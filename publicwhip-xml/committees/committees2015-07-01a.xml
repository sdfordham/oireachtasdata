    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Maguire" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070100002#H00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, estimates that the European Union is currently running a seafood trade deficit of some &euro;16 billion per annum.  In effect, the EU is importing well over 60%, if not closer to 70%, of the seafood its population is consuming.</p><p>Plainly, this is not sustainable, either from a balance of trade point of view or from the perspective of ensuring that the Union has a secure seafood supply into the future.<br/><br/>The European Commission has recognised the urgent need to increase the supply of indigenously produced seafood raw material and has concluded that this objective can only be achieved by injecting renewed vigour into the EU's somewhat stagnant aquaculture sector, particularly as the wild catch is already at its maximum sustainable yield, MSY, in the case of most of the major fisheries that fall under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Aquaculture affords coastal communities an alternative opportunity to diversify and can also alleviate fishing pressure on stocks.  As part of its efforts to stimulate increases in output from aquaculture, the European Commission has required all member states, including Ireland, to provide a multi-annual strategic aquaculture development plan as an <i>ex-ante</i>conditionality of accepting their overall seafood development operational programmes under the European maritime and fisheries fund, EMFF, funding regulation.  Those actions which member states may wish to take and fund using a mix of public and EU funding to encourage growth in their aquaculture sectors must be set out in their strategic aquaculture development plans if they are to qualify for EU co-financing under the EMFF funding regulation.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s aquaculture sector is multi-species, involving both finfish production in freshwater and seawater and shellfish production in the sea.  In 2014 it employed 1,833 persons on a full and part-time basis and the first sale value of the output was &euro;115 million.  BIM welcomes the publication, for public consultation, of the draft national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In particular, BIM welcomes the draft report&rsquo;s primary objective, which is to sustainably grow the annual production of the Irish aquaculture industry from the current level of approximately 37,000 metric tonnes per annum by a further 45,000 tonnes by 2023.  The report outlines 24 specific actions in total, which represent positive initiatives for the development, growth and sustainability of the sector.  Ireland has a favourable natural resource base for the development of aquaculture and BIM is of the view that this market-driven sector holds out significant potential for the creation of valuable coastal employment, increased export revenues and to act as a source of additional raw material supply to the seafood processing industry.  The drivers and constraints acting upon Irish aquaculture enterprises are set out in the plan, as are a range of planned actions designed to address the problems that impinge upon its expansion.<br/><br/>BIM notes with interest the new scaling guidelines for offshore salmon farms provided by the Marine Institute in the draft report.  These new guidelines may offer a route to achieving greater consensus among all marine stakeholders with regard to the planned growth of the marine salmon farming sector in Ireland.  As the State agency with the primary responsibility for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s aquaculture industry, BIM will reflect these guidelines in any future aquaculture licence application or development initiatives it is involved in, if and when the draft guidelines are adopted after the current consultation phase.<br/><br/>With regard to the long-standing application for a salmon farming licence in Galway Bay - which was submitted in 2012 by BIM with scientific support from the Marine Institute - BIM awaits the outcome of the current consultation process.  Once that is complete, it will carefully reflect on such new policies as may emerge and it will then act appropriately and in accordance with Government and ministerial policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lorc&aacute;n &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070100002#J00200"><p>I am here on behalf of the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association, IFPEA.  In that context, we welcome the publication - and the initiative behind that publication - of the draft national strategic plan the Minister has issued for consultation.  It was obligatory on the Minister to produce such a document under EU regulation but he is to be commended for it nonetheless.  Aquaculture, by its nature and in the context of both the shellfish and finfish aspects, is processing intensive.  There is a great deal of handling involved.  The industry has significant potential in the context of employment, provided it operates on a sustainable basis and with the consent of the communities in which its activities are located.  In addition, it must add to the quality of the portfolio of products already produced in and exported from Ireland.</p> <p>  That said, the IFPEA will be making a submission to the Minister and the Department in respect of the draft national strategic plan by the relevant due date.  What I am about to say probably represent a rehearsal of some of the comments we will include in our submission.  Although welcome, the draft national strategic plan is flawed in a number of very important respects and I hope the position in this regard will be corrected before it is published in its final form.  Some of the analysis it contains is barely intelligible.  I will provide some examples whereby I just could not understand what is meant, which, I am sure, has proven to be the case for others.  Despite the fact that it is a very good recital of most, if not all, the issues which need to be addressed in terms of licensing, research, coastal zone management, etc., the draft national strategic plan's central failure is that it does not contain adequate timelines or measureables in the context of what is envisaged.  This means that if it were to be implemented in its current form, it would prove to be largely aspirational in nature.  There are enough aspirational documents emanating from the State without adding this to the overall number.  I am of the view that it needs to be beefed up, with specific milestones set down in respect of the various initiatives outlined.  If, for example, a research project is to be carried out, we must know what will be the timeframe involved, how it will proceed and who will have responsibility for it.  Such considerations must be covered in a document such as that under consideration in order for it to be credible.</p> <p>  The draft national strategic plan suggests that the development of aquaculture has been stagnant.  It has not been stagnant, rather it has been regressing, and quite significantly so, for a long period.  We have halved our production of farmed salmon and reduced our production in respect of a number of other species over the years.  We are not at the races in terms of what needs to be done.  The strategy document should include further information on the key mechanisms relating to the siting of aquaculture operations - be they in respect of finfish or shellfish or even if they are located on land - and that such mechanisms must take into account competing uses, the concept of consent and consensus among communities and a clear understanding of the concept of environmental monitoring.  That in itself would provide credibility.  We are of the view that the strategy requires considerable improvement in terms of how it deals with these issues.</p> <p>  As stated, there are parts of the strategy document which I did not understand.  On page 19 it is stated, "The impact of the improved profitability has been increasing income with a less than proportionate increase in operating costs".  What does that actually mean?  It gives the impression that the industry is becoming more profitable, despite the fact that it has been shrinking in terms of scale.  On page 26, the document states, "Since 2000, there have been both increases and decreases in salmon output".  I do not think that adds greatly to our store of knowledge about the sector.  On page 38 it states,"Notwithstanding declines in salmon production output [which is superfluous in itself], the Irish salmon farming industry maintains extremely positive market trends by delivering a product that is viewed as distinct and desirable".  It is distinct and desirable but statements of this nature are far too woolly and hyperbolic to be useful.</p> <p>  We are of the view that this is a very useful process in a very contentious area.  There is a great deal that needs to be done.  Aquaculture is not automatically a good, although it is good if it works in terms of investors, exports, employment and communities.</p><p>The processing sector would be very supportive of its continued development and even of efforts to exceed some of the targets in this document, provided some of the deficiencies to which I have referred are addressed.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as an gcur i l&aacute;thair maith at&aacute; d&eacute;anta acu.  Bh&iacute; siad ag fanacht tamall fada.  Is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil s&eacute; seo mar t&uacute;s na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  This is the beginning of a process of dialogue in an area which, as Mr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide said, is contentious and can be divisive.  We saw that in Galway in recent times with the development of the salmon farming project.</p> <p>  In a global sense, I accept there is a demand for food.  The world population is increasing and there is an increased demand for aquaculture and seafood across Europe, which we are certainly not meeting at the moment.  The plan from the Commission has been to develop alternative sources of supply and aquaculture has been one of those.  I am generally a supporter of aquaculture but I would caution that we need to ensure all the most up-to-date scientific evidence, such as that carried out by the Marine Institute, is used to balance our approach, taking into account ecological concerns.  </p> <p>  The proposal by BIM is revolutionary in seeking to increase the aquaculture industry hugely over the next eight years.  According to the BIM figures, salmon farming contributed some 15,000 tonnes of aquaculture product in 2013, trout some 708, rope-grown mussels some 10,000 tonnes, bottom-grown mussels 5,500 and oysters and novel species approximately 50 tonnes.  Growing from 37,000 or 38,000 tonnes in 2013 to almost 50,000 tonnes by 2023 will be challenging.  On the one hand, it is an opportunity but my fear is that while a lot of projects, particularly salmon, are to be controlled by BIM, international investors will see this as a potential opportunity.  That may not be a bad thing but how do we balance that against local employment opportunities and opportunities for Ireland Inc.?  While development is certainly beneficial, how will we deal with the ecological constraints?</p> <p>  I spoke to some of the individuals involved in the plan in Galway and they have highlighted concerns on the part of BIM, the Department and the Marine Institute, which may not be valid in the eyes of the organisations but are concerns of the local community.  There will be further concerns as projects develop for Mayo and Donegal which are in the pipeline at the moment.  According to a 2013 report on aquaculture by the Marine Institute's Dr. David Jackson, it would appear that the State and BIM are taking a precautionary approach but the rigour with which the guidelines will be enforced in future years, depending on who is operating the plants, will be important.</p> <p>  This forum and the draft plan provide an opportunity for all the competing interests to make submissions but I agree with Mr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide on the need to be specific.  If we are going to be specific about our global plans to develop aquaculture as part of Food Harvest 2020 and Food Harvest 2025, we must be specific about how we are driving the effectiveness and efficiency of the project from the point of view of public investment.  It is important not just for the country but for the industry to be clear about how an investment of this nature will bring about value for money and opportunities for local communities.</p> <p>  I would hope that local interests would not be excluded from tendering for, or executing, these projects.  In a  public contract recently awarded by the Department of Justice and Equality for eight bundled projects, local contractors were excluded and it went to an international tender because the project was so big.  Are we going to bundle these projects or isolate the contracts for tendering?  I will accept it if the witnesses believe this question is not relevant at this stage but if we are developing aquaculture projects awarded by BIM on a design-build-operate basis, what companies or organisations are going to be big enough to carry out those enterprises?</p> <p>  I have a lot of thoughts on this area and we will be able to make submissions.  Today has been a valuable opportunity to consider the issues, although it has been short.  Other members are tied up this evening with votes in both Houses.  Nevertheless, it will feed into the overall process and I thank the witnesses for appearing before us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070100002#K00300"><p>I thank Mr. Maguire and Mr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide for their presentations.  Anything that can contribute to helping the sustainability of rural Ireland through job creation is pushing an open door as far as I am concerned.  I have concerns around certain aspects of the current proposals and over the Galway Bay project because of its size.  If the fears of scientific people and fishermen are realised, there could be a catastrophe for natural salmon.</p> <p>  We always seem to go for things that are envisaged and then pushed through with a lack of consultation.  For something to succeed in rural Ireland, one needs extensive dialogue with local communities and one also needs their buy-in.  There is a need to dispel myths, such as those relating to the finfish farm sector, and to produce a dividend for local communities.  If there is a dividend, it can go some way towards getting the buy-in of local people.</p><p>I have been told by various agencies that inland farm finfish production is extremely costly and not financially viable.  The reason for that is the enormous energy costs involved.  A bit of imagination is required.  Alternative energy could be generated which would make the endeavour cost-neutral.  Alternative energy itself would go some way towards ensuring that.  I am told there are some projects around the country that involve such development, but if BIM intends to go down that road in conjunction with other parties, a pilot project is required that can show what can be done.  It must include the use of alternative energy - either wind energy, solar energy or another energy source.  There are such advances in alternative energy that such an approach could be taken.  That would be one way of building the necessary confidence, and it would also build on the credibility of people who I believe are doing their best and have had their credibility challenged.  In many instances the challenge is based on myths and rumour.  I have listened to the debate on the Galway Bay site.  If one were to believe everything one hears, one would conclude that it was a deliberate attempt to destroy natural salmon.  On the other side, there are people who have no personal or vested interest but want to do the right thing.  There must be buy-in from communities to get it across the line.</p><p> I went to Scotland, along with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and some others, primarily to have a look at the projects in operation there.  They have the luxury of long inlets and well-sheltered bays, which takes away the fear of escape and its repercussions.  The delegation was led by the Chairman.  Such an environment includes protection from the west and the north west in particular, which is where the strong winds and gales come from.  In Scotland there is buy-in from communities as well.  Consultation was widespread.  People put myths about in Scotland as well.  One can get a scientist anywhere in the world who will say what one wants him or her to say.  The same is true of an issue such as fracking.  One can dig up an expert somewhere in the world who can substantiate one&rsquo;s argument.  That is the way a vested interest does things.  It is not for the common good.  We have to act for the common good.  That is our job.</p><p> Concerns have been expressed about sea lice, escapes and cross-contamination in the context of finfish farming, as well as the effect on the life cycle of wild salmon.  It is surprising that 60% of fish must be imported into Europe.  I assume Ireland is comparable, even though we should have a considerable export market.  As Mr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide knows from his previous work as a fisherman, which is something we have in common, lack of quota is a problem.  We started from a very weak base and there was no investment in the fleet.  We have been paying the price ever since for the consequences of political trading in terms of farming and fishing.  Disgraceful trading was done and our fishing rights were given away from the beginning of our membership of the EEC.</p><p> Mr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide said there were a number of flaws.  He referred to timetables and targets and said they were aspirational, and that a result the plan lacked credibility.  He also referred to the environmental consensus.  I share his concerns but I believe we can get this right, collectively, if we approach it with an open mind, and also by having the interest of rural Ireland primarily at heart.  Rural Ireland is a very depressing place if one loves it.  That is the best way I can describe it.  If one grew up there and one loves to live there and if one has a connection to it, it can be very depressing to see what is happening to it and what needs to be done.  In politics, unfortunately, policy is determined by numbers.  Areas with the biggest representation and the most people hold sway.  The fishing community in rural Ireland is very low down the scale of priorities for attention from the Government because it is a small constituency.  Small constituencies are really forgotten about, which is sad.  It is an indictment of the political system in this country that there is such neglect.</p><p> I would like to hear about a pilot scheme for inland finfish farming in order that people could see it working.  Vested interests and big companies in particular are only interested in profit.  They are not interested in the environment or how coastal communities would be affected.  They do not give a damn about rural Ireland.  Their main motivation is profit.  We must try to turn that around.  I believe we can do it.  I thank the witnesses for attending today.  Unfortunately, not all committee members are present, but those of us who are present take an interest in the matter.  Others who are interested unfortunately cannot be present.  It is essential that we get it right because rural Ireland could be a much better place to live in for those who come from there and live there.</p></speech>

My expertise in fishing and aquaculture is not great but I have a considerable interest in it.  I agree with my colleagues, who are all from along the western seaboard, that we should support anything we can to create jobs in the area.</p> <p>  Aquaculture appears to have huge potential to create more local jobs, according to the documentation presented to us.  We should do anything we can do in that regard.  It is worrying that salmon farming has halved in recent times, according to Mr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide.  In recent years we could have increased salmon farming.  The Galway Bay initiative is dragging on.  Some years ago we thought the project was close to being developed, and it is a pity that it has not progressed.  The question is what incentives can be given to help companies to develop aquaculture along the western seaboard or elsewhere.</p></speech>

I thank members for their questions.  Much of the concern that has been articulated, and not just at the committee, has been about buy-in and agreement with local communities.  The committee has done a number of reports, but Deputy Ferris referred in particular to the visit to Scotland.  The aim of the report in question was to develop an economic model for rural, coastal and island communities.  Aquaculture was one pillar on which the foundation could be built.  Another committee report was generated when we were in a previous guise, with a communications and natural resources remit, on oil and gas.  An important point of the report was the concept of buy-in at the earliest possible point from local communities in order that people would have a sense of ownership.  I am not sure about the new guidelines.  Is it possible for the regional inshore fisheries forums to become a partner to establish joint ventures with companies?</p><p>To be honest, they are the ones that have the wherewithal.  If they get buy-in from a type of joint venture co-operative model, that might be the best way to progress this and get real traction in terms of growth, rather than meeting resistance everywhere we go.</p><p> The other aspect is the environmental designation of many of the inlets and bays that are best suited to setting up salt-water farms.  Where stands that process?  That is one of the reasons many of the farms either no longer operate or operate on a tenuous licence.

I would hope that in the final manifestation of this document I will not be addressing those shortcomings but will be able to say that because some of those were addressed, this is now a substantial blueprint that we can use.</p> <p>  All of the concerns the Deputy mentioned can be met.  For example, on the question of confidence, there must be confidence for investors.  How do we give investors, be they local or international, certainty in terms of providing a framework for our zoning, a clear path towards licensing and a clear policy?  If we want to give communities certainty we need some examples to show them.  One of the difficulties is that there has been so little that is new for so long.  People do not have the benefit of seeing these projects done.  Perhaps we should do them on a more modest scale, see how they develop, have tight monitoring of various parameters and have those results published.  Organisations such as the Marine Institute and BIM would be on top of that.  In doing that, over time, we can build a degree of confidence.</p> <p>  In terms of incentivisation, the country needs to make a choice as to the mix of enterprise types.  Are we to have multinational companies coming in which have a pure profit motivation?  Intel does, and it is located here.  We need to have them coming into this country, and we need to set the parameters in terms of how they come in and the standards to which they operate so that this profit-at-all-costs approach cannot be allowed.  We would not be supportive of that approach.</p> <p>  The second point is about local and small-scale operators.  Many of the members I represent are small-scale operators who are already investing their own money in this business.  We could have a model that would cluster large- and small-scale operators around them.  I refer to people working together, technology transfer, mentoring and so on.  There are a number of models that we as a country should be considering which will enable this process to progress in a way that is not always confrontational and can produce the jobs and deliver.  People are cynical because there has been plan after plan year after year, but nothing has happened.  That is the worst thing we can do to people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Maguire" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015070100002#M00300"><p>To respond to some of the remarks from Deputies and Senators, from a BIM perspective, we share those aspirations entirely.  I am a west Clare man.  Ms Morrison is from the western isles of Scotland, so she knows more than anybody else the positive influences that can come from correctly practised aquaculture in communities.</p> <p>  The first point I would make is that the aquaculture industry is not just about salmon farming.  Salmon farming is a very valuable part of it, but there is a lot more to it than that.  We have a very successful oyster farming industry.  That section is doing very well, and please God it will continue that way.  We would like to see a resurgence in success, particularly in the bottom-grown mussel industry and in salmon farming.</p> <p>  The great aspect is that this is a market-driven sector.  We just cannot get a large enough supply of raw material to give to the members of Mr. &Oacute; Cinn&eacute;ide's association and to other people.  If any other sector had the same market opportunity and market pull, they would be highly envious of it.  That factor of market opportunity and the fact that it will last into the foreseeable future - because of the increases in wealth we are seeing in the Asia Pacific region, the purchasing power and the desire to buy top-class Irish seafood - exists throughout Europe and the world.  The question is whether we in Ireland want to come to terms with some of the difficulties required to exploit this opportunity.</p> <p>  Salmon farming is a very expensive business.  Multinational pockets are needed to run it successfully because it is so sophisticated, but we must consider the experience in Ireland.  The biggest seafood company in Ireland is Marine Harvest Ireland.  It is also the biggest salmon farmer.  It has been in operation for 35 years.  With the exception of the managing director, who, although he has a foreign name, grew up and went to school in Ireland, every other person in that company was born and reared in their own locality.  I accept that it has a profit motivation, but it has strong corporate and social responsibility values, and they are rooted in their particular locations.  I am sure that is the same model the members saw replicated in Scotland.  The nature of the business is that it has to be located in the community.  The employment is there, and if one can get the raw material going out to the processors, it is a win-win situation that suits everybody.  It is not like a situation in which someone can decide to take it away in the morning.  Irish salmon or Irish oysters have to be from Ireland.  If we can get over the difficulty - and many of the actions set out in the plan are designed to get over that difficulty - I have no doubt this can make a great contribution to reversing some of the trends Deputy Ferris pointed out, which are lamentable in rural Ireland.  It could help to rejuvenate fortunes in some of those areas.</p> <p>  Also, the aquaculture side of things can be put together with inshore fishing, and it could provide a powerful engine for restoring the former abundance of stocks such as lobster, as well as other inshore fishery stocks.  Done correctly, that could have a big effect.</p> <p>  With regard to shore-based aquaculture, as mentioned by Deputy Ferris, we studied that very carefully.  There are a number of recirculation aquaculture system, RAS, projects in Ireland.  Most of them are in freshwater rather than in seawater projects.  The technology for RAS seawater projects is not advanced enough to be reliable as yet.  A number of experiments have been done around the world but none of them have proved viable to this point.  We have a number of clients looking at it.  Nobody has bitten the bullet yet in terms of being prepared to invest in it, but we are very interested.  As soon as we believe it is a live prospect we will jump, so to speak.  It is probably more suited to lower-volume, higher-value species than to mass production of big volumes of something like salmon, but we have no preconception against it.  We are doing a lot of studies and are staying very much on top of it.</p> <p>  On the other point raised by Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, ironically, the environmental worries, particularly around salmon farming, have led to the point at which applications for salmon farms are so sophisticated that the science involved just to complete the application is enormous.  That makes it very difficult for local communities to be the ones bringing forward the projects.  In many ways, it has become the preserve of State agencies or large multinational, but there can be many models as to how those businesses can be developed thereafter once an application is successful and if and when a licence is brought forward.  We can accommodate both of those aspects, but it is worth saying that the degree of rigour and scrutiny to which a marine salmon farm licence is subjected in Ireland is extraordinary.  For example, it is far easier to establish a wastewater treatment plant for a town and pump sewage into the sea than it is to get a licence for a salmon farm.  The environmental impact statement, EIS, for a salmon farm is that thick in terms of size, but the EIS for a wastewater treatment plant is thicker.  There is something odd about the way we are looking at some of these aspects, and that is driven by the concerns and the politics of it.</p> <p>  Many of the comments made with regard to this plan are not particularly for BIM, because it is the Department's plan and it is out for public consultation.  We had a certain input into it.</p><p>We see that must be done to allow the full seafood operational programme to move forward.  It is a technical document as much as a public document to allow the greater seafood operational programme to move forward.</p></speech>

It is highly corrosive and it reacts very badly, as does the equipment, if one is obliged to heat it and one must control the temperature in these issues; the water chemistry is completely different.  The technology pertaining to recirculation technology in fresh water is largely driven by the Danes, who are really good at this when it comes to trout farming.  They have taken this to a fantastic level where it really is very reliable and the systems all work.  As for trying to do it with sea water, it has not yet proven feasible to do it at an economic level, although there have been some very big ambitious projects.  A number of projects are trying it at present but as yet, the jury is out.  Thus far, all who have tried it have been obliged to stop, redesign, and rebuild and none of then have proved to be sustainable from a technical or an economic point of view.  I am sure they will be; it just has not got there yet.</p></speech>

It is a bit like using a giant septic tank system, if members will pardon the indelicacy, to clean the water.  As for making such a system work in sea water, they are getting big crashes whereby the system works for a while and then stops working all of a sudden.  One then gets toxicity in the water and the fish die.  The other thing is that to make these recirculations systems work, the fish are stocked at extremely high densities.  In a salmon cage in the sea in an Irish organic salmon farm, there are 10 kg of salmon to a cubic metre of water, so that is 1% salmon and 99% water.  They must stock them at ten or 20 times this density to make these tank systems pay.  Therefore, if the system does not work perfectly, one gets a giant fish mortality really fast.  Therefore, it is quite high-risk stuff and highly technologically based and if there is any slight fault, there can be huge consequences for the farm.</p></speech>

The Chairman raised that as well.  Progress is being made in this regard although regrettably it is slow.  While this is not something on which Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, has the prime lead, we provide a lot of services to assist in that and we carry out the aquaculture profiling as part of that.  It is grinding its way, slowly but surely, around the coast and we probably will see quite a lot of progress this year.  Dungarvan Bay will have been completed, as will Clew Bay, and Lough Swilly should come through fairly quickly.  The process is in place but it is proving to be extremely complex and no sooner does the system get through than some other hurdles have arisen.  It looked, for example, as though Dungarvan Bay was ready to be licensed and then it suddenly was realised there were issues to do with archaeology and it was necessary to conduct an entire archaeological survey for national heritage to clear that hurdle.  It has proven difficult to foresee in advance what are all the hurdles and just when one thinks one has gotten there, another hurdle had come up.  At this stage, however, it is pretty well understood and it is getting there but even when the Natura 2000 issues have been resolved, there still is quite a gap between that and the determination of individual licence applications.</p></speech>

I know about the position in Dungarvan, extending back as far as Helvick Head, as people were working on it there approximately 20 years ago.  The same is true in respect of Kenmare Bay, in large parts of County Donegal and all those areas where there was mussel and oyster farming.  Communities were working on it and it appears as though communities have bought into it far more than they have in respect of the finfish farming.</p></speech>

One can operate successfully as an oyster farmer or a mussel farmer at a lower level.  That has meant there is much more community ownership and with that community ownership has come buy-in.</p> <p>  Interestingly, we carried out some studies with IFA Aquaculture recently and we conducted a big national survey asking whether people had a difference in attitude and acceptance between finfish farming and shellfish farming.  The greater population are very relaxed about either form of farming and did not perceive any real difference in acceptability between salmon farming and either mussel or oyster farming.  What we did find, which was very interesting, is that the great mass of people in Ireland have no objection whatsoever to any form of aquaculture.  They are very relaxed about it and if it creates jobs, they are for it.  They want to buy the product in the supermarket and what we really have is a small, vociferous and highly effective minority who are strongly against salmon farming because of their worries regarding its interaction with sport angling.  This, in particular, is where the issues lies.  However, the vast bulk of people are broadly positively disposed towards the sector.</p></speech>

Members note the deadline is 24 July, which means the joint committee has a few more witnesses to appear before it, which include IFA Aquaculture and, to be fair, some representatives of the environmental pillar.  All going well, the joint committee will make a submission to the Department ahead of the deadline.  The document covers multifaceted points, some of which I outlined about structures regarding how it could be rolled out or some things that could be models for developing the industry.  However, there is a lot of technical detail that must be dealt with first, as well as knowledge and awareness.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.56" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#C00200"><p>Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having me here today, and I will do my best to help the committee in its difficult task.  You have my statement and I won't read it all out but will summarise a few important aspects of crisis management and the new legislative framework.</p>  <p>  When I started on the banking side at the beginning of November 2008, the task at hand was the assessment of the size of the problem and the possible tools to handle it.  The liquidity aspects were well measured at that time and fairly stable.  The Irish economy had been contracting all that year and by the autumn of 2008, following the Lehman Brothers collapse, the property market had collapsed, with activity ceasing and prices falling.  The solvency of the Irish financial institutions depended on the performance of the economy overall and the value of the property assets against which the institutions had lent money.  Therefore, it was clear, as the property market continued to decline, that future losses on the property would be greater than had been previously expected and future profitability would be less than previously anticipated.  This meant that the capital position of the banks had to be addressed.  The PwC analysis showed clearly that there was a serious problem with land and development loans, both because of the total volume of such loans across the system and because of the small number of developers who had huge debts across the system.  The Department immediately began discussions with the bankers on the need to bolster their capital position.  The policy parameters within which the Department approached the recapitalisations throughout the period were as follows: banks should take action, where possible, to reduce the capital need by making changes to their balance sheets; assets should be sold; subordinated debt holders should be bailed in as far as possible; money should be raised on the markets, if available; the risk to the guarantee should always be considered; the systemic risk, that is, the risk of contagion, if capital were not provided, should also be considered; State support should only be considered as a last resort.</p>  <p>  The initial recapitalisations of Bank of Ireland and AIB, consisting of &euro;3.5 billion in preference shares, was agreed and implemented between December '08 and May '09, with detailed discussions on the amount and the terms and conditions in these capital injections.  AIB also agreed at that time to sell their US and Polish subsidiaries.</p>  <p>  The chairman and chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank left in December '08 and Donal O'Connor was appointed executive chairman on a temporary basis until a new CEO could be recruited.  In view of what we knew about it and had discovered, once the announcement of our intention to recapitalise the banks was made on 21 December '08, we prioritised legal due diligence of Anglo.  Arthur Cox carried out the due diligence and their first report was with us on 15 January '09.  The options which we had at that point were to continue with the original recapitalisation, either by preference shares or ordinary shares, to nationalise or to try and disengage.  The latter was not realistic in view of the guarantee, the expectation that European governments would stand behind their banks and the extreme likely contagion effect across the Irish system.  In the event, it was decided to nationalise and replace the board and management.</p>  <p>  The problem of land and development loans was dealt with, following a study by Peter Bacon, by setting up NAMA.  An asset management agency was necessary because this loan book was so big and dysfunctional that it would have been very difficult for the banks to deal with these loans while continuing to provide banking services to the rest of the economy.  NAMA has proved efficient in dealing with these loans.  However, the slow, detailed method of valuing them individually and moving them over in tranches, which was developed to meet the requirements of the European competition ... European Commission, the competition directorate, increased the pressure on Irish banks and on the Irish State throughout 2010.  The effect of this should not be exaggerated.  The size of the losses was the major issue and overvaluing NAMA loans in 2010 would have resulted in losses materialising for the State later.  Nonetheless, the transfer of loans based on discounted ... a discount calculated on a broadly stratified sample of loans for each bank would have been a better methodology and would probably have left ... given us the same result.</p>  <p>  Another major issue was the haircuts for loans was significantly higher than we had estimated.  This was mainly because of lack of equity in the developments.  In addition to this, the continued recession meant that other loans, including both mortgages and loans to SMEs, were registering an increase in arrears.  The first PCAR stress test run in March 2010 by the Financial Regulator found that the banks had very significant capital needs.  Bank of Ireland met this need through a combination of raising capital on the market and a conversion of &euro;1.7 billion of their Government preference shares.  AIB sold their overseas assets, with the balance of capital - &euro;3.7 billion - being provided by the Government.</p>  <p>  Following our entry into the EU-IMF programme, the second PCAR stress test in March 2011 resulted in further capital demands for the banks.  </p>  <p>         Once again, Bank of lreland was able to raise money from the private sector, but the other banks, AlB, PTSB, EBS relied mainly on the State. </p> <p> Given how much the State had to invest in the banking system, the policy throughout the period was to burden-share where appropriate.  All of the original shareholders in the covered institutions saw their share value diluted to nothing, or almost nothing.  At peak in 2007, the total share value of the institutions was &euro;53.7 billion.  In addition, &euro;15.5 billion capital was raised through burden-sharing with subordinated debt holders.  Much of this was done through liability management exercises where debt holders were asked to voluntarily sell their debt back to the banks at a reduced price.  We also passed legislation to allow the Minister get a special liability order, SLO, from the courts to change the terms of the bonds.  This forced the bondholders to sell into the liability management exercise, or have their bonds extended for a long period and interest suspended.  The SLO was only used in AlB, but, undoubtedly, the existence of the legislation contributed to the success in burden-sharing with the sub debt holders in the other institutions.</p> <p> The question of extending burden sharing to senior bondholders was considered seriously twice that I remember - first, in October and November 2010 when the guarantee had lapsed and the programme of assistance was being put in place.  A number of lMF officials were strongly in favour of burning any unguaranteed and unsecured bonds in Anglo.  This was opposed by the EU and ECB officials.  In the event, the matter was considered at a more senior level in the IMF and, as a result of a US Treasury veto, the IMF also came down against any such action.  It would not have been possible for the lrish Government to act without troika consent.  The question was considered again in March 2011, but it was ruled out this time, as I understand, by the ECB.</p> <p> The financial crisis ... to look at the regulatory supervision and government issues.  The financial crisis lead to a reassessment of the legislative framework for the financial services, both domestically and internationally.  I will give a brief summary of the changes made.  I will divide my comments into domestic and EU, though obviously the two programmes were developed in tandem and the Department worked to ensure they were consistent to the greatest extent possible. </p> <p> On the domestic side, the first action was to amalgamate the Central Bank with the lrish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Separating the supervisory and financial stability functions, albeit with a requirement to cooperate, had undermined the importance of the macro prudential aspects of the role of both organisations.  The amalgamation was effected through the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  This was followed by an extensive renewal of the supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank through the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.  This latter legislation streamlined, enhanced and modernised the powers of the Central Bank.  Again, while this was a necessary and welcome improvement in the legislative framework, the Central Bank had significant powers before it was enacted and, indeed, used them extensively in the crisis management period, 2008 to 2013, prior to the new legislation.</p> <p> The third major strand of legislation was providing for resolution powers.  This was done initially through the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, which gave extensive temporary resolution powers to the Minister for Finance to deal with the six covered institutions, as necessary, during the crisis.  Subsequently, the Central Bank and Credit institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 was passed.  This provides for the orderly resolution of a financial institution in financial difficulties.  The Central Bank is the resolution authority.</p> <p> A final major piece of domestic legislation in the Credit Reporting Act 2013.  This is to enable credit institutions check what loans potential borrowers have from other institutions and organisations.  This should prevent a reoccurrence of a situation where a small number of people can have large loans from many different institutions and pose a systemic risk.  The credit register is currently being set up by the Central Bank.</p> <p> On the EU front, the crisis lead to significant changes to the international regulatory framework also.  The 2009 de Larosi&eacute;re report recommended the establishment of a new European systemic risk board and three new supervisory authorities, the European Banking Authority, the European lnsurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, and the European Securities and Markets Authorities.  These bodies set technical standards, resolve disputes between supervisors and assist in developing consistent interpretation of European law.  Major legislative directives were also put in place for all the financial services areas, including the capital requirements directive, CRD lV dealing with bank capital, solvency ll dealing with insurance, and MIFID ll dealing with markets.  This was followed by the banking union proposal which centralised banking supervision and resolution for euro area countries, with a possible opt-in for non-euro countries.  The Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, was set up as a new branch of the ECB with responsibility for supervising the top 130 banks in Europe.  The bank restructuring and resolution directive, BRRD, was also agreed to provide for a single resolution mechanism to resolve financial institutions in difficulties.  </p>  <p>         All of these changes represent a major reconfiguration of the regulatory and supervisory framework.  Many of them have only just been implemented and some are not yet operational.  It will be some time before their effectiveness can be assessed.</p> <p> And I'll stop at that, Chairman, and allow you ask your questions.</p></speech>

Deputy, you've 25 minutes.</p></speech>

Ms Nolan, the banking and financial services division at the Department of Finance have, as a principal directive, it's on your website, and I'll just quote: "On the one hand, to contribute to the maintenance of financial and economic stability and identify and manage potential risks to that stability...".  And then, on the other hand, a little bit later, "...to continue the development of Ireland as a centre for international financial services".  As you well know, in the 2003 Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act, responsibility was given to the Central Bank and the regulator in the Act "to promote the development within the State of the financial services industry".  And that was removed, then, in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. </p>  <p>  Can I ask you if continuing to give this mandate to the Department of Finance to develop the financial services industry on the one hand, and then to have ... identify and manage potential risks, can this impact on making appropriate decisions regarding policy and legislation in regard to the regulation of the financial sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.61" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#E00400"><p>It is a function of government to develop the economy and a major priority of the current Government and, I think, of previous Governments is employment development, and there are in the funds industry alone, 35,000 people working in the funds industry in Ireland.  So, you know, it is a major source of jobs for Ireland and a major and important area.  However, for us to develop that, we need a strong regulatory system.  I don't see the two as being in contradiction.  I think if our regulatory system isn't robust, then that industry isn't secure, and the jobs in that industry is not secure.  So, although I think for the regulator to have a job of promotion is inappropriate, I don't think it's inappropriate for the Department of Finance to have that job, and I don't think it influences our regulatory decisions because I think for us, we would see as a major policy issue to have a robust regulatory system, and that that robust regulatory system is necessary to develop the international financial services industry.  I don't think they can develop against a background of light regulation in the modern world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.62" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#E00500"><p>Yes.  With respect, Ms Nolan, the paper, Regulating Better, from the Department of the Taoiseach in January 2004 made exactly those points, that regulation was to develop in a responsible way the sector.  But we know what happened in the meantime with the bubble and the disastrous crash.  Now, several witnesses in front of this inquiry have suggested that giving the Central Bank and the regulator at that time the mandate to regulate and control at the same time as promoting the industry gave rise to a conflict.  And the Governor of the Central Bank listed it as one of the difficulties that arose with tougher regulation and allowing so-called light-touch regulation.  What's different now, one would have to ask?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#E00600"><p>Well, what's a major difference is the Central Bank no longer has that requirement.  I mean, I think you have to differentiate significantly in the role of the Department and the role of the Central Bank.  The role of the Central Bank is to regulate, and it is absolutely not the role of the Central Bank to promote the development of the industry.  We provide the legislative framework for that regulation, and the legislative framework is separate, even within the Department, to the promotion of the IFSC, which is in a different section of the Department.  But all Departments have the economic development of the country as part of their mandate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#F00100"><p>Yes.  I'm just trying to explore whether this is a conflict that still can have detrimental effects because it was suggested by witnesses that one reason for so-called light-touch regulation was that there was a reluctance to be tough on Irish banks, for example, in relation to the extent of property lending, over-lending, etc., because that would make then the Irish Financial Services Centre and the foreign banks that were there look like an offshore account.  Isn't there still that contradiction there then?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#F00200"><p>Absolutely not, in the sense that first of all, the Central Bank no longer has that requirement but far more importantly, the regulation across Europe for all financial services has become far more strict and far more uniform, so the regulatory system to which the IFSC organisations are now subject is not lighter than the regulatory system in other countries.  It is not a light-touch regulatory system and nor should it be.  It is subject to the EU directives which are implemented in Ireland by the Irish Central Bank but implemented in other countries by their central banks.</p></speech>

Then it goes on to say, "Through its work with governmental and industry committees and working groups, Irish Funds contributes to and influences the development of Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory and legislative framework."  Is that worrying, that a powerful lobby can say, in effect, on one reading, that they are writing the regulation for their own industry?</p></speech>

I mean, I'm not responsible for what they say.  They are free ... they're ... if you want to find out what they say you'll have to ask them, I can't answer for that but they most certainly are not writing their own regulation.  The regulations for the fund industry are almost entirely EU regulations and are developed by the European Commission in conjunction with the European Parliament.  We would consult with the funds industry as we would consult with any other group on those regulations as how they would affect them ... interest group.  Most of our consultations nowadays are done on the web in ... by means of public consultations.  But they do not write the legislation, it just simply isn't true.</p></speech>

Why that was not taken the night of the guarantee rather than a few months later and what advice the Government received at the time in this regard?  And if you could comment if, in your opinion, nationalising Anglo earlier would have sped up a resolution of the crisis?</p></speech>

I was working on the emergency budget which, if you remember happened on 15 October and was working all that weekend all right but it was on a different topic.  So I wouldn't be aware as to what ... why decisions were taken in that.  I know Kevin Cardiff has already spoken on this and is in a far better place, and probably William Beausang as well, to give you commentary on that.  On whether it would have made any difference, I honestly do not believe it would have made any difference but I can't prove that.  You can only run life one way and you only get to see it once but I personally don't believe it would have made any difference on the speeding up of resolution.</p></speech>

I refer to core documents Department of Finance Vol. 2, pages 116 and 119, but I'll quote, it's not necessary to follow it.  </p>  <p>               This is the advice from Merrill Lynch to the National Treasury Management Agency and the Department on 28 September, which is one day before the guarantee.  And it is obviously in favour of what it calls "state protective custody" of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS, and it says on paragraph (b) there, page 116, "This could occur over a very short period of time ... within days, but the point at which it occurs it will not be of surprise to debt or equity investors as knowledge of the institution's financial position will be obvious and they should expect such intervention in the absence of a private-sector solution."  And then, on page 119, under "Guarantee for six Primary Regulated Banks", it says, "This would almost certainly negatively impact the State's sovereign credit rating, and raise issues as to its credibility."  That was the advice of the, one of these groups that the Government retained quite a bit.  Does it surprise you, in view of that and in view of the fact that their prognosis about the sovereign being affected came true very strongly, that the comprehensive guarantee was still given - and, again, to reflect on the effect of that - as opposed to nationalising Anglo and INBS on the night?</p></speech>

So, the suggestion which seems to be in this document, that merely nationalising would stop all the outflow of funds from the system, our experience ... subsequent experience was not that that was the effect of nationalisation.  So, you know, apart from that, that's really all I can say-----</p></speech>

Just to move on to a different but related area, then, Ms. Nolan, on page 5 of your statement, yes, you said, "There was a great reluctance at European level...".  We have moved forward to the October-November period of 2010, and approaching the crunch period and the so-called bailout, and you said, "There was a great reluctance at European level to allow the burning of senior bondholders."  And that has featured here, but what is your understanding, why was there such reluctance, where did it come from and how was it conveyed to your Department?</p></speech>

It may also have been conveyed to the Minister separately, at Eurogroup meetings and so on.  The reluctance was because of the contagion effect.  They were very concerned that it would encourage or create difficulties in other states, for example, Portugal, Spain, Italy, where it might be seen that they were likely to burn bondholders less, and that you could create a run across Europe from the peripheral states into the centre ... in bondholders.</p></speech>

There was the discussions on the imminent bailout, EU-IMF programme, and I think Kevin Cardiff, in his long statement, probably far better than I remember, gives details of the various meetings that occurred, so I would have taken part in some of those meetings.  But also, my colleague at the time who was in charge, our EFC member, would have been going to very frequent EFC meetings ... meeting his European counterparts at the European working group and so on.

Who was in Korea, pretending to announce that the Irish Government had decided to seek a bailout?  Who, in Korea or elsewhere, [and that's in relation to a G7 meeting, I think, that was happening] was taking these false rumours and putting them into the hands of press and financial commentators?</blockquote>  <p>Can you throw any further light on this?</p></speech>

Now, just then on ... in relation to the veto on burning bondholders, can I ask you, Ms Nolan, it's core document Ann Nolan, Vol. 2 and it's page 19.  This is a letter from Mr. John Corrigan, the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, to Brian Lenihan, TD, Minister for Finance, dated 28 November 2010.  And in the second paragraph, Mr. Corrigan writes:</p><blockquote>I learnt during the course of the discussion [and that was a discussion at a meeting of the Government the night before which he attended] that the external authorities and the European Central Bank (at board or equivalent level) had taken the view that burden sharing with unguaranteed bank senior bondholders was &quot;not on the table&quot;.  It is unfortunate that, notwithstanding the fast moving pace of recent events, I was not made aware of this outcome.</blockquote>  <p>Ms Nolan, is that an extraordinary revelation that the NTMA was again outside the loop which seemed to have happened the night of the bank guarantee as well?</p></speech>

The NTMA weren't outside the loop; they were at many of the meetings we were at.  In that period 27-28 November, we had meetings night and day, I mean, literally 'til two, three in the morning.  The NTMA were at some meetings.  There were at some times five or six.  I remember one of the Saturday nights there were five or six different meetings taking place at a technical level throughout the building.  It was very unfortunate that John was not made aware of that but I rather think it was entirely accidental that people believed he had been told and that he wasn't told, rather than that anyone decided not to tell him.</p></speech>

I mean, I think the issue ... the NTMA and ourselves were <i>ad idem </i>to what we wanted, which would have been the burning of the bondholders and the question was that the European Central Bank that ... had taken a very strong line.

Now, at one stage Bank of Ireland told you that it needed &euro;2 billion.  It finished up getting multiples of that.  Allied Irish Bank said it didn't need as much support as both Anglo and Bank of Ireland and it finished up getting &euro;21 billion.  Were the banks straight with the Department or were they covering up or were they even lying some of them?</p></speech>

I ... it's not a question of whether they were lying or not.  First of all, the question is whether they knew themselves what their position was at the time.  There is a question of what their position was at one point in time and the fact that the things deteriorated.  I mean the drop in GDP in Ireland in 2009 was phenomenal.  I don't think anyone at the end of 2008, which is the point where this is taking part, had any idea the extent to which the recession would be so deep as it was, particularly in 2009-2010.  So, therefore, I think the capital needs grew over that period and so even if they were right in 2008 as to what they needed at that point, that point was not even allowing for what was envisaged as so-called stress tests wasn't sufficient when the actual stress was so much bigger than they were testing for.  So I don't think there was a question of they told ... you know, in 2008 if somebody had walked into this committee and said, ''By the way, AIB need &euro;20 billion'', everyone would just simply have said, ''You're mad; you can't possibly think AIB needs &euro;20 billion'", you know, because there was no ... there was no facts on which to base such an idea.  So I don't think it's a question that they lied, that they knew they needed the &euro;20 billion and lied to us.  I think it's a question that they didn't think they needed and, at that time, they didn't really need it.  It was later they needed it.</p></speech>

Irish Nationwide, I think, is a slightly different case.  I think, Irish Nationwide, there was greater evidence that they were in difficulty.  But ironically, it took longer for it to manifest, partly because their deposit base was more sound and, therefore, they weren't as hit by the market walking away from them as some of the other banks.</p></speech>

Irish Government formally notified the European Commission that they would be recapitalising Anglo to ... on 15 January, just over a week later, when you announced ... when the Government announced they would be nationalising Anglo instead.  What led to the change of decision and what other options were considered and what advice was advised the Minister and the Government in this regard?  So it's that critical week between 8 January 2009 and 15 January 2009, where you went from recapitalising Anglo to the tune of &euro;1.5 billion to nationalising Anglo.</p></speech>

On the 21st we announced that ... we had previously announced that there was capital available, on the 21st we announced that it would be divvied up by, I think at that time, &euro;2 billion each for Bank of Ireland and AIB and &euro;1.5 billion for Anglo - any that were most in need of the capital ... of the three of them ... most immediate need.  We had deep concerns about recapitalising Anglo without nationalising it, simply because of the issues that had led to the chairman's resigning.  So we prioritised the due diligence of Anglo.  We sent Arthur Cox in to do a legal due diligence to see were there any other issues which might have to be dealt with.</p></speech>

So it was like we had two work streams, one looking at nationalisation, one looking at recapitalising.  The recapitalising notion ... this paper that you ... on page 37 was on the work stream that was looking at the recapitalisation because we had to have that ready.  Otherwise, you would be presenting the Government, when the due diligence came back, with a false choice.</p></speech>

The reality is we did look, you know, the crisis was ongoing and we couldn't allow the ... we couldn't give ourselves the luxury of taking six months to look at every single loan because the banks might have collapsed in that time, which would have left every small business in Ireland without a proper banking system.  So the first recapitalisation was done on the basis of relatively little due diligence in that sense, relative to whatever happened afterwards.  But also, the position kept getting worse so even if we had looked at everything, a lot of the loans were perfectly okay at the beginning of 2009, they were very bad by 2010 or 2011.  Things got worse over the period.</p></speech>

In hindsight, it is easy say things could have been done differently but it wasn't possible at the time.  I think, you know, the Central Bank itself had in 2008, the end of 2008, told me all the banks were solvent but, in reality, I don't think they had that much detailed knowledge of what was going on in the banks or, indeed, all the expertise they needed to do that.  Throughout 2009, they revamped their system as well.  By 2010, they were capable of doing a proper PCAR.  I don't think they could have done the same PCAR in 2009.  I don't think they had the expertise.  So I think there is an element of that in what happened.</p></speech>

Can I ask, the issue in terms of the ... the discussions around, we'll say, with burden-sharing with the ECB and so forth, and I want to draw attention, Chairman, to Vol. 2, page 49, which is effectively a report that was commissioned by ... completed by the National Treasury Management Agency in March 2011, basically on burden-sharing for senior and subordinated.  Now, in that report, they stated, "[D]epending on the eventual level of haircut applied to the senior unsecured guaranteed debt (senior debt) and subordinated debt, could give rise to a capital saving to the State of approximately &euro;14.9 billion."  So, I suppose the question I want to ask is can you tell me the various ... this was March 2011, the various discussions that would have taken place with the IMF, the European Commission over the period since '08 as to where this issue would have come up?  Do you believe that if the US had not issued ... exercised their veto within the IMF in late 2010, do you believe that burden-sharing in terms of senior bondholders and subordinated debt holders would have arisen at that time?</p></speech>

I mean, I suppose the problem with the banking system is that it needed to downsize very significantly and that downsizing, no matter what you do, takes time.  If you look at the trajectory, you know, it was &euro;400 million loans outstanding in '08 across the six institutions; and, 2010, there was &euro;280 billion loans outstanding; and now it's down to, oh, about &euro;172 billion and we're now at a loan-to-deposit ratio of about 112%.  So we're probably around a sustainable level now across the three banks that are left.  But that downsizing, could it have been done quicker?  It might have cost the State a lot more if we did it quicker is the real problem because there's always a trade-off.  If you sell everything very quickly, you get a less good price, so, you know, it isn't a given that doing it quicker would have things better.  It might have made things worse.</p></speech>

I suppose the two ... the major things that were involved there was I was involved in the assigning of licences to IFSC companies which ... the last number of licences were done by competition, so I ran the competitions for companies that wished to get licences in the last two or three rounds of licences for the IFSC.  And the other major piece of work I did in there was to integrate the tax system between the IFSC and the non-IFSC tax system because the IFSC had had a 10% rate, it was moving up to a 12.5% rate, and the rest of the tax system was moving down to a 12.5% rate, but there were a number of other aspects where the IFSC ... of the taxation where the IFSC was treated differently to the parts that were outside, so my role was to develop plans to integrate those two.</p></speech>

You said in response to Deputy O'Donnell just a moment ago that the overall net cost of the banking crisis will effectively be the money put into Anglo Irish Bank.  Can I just ask you your view on some of the work that was done in Project Atlas by PwC?  I mean, for example, in February 2009, they produced a summary report of three previous reports that they had conducted into Anglo Irish Bank and they projected what the capital position of the bank would be on the various loss scenarios and they reached a conclusion, for example: "Under the PwC highest stress scenario, Anglo's core equity and tier 1 ratios are projected to exceed regulatory minima, (Tier 1 - 4%) at [end of] September 2010 after taking account of operating profits and stressed impairments."  Now, when it actually came to September 2010, the losses in Anglo were almost &euro;30 billion, so how can you rationalise that conclusion in early 2009 with the outcome of a loss and a bill for the taxpayer of almost &euro;30 billion in September 2010?</p></speech>

I think there were two aspects where they were wrong in ... not necessarily that they should have been right but, in retrospect.  The first one was the issue we've dealt with earlier, the question of whether there was any equity at all in the loans and I think, if you were to ask me, Bank of Ireland did have equity, AIB had some and Anglo, as far as I could see, just topped up all the loans to 100%, or were lending to the borrowers in a different hat ... with a different hat on, so the loans effectively had almost no equity.</p>  <p>  The second aspect, I think, where there's the biggest difference between the original PwC work and what actually happened is the assumption that the bank had a model that would continue to generate income.  And the other banks, and the living banks, and the reason they're still living banks, had other business where they were generating income, whereas Anglo, this was all they did.  Their model was broken and, therefore, there was no income to compensate, or to make up extra ... and no prospect of income to make up extra capital.  </p>  <p>               But looking back now, how would you characterise that report which, you know, essentially formed the basis of------</p></speech>

I suppose there are two aspects to that question, Deputy.  Obviously the question is could PwC have known better, and I'm not sure whether they could or not.  Obviously it was wrong, and I remember at the time, if you look at the ... the first time I saw those reports, summary report, I think it was a bit earlier than the beginning of 2009, some time in 2008, so it was the banks' own projections and the PwC's projections which were stress 1, stress 2, and I remember looking and thinking, "Wouldn't it be wonderful if what happens is the banks' own projections?"  Because you don't know the future at any given time, but thinking not very realistic.  And then thinking that actually there was a real chance that things were worse than the PwC stress 2 because the economy, you know, with the other side of our hat we were looking at the economy, looking at having done a budget in October, which I was involved in, October 2008, which was out of date already by January '09.  So you, kind of, looked at that and thought, you know, "It might be worse than they're saying."</p></speech>

What other options were being considered at that time, because we know the management of the bank, for example, were putting forward an alternative model which would have seen a surviving bank emerge, as such, from the carcass of Anglo, so what options were the Government considering in the autumn of 2010 for the future of Anglo?</p></speech>

The new management team had tried to get a business plan for an ongoing bank which would work, and we looked at those, I think in August 2010, as best I remember it, in conjunction with the Central Bank.  In the meantime, their funding model was, you know, they were just ELA almost entirely, and as every piece of their funding rolled off it was replaced by ELA, so they had a huge funding problem.  And the new bank just wasn't to my mind - that they were proposing - wasn't to my mind - and we did look at it seriously, but it wasn't actually fund-able in terms of ... it didn't have a business plan that you could convince the ECB or the markets was a funding model going forward.  So, that option was looked at and decided against.  The twin-track approach was on the basis that we were under the impression, which turned out to be a misapprehension, that the ECB was willing to fund the funding bank, so-----</p></speech>

So there were ... it wasn't just the guarantee itself, there was other things which contributed to that, but certainly that was a factor.  It was a factor in the ELA being as big as the Deputy just pointed out.</p></speech>

When Mr. Trichet was, as I say, at the IIEA event in which the inquiry engaged with him, speaking on the same issue, he says:</p><blockquote>[As] you know, we could [have almost] continued on our side ... having gone up to 100% of ... GDP ... to 200% of ... GDP [this was with regard to the ELA funding that was coming into the country], and why not 300% of ... GDP?  [That would] Then what would ... the commission [of] inquiry [be] asking for?  [Talking about this inquiry, as to what would be our purpose]  You would say, &quot;Were you totally crazy at the ECB to continue, when you were going to the wall at 100 mph, to continue to provide liquidity and liquidity and liquidity?&quot;</blockquote>  <p>So could I ask you, Ms Nolan, was Mr. Trichet right?

Can I just come back to an earlier ... it was relating to Deputy O'Donnell, and that is on the issue of Anglo, and Deputy O'Donnell was taking a line of questioning with regard to the whole due diligence issue.

I mean, the legislation was ready, I think, and could be made ready very quickly in terms of ... that was ready, I think, at the time of the guarantee, in that nationalisation, and that legislation was ready to go.  Part of the due diligence we did in Anglo before we nationalised it was looking at all the bond agreements to make sure there were no clauses ... there were some of the clauses that had to be bought out just before the nationalisation, you know, in terms of swaps and these kind of things, technical stuff, and that ... you know, you need to do that stuff before you nationalise, and we did do it before we nationalised.</p></speech>

It's from ... it's witness book Ann Nolan, Vol. 2, pages 85-87.  Okay.  Now, if I can just scroll down this a moment, and while it's being done, maybe to a page ... it's the third page of it, it's the last footnotes of it here.  But in doing so, as I'm pulling that up, by March 2012, it was becoming clear within the Department of Finance that a longer term restructuring solution was needed to the promissory notes which had been provided to IBRC.  The paper was produced in October 2012 for the EMC.  This proposed replacement of promissory notes with longer terms bonds over maybe a 30 to 40-year spread, however the view was that this would require liquidation of IBRC to allow this to be acceptable to the ECB.  Now, what I'm trying to do here is to get an understanding as to who was responsible for the strategic planning of the balance sheet impact of the banking crisis and also to establish with you the level of assistance and co-operation the Department of Finance received from the European Central Bank and Central Bank of Ireland during the crisis plan and implementation of putting in a solution.  So, in this regard, who originated this idea and what level of co-operation was evident from the Central Bank of Ireland and the ECB to investigate, discuss and cost alternatives and can you also describe the interaction and level of co-operation between the Central Bank of Ireland, the EMC and the European Central Bank and your Department to work through this proposal?</p></speech>

This proposal ... I suppose, it goes back to what we were talking about earlier about moving all the deposits out of Anglo and INBS and then the following summer we amalgamated the two of them.  Now, we then had, effectively, a run-off vehicle with very big European funding which was rolling on a two-week basis, which was very unsatisfactory.  At the time of the guarantee ... at the time of the bailout, which would have been November 2010, there was some discussion about how the long-term funding of Anglo ... but no conclusion was reached at that time.  So we had various options after we had amalgamated the two of them in summer of 2011.  Various options were discussed, many of which didn't make very much sense but, from our own point of view, those discussions with the troika were very important because we knew we needed to get some resolution which would give long-term, not two-week funding, that we couldn't have a vehicle there ... you know, effectively for us, a priority was fixing it up or having a long-term solution before we left the programme.  While you were in the programme, you had a kind of certain protection from the markets but you wouldn't have that when you left the programme so it was quite important to look at that.  So it was, I think ... I genuinely do not remember who first suggested it, but I think it was at some meetings at the very beginning of September 2011, no, 2012, when the liquidation of Anglo was first discussed and suddenly it became possible because, because it's kind of almost legal theology that the ECB had, this was a more attractive solution to them than the other solutions we'd been putting forward.  And it was ... had huge attractions to us as well, in that it would, effectively, remove Anglo or IBRC from the landscape, which was causing so much trouble for everyone.  So we entered into discussions fairly intensively starting at the very beginning of September 2012, ourselves, the Central Bank and the ECB.</p></speech>

Total ELA funding at the end of September ... (as advised by [the Central Bank]: &euro;40.6 billion.

We needed to make sure the Central Bank was whole, because you couldn't leave the Central Bank with a deficit in it.  We'd only have to make that up ourselves.  We needed to make sure that the ELA was gone out of the system because that was the objective of the ECB in getting involved in this.  We needed to make sure that the promissory note payments were put on a much better position ... a better schedule for the Irish Government so that when we were going back into the market, we wouldn't have this huge borrowing requirement for the promissory note, which would damage our capacity to do business in the market.  So they were our ... you know, the solution we got met most of those objectives.</p></speech>

And just moving on to point 9, and this will be my final question on this issue, it says, "If [the fair value of NAMA pays for the assets sorry, if] the fair value that NAMA pays for the assets is at a significant discount to the net value of to the assets at IBRC [this is the relationship now of NAMA and the loan book of what was formerly the Anglo Irish Bank], this may create a capital shortfall for the [Central Bank of Ireland] arising from the sale, [from] which the State would ultimately be liable as a result of the Ministerial guarantee."  Can you explain to us what that actually means there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.361" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#Q00500"><p>Okay ... well, when we liquidated we didn't know we could sell all the assets.  So, if the assets sold or ... the assets would be transferred to NAMA ... What happened was, the flow ... the Central Bank had a floating charge on the assets; the floating charge was sold to NAMA in return for NAMA bonds, so then the Central Bank had NAMA bonds.  So the Central Bank was okay from day one, it had NAMA bonds and they were Government-guaranteed NAMA bonds.  The floating charge then went to NAMA.  All the assets were then valued, the valuation, the NAMA valuation set a floor.  They couldn't be sold for less than that.  If the sales process had bids for less than that, they go to NAMA at the NAMA valuation.  In the event they were all sold for more than the NAMA valuation so it never arose.  But in the ... had it been that the NAMA valuation added together for all the assets and none of them had sold to the private sector and the NAMA valuation was less than the floating note charge, we could have been left with a ... with a bill, and that's what that is referring to.  But that did not happen.</p></speech>

So just to come back to maybe to summarise my very, very first question to you, all of these details very, very big numbers, very big sums, very difficult detailed, complexed issues to be unravelled to try and create another type of solution or another type of approach.  Who originated the idea, and if you could maybe summarise again as to what level of co-operation was evident coming from the Central Bank and the European Central Bank to discuss and cost these alternatives?</p></speech>

We seconded ... corporate bankers from AIB, who weren't very busy at the time ... a team of corporate bankers into the Department, and had them working directly on my team there, to look at all of these very complex details.  And they did the planning for us in co-operation with the Central Bank of Ireland who co-operated very strongly and in negotiation ... technically, the ECB weren't negotiating with us; technically, this was a deal between us and the Central Bank of Ireland, but, of course, there were technical discussions between my team and the ECB on several occasions.  The ECB, I think, blew hot and cold on it.  There were people within the ECB who felt it was a good deal and should be done; there were people within the ECB who felt it was, you know, not such a good deal and maybe shouldn't be done.  But the ones who wanted to do it were the ones whose view prevailed in the end, thank God.</p></speech>

I ... you know, in some ways it made no difference because he was pre-empting the Government's decision.  I think it probably was unhelpful to the Government but I don't think it really changed anything.  It was probably unhelpful to our negotiation position, which was probably our immediate reaction, if I was being really honest about it, because for us at that point, down in the trenches, we were more interested in the small print of what was being agreed.  You know, what are we committing to, is it things we don't want to take off it?  You didn't want someone coming along pre-empting that.  But, even in that, I'm not sure if it really made any difference.  It's more an emotional reaction when you're very involved.</p></speech>

How early on did you believe Ireland would need a bailout?  Because Patrick Honohan suggested he had a conversation - albeit a small conversation - with Minister Lenihan in April of that year, suggesting that there might be.  Did you have a view yourself?</p></speech>

I mean, I would've been aware that somebody had mentioned it and ... probably by May anyway, that year.  And I don't think I remember having a conversation with Patrick about it particularly.  I think we were looking at how it could or couldn't be avoided and whether it should or shouldn't be avoided because there's two aspects to that.  At a certain point of stress, you might be better off in a programme, you know, provided you could control what the programme was forcing you to do.  In other words ... and certainly by that August we were working in the Department very much on the national recovery plan, the four-year plan, because we wanted to make sure that if we entered into negotiations, that we had a version up front, ourselves, of what we wanted out of them.  In other words, that we weren't in a position where the IMF was coming in and making it up <i>ab initio</i>.</p></speech>

I think it was ... it was beforehand and I genuinely can't remember when the meetings were.

And we also ...  you know, what we were looking at is were there other places where you could get cash.  But we were never ... in the event we had the bailout agreed before we were in a position where we were actually looking for cash in any desperate way.  And I think, in retrospect, that was right.  We should have ...  it's much better to negotiate from a position where you're not desperate.</p></speech>

I think Bank of Ireland were the most realistic.  I mean, I think very early on they told us that even if, technically, they could do a projection that showed they wouldn't need capital, they felt for the markets to really have faith in them, they needed probably &euro;2 billion extra capital.  And AIB told us they were the alpha male that didn't need any capital.  And ... sorry that's a bad expression ... they were, you know, well able to cope.  And Anglo told us that the private sector would give them capital.  The first time I met them I was stunned at the amount of capital the private sector was going to put into them.  But, of course, it never materialised.  I mean, you knew it was-----</p></speech>

I was just going to turn to the Bank of Ireland question because we have minutes - and I've referred to them in evidence - from Mr. Cardiff from 13 and 17 October 2008, where they were discussing at board level that ... the need for a taxpayer injection - actually, not just a recapitalisation but a taxpayer funded one - and on 17 October, one of their minutes said "it would be inappropriate to push the Government at [this] time, as the Exchequer budget was due to be announced the following day."  Would you have been aware, and when did you become aware - because I think you indicated that you were - that, internally, Bank of Ireland were acknowledging the need for taxpayer capital?</p></speech>

I now want to turn actually briefly to Mr. Moran.  Mr. John Moran, the previous Secretary General we've had in giving evidence already.  He in many respects was one of the first outsiders, maybe the first one, to become Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  How would you define his period as Secretary General?

And John, in his unique, inimitable way, contributed very positively to that change but it had started before he arrived - the Wright report, it indicated quite a lot of changes - and has continued after he's left, but he certainly brought some very positive things to that and contributed very positively to that.</p></speech>

It was still largely an agricultural bank, lending to farmers.  It was doing a small bit of property lending.  I didn't like the structures of the property lending but I was told I was a conservative civil servant.  In retrospect, maybe I should have brought my conservatism to all of the other banks as well.  I wasn't keen on it but it was a small portion; it wasn't a huge risk at the time because it was a relatively small proportion of their book, so it was different.</p></speech>

And you go on to say that the long-term losses essentially arise from INBS and Anglo.  Can I query and interrogate that somewhat with you for a minute or two?  In regard to Allied Irish Banks, the general figure that is put out there is that &euro;21 billion of State funds went in.  I would say that has to be added to by the following: NAMA witnesses said to the inquiry that the banks were overpaid for loans transferred to NAMA from them by &euro;10 billion.  That was the evidence from NAMA chief executive and chair.  If we allocate the Allied Irish Bank proportion of that, it would be &euro;2.8 billion, so I say if you add that to the &euro;21 billion, you get &euro;23.8 billion.  the merger with the EBS gives a further &euro;777 million in a, kind of, a hidden recapitalisation to AIB and then there's a further transfer, in February 2011, of &euro;1.6 billion or &euro;1.7 billion of Anglo NAMA bonds and deposits.  Now that brings the cost, arguably, to &euro;26 billion.  Can I ask you how do you see such costs, between &euro;21 billion and &euro;26 billion, being recovered for the taxpayer, as you suggest?</p></speech>

You know, the money that we ... the capital we put into EBS is counted as part of the &euro;20 billion, I think.</p></speech>

I mean, I think NAMA will sell the loans for what they spent so there's no extra loss there; that extra loss doesn't exist.  So I couldn't agree with that piece being extra.  I can't remember what the third thing you said was added to it.  So I mean it's the &euro;20 billion, I think, we'll get back.  We've already got fees of about &euro;5 billion and we have our CoCos due back next year of &euro;1.6 billion, which I expect them to pay us back.  And I expect that over time we can get the rest back.  I mean, it's my expectation and, you know, it's pretty for the future-----</p></speech>

I mean, I'm not an accountant so ... an accountant would have to tell you whether they were solvent or not.  </p>  <p>         The real problem was that - and I didn't know this at the time but I know it now - their model was broken.  They were lending effectively into the building industry.  The bulk of their lending, directly or indirectly, was into the building industry.  And that method of financing developments can't be done any more, you know, banks will never again give more than 60% into development loaning ... lending - 60% of any given development.  So, the problem wasn't so much ... there were several problems but the big thing was that there was no capacity to regenerate profits, which the other banks had.</p></speech>

All I'm talking about there is the method of doing it.  What we did was we looked at every single loan.  So in tranche 1, they went through every single loan in every single bank.  Probably if they'd done 20% of the loans for every bank, in the different tranches, and done them all together, you'd have got more or less the same answer.</p></speech>

I don't think we would have avoided a bailout but I think we may have had a far worse problem in terms of the SME loans and the capacity of the banks to get back to looking at their SME loan books, which might have had a much worse impact on the real economy.  Because, after all, you know, the banking ... and this inquiry is, obviously, looking at banking, but banking is there to service the economy and getting employment growing and unemployment falling was the most important political desire by both of the Governments in the last seven years.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.530" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#W00600"><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My opening remarks are quite brief.  First of all, I'd like to thank you and the members for the opportunity to make this brief opening statement today.  The task of inquiring into the banking crisis and the events surrounding it will, I hope, reveal lessons for the future guidance of policy makers which will help reduce the risks of a recurrence of these events to a remote one.  I don't think we could have another such unaffordable crisis.</p>  <p>  I would like at the outset to express my regret at how matters turned out for the people of Ireland and for the period of austerity that affected so many, and for the increased burden of debt that we now carry.  As set out in my written statement, my connection in this was as a senior civil servant providing economic and fiscal policy advice to Ministers and Government, who then decided on the policy actions to pursue.  </p>  <p>  I believe that, as confirmed by the Wright report, that the policy advice was appropriate, although not always followed.  The advice was to run a fiscal policy close to balance or a surplus, and to avoid adding unnecessarily to demand in the economy, to improve supply and to guard our competitiveness.  I did not provide advice on monetary or credit issues, that being the preserve of the Central Bank, or on credit growth, seeing that is a matter for the Central Bank to handle.  While giving advice I also took advice, notably that the likely growth scenario was one of a soft landing, i.e. that the housing market would return to more normal levels in a manageable way.  This was the view of economic advisers in the Department as well as outside, official and private sector commentators.  </p>  <p>  I did not foresee events as they happened.  Others didn't do so either.  I was aware of only limited contrarian advice at the time.  It is difficult, as I said in my written statement, for cautionary or contrarian views to be got across when the economic news is so positive and when the country has been widely complimented on its economic performance.  </p>  <p>  The rise in asset prices was a factor of accommodating monetary policy and fiscal policy, strong domestic demand and certain property tax incentives.  These incentives were introduced at various times since the 1980s.  The motivation for these reliefs was to develop, restore, renew certain areas, and to stimulate employment and job creation.  Some of these were more successful than others, and all were generally supported at political level.  A number of these were terminated after 1997, some limited in extent, and some new ones introduced.  The case for such reliefs was much diminished in the strong property market, but it took time to eliminate these from the tax system.  </p>  <p>  I accept that there was a deficiency in economic advice resources, which it also took time to address effectively.  The situation was improved, but the problem is not just recruiting but retaining staff.  The current Government economic and evaluation service model seeks to address these issues in a constructive way.  Fiscal policy decisions take place in a different context to monetary policy action.  That context is a democratic one.  Government must marshal support for policy actions, and justify and defend these to parliament and the electorate.  It is not easy to garner support for restraint when resources appear plentiful.  A key challenge for the future, I believe, will be the need to communicate the wisdom of restraint to the public, even when resources allow, and the desirability of using surplus funds to reduce debt now to lessen the burden for the future.  It also seems that the EU believes that closer monitoring of member states, more constraints on our freedom of action, and firmer rules on budgetary policies will bring about greater fiscal responsibility.  Hopefully this will not be at the expense of democratic responsibility.  In short, there are important lessons to be learned and there are important issues to be reflected on in the remit of the inquiry on which I hope I can help in that regard.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p></speech>

In terms of expenditure in your period, in the senior role in expenditure, did the Governments, successive Governments, keep their hand out of the public expenditure till or not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#W01100"><p>Well, my role in public expenditure was after the ... after the crisis started, and in that case there was significant cutbacks in spending.  As regards the period from 2000, I think the picture varied.  There was some years in which there was quite strong expenditure growth, and I think in 2003 and 2004 that fell to 7% or 6%.  And then, after that, it returned to a level of 10%.  So there was very strong expenditure growth.  I mean, it was a time of plentiful resources.  There were also Government commitments and social partnership commitments, so that these added to the pressures for public spending.</p></speech>

Ten years later it was &euro;62.5 billion.  That's a trebling of expenditure on behalf of the State in a relatively short period.  Did the Department do any international peer reviews with trading partners or anything of that nature to see ... to gauge the expenditure by the Irish State with other states?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.537" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#W01300"><p>I don't think so.  I think the metric we used was as a percentage of GDP.  And, you know, it remained around the 32%, 33%, 34%, which was far less than in neighbouring countries, maybe with the exception of the UK, and on the same level as the US.  So that is the ... that's the main metric we used.  I mean, different countries had different traditions.  The Scandinavian countries have high expenditure, high taxes.  We were trying to run high expenditure and low taxes, which the growth and the economic resources allowed, for a time.</p></speech>

And that on the basis of that &euro;100 billion, that that is part of the national debt.  Could I ask your analysis of the &euro;100 billion and how, in the future, the future generations will be obliged to pay that back?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.541" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#W01700"><p>-----what's said.  I mean, we had this problem before in the '80s when we had debt, GDP, or GNP ratios of over 100%, that you got up to 130%, or close to it at one stage.  And the interest rate regime, I think, payments were taking up a lot of the income tax receipts were going on paying the national debt.  </p>  <p>         Unless there's some debt forgiveness, then the only way we can fund that is by growing and reducing the burden in that way, so that we have more capacity to pay the interest.  We did it before.  It took some time to do but that's the main way.  Now, obviously, before there were high interest rates we weren't part of the euro.  So, you know, to the extent that the monetary policy in the euro works, and fiscal policy ... the debt burden in terms of interest rates will be a bit more manageable than it was before.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.544" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#X00300"><p>Well, there are various figures given for the reliance on these taxes.  There's a figure mentioned of 30%.  That includes corporation tax, and corporation tax is paid mainly by the multinational sector and is more related to foreign GDP than it is to domestic.  And, in the case of stamp duties, the fact is that there's no stamp duty on new houses, it's ... stamp duty is on second-hand houses; it's VAT that's on the new houses.  So, there was a concern that if the economy turned down sharply we could be exposed, but the general opinion was that there would be a soft landing, in which case there would be less tax, but there would be some facility either to raise tax in other ways or to let the deficit ... incur a deficit, which is allowable if ... to a certain extent, if growth reduces.</p></speech>

The ... can I ask, Mr. McNally, is it possible for a civil servant, even a very senior, experienced civil servant to say, "No, you can't do that, Minister, it's too far, it's beyond the pale", that it's irresponsible to implement a specific type of policy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#X00500"><p>Well, I suppose it is.  It depends on the context.  But if you put the arguments to the Minister, and put them in the budget strategy and memorandum, then there is a matter for political decision what the level of public spending should be and what the tax to fund that should be.  So, I'd say, yes, you could say ... you could argue against it but if the Minister decides, or the Government decides, generally, as a civil servant, you do what the Government decides.</p></speech>

The SSIAs: can I ask what was your view about the SSIAs?  They were &euro;15 billion with the State contributing a portion of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.548" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#X00700"><p>Well, the advice that was presented to the Minister was not to introduce such a system, or, that tax on savings ... it was difficult to know if it increased net savings or not.  I think there was some OECD evidence to suggest that it just moved the savings around.  I don't know whether that was the case or not, but the Minister was strongly of the view that, given the - this is what he expressed to us - given the prosperity, given the level of consumption, that people had forgotten how to save, and that this was a way of encouraging people to think of the future and put some money aside.  So, my advice was against the SSIAs, as was the Department.  I didn't have an SSIA myself because I believed that if I'd argued against it, I would have been, I won't say dishonest, but I just thought I shouldn't invest in something that I had argued against myself.</p></speech>

But, I mean, you can argue ... you're free to argue with the Minister and put the point of view, but if he decides, then that's the policy.</p></speech>

I'm not quite sure what the cost was, but it was also felt that there was a benefit in terms of spreading around some of the prosperity throughout the country, and in helping some areas.  I wasn't involved in the decentralisation  It was kept a fairly closely guarded secret until it was announced, and there was a small team working on it.  I mean, there are pros and cons in favour of it.  I must say I had a neutral viewpoint on it.</p></speech>

We looked at various different incentives, incentives on the principal amount, incentives on the interest, but the main reason would have been possible cost and the fact that we weren't sure that this would incentivise savings.  I mean, it may have; I don't know if it did or not.  We tried to build in factors to stop the SSIAs being used to finance consumption.  So, they were the two main reasons - the cost and whether it would be effective in stimulating saving.</p></speech>

I think the &euro;1.8 billion was that ... a question was asked, if private housing output decreased by 10,000 and you built 10,000 local authority housing, what would be the cost?  And the &euro;1.8 billion refers to that, as far as I can see from the documentation.  The actual cost in terms of the 10,000 decline, for each 10,000 decline it was &euro;570 million.  The 1,800 was made up by the increased capital expenditure on the local authority houses.</p></speech>

I think there was a figure of 6,000 or 8,000 per annum, in which case there would be lower income taxes and VAT, and higher live register payments.  </p>  <p>         If it proceeded at that rate, it was possible, I mean, it could be possible to raise money in some other ways to try and offset that or to run a small deficit.  We were in surplus or in balance for most of the period.</p></speech>

As early as 2001, a paper presented to the MAC meeting on 26 April shows the Department were facing a specific skills challenge and had a broad spectrum of skills requirements among others in economic modelling.  Can you give us your view if efforts were made by the Department, if they were sufficient after 2001 to improve the skills shortage?</p></speech>

I don't know about the other side but the financial side, there would have been also IT skills but I do admit there was a problem in terms of resourcing on the economic side.  I found this out early on when the economic forecaster, who I think was Robert Watt, who is now the Secretary General of PER, I think he was the short-term economic forecaster.  I was seeking somebody to replace him and I had some difficulty because there was a reluctance to go on to the economic side, because people thought that their career prospects were better if they had a more broader experience and they weren't identified as being too technical or working too long in one particular area.  I said to the person that "look you will only be there for a couple of years, you will be replaced" as a way of trying to get him to agree.  As a result of that, I spoke to the Secretary General, John Hurley, who became Governor of the Central Bank, and he arranged for the Central Bank to second an economist, John McCarthy, who has since gone on to be the chief economist.  That was sort of a stop-gap measure to an extent.</p>  <p>  When Derek Moran, the current Secretary General, came in, he conducted an analysis of the leads of the section and proposed a plan to recruit economists directly, which was done, and to bring in some other people from other parts of the Department, from the NDP - the national development plan side - who were, that was running down their engagement there.  We also took on another economist in 2006 from the Central Bank.  So something, things were done.  I don't think there was any lack of quality, it was more an issue of quantity.  The Wright report did say that the analysis presented by the economic side was as good as any else and there were no complaints that I heard from any of the international bodies they dealt with to that extent.  While they might have had a small economic side, it did work with the ESRI and the Central Bank and the Commission so to an extent they were able to use their resources as well in their activities and the Commission would have had regular meetings to discuss the economic methodology and the economic forecast.</p></speech>

So was the IMF and the OECD and the Commission.  So it wasn't just us that were taken by surprise.  We just got it wrong and I can't explain it in any more detail than that.  We relied on ... perhaps we placed too much trust in a soft landing, not allowing for the fact that these things could go wrong.</p></speech>

I mean, since 1997, some of them had been got rid of - the seaside resort scheme, the Temple Bar scheme, the Custom House docks scheme - and we would have recommended to the Minister certainly that these reliefs should go and I recall reading the 2003 budget where it said they would go in 2004 but when 2004 came, they were extended because as far as I remember, because of worries that there were schemes still incomplete.  So when the new Minister came in, we put a proposal to him to try and get rid of most of these property reliefs but he asked for a special study to be done so that it could be explained to the public why this was being done, and not sudden.  So that was the main one within my purview.</p></speech>

Can I ask your view, your personal view on the appropriateness of them, the benefit that they had to the Irish economy?</p></speech>

The urban renewal scheme was brought in in 1986 and, I think, as was the Custom House docks scheme.  So the Custom House docks scheme certainly did help develop the IFSC and there was also a BES, which was ...  I think property was allowed in the BES scheme.  That was got rid of because property was ... the BES was supposed to be risk-taking, not investing in bricks and mortar.  The schemes were reviewed in 1996 and I think the conclusion was that there was some benefit in the areas in which the schemes were concentrated and some which ... what they call a shadow effect in areas beside it, but it was difficult to conclude whether that had led to an overall increase in output in the economy or not.  The seaside resort scheme, we were never convinced of the wisdom of it, and I think the idea was, and it may have been well-founded in the sense that some of the traditional resorts had ... were a bit down at heel and the accommodation wasn't as good as it should be and the amusements and facilities.</p></speech>

They had been proposed, I think, in 1992 ... I think the Department ... the Minister didn't proceed, but in 1995 it was decided to go ahead with them.  While there may have been some sense behind them in terms of trying to restore the attractiveness of seaside resorts in Ireland, I think most of the investment went into accommodation, rather than into facilities and, I suppose, that is to be expected if there is tax relief for investing in property or for investing in amusements and things, the likelihood is that property will win out.</p></speech>

I mean, the problem ... one of the issues with the stamp duty was ... the stamp duty was raised from 6% to 9% in 1996 when residential property tax and, I think, local authority charges were removed.  This was a way of restoring the ... the revenue.  But the stamp duty rates applied not on a tranche basis, not, sort of,1% of the first &euro;100,000; 2% of the next.

You paid 2% on &euro;101,000 as opposed to 1% on &euro;90,000.  So, that meant, when prices rose, there was ... there was significant elasticity and that was one of the reasons why the yield went up so much.  We did think was there a better way of restructuring the stamp duty because, you know, 9% was quite a high rate and we didn't go to the Minister on this because this was just talking amongst ourselves in the tax division.  But the problem was that any attempt to ... to restructure the stamp duty rates would probably have meant a lowering of the rates ... just the way the process works.  And lowering the stamp duty rates could have added fuel to the fire of the house prices, so, you know, we were ... we had a system that brought in a lot of money.  It probably wasn't the most judicious system but making changes in it could have raised other problems.</p></speech>

The Regling and Watson evidence book has that after 2004, the IMF, the OECD and ECOFIN all clearly recommended a tighter fiscal stance and the building up of a cushion for the time when the income from the property-related transactions would fall.

We did have a very low debt ratio, I think it fell towards 20%.

I wasn't centrally involved in the PMPA and the ICI events in 1982 and '84, I think it was, or 1982 and 1985, so I knew the value of close supervision.  I wouldn't have gone for this light touch regulation because, as in most of these cases, the State ends up having to pay the bill and the State should be extra vigilant.  In terms of banking policy at the time, I was involved in the Central Bank Act, which was passed in 1989, which was to strengthen the powers of the bank to ... the Central Bank to supervise banks, to attach conditions to licences, to apply codes of conduct and other matters.  But my recollection was of trying to take initiatives with the banks to get them to lend to ... especially to ... I think there was a young entrepreneur scheme which the Minister at the time, Minister Reynolds, persuaded the banks to lend ... or to provide &euro;100 million for.  I'm not quite sure how he did it but he managed to do it.  And there wasn't the ... there wasn't the culture of ... I didn't detect a culture of profit maximisation; they might have wanted to grow the size of the banks.  And I don't think there was the same culture of bonuses so, you know, the culture ... there was a cultural change in terms of seeking after profits and rewarding those who sold the most and contributed most of the profits.</p></speech>

Because he was ... he's very critical of the lack of specialist economists.  In fact, I think he had only  7% of people at the top level had degrees in economics at master's level or above.</p></speech>

I was surprised at the level of economists they mentioned in the finance in Canada.  I mean, we're a smaller country with smaller resources, and, as I said, even though there might have been limited numbers on the economic side, the quality, as far as I could see, was good, and they had available the economic ... economists in the other institutions that were being dealt with.  So, I was a bit surprised to find that we were so underweight, and, you know, we had tried to improve that.  And I think the initiative of the Government in the Government Economic and Evaluation Service is a worthwhile initiative in trying to recruit people to that particular job, and then giving them the opportunity for career development.</p></speech>

And there was also some documents we saw that those people should have only a three-year contract, I mean ... I think ... you're an integrationist, I think, if I interpreted you correct that those economists should be, in the general scheme of things, in the Department.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I mean, a lot of work was being done on evaluation, and the ... more could have been done on the use of economists in that respect, and that's what's being done now in the Government Economic and Evaluation Service.  The idea ... there was a feeling that at interviews what people were looking for was people with broader experience having worked in different areas and not being ... I mean, it's wrong to say technical, because being an ... and having studied economics, it is broader than simply crunching numbers.  But there were ... there was a view that people were hampered in some way by being too closely defined with a special area.  I mean, I did experience it myself in interviewing people who were excellent on the budgetary numbers and on all the number crunching but when asked a question outside their area, showed great difficulty.  So there was something in what was being said, but we needed to have economists; we needed people to work in the area, and, you know, getting somebody from the Central Bank was a help, but it was only a ... it was a stop-gap in some ways.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#BB00800"><p>Well, the very fact that we have gone through the experience means that there will be more caution in future and people will understand the need to run surpluses.  I mean, as I understand it, the Finns run a large surplus because of the history they had, as do some of the other Scandinavian countries.  As to how governance should work, I did suggest that there is ... possibly it needs to be explained or some sort of social compact or social consensus that you don't have to spend all the money just because you have the money and that there's a need to ... whatever you have, rainy day funds or some way of segregating some of the surplus to be used later.  The other way is to have some sort of rule which limits expenditure.  I know there's one in the EU which was changed a bit at our request.  So it's either learn the lesson, agree something at a social level or have a rule that limits the growth to spending when the resources are there - a sort of counter-cyclical spending rule.</p></speech>

There was a recognition that, you know, it couldn't keep going at the same rate, but if you subscribe to the view of a soft landing then it was possible to cope with that when the revenue reduced.</p></speech>

It both gets the one-off taxes and has invented new forms of recurrent taxes.</p></speech>

I thought ... didn't think development levies were raising that much money nowadays.  That was one of the most cyclical taxes because when development stopped the revenue went.  I mean, the stamp duty was a good revenue earner but it could not be relied upon.  It obviously depended on the amount of transactions.  The property tax is better because it'll be more stable but I didn't detect, during my time, a great enthusiasm for property tax.  We had done some work on it for the tax strategy group in 1996 but it wasn't really on the agenda.</p></speech>

Unemployment is forecast to average 6 per cent this year, mainly on foot of the construction and slowdown, and Ireland like others is facing ... difficult inflationary pressures.  In terms of public finances, the Bank concurs with our assessment.  The Bank reiterates the assessment that Irish Bank's [sic] are well capitalised with good quality assets and that the banking sector's shock absorption capacity remains strong.</blockquote>  <p>Do you recall that document and that advice at the time, do you?</p></speech>

I just want to pick up on that point because we've been hearing evidence from different agencies, the Department of Finance as well, and your own evidence, and from the ESRI, the Central Bank.  Can you explain to me this ... because we've heard a lot of people say, well, in terms of the soft landing or in terms of that consensus view, that, "Well, the Department of Finance said it."  And then the Department of Finance say, "Well, the IMF were saying it," and the IMF don't do their own analysis so they're saying, "Well, the Central Bank were saying it."  The Central Bank will tell us, "The Department of Finance were saying it."  </p>  <p>               So, where did this originate from?  Did it come from on high and everybody just started passing the parcel, or was there original work done within the Department of Finance that concluded that there was a soft landing was what was going to happen?</p></speech>

So, you know, it was known that these reliefs benefited high earners, yes.</p></speech>

I think Deputy Doherty has covered most of the specific questions that we'd agreed to ask.  Just to follow on slightly from the soft landing, was there ever a forum internally where assistant secretaries, senior principal officers would sit down and say, "Okay, the consensus from the IMF and the ESRI and the OECD and various other people and the data and, indeed, our own individual units, is that we are going to have a soft landing."?  So, was there a forum that that was discussed at ... that you can recall where it was decided, "Yes, that is the likely outcome so, therefore, that's the position"?</p></speech>

So, you know, we didn't feel it was a justified ... especially when other countries were struggling to make the 3% deficit and were using a lot of one-off measures to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact.</p></speech>

I mean, if you're catching up with other countries, you will find that that inflation will be a bit higher on the services sector side, which has less productivity than the traded side ... that that will tend to show higher rates with inflation.

In 1999 I think it was &euro;1.5 billion and in 2003 it was &euro;300 million.

Thank you, Mr. McNally, you're very welcome.

And ... to my ... I'm telling a story against myself but I estimated that the cut in CGT would cost something like &euro;19 million, but over the next four or five years, the revenue increased by tenfold, so there was obviously a behavioural change.  People used the lower rate to cash in.  So I mean,  wouldn't say we opposed the cut.  We pointed out the consequences there might be, which, in my case, it was wrong, plain and simple.</p></speech>

The final question I wanted to ask was in relation to lessons for the future.  You spoke about prudent being not spending all your tax receipts in a given year, so I just wondered what the current thinking is, in relation to when you have a surplus, is it to run a surplus, is it to direct a surplus into some sort of fund like a pension reserve fund, or is it to pay off the debt?  What would be the prudent thing, looking forward?</p></speech>

But I would think that the main recommendation of the Department would be to use the surplus to run down the debt as that's a burden on the people, which, you know, if interest rates rise will be ... will absorb more of the tax revenue.  That's what I would imagine; I haven't asked in the Department what the priority is, but that would be my sense of it.  That's what I would be recommending anyway, to use the resources to get down the debt or to find some way of minimising the debt.</p></speech>

Okay, I'll just deal with one question myself, Mr. McNally, and then we'll move towards the wrap-up and I'll invite both Senator Barrett and Senator D'Arcy back in again.  If I could just relate to, and I think Senator MacSharry touched upon this with you just a moment ago, on 24 January 2001, the European Commission concluded that Irish fiscal policy was inconsistent with the broad European policy guidelines.  They further asked Ireland to avoid further overheating of its economy, and there's a document, I think, coming up on the screen there now, but you make reference to this, I think, actually in your own opening address today, where you mention, I think, it's on page 4 of your opening statement:</p><blockquote>The only notable exception to this is the recommendation issued to the State in 2001 by the Economic and Finance Council under Article 99(4) of the Treaty to take countervailing budgetary measures during 2001 to avoid overheating.  This recommendation was not felt warranted and was not accepted by the Irish authorities.</blockquote>  <p>And if I just, the document is there, if I just move one or two pages into it, it's page 13 of the document itself, on the bottom, it's ... next one ... next one again ... just page 13 of it.  And if you look at the last paragraph of it there, Mr. McNally, just come in there about three lines down, it says:</p><blockquote>Against this background, the Council finds that <b>the planned contribution of fiscal policy to the macroeconomic policy mix in Ireland is inappropriate</b>.  The Council recalls that it has repeatedly urged the Irish authorities, most recently in its 2000 broad guidelines of the economic policies, to ensure economic stability by means of fiscal policy.  The Council regrets that this advice was not reflected in the budget [of] 2001, despite developments in the course of 2000 indicating an increasing extent of overheating.  The Council considers that <b>Irish fiscal policy </b>[of]<b>2001 is not consistent with </b>... <b>broad guidelines of the economic policies </b>as regards budgetary policy.</blockquote>  <p>And it goes on and on.</p><p>Now, we've had reports from some institutions like the IMF and others that said in around 2005, 2006, they were getting things wrong.  But this one would seem to be very, very strident in its language and in its indication of action required and so forth.  So could you, as I say, I think the document is of 12 February 2001, this, so ... and the European Council recommend that countervailing measures be taken, as I just cited.  Could you tell us what action was taken by the Department of Finance on receipt of this very, very strong advice as outlined from the European Council?</p></speech>

I would have been advised just before that meeting of the Economic and Finance Committee, that they were planning to make this recommendation and I would have reported back to the Minister, who felt that it wasn't justified, and I would have argued at the Economic and Finance Committee that the recommendation was not warranted.  I agree that they did, in the 2000 broad guidelines, say that we should stand ready to use countervailing measures.  But we had a surplus of 4.3% in 2000 and were planning another surplus of 4%, so, you know, that is taking a lot of resources out of the economy.  What they were suggesting was another 0.5%.  In the end, the economy slowed in 2001, and the Commission did not renew the recommendation, it, sort of ... a draw was called, I suppose.</p></speech>

So is a one-quarter observation of an economic trend sufficient to say that things have changed?</p></speech>

And the economy did slow down; the initial forecasts were for no growth, that turned out to be growth in the end.  But, you know, it's ... there was a feeling that we were being picked on, somewhat unfairly, and that did influence the view that was taken.</p></speech>

My view would be that they should have been concentrating on those issues, rather than on ourselves.</p></speech>

The relief was given at 20%, which was the standard rate, and was given by means of a top-up, so everybody got it, irrespective of income.  But I didn't see a political motivation behind it; at least, I wasn't aware of one.</p></speech>

The term "euphoric recall".  It's used in terms of recovery, particularly with addiction studies and stuff like this, and by means of a time to find a relapse.  They also ... they note with addicts that they start recalling the past in a different type of light to the type of damaging way it was.   Would you ... considering that you are maybe now retired but you're observing things as we move into the future, do you see any sort of dangers like this?  That we look back to the past?  Things like the SSIA scheme that we were discussing earlier and we might reshape them in our heads that might create difficulties for us going into the future.</p></speech>

I was Minister for Finance from the 26 June 1997 to the 29 September 2004.  As directed by the committee, I submitted a statement on specific lines of inquiry relating to my role as Minister for Finance.  As my period as Minister for Finance ended in September 2004, some considerable time before the banking collapse, my statement deals only with those areas of interest of which I might have some direct knowledge or which would have arisen during my tenure as Minister.  This opening statement refers briefly to areas of my written statement.</p>  <p>  The new regulatory structure was set up during my time and culminated in two separate Bills in 2002 and 2003.  In 1998 the Government agreed in principle to the setting up of a single regulatory authority for financial services.  Interestingly, the idea of an SRA was first mooted in 1989 but it was decided not to go ahead with same at that time.  We asked Michael McDowell to chair the implementation advisory group.  It consisted of nine persons and produced two reports, a majority report and the minority alternative model.  It took some time to reach political agreement as to the new structure, which eventually led to the two Bills as referred to above.  There was considerable disagreement and not just between the politicians.  If you read the commentary on stances of that time, there was not universal agreement as to how and where the new authority should be located.  I've noted with a certain degree of irony that a number of the politicians and commentators who wished to keep the Central Bank out of the key role at that time were to the forefront in advocating the return of all powers to the Central Bank post the recent financial crisis, and that has now been done.</p>  <p>  Practically all of the debate of those years centred on the consumer protection angle, and little on prudential supervision.  I outlined in my statement the various reasons for such debate orientation.  I further outlined in my statement that the rules for the capital requirements for banks were designed internationally following the Basel committee recommendations.  There has been a recurring notion in much of the Irish media commentary of recent years that principle-based regulation, also referred to as light-touch regulation, was an Irish invention.  In particular, some commentators have gone so far as to advise that light-touch regulation was even a Charlie McCreevy invention.  Much as I might be flattered to think that I might own the copyright, it is not the case, and light-touch, principle-based regulation was a long time in vogue internationally, and years before I arrived as Minister for Finance.  At least some of the earlier evidence to this committee has at least scotched that notion.</p>  <p>  I have outlined in my statement as to how capital requirements for Irish banks were managed under the same formulae and policies which applied to all the other European banks.  </p>  <p>         As the new structures were in the embryonic stage of development before I ceased as Minister in 2004, I can only comment in a cursory way on the co-operation and integration of the new bodies.  However, during the setting up of IFSRA, I was strongly of the view that there was an excellent level of co-operation between the chair of IFSRA and the Governor of the Central Bank.  The new structure allowed the Central Bank to concentrate on the macro level and to produce financial stability reports which contain guidance for the financial regulation to follow.  IFSRA had responsibility for the individual institutions under their remit.<br/><br/>I now turn to direction from the committee on advice.  Strictly, the reprimand from Brussels on our 2001 budget would fall under the heading of &quot;advice&quot;.  The European Union was of the opinion that our budget and stability programme update were inconsistent with the broad economic policy guidelines and issued this reprimand early in 2001.  However, in November 2001, the Council of Ministers lifted its earlier reprimand and stated, &quot;Unexpected economic developments were such that the inconsistency underlying the recommendation has lost its force.&quot;  This says much about the whole art, if it is one, of economic forecasting.  In fact, during the course of 2001, the international economic slowdown had gathered force arising from a number of factors, and economic activity in Ireland had declined sharply.  In fact, the year-on-year increase in real GDP in Ireland decelerated from 13.1% to 0.1% in the last quarter, thus the 2001 Irish budget was then seen in a different light in Brussels.  I shall also mention that, in 2001, there was much criticism of the EU reprimand, and not just from the Irish Government.  Many commentators, nationally and internationally, were critical of the EU stance.  As many referred to at the time, there appeared to be one set of rules for the larger countries, and a different book for the smaller member states.<br/><br/>On the issue of advice given to governments from many quarters, the Department of Finance, Central Bank, ESRI, OECD, European Union, IMF, and others, the line taken by all democratic governments is that it is just what it says on the tin, advice.  Democratically elected governments must, at all times, with their freedom, do what they consider best, in the interests of their people.  Yes, this means the ignoring of some advice and the taking of others.  I note with some wry amusement that the current Government, as is their right, seems to be steadfastly ignoring advice from a plethora of sources.  The Fiscal Advisory Council, established in law by the present Administration, are saying that the projections for growth, consumer spending and population are too optimistic.  Also being sidelined are commentaries from the ESRI, the European Commission, and the IMF, not to mention some domestic economists and commentators.<br/><br/>My high regard for the Department of Finance and the staff is well known and has been documented many times previously.  However, it is not a criticism when I note the very obvious.  Very few worthwhile initiatives of different political Administrations would never have seen the light of day if advice from the Department of Finance had been followed.  One of the most groundbreaking changes in Ireland was the introduction of free secondary education in the sixties by the late Donogh O'Malley.  This was done without the approval of Finance, and those of an historical bent know that the Department was so exercised, that it got its Minister, the late Jack Lynch, to formally complain to the Taoiseach.  Finance were totally unaware of the proposal, and O'Malley was, indeed, in contravention of Cabinet rules for making such a major announcement without informing his other colleagues, and, in particular, the Minister for Finance.  Wasn't it a good job for Ireland that Se&aacute;n Lemass ignored the angst of the Department of Finance?<br/><br/>I look back on the advices from a number of the already mentioned sources.  For example, in 2002 the main theme seemed to be the threat of inflation, and there was little talk of housing prices, or that general area, in any of the commentary.  In fact, a leading economist was so concerned in 2002 on the slowdown, that he suggested the diverting of funds, of the annual contribution of the pension reserve fund, and putting that money into capital projects.  Some commentary always referred to the fact that we had &euro;1.5 million people between the age of 50 and 34, and that the demand for housing would continue to be very strong.  To illustrate, again, the futility of forecasting, I would draw attention to the 2000 report from the long-term issues group of the Department of Finance.  It predicted a total population of 4.1 million in 2056.  It's about 4.6 million today.  And that the Exchequer debt would be wiped out entirely by 2012.  During my time as Minister for Finance, I was painted as a right wing ideologue, possessed of a Scrooge-like parsimony when it came to public spending.  On the other hand, post the financial crisis, I've been turned into a kind of Santa Claus and the philosophy most often attributed to me by my detractors is supposedly encapsulated in the quote, &quot;When you have it, you spend it&quot;.  It is ironic that this comment was made on the publication, in November 2001, of the following year's departmental Estimates.  The headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i>on the following day was entitled, &quot;McCreevy takes the axe to public spending&quot;.  The first line of that article reads, &quot;Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy last night brought to a shuddering halt the big-spending era that went with the economic boom&quot;, end of the headline.  Later on, in that article, it refers to me saying, &quot;When you have it you spend it.  The mistake is to try to spend it when you haven't got it&quot;.  Now, however, I think it can be fairly said that the above actual comments of mine, when I was answering a question as to why I was reducing public spending, have been distorted and non-contextualised to an extraordinary degree.  The comment at that time attracted little attention but seems to have got a special lease of life during the economic downturn.  The reason for such misrepresentation ... well, to quote from another scribe, &quot;It might just be an interesting example of the way popular quotes get distorted over time to better fit the public perception of the person who made them&quot;.<br/><br/>I vigorously disagree with the assertion that the Government, during my term as Minister for Finance, misspent the proceeds of the stellar economic growth of that period.  We did increase spending in a large number of areas to make up for lost time, and for the under-provision of services in the previous decade and a half.  As a percentage of GNP, in 1986, Government expenditures stood at 58%, and Government debt at 122%.  At the end of 2003, the respective figures would have been 38% and 35%.  In respect of spending during my time in office, I've set out, in tabular form, the percentages for total Government expenditure and gross current expenditure.  These figures are taken from the public document Budget Statistics 2014, published by the Department of Finance.  The figures I quote are in respect of GNP and, of course, the percentage figures in terms of GDP would be lower.  In terms of GNP, gross Government ... gross current expenditure ... I'll leave ... the figures for Government expenditure are in a different column; I'll just refer to the gross current expenditure figures.  As a percentage of GNP, in 1997 it was 35.2%, and that relates to a previous Government of Fine Gael and Labour.  In 1998, for me, it was 31.7%; in 1999, it was 30.4%; in 2000, it was 28.1%; in 2001, it was 29.5%; in 2002, it was 30% even; in 2003, it was 29.8%; and in 2004, it was 29.8%.  No matter how these figures are interpreted, it is quite clear that there was no splurge over the period.  This was a period of considerable economic success.  The numbers for people at work increased massively; there was practical full employment; the scourge of forced emigration ceased after 150 years; we experienced the welcome new phenomenon of migration to Ireland; the population increased dramatically; we increased spending considerably in the areas of health, education and social welfare; the pension for the aged was increased to a proper level; child benefit more than doubled; and many other improvements in public services.  And, during all of those years, we ran substantial Exchequer surpluses, except for a small minus in one year.  This was achieved after paying for a massive public capital programme, the most visible example being the now excellent road network, and yet there was still a surplus.  We also set up the National Pensions Reserve Fund, setting aside most of the proceeds from the Telecom privatisation, and setting aside 1% of GNP annually.  This fund was intended not to be touched until after 2025, and was there to provide for future pension liabilities.  Since the recent financial downturn, critics are suggesting that we should not have spent all of this money.  </p>  <p>         So if we had spent less, it would have meant larger budget surpluses and some have gone on to say we should have built up further rainy day funds, apart from the pension reserve.  Now, are these people for real?  In a political democracy, it is especially difficult to run any kind of a budget surplus and many were even against the idea of the pension reserve fund.  It is difficult to run a surplus in a democracy.  If there was one patient untreated by the health services, one family without a house, one special needs person without proper services, one pay demand unmet, what justification would any Government have had for increasing the reserve fund and initiating further buffers?  Not alone would it be politically unacceptable but I suggest it would be morally wrong also.<br/><br/>The next theme of the committee refers to the property sector and, by implication, the question of tax incentives in that area.  Activity in the construction sector has always been a key driver of economic activity.  Despite the gains made in residential construction over the years, Ireland's housing stock is still below the EU average in units per 1,000 of population.  This is particularly obvious in 2015, which results in rents climbing substantially.  Furthermore, it has always been part of the Irish social culture for persons to actually own their own home.  This led the Government to initiate various reports of the housing market, which resulted in some changes.  Tax incentives for the property investment have been a feature of the Irish tax code for over 50 years.  As far as I can research, there are incentives as far back as the 1959 Finance Act.  Some have sought to give the impression that the property tax incentives only really started after the '97 Government came into office.  However, if you look at the list of incentives by non-Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, you will find many others, such as urban renewal, seaside resorts, designated islands and many more.<br/><br/>My attitude to property tax incentives is summed up in my budget speech on the 2003 budget, when I was going about ending the deadline for some of the schemes.  I proposed ending many on 31 December 2004.  As I said in that speech, &quot;the existing demand for property investment and the desire to improve equity in the tax system, there is no justification for a continuation of these reliefs beyond 2004&quot;.  Regarding the philosophy of property tax incentives, I stated, &quot;I am a supporter of properly-focused, clearly defined, specific reliefs which can encourage the development of goods and services, including public services, which might otherwise not be provided, or where provided, are too little or too late.&quot;  So to conclude, quite recently an Irish commentator wrote the following:</p><blockquote>The reality is that economics is a social and not a physical science.  Economic outcomes are generally driven and shaped by human behaviour, and unfortunately human behaviour is rarely possible to predict with any degree of certainty.</blockquote> <p>During my time as a student in University College Dublin, what is now the department of economics was then known as the faculty of political economy.  The longer I was in politics, the more I understood the accuracy of that old definition in UCD.  Thank you very much.</p></speech>

I can only speak for my time at the Department of Finance.  I found the officials there very helpful, working extremely long hours, prepared to - at the drop of a pin - to go and do things which were way above and beyond the call of duty.  I found them helpful in every respect.  They argued their viewpoint very forcibly, they ... and then when, if you wanted to go in another direction, they went off and did what you told them to do.  That's the job of what good public servants do and I can only say that I think they vigorously fought their corner.  I found nothing during my time to say that there was anything but the highest level of intellectual capacity applied to all the problems and the best officials I think in the public service were there.</p></speech>

The question, as I put it to you, was that Mr. Wright makes a critique of leadership and direction in the Department during that period, in terms of trying to make those arguments and that it was very very limited.  Would you agree with Mr. Wright's analysis or would you have a different opinion?</p></speech>

But, like, unless we want to go to another kind of structure on ... whatever kind of democracy you want to call it, it's the Government of the day that makes the decisions and it's the Minister of the day that runs his Department.  There is no ... in the words of a former Secretary General at Finance, still alive I know, there is no such thing as a departmental view of government.  There are only Ministers' views.  I am some time intrigued in recent times to read when politicians, and we all have done this, try to get out of trouble as to why something can't be done.  They come along and say the Department of Finance won't let us.  That's only a cop out.  If you convince the Minister for Finance - that's the person to go to and he can overrule his officials if it's a good enough case.  I am sure if you go back over my 27 years in the D&aacute;il when I was a backbencher, I perhaps used that as well.  I don't recall so doing but it's an absolute ... so if the Department of Finance come along, argues it case, it puts some of those things in writing and they fight their case.  Then the Minister goes and makes the decision and the Government makes the decision based on what the Minister and the Government want to do.  So, therefore, there is no difficulty, I found no difficulty with the Department of Finance giving their views.  I don't really understand what Mr. Wright wants the officials in the Department of Finance to do.  Maybe to stand outside Merrion Street with a loud hailer or something like that.  But you couldn't run any democracy on that basis.  I am sure when Deputy Pearse Doherty becomes Minister for Finance and Deputy Joe Higgins is Minister for Public Expenditure, that they will get loads of advice from the Department of Finance and they'll blindly ignore it.</p></speech>

Can I begin first of all by asking you through 1999 to 2003, the Governor and the Central Bank warned you of excessive growth in the credit markets, warned you about the housing markets, commercial property markets, overheating in the economy and, finally, the possibility of a hard landing and this could lead to unhappy economic and social consequences.  So Mr. McCreevy, with hindsight, and given the advice you were receiving, should you have been more cautious in taxation and spending policies in your budgets?</p></speech>

And during my ... there was, of course, an increase in house prices over that period but there has been an increase in house prices long before that period as well.  In fact, I took a little liberty of going back and looking at Central Bank kind of commendations for the last 30 years or so and you'll nearly find the same thing in every report of a central bank in Ireland and elsewhere as well.  Central bankers are by nature, and rightly so, obliged to worry about things like inflation.  They'll always advise the Government to run surpluses if they can run surpluses and even when we had large indebtedness, they were saying back years ago "well you shouldn't give any tax concessions at all and you should more or less cut down the public services entirely."  </p>  <p>         And Governments took some of that advice on board and trained their budgets, as I did in my time, in what I considered the best possible way and the proof of the pudding has been in the eating.  We achieved economic growth of considerable measure.  We did the things which I've outlined there earlier and no disaster came to pass.  So I don't accept that, in my time as Minister for Finance, until 26 September 2004, that any of these disasters occurred as predicted by all these people.  It just didn't happen.</p></speech>

So, what we ... so I would see a relevance to different decisions made at different times and the systemic consequences of them.  That's not to say that you're to blame or to fault, but whether there is a relationship or not a relationship.

And I would like to remind the witness that if you refuse to answer a question which falls within your direction, you may be subject to criminal sanctions under section 75 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2009.  Further, if you refuse to answer any question without being entitled in law to so refuse, the committee may make a finding of you that you failed to comply or fully co-operate with the inquiry in its final report under section 14 of the Act.  Also, in your direction to come before the committee here today, you were also put on notice that the committee may make a recall of you on Wednesday or Thursday of next week, at which time we can amend the directions to actually broaden out the line of questioning, if we so desire, once it falls within the terms of reference of the broader inquiry.  So, with that said, if we can now actually proceed with our line of questioning and if I can start ... restart the clock and ask Deputy Doherty to ask his question again, please.</p></speech>

The Bacon report proposed a series of measures to curb price increases, including a 9% stamp duty rate for investors, a 2% anti-speculation property tax - measures that you initially supported, Mr. McCreevy, but then rejected.

There were three separate Bacon reports.  They were commissioned by the Minister for housing.  The first one was requested in November '97, and reported in April '98.  The evidence in all of that time was on the first-time buyer.  If you read the commentary in the newspapers and the D&aacute;il debates, everybody was concerned that the first-time buyer was being forced out of the market, and he or she couldn't get their foot on the first rung of a ladder, so the Minister for housing requested the Bacon report.  The Bacon report made, kind of, certain recommendations and that resulted in the Finance (No. 2) Bill of 1998.  The main reasons for ... there were a lot of other things in the Bacon report related to housing supply, etc.-----</p></speech>

There was an interesting, very interesting D&aacute;il debates at the time.  The two main Opposition parties opposed it.  One of the Opposition parties was considerably against the interest ... the disallowance of interest deductibility.  And I remember him saying, and you can check the D&aacute;il debates, that all this would have unintended consequences.  So that was the effect of the first Bacon report.</p>  <p>  Then we have the second Bacon report, and when the second Bacon report came out, prices had slowed down since 1998, but rents ... prices had gone down on houses, but rents had gone up 24% in Dublin and 17% in the rest of the country.  Apartment prices had gone up 24% and there were about 42,000 units completed that year.  Now, actually that report of second Bacon 2 praised the new student accommodation tax relief that I had in budget 1999.  And it also praised the new urban tax scheme for 43 towns cities that was in that time as well.  And then we had the Bacon No. 3 report that reported in June 2000.  And that report concluded firmly that rates of increase in prices on new and existing homes in Dublin were down sharply since 1998, and that's what the report said.  It also said that immigration of 200,000 to the country was expected over the next seven years, and this led to the Finance (No. 2) Bill of 2000, and that third Bacon report and the subsequent Finance (No. 2) Bill 2000, led to the introduction of the 2% anti-speculative tax, and tax of 2% of non-principal private residences.  Now, the interest deductibility and other changes were made subsequently, as Deputy Doherty has pointed out, and the reason for so doing was that we got a fair shock as to what was happening in the economy in 2001 into 2002.  As I referred to early in my address, growth had fallen off considerably.  There ... if you read the figures from the CIF and from the housing bodies, there was considerably less economic activity in the housing sector, or in the construction sector generally, and unemployment in that area was starting to rise, and that's why we reversed our approach on deductibility and the 2% anti-speculative tax did not take place.  It was really made redundant as well.</p></speech>

Okay, Professor John FitzGerald of the ESRI was very critical of the changes you made, the fact that the 60% capital gains tax on zoned land along with the changes you made to the Bacon proposals.  He told the inquiry on the 11 February, and this is evidence that he's given, he said:</p><blockquote>The fiscal policy was most unwise, and it fuelled the programme.  If we had a sensible fiscal policy, we would not be where we are now.</blockquote>  <p>Do you agree with him?</p></speech>

So, I understand, in 2006, as you said, they got a big report done on all of those schemes.  But it&rsquo;s hard to like ... since I haven&rsquo;t read the report, I can&rsquo;t comment on the specifics of it, but it&rsquo;s hard to make such a sweeping statement that all the property tax reliefs in all of that period contributed to house price inflation, in particular.  Like, since the schemes to which I were responsible for introducing, were such like for nursing homes, rural renewal ... I certainly would ... I can argue the toss about rural renewal; it&rsquo;s a fairly ...  But it&rsquo;s hard to think how the nursing homes relief escalated the property price of housing - child care facilities in the 1999 Finance Act, student accommodation I did in the &rsquo;99 Act, park and ride, which, I think, there was a very little uptake on it.  </p>  <p>         There wasn't ... as far as I know, in my time, from answering questions in the D&aacute;il, I'm not too sure whether really did anybody take it up, up certainly to the end of 2002 in any event, maybe someone did.  We brought in town renewal ... and actually town renewal ... the number of towns that took it up, were a lot less then we had envisaged at the outset ... there was a list of a couple of hundred.

Well, there you go.  One of the statutory objectives of the Financial Regulator was the promotion of the financial services industry in Ireland.  To what extent did Government encourage the Central Bank to pursue this role internationally?  And in your view, did the ... this objective compromise the prudential role of the Financial Regulator?</p></speech>

I couldn't see for a moment how it would've compromised the role of the regulator in terms of the prudential supervision of Irish banks.  And I'll tell you why I would believe that.  There are many reasons why financial services have come to locate in Dublin or, now, in any part of the country.  The main ... but the main reason for so doing, for the respectable funds, is to be ... is to be in an area, in a country, which they had ... is regarded as well regulated.  That's what these firms and banks and institutions want to locate in Dublin for.  You can make other cases about tax, etc., etc., but one of the primary reasons is to be located and regulated from a jurisdiction that's recognised as having good prudential rules and regulations.  So it would be a negative, in the medium to longer term, for the regulator to not go about doing his job in a sufficiently robust way because the ... it would then get out that Ireland was not the place of proper regulation and, therefore, we would lose our cachet in attracting firms there.  So, I do not believe that was the case.</p></speech>

In fact, we ... it was the one thing that concerned the Irish Government, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach and they were exercised any time there was ever a hint in an article that Ireland was a tax haven.  There were strict definitions of what a tax haven was by the OECD and others and we certainly were not then, or since, a tax haven.  And so, therefore, we never ever ... Ireland would vigorously object in all of those years, including to the present day - I'm sure, the current Minister would say the very same - we do not regard ourselves as a tax haven.

And Brian Patterson, the former chairperson of the Financial Regulator, told this inquiry that he made you aware of his lack of experience in financial regulation at the time of his appointment.  So, can I ask you, how did you come to deciding who to appoint and what were your reasons to appoint persons with very limited regulatory or banking experience to the board of the Financial Regulator?</p></speech>

I don't recall the particular discussion but I know ... if Mr. Patterson said that, that's what he said.  I take it that's what did occur.  And, as I said in my opening statement and in my witness statement as well, all the ... in setting up the new structure, you can look at all of the D&aacute;il debates and all of the Seanad debates and all of the commentary and you'll see all this concentration on consumer issues to the exclusion of nearly everything else.  And bar myself and, once or twice the Front Bench spokesperson of Fine Gael, referring to the prudential area of things, that was about the only discussion you'll read at all about prudential in all of the debates on two Bills ... not alone the two Bills but all the four years that went by before we actually set up the bodies at all and all of the controversy there was about the difference between us and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, about where the location of new bodies should be.</p>  <p>  When it came to the appointment, I actually ... I can't remember how Mr. Patterson came to be appointed.  I certainly never knew him.  I never knew him in any walk of life.  So I assume he must've came up through a process that maybe the Department of Finance or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment pursued at that time.  We did try to ensure when we set up the body CBFSAI, the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Regulatory Authority, we had them ... IFSRA here ... and we had the broader body then.  We did have, I think, about six members of the IFSRA on all - including the chief executive chairman - on the board of the larger body as well.  And that was done in order to accommodate and to meld the two organisations together because there'd be a lot of controversy about setting up this in the first place.

So there was all this emphasis on Ireland, so, as Kevin said at the .. the thing, and I'd say it's very accurate what he said, I said more or less to him "I think it's time", I probably said "Someone should make a broad statement about the situation."

I ... we would ... I would have thought that, and I'd say others thought as well, there was a lot of commentary, a lot of articles written with the Irish situation and many Irish people of all types of backgrounds were writing and sending in opinions to everybody as to what should be done.  But can I just put it; at that particular time I don't think there was ... it was just talking about broad support of the banks and I think that they subsequently to the guarantee, this legal thing about what was guaranteed became an issue.  But I'll nearly wager most people here that around that time, and that would be September, there was no much talk ... there was no ... when you're talking about supporting the Irish banks, it wasn't talked about ... these wonderful terms like subordinated bondholders etc. etc.  I doubt that there was any much comment at all about that because most people, most people were warning something will have to be done.

I know Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick since 1973.  He's a bit older than me but we qualified at the same time.  We worked in Craig Gardner accountants - now PricewaterhouseCoopers - we were there as seniors for a year and a half or so, together with the leader of the Labour Party, Joan Burton, who was a classmate of mine in UCD.  So I know Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick for that length of time but my only thing is with Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick as a banker was that at one stage he was chairman, I think, of the Irish Bankers Federation and so I think they had a lunch or a meeting one time where they met us around the big table.  This is back in my time in finance.  I ran into him many ... a few times socially.  I never played golf with him even though he's quite a ... he's a very good golfer, people might like to know that, but I actually never played with him, as far as I know.  And I know him that length of time, but like I've no communication with Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick.  And by the way, for the record, I haven't drank for over 20 years.</p></speech>

I want to go right back if I may just prior to you becoming Minister for Finance.  In opposition you expressed a number of reservations about our entry into the euro and just two months before you were made Minister for Finance you said in an interview with Jane Suiter, "It will be interesting to see if you can have monetary union without an integrated process".  So upon your appointment as Minister what did you do to protect Ireland from our entry into the euro, in terms of the shortcomings that you had seen?</p></speech>

I was the finance spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il to look at the whole area of our possible entry into the euro.  And the late Deputy Mitchell brought all types of views before the committee; people who were very for joining it, people who were against.  So we had a very robust discussion and no one ... we learnt a lot, all of us there, and it worked.  We got very little headlines but actually it was very keen, so therefore all of the issues were thought about then.  When I, as Deputy Murphy has alluded to, I would have had concerns about us joining the euro, as most ... as a lot of people did.  Interesting enough, to show how ridiculous the economics profession is, our biggest, one of our biggest concerns at the time was that when we join the euro and our nearest neighbour wasn't joining.  That was the big issue at the time, that we were going to join the euro and knowing that the United Kingdom wasn't going to join.  Now it shows the development of the Irish economy since we joined the EU in 1973 that we were able to take that decision and consider it, knowing that our nearest neighbour, our biggest market, were not going to join.  And one of the biggest issues that we had at the committee was the fear that we would join the euro, that the rate for the Irish ... the euro versus sterling would go totally in the wrong direction for us.  And if you read some of the expert views we got done by many eminent economists who predicted that the Irish rate might go to &euro;1.10 - &euro;1.09, &euro;1.10.  Deputy Murphy will be aware that the total opposite occurred and we went in the other direction to as low as &euro;0.66, &euro;0.67.  So it goes to show what all the experts ... but when we ... when we ... when I became Minister for Finance then in 1997, I actually was the Minister responsible then for making the formal decision and it took place ... or the euro notes and coins didn't start till '02 but we joined from 1999.  And the major decision I had to make was at what rate we were going to join <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Deutsche mark and if I remember correctly, Ireland, when we devalued in '92, '93, we went to a rate, off the top of my head, the Deutsche mark from DM2.67 to DM2.41.  It was then that the Irish pound kept appreciating against the Deutsche mark in '96, '97 and '98 up along, and the rate was when we were going to join and I said ... we kept our counsel very ... our cards very close to our chest and I finally made the call and we joined I think at the rate was DM2.48667.  Why I can remember these figures I just don't know but I think they are fairly accurate.</p></speech>

Plus the difficulties of that we were joining  a currency union without ... without central budgetary and fiscal policy, because take the United States for example.  Well if there was a big crisis in Minnesota, the Federal Government can make a decision to put resources in Minnesota.  You don't have that with the euro, we don't have a central government to decide.  So we knew all those downsides but we decided that it was in our best interests that we would join, knowing the downsides.</p>  <p>  Now, one of the downsides was that we gave up control over our interest rate policies and that, that, if I was to make any ... if I was to ask one thing that the ... would have lessened the economic impact of the housing crash that Deputy Doherty referred to I would say ... I would say the loss of interest rate control was the biggest, because without any shadow of a doubt if we'd been there, if we had our own interest rate setting policy outside of the euro we'd have had higher interest rates.</p></speech>

So that was being written about in <i>The Irish Times</i>in 1998, on the Monday just after you fixed the exchange rate mechanism, so what did you do to prepare the economy for that?</p></speech>

I haven't looked at it for years ... God, that's 18, 19 years ago and I certainly, I wouldn't know where to find it, but I would be fairly, I think it would have been referred to, that particular report.  But you must remember, we all decided, I mean all the political parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour, I'm not too sure about any smaller, were there any other smaller parties then, we all decided it was in the best interests of our country to join.  And by the way, I was often criticised when my nomination was put to go to Europe as Commissioner, I didn't always sing from the same hymn sheet as everybody about the greatness of having the euro project.  I always knew that there were downsides to it.  I would have signalled it as well, but it was in the, our overall best interests.  We all thought we'd join the euro, and I still believe that to this day.</p></speech>

You must remember, it was ... I know, I've said about high interest rates could have lessened the impact of the subsequent property crash but remember also that high, that low interest rates gave an opportunity for Irish businesses in the non-construction sector to actually try to make a bob, because we had been paying for years colossal interest rates and it was hard.  How some businesses survived over the previous 40, 50 years is a great tribute to them, so there were benefits to having the low interest rates and the Irish economy had become very, very, very competitive over a period of time.  And another thing may I say, if you look back at commentators when I was in government as Minister for Tourism and Trade when we had to devalue the Irish currency, we were forced to devalue the Irish currency, it wasn't working, and 19 out of 20 economists predicted that it would be a disaster and it would lead to rampant inflation.  In fact, it was the makings of the economy-----</p></speech>

Now you mention in your reply there about the success of your budgetary policy as part of you preparing for the dangers of, the risks associated with euro entry.  But, in 2001, at the beginning of 2001, we see the censure from the Commission, and it states:</p><blockquote>Given that the monetary policy is now set for the Euro area as a whole and no longer available as an instrument at national level, other policies, including budgetary policies, must be used more actively. ... The Council recalls that it has repeatedly urged the Irish authorities, most recently in its 2000 broad guidelines of the economic policies, to ensure economic stability by means of fiscal policy.  The Council regrets that this advice was not reflected in the budget for 2001-----</blockquote></speech>

The Central Bank pre-budget letters, the pre-budget letter in 2000 - this is coming in at the end of 2000 for 2001- talks about commercial property prices as a source of concern, this is page 83 in Vol. 2, it warns about competitiveness in the economy and the heightened "risk of a hard landing for the economy", because of decisions taken.

This is maybe a decade before the hard landing took place and I noted that in subsequent Central Bank reports and in subsequent ESRI reports, as late as 2006 and 2007 and 2008, they were predicting a hard landing was not going to occur at all.  So they were considerably wrong, in 2001 and 2002, because a hard landing certainly didn't occur in my time in office; in fact they changed their minds later in the decade and then it turned out there was a hard landing.</p></speech>

I spent an awful number of hours per day in the Department of Finance and that's what I did a lot of the time, so therefore I certainly did take account and read what these commentators had to say.  But as I said, in my opening Budget Statement, I then, we then decided and I recommended to the Government we do certain things, sometimes we did something that they were in agreement with, sometimes we didn't, but that's, as I said, what we do always with advice.</p></speech>

We know that the report argued for a different model, excuse me, of a fully independent and autonomous financial regulator but the Central Bank and the Department of Finance were both against that recommendation.  So what were your views on the model that was eventually agreed?  Was it your model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charlie McCreevy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#TT02700"><p>No, it was a compromise that we came up with in the end, which more or less could be termed "the McCarthy compromise".  That's named after the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Dermot McCarthy.  Can I just go back a little bit about this?  We decided in 1998 that we should have a single regulatory authority.  We set up the McDowell report to decide how this would be implemented.  Why did we want a single regulatory authority?  Well, I think if you read the early chapters of the McDowell report, it summarises very well the reasons for having a single regulatory authority, having it all in the one place, bringing all the supervision from different quarters.  Up until that, you had the Central Bank involved, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, you had the Department of Environment ... Local Government, now the Department of the Environment, you had different regulations to do with credit unions, you had all this all over the place.  So we thought the single regulatory authority was a good idea.  Mr. McDowell was asked to chair an implementation group that had nine people on it, from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, the Department of the Taoiseach and others as well.  They came up with two reports, or two and a half reports; the majority came up with the single regulatory authority outside as an autonomous unit, outside of the Central Bank.  The minority alternative model, supported by the Finance person - Tom Considine I think it was at the time - and the representative of the Central Bank, I think it was Mr. Barron, came up with the alternative model to keep it located within the Central Bank.  And Dermot McCarthy, then subsequently had a slightly ... a variation of all that.  There were differences of opinion as to its location, there was not a difference of opinion about having a single regulatory authority.  The differences of opinion regarded where it should be located and constituted and that's what caused all the difficulty between us all.  And the D&aacute;il debates are very, very interesting.  </p>  <p>         Not alone was there a difference between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, namely, the T&aacute;naiste, Mary Harney, and myself, but there was also a difference between the political parties.  Deputy Derek McDowell, who represented the Labour Party, was for the independent model advocated by McDowell.  Michael Noonan, who was then the spokesperson for Fine Gael, was for the model that we were for in Finance, keep it within the Central Bank.  In fact, if you look at one of the D&aacute;il parliamentary question debates, you see where Michael Noonan has a funny aside with Derek McDowell and he says, &quot;So, you're a PD at heart&quot;, or something like that.  You can look up the D&aacute;il debate to see that.<br/><br/>So therefore, it wasn't anybody was coming at this from <i>mala fides </i>but there was a difference of opinion and as I said in my witness statement, over Europe and further afield, there was not a universal way of doing this.  Other countries had different ways of doing this.  So finally, we came around and we came up with this compromise solution which I would term more &quot;the Dermot McCarthy kind of solution&quot; which had this overarching body, the Central Bank of Ireland self-regulatory authority and within that, we had the regulatory authority known as IFSRA, and we combined the two bodies together.<br/><br/>Now, subsequent to the economic collapse, as I said also in my opening statement, people have gone back to having it all within the Central Bank.  And by the way, the United Kingdom, in 1997, were also in the process of diversifying out as well and reverting and they also have gone back, more or less, to a single model as well.  So, it's not that anybody came this from <i>mala fides</i>including the politicians, it's just that there was an agreement on all this and how to reach it.  So, that's how we came about it.</p></speech>

It really started in the Estimates campaign and then over the course of the summer and into September-October, you would have bilateral meetings with ... officials would have bilateral meetings and then finally, you would have bilateral meetings with individual Ministers about outstanding issues.  That's the process that went through.  In all of those years that you show there, you'll see that the memorandum in June was ... and compared that with the tax and welfare package in the budget, that the memorandum in June is a higher figure except one year and that was the budget for 2003.</p></speech>

And certainly all Governments of which I have been a member and all Governments when I wasn't a member, have always borne that very much in mind.  </p>  <p>         So the answer to your question is, yes, of course, the upcoming election has always influenced measures which the Government do at election time.  We are politicians, don't forget, and we actually like to be re-elected.</p></speech>

I have given the figures for our spending as a percentage of GNP in my address earlier to the committee.  And you can see even in terms of gross current spending, which is the most legitimate one to look at, that the percentage is in or around 30%.  We did all of that, reduced the national debt and still had budget surpluses.  So, I would contend - you could have a different opinion - I would contend that we were most responsible than any other Government in the history of the State.  No other Government in the history of the State ever had budgetary surpluses and we had budgetary surpluses after large increases in spending, after large capital expenditure and that was the success of our economic policy.  So, therefore, I think there was ... we .... the things that we did in terms of expenditure were all justifiable.  I'm not saying that every euro or pound that was spent in every corner of the country was maxed to the maximum effect.  But, in general, what we did, I believe, was correct.</p></speech>

Like, I would ... some what are regarded as pro-cyclical taxes, I'm not too sure they are pro-cyclical taxes.  For example, capital acquisitions tax, I'm not too sure whether you call that pro-cyclical tax.  I don't know whether you should call corporation tax as a pro-cyclical tax.</p></speech>

Just for the ... what we did ... the Government of which I was the member, did all this tax cutting in the first three budgets, as we had promised in our election manifesto and our programme for Government in 1997.  And in the last two budgets where I was responsible, the ... in the 2003 budget, the tax package ... as it may interest you, the tax and PRSI changes cost &euro;95 million and we had a social welfare package of &euro;530 million.  And, in 2004, our tax package cost &euro;296 million and our social welfare package was &euro;630 million.  And, interestingly, if you want to know, for the budgets where I was responsible from '97 to 2004, our income tax and PRSI package total came to &euro;5,607 million.  And our social welfare package at that period came to &euro;4,507 million, meaning a ratio of about 1.25:1.  Funnily enough, for the three budgets previous to my term, '95, '96 and '97, led by the previous Government, the income tax package and social welfare came to &euro;1,171 million as against a social welfare package of only &euro;750 million.  So I would certainly say, given that the surpluses that we were generating, and also put the money aside to the ... and the pension reserve fund that our overall taxation and welfare packages and spending packages during my seven years were totally justifiable and I have no hesitation in defending it.</p></speech>

The barrier the whole time that I used, for what it's worth, was the total trying to balance the budget - that we wouldn't run a deficit.  That was the barrier.  It's very hard to do anything else and that was a fair barrier to try and keep up the whole time.  So, therefore, it was obvious that from 2003 that there ... the tax that we were expecting to ... we were judging to come in, wasn't going to be anything like the previous years.</p></speech>

So, therefore, we made ... I made decisions at that time that, even though I produced a memorandum in June to say X level of the spending, when I got around to doing the budget, I forced on Departments a lower level of spending, much, of course, to annoyance of my Cabinet colleagues, much also to ... even in the Department of Finance didn't believe it could be done and we did it.  </p>  <p>         And we did ... we, then in ... for the 2004 budget we kept spending to a relatively low level again and did a very small, as I told you, very small tax package in both of those particular budgets so, therefore, we got ... what I would term ... we had got over the difficulties and we had still a balanced budget.

Can I just explain?  And there was ... this, actually, was never corrected, despite various efforts by me at the time to try and get the right impression ... the actual facts.  At the start of every year we had the budgetary process ... we used to have the spending Estimates process.  About three weeks before the budget, I'd announce the spending for each Department.  Then in about February of every year we produced what's called the REV, the Revised Estimates Volume, which was the final figures for the Department.  During the course of any year ... and it happened in '97, in '98 and '99, during the course of any year, around June, you find that different Departments are overrunning their budgetary allocation.  And up until '99 we used to have a mid-term ... a mid-term adjustment and we used to make an announcement about it and it used to cause some difficulties, and ... because in order to make sure that for the end of year that the budgetary spend would come in at a figure that was given in the REV, Revised Estimate Volume.  We didn't do it in 2000 and 2001 because no one was noticing what we did.  We did it internally each of the times with different Departments.  In 2002, after the election, it was obvious that we were going to have to take measures to make sure that the part ... that the overall REV, the overall spend I announced in February, that it was going to come in on budget, and what we did immediately after was make pretty severe adjustments to some of the spends to ensure that we'll come in at the Revised Estimate Volume figure.  And that was stage 1 of the budgetary process.  And then stage 2 then, were the Estimates for 2003 that we started the process for-----</p></speech>

Anyway, it's the Revised Estimates Volume is the book.  The abridged ... in my time we called the ... we used to announce the Estimates in November, three weeks before the budget, and that was called the Abridged Estimates Volume.  Then when we got all the figures by the end of the year, and the outturn for the year - the previous year - if you look then we published the Revised Estimates Volume, which shows the outturn for each ... departmental levels of spending for the previous year, and beside that you have then the Estimates Volume for the following year.  Sometimes there would be small adjustments from the Abridged Estimates Volume to the Revised Estimates Volume, mostly relating to changes that the Minister might have announced in the budget in terms of spending, that would be that figure.  And then we would produce a Revised Estimates Volume.  And that was the process.</p></speech>

Mr. McCreevy, I just want to deal with one or two matters before I bring in the next questioner, who is Deputy O'Donnell, and then we'll break for a coffee break at that stage.  If I can maybe just return to the Bacon report, which was discussed earlier.</p></speech>

His measures ... and we have engaged with Mr. Bacon in the earlier part of this inquiry, his measures resulted in the pace ... in the pace of price growth halving from the first quarter of 1998 to the same period of 2000.  This was largely undone in 2001 when the measure to exclude interest deductibility was reversed.  In your view, can you explain the rationale behind the decision, and were there any influencers, lobbyists, or anybody else behind that decision?</p></speech>

If you look at the lobbying document ... annual document from the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish House Builders Association, various chambers of commerce, Dublin Chamber of Commerce, you will see in those particular documents that there was lobbying from them about the interest issue in particular.  That's ... you can go back and get those documents out, I'm sure they're all here in the committee somewhere.  So there was considerable lobbying from the CIF and other bodies as well.</p></speech>

Now, there's lobbying all the time, and before the budget, you have hundreds of lobbying going on and we had a process in my time, and pre my time, of how we met all those particular groups.  We didn't meet the same groups every year, we met the people in large groups, for about two weeks, for about ... every hour, from 9 in the morning 'til 9 and 10 at night and, some of them used to come before a committee as well, in the House.  I remember that also.  So, we would have had all of that.  But like, as I've said previously, whether there was lobbying or not, the Government would have taken the decision ... would have taken into account the ... well, we would have deemed, anyway, that the massive fallback that we'd had in construction activity, which, more or less, proved Michael Noonan's point about unintended consequences.  And I ... I think that the D&aacute;il record will show, during the debate of Finance ... the first Bacon report on Finance (No. 2) Bill 1998, that I also said, there, or in another D&aacute;il debate, that one never knows when one is interfering in the market, particularly to do with housing or property, as you might have------</p></speech>

Just to summarise the response you gave to me, Mr. McCreevy, yes, there was lobbying going on at the time, and, as you said in your earlier questioning, that the Minister, the politician is independent of officials, they stand over decision, and, of course, they're independent, the lobbyists.

So, during 2001 there was also a measure in place which recommended in the third Bacon report, to limit mortgage relief for investment properties.  In the 2001 budget, you withdrew these measures in order to encourage what would seem to be more rental properties.  Can you explain why you done that?</p></speech>

We had rents ... I gave figures there of rents going up by 25% in that particular period there.  So, we felt at the time, for better or worse, that the thing to do was to allow the investor more or less back into the market.  It should not also be forgotten that we made considerable changes to the stamp duty regime in all of those years, and I started off with quite a simple stamp duty regime and ended up ... with a desperately complicated one.</p></speech>

And, if you look there at quarter 1, 2001, and quarter 1, 2002, this is the period I'm talking about.  And, what we see in the graph there is that residential new house prices and second-hand house prices are kind of flat-lined going back to '92, then they're rising, then the impact of the Bacon report is beginning to kick in, and we see a modest reduction in house prices, and then we see the removal of ... just, on the same timeline, we see the removal of the Bacon holding measures, if they were described as that, and a significant increase, right up until 2007 or so, in house price property values.  In hindsight, were the decisions that you made ... did they prevent or create the soft or hard landing that was going to come in the property market?  </p>  <p>               In hindsight the decisions that you made, did they create or prevent the soft or hard landing that was going to come in the property market?</p></speech>

Because I think we what did on foot of the first Bacon report was, it stopped the upward slant of prices.  We then as I gave reasons as to why we reversed that some years later, and I think if you look from 2002 right on to 2007 or 2008 or whatever it says here ... I think it was up to 2007 when the peak occurred, I think there were other factors at play regarding the house price spiral at that time.</p></speech>

This is the ratio of average new house price to average industrial wage.  If you look at both graphs one is new house price and the other is average second hand house price.  What we see here is that the ratio is in and around '96 or '97, is about four times the income of a household in terms of wages in both the new house and the second house market, and in the period I am talking about again, we see that becoming stabilised.  If somebody was trying to buy a home for themselves between 2000 and 2002 - in and around that period - there is a stabilisation in the market.  Following the removal of those Bacon measures, we then see the graph going up quite significantly, up to 12 times or ten times, respectively, of a person's capacity to earn.  Have you any view on that?</p></speech>

I would not agree with that.</p></speech>

By the way I will just say this graph figure 36 relates to average industrial wage.  Maybe you have another graph to show what was the net take-home pay levels in those particular years as well.  Because a lot of the reason that people were able to buy houses and buy other houses relates to the affordability relating to their take-home salary rather than actually their gross industrial or gross any other wage, as you well know yourself from paying your own bills every month.</p></speech>

Just to get that on the record Mr. McCreevy, the graphs I have shown you this afternoon, the relationship with the cost of trying to buy a home after 2002, and the relationship of that the cost of buying a home was actually having on a person's earning capacity, you don't see any relationship of the pullback on the measures by Bacon to those two outcomes?</p></speech>

Sorry I said in my earlier evidence that the effect of the Finance Act 1998 that did the non-deductibility and other changes, that certainly had an effect but it also had an effect in kind of shooting down the level of constructive activity, the level of employment in the construction area and that's why we changed it.  Yes it certainly did, you could make that correlation.</p></speech>

I think it's come out in July there under a freedom of information request and I just want to deal with that after the break, but it comes from your own Department and it's from the Office of the Minister for Finance and it relates to the pre-budget Estimates in and around the same period.  The document's dated 19 June 2003 and it relates about going into 2004.  So I'll just ask legal to give you a copy of that before we go for a break and I'd also ask just to get a clarification on the chronological kind of dates that Deputy O'Donnell is referring to.</p>  <p>  So, with that said, I now propose that we take a break.  The witness is reminded that once he begins giving evidence, he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to his evidence on matters that are being discussed before the committee.

You say:</p><blockquote>On tax reliefs, last year I announced the termination of a series of major tax reliefs from the end of 2004.  Since then, I have been bombarded by demands to revisit that policy, especially in the case of one particular relief.</blockquote>  <p>And that's what is there.  So the question I'm asking, you extended every relief that was to be concluded by 31 December '04 by a further two years to 31 December 2006.  And the question I'm asking you is why did you do that?  Certainly, from the D&aacute;il ... from the records we have when I made reference to it earlier, over a month between 1 October 2003 and 3 November 2003, you met once with the Construction Industry Federation, you met twice with the Irish Home Builders Association, you met twice with Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute and you met once with the Irish Property Owners Association.  So, you might just elaborate.</p></speech>

This is of 19 June 2013 and it's the Office of the Minister for Finance and I'll just be asking the investigation team to be putting this in as an evidence document for further hearings coming down the tracks as well.  It's 2003, sorry, my apologies.  Yes, 2003.  And if you just look at the first two Roman numericals on page 1, it references a general Government deficit and then on II it says, "Ministers should prepare their pre-Budget Estimates proposals for 20[1]4, 2005 and 2006 on the basis of an overall reduction of [a half a million euros] in the costs of the Existing Level of Current Supply Services."  </p>  <p>               Now, this was in and around the time of the decentralisation and forth ... so forth.  I just want to move on to one, two, three, four pages later.  It's to the item, Background to Budget 2004.8.  It's at the very end of the page, yes, it's actually circled there.  All right.  And there it says:</p><blockquote>The 2004 budget will be prepared against a continuation of [a] more difficult international and domestic economic climate which has been present since the second half of 2001.  The period of exceptional economic growth enjoyed by Ireland is over.</blockquote> <p>Do you recall that sentence because when I read that it actually, kind of, came off the page quite loudly to me?  Do you recall this document?</p></speech>

It's the memorandum for Government that we produce every year in and around that time which starts the budgetary process.  So, I actually can't ...

Like, if one ... I haven't got them here but I'm sure if one looks at the percentage growth figures for GNP, GDP, for all the years since 2001, I'm sure that statement there as well that the exceptional economic growth that we had prior to that had lessened off.  But that was always going to be the situation.  There was no surprise about that.</p></speech>

Was this the culmination of that budget strategy, that from 2004 onwards, the surpluses were going to be based upon extraordinary cyclical measures, particularly those related with the property market, and that what is called 'the real economy' was no longer going to be able to sustain the expenditure that the Department of Finance would require?</p></speech>

So what we were trying to do in 2004 was to ... in that ... for June 2003, setting out the parameters for the next three budgets, to say, "Look, this is the background to the upcoming budget.  Growth has slowed down, we're not going to have these exceptional revenues that we had in the past, so we have to cut our expenditure cloth to meet these new circumstances."  That would have been the overall ... in fact there ... now in the Department of Finance and everybody else, we wouldn't ... we didn't have a big crystal ball and, like, so we could say what was going to happen in 2006.  And, by the way, everybody was understating the amount of housing that was being constructed.  Every time we were told from '98 onwards that we'll meet the housing target if we build, say, 25,000 houses a year and then 32,000, the figures kept exceeding that.  So, therefore, we were at all times saying, "Yes, anyway, well, the exceptional economic growth that's in a whole variety of areas - not just in construction - is going to slow down somewhat", and then we had the general economic background and a slowdown in the world economy in 2001 relating to the dotcom bubble collapse etc. etc. etc.</p></speech>

That ... by 2004 - and you're dead right - there was ... production in property and property investment continued and home ownership and all the rest continued afterwards.  But Mr. Wright, in his report, is very critical of there being no counter-cyclical measures as far back as 2000 and 2001 and in his physical presence and ... when he gave his testimony before this inquiry when the analogy of the red button being pressed, he said the red button should have been pressed at 2004 because the crisis was now commencing.  It wasn't the night of the guarantee was the crisis, it was the measures that came afterwards.  </p>  <p>               So given this information that you had to hand at that time, do you believe that anything extraordinary was required, or was it that there should just be a modest adjustment going into next year of &euro;500 million?</p></speech>

But actually the outturn, which I wasn't there for, the outturn of the budgetary surplus was very large in that particular year, 2004, and bigger, I think, again, in 2005 and 2006.</p></speech>

What Mr. Wright and maybe other commentators seem to be suggesting, that in those years a big economic, big budgetary surpluses, that the Government should have been saying to the people, "Oh no, instead of giving you rises in social welfare, child benefit, tax reductions, etc., etc., we want to be cutting back on you."  And as I said in my opening statement, does anyone think that that would be possible?  Or does anyone think it would be desirable either?  Either it would be certainly unacceptable politically, but I suggest it was unacceptably morally as well.  We have to ... imagine me standing up in the middle of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on budget night and saying, "We're going to have an enormous surplus this year, and a bigger one next year, and I'm going to cut back social welfare and I'm going to cut back tax reliefs, etc., etc., and I'm going to impose a whole lot of stringency measures."  And then some Opposition person would rightly say, "But you're putting aside an enormous amount of money to the pension reserve fund and you intend on putting forward more and reduce the debt even further."  Like, that type of reality is, like ... and if Mr. Wright or anybody else is suggesting that that is in the realms of political reality, he's wrong.</p></speech>

Cyclical taxes are in, kind of, layperson's term, a bit like overtime.  This is extra money you're earning, but you don't plan your household budget on overtime.  You might go out and buy a refrigerator, buy a Chinese on a Saturday night, or take a holiday on it, but you don't plan your week to week current expenditure upon overtime.  This is the difficulty with cyclical taxes.  So do you actually go in and say, "I've a load of overtime," to take your, kind of comparison, there, and say, "Well, I'm going to have this overtime forever"?</p></speech>

But I have outlined to you is that we were having considerable economic success, which gave us the resources to do certain things, which we could only dream about in previous decades.  I think the ... Professor Wright, or anybody else, who's ... when he's talking about counter-cyclical measures, what is he actually talking about?  What did he or other people want you to do?  Well, the only other thing that I can suggest to you is that you impose more taxation, lessen the amount you're spending on public services, withdraw thousands of people from the public service, and, like, what would that do?  And, by the way, other studies have been done which say if you were to have counter-cyclical measures that would maybe have an effect of maybe of a quarter of a percent on the harmonised inflationary index, you'd have to take about the best order of &euro;5 billion out of the economy.  That's not realistic in those years.  What we did in my last two budgets, I lessened considerably, as I gave my figures earlier, to the amount of tax change ... the tax package.  The social welfare package continued fairly good, but the tax package was very, very small.  And I think that was the reasonable, the politically correct thing to do, and the morally correct thing to do.</p></speech>

Well, now, let's look at it like this now, about buying an election with that.  I announced that for 2001.  And people could sign up from I think 1 May 2001 to 30 April 2002.  Now, I like credit as much as the next man, and to be given great credit for winning elections, I wouldn't be adverse to great commentary about this.  But, since 1969, the same Government had not been re-elected on any occasion.  </p>  <p>         So, this brilliance of mine, of the SSIA ... I was going to be able to ... even though I was taking the money out of people's pockets for putting aside, it was going to win the 2002 election for us, which ... and bring back the same Administration, which hadn't been done for the previous 30 odd years, and I was going to be able to look forward into my crystal ball to see we'll win the following election as well, because the following election people will be getting this particular money in their back pocket.  Now, much and all ... and, great and all, as I am, Deputy, and the great sage which I know I am, and which I ... well, I'm sure you'll give testament to yourself, I didn't plan it like that.  It just wasn't like that.  And any sane, sensible person that looks forward and says, we'll bring it in a budget, asking for the savings, before an election, which was going to come up anyway, he was going to win that election ... he was sure he was going to win that one, but not alone was he going to win that one after 33 years for the first time, he was going to win in five years' time as well.  I'm not that much of a genius.</p></speech>

I constructed the scheme in such a way that there was an exit tax ... so less the exit tax, which I presume came to &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million.  I don't know what it was.</p></speech>

That was the ... at the time.  And we ... I answered repeated questions in the D&aacute;il and said is that ... I didn't know what the uptake was going to be, but I hoped it was going to be the maximum amount possible.  In the end of the day, the first few months with ... many people didn't apply.  And, as usual, in Ireland, other places probably as well, everybody registered in the last two months or so.  If I remember correctly, there was about 1.17 million people originally signed up for it.  And, I think over the period of the five years, maybe 70,000 dropped off, or thereabouts.  I ... the scheme was ... it was an incentive scheme to get people to come back and save in very, very good times, the same as the State had been saving in the good times.  I'd been reducing the budget ... the overall national debt to a figure in the 30s, I set up the pension reserve fund, and ... so we were saving on behalf of the State, so, therefore, I think it was important ... people were getting used to all this money in their pockets and I decided that we'd have an incentive scheme to encourage people to save.  By the way, if you want to talk about counter-cyclical policies, Chairman, actually, that was a counter-cyclical policy because it took the order ... it must have taken in the order, over the five years ... if it cost &euro;2.5 billion, it must have taken in the order of &euro;10 or &euro;11 billion out of the economy over the five years.  So, therefore, I rest my case.  By the way-----</p></speech>

The Chairman spoke about the cyclical taxes.  Now you can count whichever taxes you wish to be cyclical or counter-cyclical.  The narrowing of the tax base, the reduction in the wealth taxes, the capital gains taxes, the transaction taxes and then the decreasing of the income tax.  Was he correct then and were you wrong?</p></speech>

The biggest transaction tax was stamp duty.  There was 0% stamp duty for first-time buyers of new houses, zero.  Regarding capital gains tax, I certainly reduced the rate of capital gains tax from 40% and we quintupled the amount of revenue coming in to the State.  The same happened to do with capital acquisitions tax as well.  And narrowing of the tax base, I didn't.  What I did was that I reduced an unfair burden at both rates of tax.  When I became Minister for Finance, the rates of tax were 26% and 48% and various other levies in between.  Well, anyway, I reduced it, as we said in our election programme from 26% to 20% and from 48% to 40% over my time as Minister of Finance.  I did most of that in the first three years.  I ... and from then on, in the last two budgets, all I did was increase the exemption limit to take the people on the minimum wage out of the tax net.  And if you look at the 2002 agreed programme for Government, you will notice that our programme for the next five years didn't specifically mention any more change in rates of taxation but said our goal was to have 80% of all taxpayers paying on the standard rate.  So we certainly reduced the rates of taxation, we widened the bands, we brought in the revolutionary concept of tax credits, which allowed a lot of different things to be done in the meantime, which hadn't been done previously and we made these particular ...  So I don't for a moment accept that we narrowed the tax base.  And some of those transaction taxes, the biggest one being stamp duty, we had a 0% stamp duty on new house purchases for first-time people.</p></speech>

In 1997, the expenditure, total capital and current, was &euro;18.8 billion.  Seven years later, it was almost &euro;41 billion.  Again the Chairman touched upon it but I'm touching upon it now.  A lot of it was based upon taxes that were going to come from the property sector, so long as the property sector kept going.  Deputy O'Donnell touched upon your change of mind in relation to the property-based taxes.  Had you any knowledge that when the property sector slowed down that there could only be a collapse in terms of because we had... the money had been given out on an annualised basis and had you any knowledge how difficult it is to reduce these numbers when the money is not available?</p></speech>

What I was taught the whole time, for years, that there was going to be, what became the famous phrase, "a soft landing", so there was no one in the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, or anywhere else, saying, "There's going to be a total collapse in the property sector."  Not just housing, but in all other sectors as well.  Nobody came along with that ... look, even the ESRI weren't predicting that as late as 2007, I think, never mind predicting it in 2003, 2004.</p></speech>

That was the only time that I can remember that ever there was any great, detailed discussion.  In fact, I remember, in all other years, that the stability update of the Commission and their comments, if you look, was very complimentary on Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>what they said about other countries so the answer to that question is &quot;No&quot;.</p></speech>

Going back to the financial arrangements, you call it the Dermot McCarthy compromise.  The memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator dealt with the responsibilities being divided between the Central Bank and the IFSRA.  Was there clarity on what should be dealt with by the regulator and was there an expectation that the Governor could exercise his rights under the memorandum of understanding and intervene with the regulator?</p></speech>

The ECB insisted that the Governor of the Central Bank had to be totally independent and they were ... they were only anxious at that time about that particular matter, more than anything else.  Mr. ... the structure that was set up would have ... the Governor to produce financial stability reports and I'm sure that there could have been interaction, as per the law, between him and the Financial Regulator, if the Financial Regulator brought to his attention any matters that he thought would compromise financial stability because the Act itself allowed that prudence was to be exercised and I'm sure there were sufficient powers there for the Governor to intervene if he thought so fit.</p></speech>

Nobody ... certainly ... maybe had a peremptory discussion at some stage, maybe with some of the officials about the increase in credit, but nobody was overtly concerned at that time because the Central Bank structure, including the regulator and the Governor, weren't saying, "There is a great danger of a desperate situation occurring here", at that time.

I'm not too certain about that, and I'll tell you why, for a number of reasons.  One of the reasons for the ... I would suggest that the banks here went very loose with their credit policy, were a number of factors, but one certainly was competition, and competition not just from the ... what we call the Irish banks but from outside as well.  And remember that, say, the Royal Bank of Scotland was involved here through their wholly-owned subsidiary.  The Bank of Scotland was also involved here, Rabo was also involved here.  And incidentally ... but they were regulated from their home base, and they ... Royal Bank of Scotland on their Irish operation, I read in the very recent past - you can correct me if I'm wrong - even though they never have announced fully the figures, have ... I think they've estimated that they lost something in the order of ... it's many, many billions, I've a figure ... I've ideas in the 20, in excess of 20.  Bank of Scotland probably the same.  Rabo who took over the ACC, very, very big figures as well.  And the regulator in their home jurisdiction didn't spot this collapse in the Irish economy as well, and a massive credit growth.  So I am not ... I can argue, I ... we can debate it, and you might be correct in some things could be put in place, but I actually don't see it like that because it was missed by there.  And by the way, in the United States, they missed AIG, Bear Sterns, Wachovia and a few others as well, you know what I mean?</p></speech>

It's a desire that is very well worthwhile, that we'd have the same principles for accounting worldwide.  Americans use US GAAP,  that's general accounting accepted principles.  Irish and UK used to use Irish GAAP.  And there always has been a move since the '60s to try and have an internationally accepted standard the way we look at accounts, whether it be in Australia, America, Ireland, whatever, you'd be interpreting the same thing.  The IASB, the International Accounting Standards Board, was set up in the '60s and it's funded from a variety of independent sources. They started to produce then IAS standards over the years.  The European Commission decided in 2002 that they would endorse IFRS the new standards - International Financial Reporting Standards.  And the European Commission, even though not a member of the IASB, which is totally independent, adopted all these particular standards, and public companies had to apply these IFRS standards as and from, I think the accounts starting January 2007.  </p>  <p>         Those particular standards, some people ... those particular standards generally use mark-to-market.  They all said there were some difficulties over standards, IAS2 and 39.  And all these difficulties, some people would say, is that ... contributed somewhat to the financial crisis internationally but Ireland ... Ireland was ... Ireland was the one country, the same as all the other member states, bar one, who had ... who implemented exactly what the new regulation was.  So the accounting professionals have been before the ... before the committee here, but they were doing their accounts on the basis of IFRS and there are certainly some anomalies in the IFRS standards which may have contributed globally to some of the financial problems and particularly in the EU.  But that's a matter you can discuss with some accountants rather than me.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1462" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charlie McCreevy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#OOO00300"><p>I think, Deputy, we ... Senator, we could have a discussion maybe another day over this.  There'll be a whole variety of reasons.  I said ... I mentioned earlier about low interest rate policies but if I can say one thing about ... I said competition among the banks, which we all thought, in Ireland, was a very good thing.  And, as you rightly have ... over your long career as an academic have advocated competition, and competition is a good thing, but in certain areas, too much competition can be a very bad thing because you can't compete to the lower base, financial products being one of them.  Auditing on price can be a bad thing as well because you can compete all the time on price for auditing ... you may end up with a very, very low base.  So, therefore, competition has been recognised as being a very good thing and, as you well know, all of my political career I have been pro-competition, but in certain areas it can lead to these problems and, as I said earlier, the competition, not alone among Irish banks, but banks from the outside contributed to the lessening of credit standards being applied by banks.</p>  <p>  And one final thing, may I say, if I was to ... from my experience in Brussels, and looking across what happened in the financial sector throughout Europe and throughout the world, the remuneration policies of financial institutions have led, in my view, to a lot of these difficulties.  Very ... we'll make it very simple, here is bank A over here, led by a very conservative chairman, chief executive, lending officers etc., in business for 60 years, doing a nice ... doing a nice dividend at the end of the year for their shareholders.  Along comes bank B over here, bright new sparks, new chief executive, incentivisation and bonus shares etc. etc.  Profits keep going up and up and up.  Every year at their annual meeting, old Mr. Fogey over here, "Why aren't your profits going up and up compared to bank B over here?"  What happens, out is turfed conservative Mr. A and his team.  In come a whole lot of new whizz kids anyway and they're going to compete for more and more business, because they are being remunerated on results.  And everybody's being remunerated on results, including the Government.  The Government is being remunerated because they're going to get increased taxation and corporate taxation plus PAYE etc. etc.  The shareholders are going to get more and more dividends.  The employees are going to get more wages and more salaries and more bonuses baked in share schemes.  And this cycle keeps going.  And if you were to look across the world, not just Ireland, you will see that is one common denominator.  Now, I'm making a comment, which I probably didn't intend to do, because it's post my time as Minister for Finance. </p></speech>

So before asking you ... you've given your opinion and so on but what kind of struck me when I was reading your statement is that you described it as an independent body funded from a variety of sources.  Do you know what the sources are?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charlie McCreevy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#OOO00900"><p>Well, they're ... they got money from various independent bodies around the world because they were ... they didn't take any money from the EU Commission, for example, or any government organisation.  They had very eminent people involved with them, such as Mr. Paul Volcker and people like that, because they want to be seen to be clearly independent because, you see, they would see it and rightly so that, you know ... that you shouldn't have influence in setting accounting standards from anybody, that it should speak definitively, coldly, etc., etc.  </p>  <p>         So they fund themselves.  They got ... you see they don't need an awful lot of money to keep going.  But the small amount of money, so they've always guarded their independence jealously.  But ... and they have a wide consultation process, they don't come up in the middle of the night and say "We're having a standard here."  They go through an exhausting operation that might go on two or three years.  And bodies from all over the world are represented in various fora there.  And the process they go through is exhaustive, could go on for three or four years and everybody gets a chance to comment about it.  But, I just ... some people have commented that some of the IFRS standards have contributed to this.</p></speech>

Are you aware that their biggest funders are the four biggest accountancy firms, PwC, KPMG, E and Y, and Deloitte, who last year contributed $2.5 million each.  Ireland's Central Bank and Financial Services Authority gave &pound;6,000 sterling.  So how independent are they actually, given that the agencies that are carrying out the tasks are funding the structure that does the regulation?  So, given your statement that you're saying they are independent, given that funding structure-----</p></speech>

I'm only commenting on it because ... I, for completeness, I was asked in my ... direction as to influence of outside bodies from Europe etc. etc.  And I thought I should mention it because there are people that have this view.  You'd have to ask the IASB, but you must remember, this whole accounting standards thing is not something that was ever run by a government.  No government came along to ... like in the 1960s, '70s, '80s, '90s to say, "We want independent accounting standards."  This body came ... was a body that came about itself from the accountancy bodies from day 1 ... that they say, "Look, worldwide we should have the same accounting standards."</p>  <p>  But what gave it great momentum was, in Europe, was the EU decided that we will recognise this, the independence of this body, and we will put this into effect by issuing a directive and regulation and that's what gave them their strength.  They didn't come along to us in Europe and say, "You have to do this."</p>  <p>  Now by the way, the United States had signed up to do this as well, but until the time that I left office in Brussels, they hadn't actually put all of it into effect.  So they were, it's not ... to be fair to this body, this IASB, it's not ... it was never a government that said "We'll have an independent accounting standards body."  This body grew up itself from, there was a, quite a famous individual in the '60s who had this idea for years and he kept pushing it and pushing it, and ... it is a very, very good idea that there would be one international set of accounting standards.  But ... therefore it's an idea that came from the professions and the accountancy bodies, it's not an idea that came from any government.</p></speech>

Was there clarity in what should be dealt with by the regulator and was there an expectation that the Governor would invoke his rights under the memorandum of understanding and intervene with the Financial Regulator, and did this ever happen?</p></speech>

I think the memorandum of understanding was agreed by ... was ... came about due to Europe intervening.  For a long number of years, in ECOFIN Councils, there had been debates about a cross-border banking crisis, and finally in the middle 2000s  they agreed anyway we'd have memorandums of understanding for cross-border financial institutions, and that's were the memorandums of understanding came from.  Then in Ireland, I think in 2005, 2006, but you can check this record, but post my time in any event ... the domestic standing group was set up, which incorporated the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the Department of Finance and-----</p></speech>

Was there an expectation, when you were putting this architecture together that the Governor would, at some stage if required, invoke his rights under the memorandum of understanding?</p></speech>

Mr. McCreevy, during your tenure as Minister, there were obviously the difficulties that arose around Ansbacher and also the DIRT inquiry and in 2001-2002, the problems with Allfirst, the AIB subsidiary.  I'm not asking you to elaborate on any of those matters; what I am asking you to do, is to say ... is to tell us why, in your own statement to us today, you said, "It was never contemplated as to the remotest possibility that any Irish bank could fail."</p></speech>

The only time, in my political career, that I can think of when that danger was about was around 1985 or so when the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, had run into some difficulty and the ICI, or AIB, came to the then Government and asked them to take some measures because they, if I remember correctly, thought that the financial stability of AIB could be put at risk.  I don't remember, since that time, and certainly not during my period, that anybody ever had the remotest possibility of thinking that any Irish financial institution, like mainly the major banks, was going to collapse.  In fact the ... in fact, it was totally the opposite.  Both of the major banks were having ... announcing enormous profits every year and enormous dividends and accordingly going from strength to strength.</p></speech>

You raise a good point.  You've mentioned about Ansbacher and those three things, and the one ... from another angle, that did impinge upon the thinking leading up to the financial ... the single regulator and the structure.  Because there was ... if I ... we had National Irish Bank and the overcharging scandal there; we had the Ansbacher issue regarding tax issues; we had the Allfirst thing somewhat later with the ... that was outside of the State so it's probably unfair to mention that in the same area; and there were some other ones as well.  And all of that, the criticism the whole time, both in the D&aacute;il and in the commentary was that the Central Bank, as constituted, was not up to the mark.  And also there was an all-party committee sat back in those days as well and they, more or less, said the same thing.  And out of that, the idea came then, we'll have a single regulatory authority and out of that then came this great debate that went on as to where it should be located.  And from that also the whole debate was about consumer protection ... in fact, if you read the commentary at the time and including the McDowell report, there was nothing but praise for the prudential regulatory section of the Central Bank.  All of the discourse was on the consumer angle which all of those things are.  And they are very important.  And I think ... I haven't been able to find it before I came to this committee, but you'll find, I think, at the committee, where I said, when I was being harangued by certain Deputies who are still in the House, about not doing anything about this ... I think I did make the comment, saying, "Well, I think actually Mary Jones would be actually more worried about her deposit in the bank and keeping the bank from going under than the extra &euro;3 that she might have been charged incorrectly."</p></speech>

I applied to Irish Nationwide Building Society, sorry myself and my wife applied for Irish Nationwide Building Society, for a loan.  In all, I got many loans personally over the years from many people, and I only got one ever before for Irish Nationwide in 1984 - 1985 when I neither was a Minister or had been a Minister at that particular time.  I was elected in '77, I just applied for it in the normal way and in 2006 I applied for it in the normal way because I had a relationship with that particular institution.  It was got nothing to do with ... I could do.  </p>  <p>         I was out of Finance at the time.  I was in the European Commission and there was nothing to do with Irish Nationwide or anything else.  In all my years getting loans, some for myself, but mostly during my time as a partner in an accountancy firm, I would have got hundreds of loans or facilities for clients of mine from all types of institutions, and individuals, I never, ever, in all those years, ever knew it to be the job of the borrower to know what the processes were of the lender as to how he was going to get the loan.  All I ever did, for either clients or myself, was to apply, and we received the loan.</p></speech>

In relation to the cost of tax expenditures, and I know you've discussed this with other members, according to the OECD, by 2005 the cost of tax expenditures had become larger than the remaining income tax receipts.  This is in the Regling and Watson report, page 27:</p><blockquote>As a percentage of total tax revenue, tax expenditures in Ireland are more than three times larger than on average in the EU.  Again, this excessive reliance on tax relief narrowed the tax base.  In addition, it contributed - again - to the property bubble, as some of the tax relief was directed to the property sector.</blockquote>  <p>So, I just want to know, because you said earlier on, Mr. McCreevy, that there had been tax breaks, if you like, in Ireland for 50 years.  And I've no doubt that that's true.  All I'm saying is that the OECD's observation was that by 2005, they were way higher than in any other country, and they were narrowing the tax base and they led to a property bubble.</p></speech>

It's not primarily to give a tax break to individuals, but to stimulate investment in the area, which is lacking such investment, and I referred to it quite considerably during my opening statement.  Now much of the commentary in recent years, and I note that during the inquiry, the little I've looked at, that the Senator seems to concentrate totally on the tax foregone and very little credit is given for the economic activity created.  There were tens and tens and tens of thousands of jobs created in the construction and other ancillary jobs.  There were hundreds and billions collected in PAYE-PRSI, etc., etc.  Now, there seems to be just an over-concentration in all of those years as to, "What is the tax foregone?"  And also, a, kind of, belief, well it's tax foregone, but it really isn't tax foregone because if the incentive wasn't there-----</p></speech>

So, therefore, there wouldn't be any tax foregone in any particular thing.  It's a tax break, to give to ... in order to allow activity to take place, as I said in my opening address, in areas where it wouldn't take place, or if it did take place, it would be too little, too late.  Yes, like when the more uptake there is, the more tax there'll be foregone.  But yes, there'll be more and more people employed and yes there'll be more and more taxation.  Like the question to Deputy, or Senator D'Arcy about the SSIAs; the more people took them up, the greater the income tax foregone was going to be, but the benefit to the people who took up the SSIAs have lasted until the present day.  So on your question, Deputy, there is certainly tax foregone, the greater the activity there would be in any sector.  By the way ... but there seems to be an ideological bias against some type of tax incentive related to the construction sector.</p></speech>

Sorry Mr. MacSharry, or Mr. McCreevy, could I reframe the question for you?  The question has been put that there was over-stimulation of tax incentives in the property sector; it wasn't that there was an incentive here to get something going, the broader sector, residential, commercial, above the shop, parking schemes, student accommodation, there was a litany of stimulation taking place there.  So there was a menu of numbers.  The question has been put to you, if I can come back to Senator O'Keeffe ... it's in that context that the question has been made.  There's a plethora of tax incentivisations, all property-related.</p></speech>

And as I said, the greater the take-up, the greater it would have been the cost.  But the greater the benefit there was as well.  There comes a time, Deputy, unquestionably I agree with you, there comes a time, as we had a debate earlier with Deputy O'Donnell, when you have to cut off these particular reliefs and say, "Well, we've done enough now at this area, so it can get on by itself."  And there is a debate, and you can have an argument about whether you should do it, whether it's too late or whatever.  I accept that as a kind of general kind of point.  But that is a point of view and you must take an opinion at a particular time and a view at a particular time when it is time to close them off.</p></speech>

And the Government of which I was member ... all of the initiatives that we took place before Bacon, post Bacon was to try and increase the supply in the belief that in any other area when you increase supply, the price of the product falls down.  That was ... various measures that we took place were all intended to increase the supply in that, maybe somewhat mistaken belief, which maybe proves that in this particular sector, the normal laws of supply and demand did not take place and the reason that my colleague, the then Minister for housing, I think it was Deputy Robert Molloy, initiated the first Bacon study.  I think there might have been studies by Goodbody Economic Consultants as well but someone else can check that ... is that was on this belief is that the first-time buyer and the ordinary person on the average industrial wage and people starting off with young families or whatever, couldn't get on the housing ladder.  We may not have ... Deputy, you're correct, we definitely did not succeed for a lot of that period, but that was the intention, you can take it from me.</p></speech>

And for example, an 11-acre site in Stillorgan was bought in 2000 by a group of very wealthy individuals, sat on for four years and sold for &euro;85 million in 2004.  A &euro;53 million speculative gain on which apartments were to be built which would cost each young person buying, maybe &euro;120,000 extra, just as a result of that gain.  Mr. McCreevy, can I ask you, is it fair to describe that as inordinate greed and can you justify doing nothing to curb that profiteering and how do you justify the fact that your cuts in capital gains tax put an extra &euro;10.5 million into the pockets of those speculators?</p></speech>

It was the market ... in the ... I know Deputy Higgins doesn't accept the principles of the free market.  He has another view, which I have always respected.  I don't ... I am a free marketeer and I make no secret about it.  It was the market that decided those particular issues.  I certainly ... but I want to tell you the <i>modus vivendi</i>of all Government initiatives in the housing area and all these other matters was to increase supply in the belief - mistaken as you might contend it was - that the more supply that we put in place, that the price of housing would stabilise and come down.  And if you go back and see all of the studies from '97 onwards predicting what the proper number of houses that would be completed the following year and what was the proper number to take account of the population of the country, they were understating it by zillions.  Like, there was ... I think the number of units completed in the last year before the crash was something like 90,000 or whatever.  But you would have thought a long time earlier - due to the measures we put in place to increase supply - that some sync would have occurred between the price of property ... the price of housing and the market would take account of that, which would've allowed the people that you represent get their foot in the housing ladder.</p></speech>

I actually ... I think it is common knowledge that developers are close both ... to the major political parties.  That's very obvious.  Like, the major political parties, until the recent election, represented maybe upwards of 75% to 80% of the electorate since more or less 1930.  So, therefore, it would be expected that developers and the builders would come from that large constituency from both parties.  I personally am not close to any of the builders.  I know lots of builders and know lots of tradesmen and I know lots of accountants, I know lots of punters, I know lots of other kinds of people.  I know lots of politicians, or I used to in any event.</p>  <p>  And in regarding the Galway tent, I find the whole thing about the Galway tent a bit disingenuous and I think so ... I've always thought so about through the years.  It was a big social event, right.  There were not just builders in the Galway tent.  In fact, I didn't attend that often because I found it a terrible pain in the backside because I'm a punter and people know I am a punter and like a bet and I used to have to put in my time and decide one day to go into this bloody tent.  And most of the people ... what ... the biggest thing I remember of the Galway tent was, if people want to know ... was one thing anyway, you would be inundated for about three weeks previously, or my office would be, with loads of journalists wanting a freebie into the Galway tent in order to get plenty of drink and food.  That's the more thing I remember about it and that definitely was a pain in the backside to me as well.</p></speech>

The first Bill in 2002, the Central Bank Financial Services [Regulatory] Authority [of Ireland] Bill in 2002 set up the structure and all things relating thereto.  During the course of that debate, I signalled that I would be bringing forward a second Bill that was going to do other things.  The second Bill we did in 2003.  That second Bill dealt with things like administrative sanctions, penalties, set up the Financial Services Ombudsman, did a whole lot of things like that.  So, in the second Bill in 2003, there were adequate legislative measures put in place to do all of things to do with penalties, sanctions, etc., etc., and that's what the purpose of the second Bill was in 2003, and that was done.</p>  <p>  I can't ... I'm not in a position to know as to how that was implemented post my leaving the Department of Finance.  There always would have been, even pre the old Acts, before we had a new structure ... there would have been provision in the Central Bank Act of 1942, as amended on many occasions, for that type of sanctions and penalties.  Panels have to be set up, and the lawyers around here will know it, and you had to, the minute ... one of the jobs of the Minister for Finance was to publish a list of ... the panel lists that would be ... banks could appeal some of the decisions of the regulator.  So, therefore, there were always provisions for sanctions and penalties in the old Central Bank Act, and in the new Acts as well.</p></speech>

It certainly has, and I agree with you on this, brought the whole way of how the capitalist system works, in particular, how the financial institutions work or didn't work, how regulation works or didn't work, but, having said all that, I'm not a believer ... is that the alternative of ... solutions that you've advocated since we were both students a long, long time ago, I don't think that is a solution either.

It's the first ... and I'm not trying to cut you short, but I'm down to seven minutes.  It's the first document that I have found relating to the SSIAs.

They were ... the general idea was floating about, and then I came along with what became the SSIA scheme.  As I said, in reply to an earlier question a long ... some hours ago, is that, we ... we decide ... decided to having the ... an incentive scheme for savers for the reasons I so outlined, to encourage people, in the very good times, to do what the State was doing, put money aside for an essential day.</p></speech>

This is the SSIA ... you can have daring views as to its impact.  You said it had a counter-cyclical impact.  It might have had in the short term, in the longer term, because it was a five-year scheme, it arguably didn't have a counter-cyclical impact because there was an increase in expenditure.  We've had evidence from David Doyle, from John FitzGerald, from other witnesses that the major increase in lending to property took place in or around the years just preceding or just following when the SSIAs came to fruition.  And I'm asking you about why you didn't do that analysis.</p></speech>

Is that, when the money became available to the SSIA person in 2006-2007, my ... I would think that most of the money was ... people didn't rush off and start buying houses with it.  Some did; some used it as a deposit which ... I remember saying in the D&aacute;il at the time that would be a good thing, whatever they were going to do, maybe some did.  My own view is that the majority of people spent a little of it, did whatever they wanted to do, maybe send children to school, tuition, holiday or whatever.  A lot of them kept a good bulk of the money there.  But it can't ... so, and it was counter-cyclical, if you want to argue about that, because they were taking at least &euro;2.5 billion out of the economy every year, so we can't ... the two ends of this thing.</p></speech>

In November 2000 your own officials, according to a memo revealed to <i>The Irish Times</i>on 6 May 2002, stated the following about the scheme, and I want to quite it directly, &quot;Given the uncertain effectiveness of tax incentives for savings, the potential cost and significant deadweight, the provision of tax relief for capital investment in medium-term savings schemes is not recommended.&quot;  Now, that's a very strong statement from your officials at the time.

I think I was because the amount of money that was put into the SSIAs accounts, it gave a nest egg for ordinary ... ordinary decent people such as you represent in Carlow-Kilkenny and Deputy Higgins represents in Dublin.  To go into an SSIA, all you had to do was &euro;10 per month ... per month, which wasn't a pint of stout per week extra and people participated because they saw it as a simple, good scheme.  And that applies from Mulhuddart all the way to Graiguenamanagh and all the way to Letterkenny as well.  And it worked out well and people appreciated it more than any other issue that was done over the last 15 years - ordinary people.  I don't actually expect that most of the big financiers were ... actually participated in the SSIAs but the ordinary Joe Soap and Mary Jones definitely did.</p></speech>

I don't operate like that, Deputy.  I spent 15 years on the backbenches of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I thought I'd be continuous to stay on the backbenches of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I got my chance at government given to me by Albert Reynolds and more or less I was on the Front Bench and Minister for the second half of my career.  I enjoyed my time in the backbenches as well but probably caused a fair amount of mischief to my own party more than anything else.  Certainly, the late Mr. Haughey would think like that anyway, but ... and I got my chance as Minister for Finance, and I always thought if I ever got the chance at being a Government Minister that I was going to approach every day as if it was going to be my last day there.</p></speech>

Can I put an assertion to you, Mr. McCreevy, that the ingredients of what would eventually become a major crisis were very much in place by the autumn of 2004.  For example, there was a rapid expansion of the balance sheets of the banks in the two or three years leading up to the end of your tenure.  </p>  <p>               There was a growing dependence on property lending by the banks at that time, a growing dependence on wholesale funding from the international market.  The states were becoming increasing dependent on transaction taxes and, from 2001, current expenditure was growing at a faster rate than nominal GDP every year and there was a distinct lack ... or, loss of competitiveness from 2000-2001.  Now, all of those elements, it could be argued, certainly accelerated after your tenure but do you accept that those ingredients were in place when you departed Merrion Street in the autumn of 2004?</p></speech>

I didn't and there's no point kind of speculating on it.  I would have ... I certainly have recognised since I left, and looking at the figures from 2003, 2004 to 2007, that there was massive increases in the property lending area, which I alluded to earlier.  I have dealt earlier with the questions of increases in Government expenditure, both capital and current, and given you the figures as a percentage spend on GNP.  If you like, I can give you other figures relating to what the spend was in various years.  So I think that, all in all, that what was ... in the time that I was Minister of Finance, I am quite happy that I dealt with the issues as presented to me.  If it became very obvious some of the things that have occurred since my time there in Finance, I'm not too sure as to what actions I would have taken or whatever but there's no point ... there's no point ... you do what you do when you're there.  There's no point in speculating what you would have done when you weren't there.  So I regard that as a total futility for me to be speculating about that.  I think that the changes that we brought about in the Irish economy, the things that we done, were all very, very worthwhile.</p></speech>

You must remember the economy was expanding at a very fast rate, the population was increasing, there was greater demand for services, which were going to cost more.  You can't have a good medical service, a good education service without people, and people cost money.  So, therefore, if you want to do things in the big areas of public expenditure ... do something worthwhile in those areas, then you have to put the resources, and that's what we did.  At the same time, we ran ... the biggest thing we could have done was to keep reducing the national debt.  I was in the House here, Deputy McGrath, when the national debt was 122% of GNP, when the country was practically bankrupt and we never thought we'd get out of it.  And we did, and we saw the percentage debt-to-GDP ratio coming down, which freed up massive resources, because we didn't have interest payments to be paid to all the money that we had borrowed, and that allowed other ... that money to be used for worthwhile social purposes.</p></speech>

By the way, there seems to be a body of opinion that seems to suggest, well, maybe we shouldn't have got unemployment down to 4%, maybe the safer rate for the economy was 6%, 7% or 8%.  Maybe it was done too quickly.  Well, I don't subscribe to that at all.  So you're going to tell the ... the people that have that theory seem to advocate that Joe Smith, "Well, Joe, you should stay there - you're unemployed and stay unemployed."  And "Mary Jones, you don't have to go to work, you stay in the home and don't come out to work, you could bury income," whatever the case may be.  And we'll keep you at that level, 8% unemployment - that's better for the economy, because some whizz kid economist or some theoretician belonging to some think tanks-----</p></speech>

And I said in my first budget in December 1997, that I wanted my ... the first lines of my first budget were that they should ... that I want to be judged over the period of the five budgets that this Government was going to bring in, and that all those ... and in many interviews afterwards I said, it had to be judged in the totality.  And as I said earlier, in my, in the five budgets that I introduced between '98, '99, 2000, 2001 and 2002 and then 2003, 2004, the total income tax and PRSI package came to &euro;5,607 million-----</p></speech>

The taxation ... decisions on the budget are made separately, or they were in my time.  We made them but certainly in ... within ... I dealt with spending and culminating in the publication in November of the Abridged Estimates Volume setting out the Estimates for the following year.  And then I dealt with the taxation package mostly on budget day.  The Government has gone back ... or has for some years now to have a unified system, of announcing about tax and expenditure changes on the one day and it's all done together.  That was actually done some previously ... all the years up until about, I think, my predecessor, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, might have got into the form I followed in 1996 ... having a separate process, or maybe I did it myself, I just can't remember that.  So ... the ... we then went along then ... the memorandum was put to Government and you can note that all years bar the Estimates, bar the memorandum for 2003, that the spending figures for all years, except for 2003, the figure in the budget day or the Abridged Estimates Volume was less than ever and I think that's the first time, someone has told me, in the history of the State that has occurred.  </p>  <p>         Is that we didn't ... we must ... I'm sure it's ... I can't say it's the same now, but it I ... it may just be.  When the Minister for Finance sets out in budgets in his memorandum in the middle of the year, he's trying to get the process started.  He's trying to get some law and order on the figures because every Department will come back immediately with gigantic figures, so if you didn't start the process by putting some guidelines down what the totality will be, you'll always be beaten up by the various Departments, and that I'm sure has occurred long before my time and probably occurs to this day as well.</p></speech>

That speaks for itself.  But I'm also saying quite openly, anyway, is the Department of Finance would say, "If we don't get this process started and put down some particular figures into these boxes we'll never get any type of order when it comes to the final Estimates."   Because when ... the Estimates demands that come from Departments are usually ginormous and way above our ... the indicative allocations.  And that was the situation every year during my term and pre my time and post my time and the only year where I got something different was in 2003 when I actually went lower than the figure that the Department wanted to.  By the way, I know that in some of the earlier evidence of the committee is that the Department contended after my 2003, 2004 budgets, is that the line Departments were complaining that I had left them at least &euro;2.1 billion short in the moneys that they needed to provide for existing services.  I accept that as well because I went in 2003 and 2004 in very, very heavily on Departments in order to get back to a better baseline for the future.  That's what I did.</p></speech>

We used to have the broad economic policy guidelines which are, kind of, recommendations in a, kind of, a way.  I know things will be slightly changed now in the last two years or so.  You don't ... so, therefore, you don't have what you'd have in a normal, say, country like Ireland, the United Kingdom, America, Germany, whatever, where all those things are melded together.  So, therefore, you have a currency; you have the individual member states running their own economic policies; you have various differences between cultures and everything else; and, yet, you're supposed to run a single currency.<br/><br/>Now, before we set up the euro ... for example, there were five criteria that countries or member states were supposed to meet before they joined. One was inflation; one was the 3% debt - the 3% debt every year; one was the total debt ratio which meant that every country was supposed to have a debt-to-GDP ratio of less than 60%.  There were two others as well about that you had to ...  your currency was supposed to have stayed within a band, I think, not greater than 2.25% of the central ... and I forget the last one.  Incidentally, Ireland was one of the few countries to meet all of those criteria.  Sorry, inflation was the last one.  In the inflation one ... that you weren't supposed to be, I think, more than 2%, or less than 2%, outside the average of the three lowest countries and, actually, Ireland was one of the three lowest countries.  Ireland had a debt ratio less than 60%.  <br/><br/>Now, some countries that were allowed to join the euro, like a founding member state of the European Union like Italy, had a debt ratio of 100% where all ... the country where all the struck ... all the bodies are, Belgium, has a debt ratio of over 100 % as well, so that was a long way from 60%, but, lo and behold, <i>mirabile dictu, </i>the 60% absolute rule that the German Government had insisted upon in negotiations then came to be interpreted as &quot;approaching 60%&quot;.  So, therefore, the Italian Government was approaching 60% because I think the ratio came from 114% one year to 110% and the Belgian Government did something similar.</p></speech>

But the Irish Government and the Irish political parties, after all considerations of everything, and we were a very small player picking up less than about 2% of the EU's GDP at the time, we decided, in our long-term best interests, it was better to be in.  And the most worrying factor for us at the time was not actually all those other areas because we more or less thought we were doing very well in those other criteria.  But our main worry at the time, both my party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, we were going to join knowing that the United Kingdom was staying out.  So, therefore, from day 1 the structures were a bit less ... sorry, the foundations were less than certain.</p></speech>

From 1997 on, exports were decreasing, so as a proportion of national income, it was transaction based taxes that were beginning to drive things.

I would have debated with myself and with others the whole interest ... the tool of interest rate that a central bank has, and we're going to give that away.  But I concluded, and I think rightly, that for a small country like Ireland, although we had the interest rate tool available to us since the foundation of the State, what difference ... what great thing did it do for us?  </p>  <p>         Effectively, for all that period of time, we followed... went along in the ... London.  And up until 1979 or so we had a one-for-one exchange rate but, generally then, even in the interest rates after that, we more or less followed after London.  So we ... so although we had the interest rate tool available to us for all these years, it didn't seem to have done an awful lot to grow the Irish economy, give or take, say the glorious period in the '60s.  So, therefore, I kind of ... I came to the view that losing the interest rate tool at the time was not the worst thing that could happen.  Subsequently, I would look back on, say, what happened from, say, 2003 to 2008 and I would've said, "Well, if we had the interest rate tool then, that it might have made a whole big difference."  But like that's ... now I'm going back and I must chastise myself because I'm now doing Mr. Hindsight as well, the same as the rest of the country.</p></speech>

I mean, do we have to say "Look, it's about what we need to do rather than what's going to buy us the votes," for want of a better expression?</p></speech>

But they're not against one another, the fact that a politician wants to be re-elected and doing the right thing.  Like, I gave various examples earlier of things that we had done which couldn't have had the political impact in the short term of a positive nature.  So, I think, look, a democracy such as Ireland is less, well, nearly 100 years now.  I'm sure things ... the way we do things now are different to the way of doing 60 years ago and hopefully we learn all the time and do things somewhat differently and improve things.  I think that's what we're all about.  We might disagree about how doing it, we certainly disagree on economic philosophies ... the way of doing things.  I don't have any difficulty with people that stand up for a strong view, such as Deputy Higgins, and I have said that publicly when I was a Member of D&aacute;il Eireann.  I would like to think the same right exists for people like me to have strong views, not of the same type.</p></speech>

And I'm going to wrap up and then invite both Deputy Doherty and Deputy Murphy to come in and it's on that very point, as to what the essence of a liberal is, and on your earlier engagement with Deputy Higgins about the free market and so forth is where I maybe would like to begin the wrap-up.  I maybe put the question to you, Mr. McCreevy, and it comes back to my earlier engagement with you today that was demonstrating the residential house prices and the period in which the Bacon report was most active and how that was actually playing out in the market.  So, could I maybe begin by putting a question to you?  Is the property market entirely free and neutral, given that when tax interventions take place, they do have an impact in the market in one capacity or another?</p></speech>

I refer to what Deputy Noonan said back many years ago when I brought in that, there'll be an unintended consequences and there can be.  So ... by the way, not just he said that, I said it subsequently some years later during the D&aacute;il debates.  There can be ... yes, you have an effect but you can have unintended effects also.</p></speech>

You must remember, we increased stamp duty dramatically and left it at zero, it went to zero for the first-time buyer and we increased stamp duty enormously, up to 9%, which is a fair old hike, anyway, and it had damn all effect on the housing market or very little.</p></speech>

We tried to penalise, if that's the appropriate phrase I should use, the investors and benefit, by having lower rates of stamp duty, for the first-time buyer.  That's what we attempted to do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1785" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charlie McCreevy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#FFFF01800"><p>Well, that's the same argument, Deputy, that you can make and justifiably so, with grants.  Like, when you give grants to new houses or things like that over the years, in fact, it's built in, or new grants for anything in areas of construction, it's built in then to the price, it's taken up by the person that's doing the job or building the house or selling the house.  There's always that particular difficulty.  </p>  <p>         What we tried to do with stamp duty and I made so many changes that we made ... I made quite a simple system that I started off with into a very complicated one and my goal all the time in all the years of taxation were to make things simple because I think that's the best way to get the maximum amount of money from any area.  You'd have a very simple system and a very transparent one.  But what happened in the stamp duty area to do with price we were trying give a benefit and trying to skew the market in favour of the first-time buyer.  It just didn't work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1787" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#GGGG00200"><p>So that comes back to whether it was the first-time buyer or whether it was people trying to buy a home and trading up and trading down or whatever.  And if I can bring up the next slide there.  What we see in that slide is the ratio of new house prices to the average industrial wage and the ratio of average second hand prices to the average industrial wage.  And we see it, they are the kind of more or less ... you can nearly put one on top of the other for both markets.  In 1996, the purchasing range is in and around just over four times the national industrial wage for somebody trying to buy a home which would be in the Central Bank's sort of ratio levels, and likewise for the new market, it is just over 4%.  And going into 2007, we are seeing ratios of 12 times or so the national industrial wage in trying to buy the average sort of house.  In that regard, Mr. McCreevy, in reviewing your tenure as Minister for Finance and the property-related tax measures that you implemented or increased or elongated or put off by means of deferral, do you think that these actions benefitted one sector of society over the other and, if one, which?</p></speech>

But there are other ratios that you can use as well, such as affordability.  People had more money in their pockets due to less taxation, greater money, etc.  So there are other ways of measuring that.  But at the end of the day, Chair, whether we like it or we certainly ... and maybe we don't, it is the market that spoke.  The price of houses went up, people were prepared to buy them at the prices they went up to.  Banks were prepared to lend at ratios which turned out to be, later on, weren't so good for the banks either.  So therefore, the ... now there are various-----</p></speech>

The market spoke and from our earlier questioning, we know that the market is not neutral, that the market takes direction from the tax incentives put in place.  The market was speaking loud and clear that affordability levels were running beyond the capacity of people in this country.  To be able to buy a home in ratios of four to five and you are dead right, Mr. McCreevy, whenever we talk about affordability as well.  Because what we have found since the crash, it's not actually people losing their jobs that has been the main difficulty in terms of them servicing their mortgages and the Keane report is very explicit in this, it has been their affordability to be able to service their mortgage.  So I put the question to you again, do you think your actions as Minister for Finance either impacted on one section of society more than the other, favoured one side of society over the other or had legacy issues that related in terms of hardship or benefit to one side?</p></speech>

And it certainly allowed people to move up the property ladder if they so wish.  What some of these issues about affordability relate to is the ratios which the lending institutions decided to operate.  What the regulator was doing about same.  I read interestingly enough, with the regulator that he seemed to, that he did increase as far as I can make out the ... their issues of risk-related assets of what he was imposing upon the banks.  That didn't seem to have any effect either and I referred to earlier different things that I believe contributed to the whole chasing one another.  But I don't ... I find it hard to believe that things such as that the park ... tax incentivisation ... regarding, say, things like park and ride schemes, small towns renewal, docklands relief, enterprise only, another, contributed say to housing-----</p></speech>

It was in around the period I'm talking about.  The tax relief that was given to investors of residential property gave a more favourable position to somebody who in terms of tax relief who was actually trying to buy a home or if they were trying to trade up or whatever.  </p>  <p>               So the mortgage for an investor in the buy-to-let sector was cheaper for a mortgage than a person who was trying to buy a home through the tax reliefs.  Now, if somebody was competing in the market to buy a home, and you have a first-time buyer or an existing homeowner trying to trade up, they're competing with somebody who has an additional edge on them because their tax relief is actually greater.</p></speech>

I say that you should go and, say, have an investigation or a study into, say, the housing ...the number of houses that were sold during that particular period on which there was any tax relief given at all.  You must remember, and I should have referred to this earlier, the biggest change in doing the tax relief came about after the initiative I had in the 1998 Finance Bill when I restricted to a level of &pound;25,000 - &euro;31,000 and something subsequently - as to the amount of money that an investor could cross over from, say, his rental property area and set against his other income as well.  That actually was the biggest disincentive and control of that particular time during tax reliefs.  That's the ... in my first budget I did this.  And it had more of an effect.  So then because not every part of the country had tax ... had section 23 relief for ... you see, section 23 relief would have started in 1981 and we reintroduced it in 1984.  So most of the houses built in the boom period, as you call it, didn't have section 23 relief at all.  And I think if you get an independent study you will find that.</p></speech>

I haven't lived to the ripe old age that I am without meeting a large cross-section of people and some of them happened to be builders and developers.  Now that you mention Sean Dunne, I would have met Sean Dunne in 1983-'84 when, I think, it might have been his first or second venture out on his own.  He's a chartered ... he's a quantity surveyor.  And Mr. Dunne was building, I think, about 40 or 50 houses under some type of licence for the National Building Agency.  It was local authority housing he was building.  So I know Mr. Dunne from about '83-'84 and he comes from Carlow.  So that's the length of time I know Mr. Dunne.  So he's a friend of mine, together with lots and lots of friends of mine.  He ... by the way, the housing ... by the way, he's quite a good builder as well and I regard him as a long-standing friend of mine.

You've also acknowledged that you, in your 2004 budget, which was delivered in 2003, extended many of the property tax reliefs to 2006.  Can I ask you, in light of that, when you travel around the country, and particularly if you go to the Shannon region, if you go to Leitrim, if you go to Roscommon, what do you think when you see the ghost estates, some of them that were built as a result of the tax policies that you introduced and extended?  What do you feel when you hear, for example, the fact that 40 ghost estates are to be demolished, and the fact that a report in 2006 showed that, during your tenure as Minister for Finance, that individuals who used these schemes were able to reduce their tax bill to zero?  And they were ... those numbers were being increased year on year as a result of your measures.</p></speech>

So, therefore, I'd prefer if that hadn't occurred, naturally, but it's the whole property market collapsed and I, of course, would be very pleased if some local authorities or public bodies would take over some of these estates and make them available to people who cannot own their own homes.  But that's a matter for the Government of the day.</p>  <p>  I would prefer ... I would prefer ... the idea of the incentivisation was to allow people to get on and do this particular type of work.  There were lots of jobs and incomes created in that time.  I'm also very pleased to go around the country and notice lots of facilities in the country which local business people and local developers kept ... did for the community, including sponsoring everything from football teams to everything else.  That has been missed as well and I'm very glad of the economic activity that people in the more rural parts of Ireland who didn't get the same great benefits from ... say the Celtic tiger that occurred in Dublin, say, Cork, and say, Galway, that they got some benefit as well.  I'm disappointed that it didn't end up to ... it didn't end up in a way that I would have envisaged.  But I think it did generate a considerable amount of economic activity and there were spin-offs from it at that time.</p></speech>

I always said, including some of the incentives I brought in, that any business person that makes a decision solely on the basis on a taxation incentive, without looking at the other aspects of the issue, will often be very, very disappointed.  I said that at the time, so therefore, it was a matter for the developers and construction people and their financial institutions, to listen ... to look at all the aspects, were they going to be able to a) finance on this, could they sell them at an affordable price?

It's all the market's fault, in your view, in that area.  But can I put it to you, and I mentioned this here, a review of the 400 top earners in Ireland during 2002 and 2001 ... and they benefitted ... the review shows that the way that they were able to reduce their effective tax rate was through these schemes.  These schemes that allowed you to have the schemes such as the Shannon Basin property-based capital allowance incentives.  For example, there were six individuals of the top 400 earners that paid no tax in 2002, which was an increase from 2001.  There was 37 of the 400 that paid between 0% and 5% effective tax rate.  That was an increase from 25 the year before.  Do you believe or can you agree that because of some of these schemes and because of how individuals were able to reduce their tax rates, houses were being built to effectively reduce your tax rate, not with the intention that somebody will live in it?  If it worked out that you could you flip them in a couple of years' time, you would benefit on the double.  But these individuals were able to reduce their tax rate, in some cases, to a level of zero as a result of the policies that you introduced.</p></speech>

As I referred to a few minutes ago about the change I made in the 1998 Finance Bill regarding the capping of the reliefs that could be carried across, that was the total amount you could bring across which was, I think, the most significant change I made.  Subsequently over the years, my successor made changes regarding some of these reliefs as well and put in an overall threshold for them.  All of that is a job that you review every couple of years to see, "Well, are we getting ... is there too much avoidance in this particular area and should we even it up?"  That's the job of what a Finance Minister does previewing a Finance Bill.  The Revenue Commissioners come along and say, "Well the figures show this and this relief has been overused or this relief has been abused or this particular section of a Finance Bill was never intended to give this particular type of relief."  And we take anti-avoidance measures all of the time.  That's what I did and my successor did as well.</p></speech>

Just a couple of brief questions if I may and it's just in relation to your approach to budgets to try and understand the level of analysis done by the Department.  Because throughout various points of your evidence today, it has not been clear what degree of analysis had been done prior to a budget proposal and what degree of analysis had been done after it is implemented.  In your first budget, the budget for 1998, you proposed having the capital gains tax from 40% to 20%.  I'm not interested in the actual proposal itself or its impact but was this proposal out of the blue for your officials or did it come from them?</p></speech>

Just a second now ... if you look at that particular budget, my officials insisted that I would put in a figure that the cost to the Exchequer would be &euro;19 million.  I said in the D&aacute;il during a PQ subsequently - I didn't believe a word of it - but I put it in for good prudence because I knew from my own experience down through the years a rate of 40% capital gains tax - and it was higher in other years - that it was stifling a lot of people doing anything and that if we reduced the rate, a lot of people would sell everything from shares to property, etc., and we'd get a gigantic amount of money.  My officials did not believe that but I did and we did it and I was proved correct.</p></speech>

Then later on in the process we ... the decision was made that taxation changes will be discussed with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance.  At some of those meetings that we had on the Saturdays, or different other times we had them, Ministers would come forward with various ideas that they might like done in the taxation area and they'd be taken on board and then we'd come ... so there was an ongoing process, so therefore Brian Cowen is correct.

But with us it was ourselves and the Progressive Democrats and it was done between the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste on taxation matters.  So all the Government at various stages was along.  Now there were people who perhaps post all of that over the years sought maybe to give the impression that some changes, maybe taxation and some spending measures, were done without other Ministers knowing.

It would be the sensible and logical thing to do.  Like, if I was ... if I had been there, I probably would have done the same.  So there was ... what the Department and the Minister would want would be some empirical evidence how ... what the effect of all these schemes were, what the effect now is and what we should do and the way you have a book of evidence.  That's why you would consult ... why you generally commission a consultancy review.  We did many of them in our time in a whole variety of areas.  The Department also conducts its own review in these areas as well, or did.</p></speech>

It would be appropriate to include Ireland's international commitments to a fair wage in the commission's considerations.  For example, as was highlighted by ICTU during the pre-legislative scrutiny hearings, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees the right to just and favourable remuneration, ensuring an existence worthy of human dignity, the European Social Charter refers to a right to fair remuneration sufficient for a standard of living for workers and their families, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights declares a right to fair wages and decent living for workers and their families.  These rights should underpin the work of the commission.</p></speech>

I have no hesitation in repeating what I said inside and outside these Houses, namely, that I want to see a national minimum wage that is progressively increased over time and where the economic circumstances, the requirements of job creation and the social conditions and needs converge to allow that to happen.  I want to see better working conditions for people.  I have said that time and again.  I want to see improved pay, particularly for low-paid workers.  The Low Pay Commission really can transform the institutional framework to allow that to happen.  This is one of the most significant developments for low-paid people from a public policy perspective in many years.  The objective of ensuring that workers are entitled to just and favourable remuneration is clearly built into the criteria that will guide the commission on making a recommendation to me on an annual basis on the appropriate level of the minimum wage.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Most of us would strongly agree with him.  However, his statements are already incorporated in the spirit and the wording of the Bill, particularly in the hands of the current Minister of State.  I am convinced of that.  That fulfils any objective Deputy Ellis might want to achieve.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has argued that the regular schedule of work undertaken by the commission should not be limited to its annual recommendation on the hourly rate of the national minimum wage.  We want the Low Pay Commission to live up to its name, so this amendment seeks to extend its regular schedule of work to consider and make a recommendation on the living wage annually.  This work is currently undertaken independently by the<font color="#FF0000"> </font>living wage technical group, a group of progressive organisations, and the Low Pay Commission now needs to undertake a similar piece of work on behalf of the State in its effort to tackle low pay and deliver sustainable, fair employment for the longer term.<br /><br />The prevalence of low pay is deeply worrying.  If high levels of low pay persist, tax revenue will be constrained and the ability of the State to invest in capital, infrastructure and public services will remain limited.  In effect, in-work social protection supports, while vital for families to ensure they can put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads, also act as a subsidy for businesses.  We cannot ignore this reality.  We want to keep people in work and the State must step in to support citizens, but surely it is equally incumbent on the State to provide a mechanism to address the wholesale use of low-paid, insecure contracts by companies, sometimes extremely profitable companies in certain sectors of the economy.</blockquote></speech>

Amendment No. 2 seeks to add further objectives for the recommendation from the commission on the minimum hourly rate of pay, including reducing the incidence of low pay and supporting what is termed the phased introduction of a living wage.  Amendment No. 3 seeks to have the Low Pay Commission, in addition to its annual recommendation on the national minimum hourly rate of pay, make an annual recommendation to the Minister on the living wage.  We should avoid conflating and confusing the two issues.</p>  <p>  On the issue of a living wage, I have spoken in the past of my support for the development of the concept of a living wage in Ireland, but we must differentiate between the application of a mandatory national minimum wage and a living wage that is born from a broad societal movement.  We would be familiar with the context of that in the UK and how successfully the living wage concept has evolved in the UK over the last few years.  The fact that it is a grassroots civil society campaign is where it draws its strength from.  At the moment there are about 1,500 UK companies, large and small, that are paying the living wage.  There are two separate rates: the London rate and a rate outside London.  It is a concept that I and the T&aacute;naiste support.  I have stated on a number of occasions that I will be holding the first Government-backed forum on the living wage concept in the autumn, because it is crucial that we bring employers, employees and their representatives together with civil society organisations to discuss how this concept could successfully be applied to Ireland.  However, I restate that this is a voluntary issue and we must look at it in that context.</p>  <p>  Deputy Ellis's party had a forum on the living wage in Liberty Hall recently but there was one major omission - it did not bother to invite a single employer.  There are good strong trade union officials around this table, who I do not think have ever garnered a pay increase for the people they seek to represent without engaging with the employer, so it is quite bizarre that one would not invite an employer or employer representatives to a forum when one purports to want to discuss the living wage.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 4 from Deputy Calleary would require the commission each year to research and recommend to the Minister national minimum wage rates of pay for youth and apprentice workers.</p></speech>

It provides for an enhanced research approach for the Minister with respect to the national minimum wage for youth and apprenticeship categories.  </p>  <p>               I ask the Minister of State to consider the amendment but we will consider any counter proposal he may have.</p></speech>

As Deputy Keaveney is well aware, the sub-minimum rates provided for in the National Minimum Wage Acts since 2000 were originally recommended by the National Minimum Wage Commission, which was appointed to advise on the introduction of a national minimum wage.  The commission recommended that employees under 18 be entitled to 70% of the national minimum wage with a view to striking a balance between ensuring that young employees are not exploited and ensuring that the rate of pay does not encourage students to leave full-time education or training.  The commission also recommended at that stage that sub-minimum rates apply to employees in the first two years of employment who are over 18 and for those undergoing structured training.  The commission was of the view that the employers should be encouraged to focus on training and that the structure of the minimum wage should provide encouragement and inducement for employers to take on unskilled staff and to involve them in training.  The rationale underpinning these provisions is that, all things being equal, an experienced employee is of more value and is more productive than a new entrant or trainee.  It is also important that those seeking employment are not prevented from getting the opportunity to enter work because of the lack of experience or training.</p><p>Apprentices have been excluded from the scope of the national minimum wage since it was introduced in 2000 for the reason that there has been separate, long-standing registered employment agreement approaches covering apprentices.  The REA system was struck down by the McGowan judgment in 2013 but the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015 will provide for, <i>inter alia</i>, the possibility for sectoral employment orders covering statutory pay and pension provisions for workers of particular sectors, including provisions for apprenticeship rates.</p><p>While these are important issues, they may be more appropriate for the commission to examine in the context of a future work programme.  I am not minded to insert that provision into the primary legislation but it is an issue that could come on the commission's radar in time.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, the system we are providing for the work programme of the Low Pay Commission will mean that the programme will be developed early each year, thus giving the commission the opportunity to consider that proposal and to understand what its mandate and work programme will be for any given year in the first two months of the year.</p>  <p>  On the question of requiring the commission to recommend national minimum wage rates of pay for female workers, the commission may be asked to look at a range of related matters in the context of the minimum wage.  The prevalence of female workers on or near the national minimum wage is very well known.  We know that there is a preponderance of women on the national minimum wage given the sectors.  In that context I would see the Deputy's real concerns being addressed.  In any event, setting a minimum rate based on a person's gender would arguably and possibly be in breach of equality legislation.</p></speech>

I do not agree with separate provisions for men and women.</p>  <p>  I refer to amendment No. 3 which proposes to insert an hourly living wage rate of pay.

This amendment proposes to insert provisions dealing with a wage share of national income, the role of wages as a source of demand and median earnings.  When making a recommendation to the Minister, the commission must have regard to a number of factors which we believe are too heavily weighted towards a small number of macro-economic factors that are limited in measurement as well as in outcomes.  Specifically, the commission is instructed to consider fluctuations in employment and productivity in the year prior to its recommendation, the relevant period.  It is our opinion that the macro-economic factors of the commission's consideration in this context should be extended to include the wage share of national income, the role of wages as a source of demand and median earnings.  The inclusion of these factors will enhance the work of the commission.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Ellis for his contribution on those amendments in the name of Deputy To&iacute;b&iacute;n.  I assure members that I and my Government colleagues have given significant consideration to the criteria as set out in the Bill.  Many of them have stood the test of time in that they were previously incorporated in national minimum wage legislation dating back to 2000.  They provide a balanced suite of provisions against which any recommendation must be balanced and considered.  The addition of a wide-ranging list of factors as presented in amendments Nos. 5 to 10, inclusive, would probably make it virtually impossible for any commission of any nature to undertake the level of analysis required to produce an agreed recommendation every year, or perhaps, to meet the needs we have set down in legislation to arrive at a recommendation to the Government by a set date each year.  It is also my view that some of the additional factors proposed are better addressed and may be better seen through the prism of the suite of industrial relations legislation I have brought forward and which we hope will be enacted soon and the wider decent work agenda that I am pursuing.</p>  <p>  On the issue of zero and low-hours contracts which was a component of one of the amendments, we are introducing collective bargaining legislation and the re-introduction of a system of registered employment agreements and a new mechanism providing for sectoral employment orders.  I have commissioned the University of Limerick to undertake a very significant study into the prevalence and extent of zero and low-hours contracts.  We are examining a range of different areas and we will act on the recommendations of the report on zero and low-hours contracts by the University of Limerick.  We will study the report very carefully and where there are gaps, we will be anxious to ensure that those gaps are filled.  The commission is obliged to consider changes in income distribution when making a recommendation to the Minister.  Such a recommendation is designed to assist as many low paid workers as is reasonably practicable and to set a rate that is fair and reasonable.  Previous references to changes in earnings have served us well and I do not consider it necessary to refer specifically to median earnings changes or proportions above or below particular proportions of median earnings.  </p>  <p>               There is very significant expertise available on and to the Low Pay Commission to properly interpret changes in earnings data to which it must have due regard when putting forward its recommendation.  </p> <p> As regards comparisons with Northern Ireland or any other jurisdiction that has a national minimum wage, these are compared by looking at the absolute values but also having regarding to purchasing power parities.  Again, I believe the commission has significant and sufficient expertise available to it to make these distinctions and it would not be appropriate to specifically require the Low Pay Commission, on an annual basis, to analyse different welfare supports, health care provision, child care and social housing across various jurisdictions.  </p> <p> Fair wages should never be sacrificed for the creation of jobs that are exploitative and unsustainable.  That is why section 4 sets very clear objectives for the national minimum wage and in this regard, the commission will be obliged to ensure that any recommendations it makes should ensure that the minimum wage will be set at a rate that is both fair and sustainable.</p> <p> In relation to the promotion of gender equality, it is important to note that the national minimum wage applies to all workers, irrespective of gender.  As such, it is the epitome of a measure that eliminates gender inequality in its application.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 2 to 10, inclusive.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 7 seeks to insert economic inequality, the percentage of workers in the economy earning two-thirds or less of median income and the living wage as set for the relevant period.  Nowhere in the legislation is the commission instructed to consider inequality or poverty when making a recommendation to the Minister.  The legislation is too heavily weighed towards a limited number of economic measurements.  This is not helpful in tackling the economic inequality or rebuilding an economy fit for the 21st century.  This may tick the box with employers' organisations but will not address structural faults in Ireland's economy.  We want to see Ireland's recovery rooted in a dynamic, prosperous and fair economy.  This cannot be delivered unless tackling economic equality and monitoring the number of low-paid workers in the economy are put centre stage.  Wage share as a percentage of national income has fallen by nearly 20% in Ireland in the past 20 years.  Ireland's fall in wage share is consistent with many of our EU neighbours but it is significantly sharper.  If the Low Pay Commission is not charged with monitoring these significant factors associated with the increasing prevalence of low pay, then who is?</p><p>Amendment No. 10 seeks to insert in page 5, between lines 12 and 13, the following:</p><blockquote>(iv) addressing levels of income inequality to include income inequality between men and women in the current period,<br /><br />(v) aggregate demand in the economy,<br /><br />(vi) tax receipts.</blockquote>  <p>It seems barmy that we would exclude the consideration of income inequality between men and women and aggregate demand in the economy and tax receipts from the effects that the commission's recommendations will have on the economy.  This section of the legislation limits the commission's consideration to employment levels, cost of living and national competitiveness.  We need to be more ambitious and set the commission a wider point of reference, more useful and relevant point of reference.  Perhaps the Minister of State would address those issues.</p></speech>

This has not happened.  In Britain there is a growing demand for the its low pay commission to take on a watchdog role.  This view was echoed by the Migrants Rights Centre in its submission to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Innovation and Enterprise.  It called for the remit of the commission to be expanded to become a watchdog on low pay and that powers be granted to set targets to reduce low pay across a number of policy areas.  IMPACT recently commissioned a report entitled JobBridge - time to start again?, which asks for the JobBridge scheme to be scrapped and for the Low Pay Commission to examine the prevalence of open market unpaid internships.  The report, the research for which was spearheaded by Dr. Mary Murphy, Maynooth University, recommends that the commission report on key patterns in paid and unpaid open market internships in Ireland, provide an overall framework to regulate all internships and support professional associations to promote ethical internship programmes.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this recommendation.</p></speech>

The Bill provides that requests shall be made not later than the first two months of each year, apart from this year, and will be part of the commission's work programme.  I believe that the legislative provision covering the work programme to be given to the commission each year should not be prescriptive or in any way inflexible.</p>  <p>  The amendment would tie the hands of the commission in regard to its annual work programme.  As specific issues related to the work of the commission, a request can be made to the commission to examine and report on the matter.  </p>  <p>               The specific topics raised in the amendment may well be worthy of examination by the Low Pay Commission at some point, but I do not believe it is appropriate to set them down in legislation.

It is appropriate that I alert the committee to that fact at this stage because my amendment is relevant to this particular section of the Bill.  On Report Stage, I will bring forward an amendment to section 5 to amend the date on which the committee must submit its recommendation and report to the Minister.  As the Bill is currently drafted, which colleagues will know, the date specified is 15 July of each year to which the examination relates.  I propose to amend it to "the third Tuesday of July of the year to which the examination relates".  It had been my intention to bring the Bill back to the Seanad on 9 July.  I have been informed that this will not be possible due to logistical printing reasons.  Instead, it is my intention to revert to the Seanad on 13 or 14 July to have the legislation finalised.  Clearly, this situation will present difficulties in having the Bill on the Statute Book on or before 15 July.  Therefore, I have decided to move the reporting period back by four working days.  I think it is safer to do so given the logistical challenges that we have at this point in time.</p>  <p>  The amendment also has the advantage of removing a specific date from the Bill and providing a day that will be fit in with the Government's schedule.  I mean that I am anxious to make sure that the date on which the report and recommendation would be made falls on a weekday, preferably on a day on which the Cabinet traditionally meets which would be a Tuesday.  It would be good practice to have that aspect catered for.  I wish to stress that my amendment is not in any way associated with the work of the Low Pay Commission, or where it is at, at the moment.  The commission is making good progress and the minor change I propose is purely for the logistical reasons that I outlined earlier.  I shall table this minor technical amendment on Report Stage.  I simply wanted to flag my intention to do so because it is relevant to this section.</p></speech>

I am fully supportive of the view that any increase in the minimum wage has to be done in an orderly way so that companies can prepare, in a timely fashion, in terms of their costs, business planning and so on.</p>  <p>  It would be opportune, at this point, to remind Deputies that the ESRI, in its 2006 analysis of the last Labour Court recommendation proposing an increase to the national minimum wage, concluded that adjusting the minimum wage by a substantial amount on an irregular basis with lengthy gaps between increases, as has happened in the past, is more likely to have a detrimental impact on employment and to contribute to uncertainty for employers and actual and potential employees than regular, smaller and fairly predictable upratings.  A significant benefit of the establishment of the Low Pay Commission concept is that in the future the national minimum wage rates will be assessed annually and, therefore, where they occur, any adjustments in the future will be incremental and, almost by definition, less disruptive for businesses rather than the big step changes that we witnessed in the past, and that were criticised by the ESRI in its report.  </p>  <p>  The deadline of 15 July, as it was, and the small adjustment that I shall make on Report Stage, in terms of the date for submission of the commission's recommendations, was designed specifically to allow time for full consideration of any change, or any proposed change, to be made in the context of the budget, for example, and how that would interact with budgetary considerations around tax, social welfare and business planning, and to provide for any adjustment in a planned and structured way.  Consequently, this very structure achieves what the Senator is trying to achieve by the amendment.  I am satisfied that there will be sufficient lead-in time for businesses to plan for any adjustment.  I recognise the spirit and intent in which the amendment was tabled by Deputy Calleary and put forward by Deputy Keaveney today.  However, I cannot the amendment because I believe it is unnecessary given the new structure that we are putting in place and the timeline that we envisage.</p></speech>

We think it should be a shorter period of one month rather than three months.</p>  <p>  The Minister currently has two options to declare a national minimum hourly rate of pay in line with what the commission recommends or in other terms.  We would like to see that changed to some formulation to the effect that the rate would be improved or some indication that the Minister can only vary the rate upwards as opposed to downwards.  We will table another amendment to that effect on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The amendment is straightforward in its intent and is recommended by ICTU.  Workers who give evidence, or make a statement, to the commission need to be protected against penalisation by their employers.  This protection is offered under the workplace relations service and similar anti-victimisation protections were included by the Government in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill.</p></speech>

I recognise the Deputy&rsquo;s intent with the amendment, however, there are already a significant number of protections in place for workers who consider they have been the subject of victimisation in the workplace.  However, as it stands, any worker who might find himself or herself the subject of victimisation measures for making a statement to the Low Pay Commission or giving evidence via his or her trade union already has the possibility of taking a case under the Industrial Relations Acts.</p>  <p>  In addition, the 2004 code of practice on victimisation provides that where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place, and where negotiating arrangements are not in place, no person should be victimised or suffer disadvantage as a consequence of his or her legitimate actions or affiliations arising from the dispute.</p>  <p>  The procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation is set out in the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and those protections will be further enhanced in the context of provisions in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2015, the collective bargaining legislation dealing with the Government&rsquo;s commitment on collective bargaining which this House has recently passed, and which we hope will be enacted very shortly.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has the information in front of him.  Sinn F&eacute;in is ambitious for the Low Pay Commission and has argued for its statutory remit to be expanded to include low pay and the various economic and social factors behind increasing levels of economic and income inequality in this country.  We have submitted the amendments to highlight the disappointment that the legislation is so limited in its expectation of the commission&rsquo;s work.  As presented to us, the Government has drafted a National Minimum Wage (Low Pay Commission) Bill that is a missed opportunity to tackle low pay in a real and meaningful manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2002" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015070100002#F01500"><p>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the necessary amendments to the National Minimum Wage Act to ensure the establishment of the Low Pay Commission on a statutory basis.  It is not just about the national minimum wage.  This is about low pay and dealing with the issue on a structured basis with a statutory body.  The principal function of the Low Pay Commission will be, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations to the Minister on the national minimum wage with a view to securing that the minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels.</p>  <p>  The Bill replaces the previous means by which the national minimum wage could be adjusted in the past and replaces those with the annual analysis and recommendation by the Low Pay Commission.  Those means were set out in sections 11, 12 and 13 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, which are now repealed by section 9.  Clearly, the role of the Low Pay Commission is firmly set and anchored within the national minimum wage legislation of the State, but that does not mean that the remit of the Low Pay Commission is a narrow one.  It is not the case that because Sinn F&eacute;in consistently says it, that it is somehow true.  Just because it does not suit the narrative of Deputy Ellis and others, it does not make it the case.  This is an institutional framework to deal with the challenge of low pay.  It is the most important institutional change made in this country in terms of tackling low pay for many years.  I am confident that this will make a considerable impact for those living on low pay.  It reflects very well on the Government in terms of our commitment to making work pay and making the institutional changes we need to make that happen.  It compares very favourably indeed with the lack of action of Deputy Ellis&rsquo;s party in government in Northern Ireland, which is unfortunately, a classic low pay economy.</p>  <p>  As I previously stated, the commission is about much more than setting the rate of the national minimum wage.  Section 5 also provides that the commission may be requested by the Minister to examine and report on such matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act.  That request will be made not later than two months after the Bill is enacted and in subsequent years by the end of February each year, and will be part of that year&rsquo;s work programme of the commission.  It is important as well that we do not tie the hands of the commission.  Priorities will change and there will be issues to which the Government of the day will need to react in a very structured way with the institutional framework we are providing.  That is why I have ruled out some of the proposals made on Committee Stage in an attempt to enhance, as some would see it, some of the provisions around the criteria for making recommendations to the Low Pay Commission.</p>  <p>  We have a good structure in place, one that will work.  The way we have structured the system will allow me, and future Ministers, to ask the Low Pay Commission each year to do a range of other work to address areas about which we are all concerned and to advise the Government in a professional and expert way and, critically, in an evidence-based way about the best approaches Administrations can take to address the scourge of low pay.  For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

That would be a fair change to make.</p>  <p>  Amendment No. 19 is similar to Deputy Keaveney&rsquo;s amendment and seeks the inclusion of the owner of an SME as a member of the commission.

However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2034" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015070100002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity.  The role of the SNA is clearly defined in the Department's circular 0030/2014.  Under its terms, the NPC considers that the SNA scheme is effective in meeting the needs of children who have specific care needs.  It supports children who have care needs that could not ordinarily be fully met by a teacher to access school placement.  The NPC believes that the scheme has contributed significantly to the enhancement of students' experiences in school.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding this, however, the role of the SNA in the school needs to be more closely observed.  Despite the clarity provided by the recent circular, parents continue to report that SNAs often engage in extended functions outside of those provided for.  The NPC agrees with the value for money report that the &quot;weight of educational research considers that the delegation of educational instruction to support staff is inappropriate and would represent an unacceptable departure from the role&quot;.  Children with special educational needs require the most specialised and skilled professionals to support them in accessing the curriculum.<br/><br/>While the SNA entry requirements are, in the main, appropriate for the role as set out in the circular, they are not appropriate for the extended functions in which SNAs may be engaging.  In addition to such extended functions, certain aspects of the role of the SNA as defined in the circular need further consideration in terms of SNAs' suitability to carry out their functions.  Specifically, the NPC refers to section 7 of the circular on SNA support for pupils with behaviour-related care needs, which states:</p> <blockquote> 	The care role of the SNA, in instances where SNA support is sanctioned to assist with behavioural related care needs, is concerned with assisting the teacher to meet the care needs of the child by: 	 		- preserving the safety of the pupil and others with whom the pupil is in contact<br /><br />- assisting to ensure the prevention of self injurious or destructive behaviour<br /><br />- reinforcing good behaviour on the child's part and acting as a positive role model for the child<br /><br />- assisting with recording data in relation to pupil behaviour and behavioural development 	 </blockquote>   <p>The skill and training required for the first two bullet points in particular of the SNA's role in terms of a child's behaviour-related care needs are significant and would require specific training.  As is the case for SNA support for children with visual and hearing impairments, schools that require SNAs to work with children with behaviour-related care needs must ensure that they are equipped with the skills necessary to support the particular needs of those children.  </p>  <p>         The NPC believes that the allocation of SNA support should be clearly linked to an individualised care plan which has been prepared for the child and this is now clearly set out in Circular 0030/2014. This plan should be prepared in consultation with the parents of the child concerned, the child, where possible, and everyone who works with the child in the school and other environments.  The plan would clearly identify the care needs of the child and how these needs would be met while ensuring that at all times a focus is maintained on the development of a child&rsquo;s independence skills. The aim should be that as the child becomes more independent the need for SNA support reduces.  The plan should reflect this and proactive steps should be taken to reach this goal.  This aim, along with all other aims, should be communicated clearly to parents and the child.  The level of need should be monitored regularly.</p> <p> The NPC is concerned that an over-dependence on SNA support can lead to social isolation of children, as the presence of an adult can create a barrier and so make normal interaction more difficult. We would suggest that other types of support, including peer support, be examined further at school level.  There is some evidence to suggest that peer support can have a positive impact on students' behaviour and can lead to a reduction in the need for SNA support. </p> <p> The NPC believes that there should be an accredited compulsory basic training course for all SNAs.  SNAs are often supporting the most vulnerable children within the school and basic training regarding understanding children&rsquo;s needs, communication skills and basic child protection knowledge should be included in a short initial training course.  The mere fact that the SNA is working under the supervision and guidance of the classroom teacher will not ensure they are able to effectively carry out their duties.</p> <p> The NPC believes that parents should have support and information about the different resources available for their child in the education system and the function of each support.  Parents often get caught in a fight for any resource rather than a fight for the right resource due to lack of information on their child&rsquo;s needs and how these needs should effectively be met.  The NPC also believes that special needs assistants are effective in supporting children with specific care needs to access mainstream schools.  We are concerned that their remit has been extended beyond this to include an educational role.  We believe that the best educational outcomes and overall experience of school for children with SEN would be achieved by children having their identified needs met by appropriate professionals.</p></speech>

It is the fastest growing area within the union.  Since we established a dedicated education division just three years ago we have had two very successful biennial divisional conferences.  We see the education division as providing a voice for all of those staff who work in our education system, other than teachers and academics who are already well represented by various trade unions.  In truth, the workers who we represent are often forgotten or neglected but are crucial to the successful operation of our schools and colleges and to the outcomes that are achieved.  </p>  <p>  A large proportion of the divisional membership is comprised of special needs assistants.  The expansion in the number of special needs assistants was a key element in the process of making mainstream schooling a reality for many of our citizens.  The commitments contained in the different pieces of legislation enacted in the late 1990s and early 2000s were dependent on the provision of adequate care and teaching resources.  Members of the committee will be aware of the population growth in this country over several years now.  This has manifested itself in a sustained increase in the number of school-going children.  When the financial, economic and fiscal crisis struck, one of the consequences was a Government decision to cap the overall number of special needs assistants.  This cap remained in place for four years despite conditions that would suggest the existence of significant additional demand, namely, the increase in the school-going population.</p>  <p>  The current Minister for Education and Skills deserves credit for securing additional posts, as announced last year.  This followed an increase of 390 posts announced by her predecessor in the previous budget.  However, these increases did not make up for the lost ground during the period 2009-12, particularly when account is taken of the relentless growth in this cohort of the population.  It is vitally important that members of the committee understand that the employment situation of special needs assistants is markedly different to that of the vast majority of other public servants.  Originally, the special needs assistant was linked directly to a particular child.  Hence, the association in the mind of parents and the children with special education needs with "his", "her" or "my" SNA.  In recent times, the policy has changed to one of access to an SNA rather than an individual SNA assigned to each child.  The effect of this is that the school receives a particular allocation but is required to spread this over all of the children in the school with assessed needs.</p>  <p>  The original connection between the special needs assistant and a particular child meant that when that child progressed or left the school for some other reason the SNA faced redundancy.  In fact a specific redundancy scheme exists for SNAs.  Unlike most other public servants special needs assistants do not enjoy relative security of employment.  This places special needs assistants in a rather unusual position in the context of recent public service agreements.  As committee members will know these agreements were based on commitments to, on the one hand, flexibility and co-operation with change in return for job security and, on the other hand, no further reductions in income.  As SNAs do not enjoy job security in the first place the bargain was somewhat meaningless for them.  As a result of IMPACT&rsquo;s representations we secured the introduction of a supplementary assignment panel in 2013.  Where an SNA is facing redundancy this provides the possibility of alternative employment as schools that have posts to fill are required to interview a selection of redundant SNAs in the first instance.  This was a welcome development and the scheme was further improved in 2014.  None the less, special needs assistants do not enjoy what would be regarded as normal public service security of tenure.</p>  <p>  The big issue that has preoccupied special needs assistants since IMPACT was last before the committee is that of fragmentation of posts and casualisation of employment.  When I was last here, I outlined some of the effects of the trend to fragment posts when the National Council for Special Education was making its allocations.  This became an even greater problem in the 2014-15 school year.  In several cases, our members working as special needs assistants had their hours cut, which also meant an associated reduction in income.  As this violated the other key commitment on the part of the Government in the public service agreement-----</p></speech>

In fairness to the current Minister, she has listened carefully to our concerns and representations and appears to have a good understanding of the difficulties.  We were heartened by her remarks on 9 April 2015 at our education divisional conference and we responded to her invitation to participate in talks with the other stakeholders.  These talks led to the Department issuing a circular on 12 June 2015, the terms of which place an onus on schools to offer additional hours in the first instance to part-time staff working in the school.  We see this as a very positive and welcome development.  Unfortunately, the announcement of the NCSE allocations for the next school year 2015-16 has been delayed.  Normally these allocations are announced around mid-June.  This allows schools and individual SNAs to plan in the knowledge of what jobs will exist in the school for the following year.  I regret to say that our members have commenced school holidays in recent days without knowing their job situation for end of August, early September.  This is totally unacceptable, as acknowledged by the Department of Education and Skills.  </p>  <p>         A secondary effect is that it makes it difficult to be definitive about the benefits accruing from the recent circular on casualisation of employment.  It is imperative that the allocation figures become available to allow its provisions to operate effectively.  Nothing less than this will be acceptable to IMPACT.</p> <p> IMPACT has fought hard on behalf of special needs assistants just to secure progress on the related issues of job security and income protection that are at the heart of public service agreements since the Croke Park agreement was negotiated in March 2010.  This should not be necessary.  In our view, it would be preferable that SNAs were treated similarly to teachers, enjoying continuous employment depending on school-going numbers.</p> <p> As I stated previously to the committee, the big issue for special needs assistants is respect or a perceived lack of it.  There is a significant spend on the scheme under which special needs assistants are employed.  We must move to a situation where the resource comprising the SNA population is properly respected and valued.  Too often the special needs assistant is seen as a general dogsbody rather than an important asset to the classroom.  Whether it is because their employment is seen as casual or for some other reason, there is no continuing professional development or in-service training programme for special needs assistants.  This must be created if we are to maximise the return on what the State is investing.  It is also vitally important that specific training modules are made available, so SNAs can better meet the needs of children with particular requirements.</p> <p> It would be timely to have a review that would encompass all of these issues, and others, to ensure that the children who rely on the availability of special needs assistants will have their needs met in the best possible way.  If there is a genuine openness on the part of the Department and other authorities to approach this in a truly collaborative fashion, IMPACT in its representational role would be happy to participate.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleague, Niall Feeney, assistant principal in the NCSE.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute further to the committee's discussions on the role of the SNA and to provide an update since we last met in October 2013.</p>  <p>  As advised previously, the NCSE is a very strong supporter of the SNA scheme.  Without SNA support, many students would be unable to attend school.  The scheme provides sufficient support to meet a student's care needs but also allows for this support to be faded over time in line with a student's development.  The scheme also facilitates maintained or increased levels of support where this is needed.</p>  <p>  The NCSE initially allocated 10,985 SNA posts to schools for last September, the start of the current school year.  Since then, over 165 posts have been allocated in response to needs which emerged during the year.  There are now some 11,150 SNA posts in schools.  More than two thirds of these are in mainstream class settings.</p>  <p>  Members might recall that at the last meeting, I outlined that the role of the SNA had been informally expanded by some schools to include an educational remit.  Some parents, schools and professionals consider that an SNA is allocated to help with literacy difficulties or to provide therapeutic support, such as speech and language therapy.  Often, when SNA care support is being faded out or withdrawn completely, a school might advise that they would like the SNA to do other work with a student such as working on improving a student's language, literacy, numeracy and so on.</p>  <p>  In the 2014-15 school year, the NCSE processed 8,500 applications for SNA support.  Of these, 3,000 or 35% did not come within the remit of the SNA scheme for these and other reasons.  In the NCSE, we find this to be very worrying because each application for SNA support raises expectations and hopes, and when the applications are declined there can be disappointment, anxiety, sometimes even anger, and a belief that the NCSE is not doing its job properly or that "cuts" are the reason for non-allocation.  This is not the case.  In fact, the number of SNAs has increased by over 600 since 2013.</p>  <p>  One of the issues being discussed is whether we should have teaching assistants.  From time to time there is a suggestion that the role of the SNA should be expanded to include the provision of additional educational support to students with special needs.  As a general rule, the NCSE considers the issue of whether to have teaching assistants to be much broader than special education.  The conclusions of the research I referenced at our last meeting on the matter still remain relevant.  The research studies I raised, which I have circulated again for the committee's convenience, raise serious concerns about the effectiveness of teaching assistant support for students with special educational needs.  While finding some positive effects on teachers' workload and stress levels, these studies found the more support students received from teaching assistants the less progress they made in subjects such as English, mathematics and science; students with special educational needs spent over a quarter of their school time away from mainstream class, their teachers and peers; they were almost constantly accompanied by a teacher assistant who bore the greatest responsibility for planning and for teaching them; students could become over-dependent on teacher assistant support and socially isolated from other students; and despite the good intentions of teaching assistants, students with special educational needs received a less appropriate and lower quality educational experience than other students.</p>  <p>  All of us are striving to ensure that Irish students with special educational needs do not receive a less appropriate or lower quality educational experience.  One US study noted that the substantial increase in teacher assistant use in US schools had taken place without any compelling evidence that it is "educationally sound to deploy the least qualified personnel to provide primary instruction to students with the most complex learning characteristics".  On the other hand, research findings consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between the quality of teaching, and the role of the teacher, and outcomes achieved by this group of students.  As I said, I re-circulated some extracts from various research literature for members' information.</p>  <p>  The NCSE provided policy advice to the Minister which takes on board the research findings and international best practice principles.  The NCSE considers that there is insufficient evidence, at this point in time, to support the introduction of a new teaching assistant grade to work specifically with students with special educational needs.  The research findings indicate that paraprofessionals can act as a barrier to a student's access to the teacher and full participation in classroom activities, and that it is the quality of teaching which determines better educational outcomes.</p>  <p>  To conclude, while there is a very important role for the SNA in supporting the care needs of students, and the NCSE is a strong supporter of the SNA scheme, the NCSE believes that students with complex learning needs should be taught by fully qualified and experienced teachers equipped with the necessary skills to meet their needs.  In our 2013 policy advice, Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs, the NCSE recognised the importance and centrality of the teacher in the education and care of all students, including students with special educational needs.  Research findings consistently indicate that the quality of teachers and their teaching are the most important factors in determining educational outcomes for students with special needs.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is very concerned that parents sometimes are not sure about the SNA scheme or are not sure how the educational system supports children with special educational needs.  For some time we have been producing leaflets for parents, such as the one I have with me, to provide information to parents and guardians.  This one relates to young people with a disability.  However, we have just printed an information leaflet for parents and guardians of children and young people with special educational needs and I will leave some copies with the Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2047" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Mulkerrins" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015070100002#F00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting to brief members on the role of special needs assistants.</p>  <p>  SNAs play an important role in assisting schools to support students with significant care needs and, since the scheme was first introduced, have substantially assisted the process of including students with special educational needs in schools.  The Department of Education and Skills recognises that all children require care and attention in school.  This is particularly true of younger children and infants.  All schools therefore have a responsibility to provide for the care and well-being of all the pupils who attend their schools, including children with special educational needs.</p>  <p>  The Department also recognises that there will be a significant number of children who, by virtue of their disability, will require additional care and attention.  For these children, the SNA scheme is provided by the Department to assist recognised primary, post-primary and special schools to cater for their care needs, in an educational context.  The special needs assistant scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  </p>  <p>         This support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school, to minimise disruption to class or teacher time for the pupils concerned or their peers and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p> <p> The scheme has been a key factor in ensuring the successful inclusion of children with special educational needs in mainstream education and also with providing care support to pupils who are enrolled in special schools and special classes.  In recent years the SNA scheme has been reviewed on two occasions.  In 2011 the Department published a comprehensive value for money and policy review of the scheme, which was referenced by Ms Lynch earlier, and in June 2013, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, published its report on supporting students with special educational needs in schools, which was referenced by Ms Griffin a moment ago.</p> <p> In the preparation of these reports the NCSE and the review group engaged in significant consultations with stakeholders including schools, parents, pupils, management bodies and other interested parties to ensure that the broadest possible range of views and opinions were considered in the preparation of the reports.  The value for money and policy review found that the SNA scheme, as mentioned by Ms Lynch, is supporting schools in meeting the needs of students with disabilities, who also have significant care needs, and that the scheme has assisted in enabling as many students as possible to be included in mainstream schools. </p> <p> However, the review also found that the purpose of the scheme and the allocation process was generally not well understood within schools or by parents and that the deployment of SNAs in schools had in practice moved away from the objectives originally envisaged, namely, to provide for children&rsquo;s care needs, and had moved towards SNA involvement in behavioural, therapeutic, teaching and even administrative duties.  The review recommended that the criteria for the allocation of SNA support should be restated and clarified for both parents and schools.  These findings were essentially echoed by the NCSE in its later report.  However, the NCSE also made a number of additional findings and recommendations which the Department considered and has now begun to implement.  The NCSE also completed a number of other reports.</p> <p> In light of these recommendations, the Department published a comprehensive circular to give effect to a number of recommendations made in the review reports and to provide clarity to parents and schools on the role and purpose of SNAs.  The circular was published in 2014 and a copy has been circulated to members for information.  The circular provides clarification and guidance on the following matters: the role of the SNA; the description of care needs for which SNA supports are provided; the primary care tasks of SNAs; the secondary tasks which may be assigned to SNAs from time to time; the role of the classroom teacher and resource or learning support teachers and the role of an SNA to support those teachers; the role of medical and other professional reports or recommendations by medical and other professionals; SNA support for pupils with behaviour-related care needs; SNA support for children with visual and hearing impairment; and the NCSE allocations process.</p> <p> In addition the circular clarifies that SNAs are allocated to schools to manage as appropriate.  It identifies the role of the school in managing the resource and ensuring access of the SNA to the child as necessary.  The circular also provides that SNA allocations should be reviewed on an annual basis and that, in the case of some allocations, they should be timebound in the expectation that the care need should diminish particularly with the ongoing support provided by the SNA.  It also introduces a requirement that personal pupil plans should be in place, which should include a care dimension.  The pupil plan should indicate how the SNA will meet the needs of the child and the timeframe for which this support is expected to be required.</p> <p> Transition to post-primary is considered to be a critical time for a student with special educational needs.  The circular requires that the child&rsquo;s personal plan should recognise this and the focus of the plan should be on ensuring that the child&rsquo;s care needs are, in so far as possible, ameliorated before moving to post-primary.  Of course, some pupils, particularly those with physical disabilities or conditions with enduring needs, will continue to have a requirement for some level of access to SNA support and for some children there may also be short-term care needs as they transition to post-primary schools.  In a small number of cases for pupils at post-primary age, emerging conditions or needs may only manifest as the child or young adult gets older.  However, for the most part it should be expected that only students with chronic and serious care needs arising from a disability should continue to require SNA support in post-primary schools. </p> <p> Not all children who have special educational needs or who have been diagnosed as having a disability, require access to SNA support.  The allocation of additional adult SNA support should not generally be regarded as a prerequisite for a student with special educational needs to attend school.  The purpose of the SNA scheme is to provide for the significant additional care needs which some pupils with special educational needs may have.  At present, for example, some 42,000 children receive additional resource and learning support teaching supports while over 24,000 children receive access to SNA support.  Accordingly, qualifying criteria for the allocation of SNA support include the following conditions: the child must be enrolled in and attending a State-funded primary, post-primary or special school; there must be a professional report including an assessment indicating that the child has a disability; and the care needs outlined in the assessment must be of such significance that they are beyond that which would normally be expected to be provided to a child by the child&rsquo;s class teacher, support teacher, or other school teachers.</p> <p> In general the care needs of qualifying children will fall into one of four categories: medical needs; physical impairment; sensory impairment; or danger to self or others.  Of course, the type of significant care needs that pupils may have can be varied, depending on the nature or level of the disability or sensory impairment a child may have.  While the list is not exhaustive, the following are some examples of the primary care needs which would be considered significant and which might require SNA support because the extent of assistance required, if it was to be provided by the class teacher, would overly disrupt normal teaching time: assistance with feeding or dressing themselves; assistance with toileting and general hygiene, including catheterisation, which is a less frequent occurrence, where a child with special needs cannot independently self-toilet, and until such time as they are able to do so; assistance with mobility and orientation on an ongoing basis including assisting a child or children to access the school, the classroom, with accessing school transport or helping a child to avoid hazards in or surrounding the school; assisting teachers to provide supervision in the class, playground and school grounds, for example, at recreation, assembly, and dispersal times; non-nursing care needs associated with specific medical conditions such as frequent epileptic seizures or for pupils who have fragile health including, where necessary and appropriate, the administration of medicines; care needs requiring frequent interventions including withdrawal of a pupil from a classroom when essential for safety or personal care reasons, or where a child with a disability may be required to leave the class for medical reasons or due to distress on a frequent basis; assistance with moving and lifting of children, operation of hoists and equipment; and assistance with severe communication difficulties, including enabling curriculum access for pupils with physical disabilities or sensory needs and those with significant, and identified social and emotional difficulties.  This might include assistance with assistive technology equipment, typing or handwriting, supporting transition, assisting with supervision at recreation and dispersal times, etc.</p> <p> That brings my comments to an end.  I would be happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I welcome the representatives of IMPACT, the National Parents Council Primary, the Department of Education and Skills and the NCSE.  Since taking over as rapporteur for the committee report on the role of the SNA, I have undertaken a wide consultation with educational stakeholders on this matter.  I have met with many groups and individuals, held a public meeting, in addition to the previous ones, for SNAs and conducted an online survey, to which I received responses from over 2,500 SNAs.  I have a great deal to say on how this will feed into it.</p>  <p>  The representatives and groups here today met the committee a year and a half ago to discuss this matter.  Their contributions have been noted and I requested this meeting in order for the groups and representatives to provide any further thoughts or observations.  Since I have taken over this role in recent months, I have had the pleasure of speaking with many special needs assistants.  The one thing that comes through, and everyone will agree, is the dedication and the passion they have for their jobs.  On one of the nights when I had a meeting, it was freezing cold, lashing rain, some of them had travelled from Dublin, and I was really grateful to them for coming out in their free time.  That is probably the first point I want to make, namely, how much of the work of SNAs is done off their own bat, often without any credit or acknowledgement.  </p>  <p>                 The SNAs are also very anxious to have their role more clearly defined.  The role is evolving.  The special needs assistants are widely recognised as being crucial in providing accessibility to mainstream education for children with additional needs and at times provide the support necessary for some children even to attend school.  Clearly they have a significant effect on the schools they work in and on our education system as a whole.  Much of my reading, discussion and first-hand experience confirms that the role of the SNA has expanded beyond the role outlined in the circular on SNAs by the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p> To best support the child and to provide the appropriate employment and expectations for the SNA, we need to work together to strike the right balance.  We cannot continue to ignore the reality which no longer matches the policy.  I have a number of questions for the panel.  I am not too sure I have time to ask the questions now.</p></speech>

I think there is a significant need, and this is something that is being reflected back to me at all time.  Let us bring it back to the basic requirement to fulfil the role of a SNA, which is three grade Ds in the junior certificate examination.  The role outlined in the circular from the Department of Education and Skills includes catheterisation, assistance with toileting or care needs and giving medication, including dealing with EpiPens.  There is no specific standardised training for this.  I was alarmed at the responses I got.  One person is actively engaged in catheterisation.  If something goes wrong, what comeback do they have?</p>  <p>  As I said, the basic qualifications are three grade Ds.  Looking at the list of the thousands of reports that have come in, the qualifications of SNAs at present are way beyond that.  In many cases the SNAs are more qualified than the teachers themselves, with some having qualifications ranging from PhD to a masters in child care, while others are nurses or people with degrees in intellectual disability.  All of them are qualified to know what is going on.  I can stand over my statement from personal experience that the SNAs are more qualified to know what is going on than the teacher who takes up his or her first job after coming out of college.  I do not want to go off topic but we also need to look at the role of the teacher and the qualification and the standard that is required for teaching.  We need a statement of priority on the SNA.</p>  <p>  I wish to comment on Ms Teresa Griffin's point on parental involvement.  As a parent of a child with special needs, I have a vested interest.  I could not agree more with Ms Griffin as very often parents have no idea what the role of the SNA is, and when the SNA is taken from their child, they see that as a perceived cut.  I think it is a good idea to have leaflets coming out but I think we need to get the message into schools that there should be more contact between the parents, the principals, the teachers and the parents.  I have gone in for an individualised education programme ,IEP, meeting every year and I have never met the SNA.  The SNA is never involved.  I will finish on that point but I will come back in later.</p></speech>

The research that backs that up has been referred to but is there any research that contradicts it in any way?  Is there evidence from international organisations that relates to the role of teaching assistants or SNAs that contradicts that in any way?  Will IMPACT comment further on its views in relation to the development and expansion of the role and IMPACT's position on it?</p>  <p>  In regard to the current number of SNAs and applications for SNAs in particular, will Ms Griffin outline to us the development in terms of the numbers of applicants for SNA posts in recent years and also the reason for the delay this year in informing school of the number of SNAs the school will have?  I understand this work is normally done in the middle of June.  Will Ms Griffin confirm the number of SNAs required to meet the demand, on which she has decided having assessed the applications received?</p></speech>

I also pay tribute to Senator Moran for the role she has undertaken as rapporteur.</p>  <p>  My question is directed to the NCSE in respect of the 3,000 refused applications.  Does the NCSE have numbers on how many of those 3,000 applicants would have had access to an SNA?  How many of the 3,000 refusals were appealed and were successful on appeal?  How many would have been referred to the Ombudsman for Children and would have been successful on appeal?  I do not know if the witnesses have the figures now but perhaps they can be provided at a later date because I am interested in knowing them.</p>  <p>  Most people are in agreement that the special needs assistant goes beyond the role as defined currently by the circular.  If that is the case and it is not the role of the SNA, because they are providing additional resources or they are doing work that goes beyond their role, and if it is not the role of the teacher, then whose role is it to pick it up?</p>  <p>  The representative from IMPACT mentioned in his contribution that the increase in the number of SNAs does not make up for lost ground.  Does he have the figure that would be needed to make up for the lost ground, given the growing demographic and student numbers entering the system?  What is his opinion on the proposal on teaching assist?  I would like him to comment on the use of the JobBridge scheme to employ SNAs?</p>  <p>  On the issue of peer support-----</p></speech>

I have noticed when I speak to principals, those on the boards of management or parents of children with special educational needs such as dyslexia dyspraxia, Asperger's syndrome or elements of all three, that there would be consensus on the part of some parents that they would not want to have a full-time SNA attached to a student because of the reasons outlined in terms of difficulties in trying to explain it to other classmates or because it would not be seen as appropriate.  Dyspraxia or Asperger's syndrome are learning difficulties but the student would have issues around toileting.  I can understand the peer support programme and I wonder how it will work.  There is no doubt that some students may need access to an SNA but may not necessarily need a full-time SNA.  </p>  <p>               I wonder how we can balance that.</p> <p> My final question relates to the Department.  Can the witnesses give us an update on the National Council for Special Education's resource allocation pilot scheme?  How many schools are involved in it?  Do they know how much it will cost to administer SNAs in accordance with that scheme?  Do they have an opinion on the failure to provide for a full National Educational Psychological Service allocation?  I think that failure needs to be addressed because it obviously ties in with the whole issue.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Moran, in particular, for the work she has done in her role as rapporteur on this important issue.  Ms Lynch of the National Parents Council - Primary suggested that "an over-dependence on SNA support can lead to social isolation".  One of the aims of any good teacher should be to make himself or herself redundant.  This will happen if the teacher's pupils disgrace him or her with the knowledge they have.  The same thing can be said of an SNA.  A parent should be very happy if his or her child no longer needs an SNA in the school situation, as long as everything else is fine at the end of the day.  We have to focus on that, but it should not be used as an excuse to take away an SNA.  Nevertheless, it is a very good point.  We should always remember that one of the roles of the National Council for Special Education and the Department of Education and Skills is to monitor that.  I am interested in the idea of peer support for pupils with special needs who need SNA support.  Does it contradict the assertion in the submission that SNA support is highly specialised?  What type of peer support is envisaged?  It is a good idea.  It can happen.  What are the limits and tolerances associated with it?  Where are the avenues for such support?</p>  <p>  I would like to say in response to the IMPACT presentation that the SNA role is developing in schools.  I would say it has reached a maturation.  I do not wish to be too critical.  I do not know whether it is fair to say that the SNA is being treated as a "dogsbody" in our schools.  Such a suggestion is very hard on teachers and, in particular, on principals.  I would like to know how or in what way this can be said to be the case.  What empirical evidence is there for it?  Have industrial relations mechanisms been invoked?  Has the question of the teacher treating the SNA like a "dogsbody" been negotiated and discussed with the Irish Primary Principals Network and other organisations?  Having worked with SNAs as a school principal for many years, I find that suggestion very hurtful.  I do not consider it to be true.  I ask that it be explained to me.  I was disappointed that the IMPACT submission never mentioned the children at all in terms of the role of the SNA.  If IMPACT has a problem with the INTO or any other group, it should bring it to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It should let people know that their fellow workers are treating other workers like a "dogsbody".</p></speech>

I thank Senator Moran for bringing a focus to this relevant and important issue.  It is clear from her contribution that she has done a great deal of background work on it.  I genuinely and heartily welcome this committee's focus on the role of SNAs.  This issue has been a passion of mine for my entire professional life, as a parent, as a politician and as a former principal.  Special needs education has always mattered to me dearly.  I genuinely welcome the opportunity to bring a focus to it today.</p>  <p>  I want to begin by commending Ms Lynch, who probably summed up what I have been feeling on this issue for quite some time.  I spent much of my time as a principal and as a classroom teacher trying to advise parents that less is sometimes more when it comes to resources.  Special needs learning is not a numbers game.  Ms Lynch hit the nail on the head, from my experience and my perspective, when she said that "parents often get caught in a fight for any resource rather than a fight for the right resource".  There are good SNAs and SNAs who are not so good, just as there are good teachers and teachers who are not so good.  I used to see children going out to resource teachers for 20 or 30 minutes of the school day.  A good resource teacher is great for the child and for everybody, but a resource teacher who is not so good - they exist as well - will not be of much benefit to the child.  Children in the latter set of circumstances can lose out on what is going on in the classroom socially and academically and in terms of a general overview of what is happening in the room.</p>  <p>  We have to be careful not to get too tied up on numbers.  While resources are important, numbers do not represent the bottom line.  This is not like a maths academy.  Special needs learning is much more complicated than that.  It is really crucial for the role of the SNA to be brought to the fore in any discussion.  Let us call a spade a spade - there are many SNAs who are quite unhelpful.  Parents are beginning to realise that if the SNA is doing the homework or the sum for the child, because he or she sees that as the role of the SNA, it is very disruptive for the child's learning.  Good awareness on everybody's part is needed to ensure people are clear on the role of SNAs.  We need to ensure each SNA does not cross the line by becoming an enabler who prevents the child from participating and learning and who is a disruptive force rather than a productive one.</p>  <p>  I cannot stress enough the importance of the discussion we are having here today.  I would like to raise a couple of issues.  I suggest that Mr. Robinson's contribution missed the point of this meeting.  Perhaps it is the committee's fault for not advising him appropriately.  I would have preferred to hear the union set out some of the feedback from its members who are SNAs on the ground about their frustrations with the role, their experience and understanding of the role and their desire for clarification of the role.  That is what I was hoping to get from the union's presentation.  Instead, I felt that it was a party political broadcast on behalf of IMPACT.</p>  <p>  I would like to ask a few questions.  One of my biggest fears and challenges relates to the transition from primary school to secondary school.  This issue has not been addressed here.  Do any of the witnesses have a contribution to make on that?  I am thinking particularly of Ms Griffin and of the official from the Department of Education and Skills.  Where are we in this regard?  It seems to me that special needs provision at primary school level is fairly well advanced.  It has come on in leaps and bounds.  I am quite proud of the services that are available in our primary schools, but I have huge concerns about the transition to second level and the level of provision at that level.  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' views on that.</p>  <p>  Ms Griffin suggested that the role of SNAs is not understood by parents.  I appreciated that she has presented a leaflet.  I look forward to getting it in a while.  I imagine we are 20 years into the SNA journey.  I am not sure, but I am guessing that there were SNAs in our schools 20 years ago.  Have we really spent 20 years trying to get this across to parents?  Have we taken our eye off the ball?  </p>  <p>               This is not about apportioning blame.  I am simply wondering why, after 20 years, parents still do not understand the role they have.  One of the major problems is that parents feel they need a full-time special needs assistant or ten or 12 hours' resource teaching and so forth.  This is the key to the issue.  As long as parents do not fully understand the benefit and impact of these resources on their children's education, we will continue to lose the battle.  While I welcome the leaflet, I wonder whether enough has been done in this regard over the past 20 years. </p> <p> I recently submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on the role of special needs assistants in individual education plans, IEPs.  At a recent meeting with me, representatives of Autism West Cork were at a loss to understand the reason special needs assistants do not attend meetings on the preparation of an individual education plan.  It appears this is practice is widespread.  I find it extraordinary and a matter of great concern that the special needs assistant is not present when the group of people who know the child best is preparing an individual education plan.  The parents I met all understood that special needs assistants are not allowed to attend these meetings.  This issue needs to be addressed.  </p> <p> The other issue is the need to address the transition cycle.</p></speech>

I will make one observation before asking a few questions.  Unlike many other members, I do not have teaching experience.  As a parent and layperson, the contributions I have heard and the submissions I have read have opened my eyes.  I, too, had come to assume that people would fight for more resource hours or special needs assistants without digging into what they were getting for the resources being allocated.</p>  <p>  Since Circular 30/14 was issued, has there been any feedback on whether the allocation of special needs assistant has improved?  Is the position now satisfactory or could additional work be done to build on the circular?  Has an exercise been done on the approach of other jurisdictions to special needs assistants in primary schools?  I refer, in particular, to jurisdictions with education systems that are similar to the Irish system.  Did discussions take place on the possibility of allocating special needs assistants to preschool children with a view to reducing the requirement for further SNA allocations through the primary school network on the basis of the progress made in preschool?</p></speech>

Before I put my questions, I apologise to the witnesses as I must leave to attend another meeting before they respond.</p>  <p>  Senator Moran drew attention to the qualifications required to become a special needs assistant.  What plans does the Department have to assist the professionalisation of the SNA role?  What will be done to assist current SNAs to acquire the in-service training they need to improve their skills to a level that would allow them to be recognised as professionals, rather than as glorified childminders, as they are sometimes viewed?</p>  <p>  When a child with special needs starts a school, whether at primary or second level, a briefing session should be provided attended by the child, his or her parents and the special needs assistant.  Has time been provided at the start of the school year to allow class teachers to carry out this type of briefing session to ensure everyone is on the same hymn sheet regarding the role of special needs assistants?</p>  <p>  In the case of all children with special needs, regular meetings should take place.  Classroom teachers do this by osmosis almost in that it is done on an informal basis.  This process should be formalised, however, because as Senator Jim D'Arcy stated, success is when it becomes possible to withdrawn the special needs assistant to allow a child to stand alone.  Are we facilitating the allocation of special needs assistants to children who no longer need them because they have settled into the system, as it were? </p>  <p>  I have some specific questions for the representatives of IMPACT.  I will not engage in the criticism we have heard of IMPACT's presentation.  I have always believed that a person's role is affected by the way in which he or she is treated.  How have employment conditions affected the role of special needs assistants?</p></speech>

It is welcome that the union is willing to participate in such a process, which is clearly the reason Mr. Robinson and Ms McCrohan are in attendance.  We commonly criticise the Teachers Union of Ireland and the Irish National Teachers Organisation for their tendency to use appearances before the joint committee as an opportunity to raise issues that are not necessarily relevant to the meeting.  IMPACT is not alone, therefore, in being criticised, although it clearly has a role to play in this regard.  Has it received feedback from its members about their role?  Several members have raised this issue.</p></speech>

There are three or four different types of special needs assistant.  The first is where the SNA is focused solely on meeting the care needs of the child, for example, in toileting, etc.  The second is where the SNA, under the teacher's instructions, keeps the child on course academically.  We take into consideration some of the points made about making sure children are self-sufficient at the end of the process.  That is the goal.  The reason the people we represent become a special needs assistants is that they have a vocation to help children.  Special needs assistants are also being asked to perform a third role where they perform, without any training, invasive procedures such as catheterisation.  </p>  <p>         Recently I carried out a survey, not the formal SurveyMonkey one but by sending an e-mail asking people if they were involved and, if so, who gave the training.  Out of all the responses, the vast majority were trained by the parent to perform catheterisation, an invasive procedure, which could go wrong.  I am not a medical practitioner but I understand one could puncture the bladder and that is severe.  Do we have to wait for that to happen before we provide training?  Our SNAs are not saying, and neither are we, that they would not perform it because it is a care need.  If one is going to ask people to perform such procedures or all the other procedures, however, then one has to train them formally.  The other point I would make is that they are willing.  We provided sensory integration training a number of times up until this year.  On a Saturday morning we could have 150 people in the Red Cow on their own time.  They were there and wanted to be trained and wanted to develop.  As Senator Mary Moran said, some of them are highly qualified they came into the job because of their vocation and want to develop, so there is a role for them to develop.  The most important phrase I heard today came from Senator Moran who spoke about striking the balance and ensuring, at the end of the day, that the child is looked after.  That is what it is about.</p> <p> I was accused earlier of making a party political broadcast.  I resent that remark on the basis that there is no area of my submission that does not represent the views of my members.  Everything I have said today about the lack of security, fragmentation of posts and lack of training are all the views of my members.  To say we are making a party political broadcast on behalf of IMPACT is not correct.  IMPACT is its members.  The members give us their views, we feed them back out.  That is what I have done today.</p></speech>

It is a complex issue.  A number of members raised the issue about, perhaps, the potential for in-service and so on.  We agree entirely with our colleagues from IMPACT that SNAs are, on the whole, very willing to engage in training.  We recognise that they are very open to the discussion.  As has been mentioned, we recognise that many SNAs are significantly higher qualified than the minimum requirements laid down.  None the less, we recognise there is a need for ongoing training.  It is complex.  For example, catheterisation, which is invasive, refers to a very small number of children.  Obviously, the Department would not support CPD for every SNA in the State in that particular practice.  It should only be available for those who are engaging in it.  Similarly, Irish Sign Language is a requirement for some SNA positions and, again, it would not be appropriate to train everyone in Irish Sign Language.  That is a common characteristic of the SNA scheme.</p>  <p>  A varied group of tasks is undertaken depending on the actual care needs of the child.  Clearly, the training that is required needs to be specific to the tasks being undertaken by the SNA rather than the general training made available to everyone.  Part of that can be addressed through the recruitment process.  One hires the right person for the job rather than have a general person.  In the event that one wants somebody to do Irish Sign Language, ISL, if one can find someone who is able to do it and is willing to come in, that is fine, and maybe some ongoing training may be required.  The Department is conscious of it and is open to it and we look forward to the recommendations of the report of this committee in that area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2074" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Griffin" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015070100002#L00500"><p>On training, the NCSE is very clear.  Where children have specific needs the people who are supporting those children should receive appropriate training.  For example, if it is a specific piece of assistive technology, it is important the SNA who helps and supports the child in its use should be trained.  We in the NCSE are quite clear on that.</p>  <p>  On some of the more specific questions, which I will not take in any particular order, on was to explain the role of the SNA.  I get depressed that we are still explaining the role of the SNA some 20 years on, but it is not simply just to parents.  We have just finished a round of consultation on autism.  This is policy advice which we will publish shortly.  It was not only parents but also teachers, principals and school management who ask about SNAs.  Sometimes a teacher would say they thought the SNA was to help them in the classroom as opposed to helping a specific child.  I do not know what it is but we have tried to be helpful in our information booklet for parents.  We have had positive feedback on that general information booklet for parents, which is now on its third run and which we are going to bring up to date this year.  The SNA scheme is a handy flyer for people to take away because it is really important we are all on board on the same thing.  It is a worry.  One of the reasons is because the role is so broad.  It is not a specific role, but it is particular to the child and the child's needs.  Therefore, one will find in one school the SNA is doing one thing and in another school an SNA is doing something else and in a third school something else again.  With respect to the Department, it is very difficult to capture that in a circular.  Parents are talking to each other and teachers are talking to each other and all of a sudden there is a multiplicity of roles, so we have to try to be quite clear.  It is an easy to read leaflet and I hope it will help in the process.</p>  <p>  On the issue about any research that teaching assistants are good or what is happening in other jurisdictions, again this is an issue the NCSE looked at in the preparation of its 2013 policy advice.  It is also an issue we have looked at in terms of the current advice we are preparing on autism.  It is fair to say that every jurisdiction we have looked at experiences difficulties in the area of, as Ms Lynch would say, the appropriate supports for children who have special educational needs.  There is no one model that people would say is the correct or perfect model.  They range from some jurisdictions that have absolutely no SNAs to some jurisdictions where children who have quite profound special educational needs have no teachers, and there is everything in between.  It is quite difficult and the research is therefore quite difficult to interpret in that way.</p>  <p>  When trying to consider objectively what are the right supports for children with special educational needs, we have a look at the research.  In some longitudinal research published a couple of years ago in the UK it was clear that while one could make a case for teaching assistants or one could make a case for more teaching or whatever, in general and not just for children with special educational needs, the evidence is that the longer a child remains with a teaching assistant, the poorer the academic outcome.  That is quite strong evidence.  The other evidence, which is quite widely regarded, is the impact of the teacher and the quality of the teaching.  On Senator Mary Moran's point about the teacher, people who are newly qualified, the role of the role of the teacher and so on, while that is an issue, it is the professional teacher, the quality of their teaching and how they understand how a particular child learns is what is important in terms of delivering better outcomes, which is what all of us would like to drive.</p>  <p>  If it is acceptable to the committee I will leave the questions relating to the current allocation process to the Department which I think is happy to deal with those.</p>  <p>  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien raised a number of issues about the 3,000 who were refused applications and how many appealed and the role of the Ombudsman, who is not present.  </p>  <p>         I do not have the figures in front of me, but from memory, a couple of years ago, out of a total of 24,000 applications for resource teaching and SNA support, we had 150 appeals, and of those, the majority were for SNAs.  As a result of the appeal, three or four of these received SNA support.  Last year, there were approximately 100 formal appeals, but I am not aware how many went to the Ombudsman.</p> <p> In regard to individual education plans, IEPs, and SNAs not being at the IEP meetings, while this would not be a formal matter for the NCSE, we maintain strongly that whoever is in a position to assist in the child's development and the development of the IEP should be at the meetings.</p> <p> On transition from one system to another, we looked at this issue closely and we are doing work currently on providing advice on transition from preschool to primary level and on to post-primary level and on transition into or from a special school and on to special classes.  We hope to have that work completed this year.  We have spoken to parents, teachers, school management bodies and advocacy groups and much work has been done, particularly in regard to transition from primary to post-primary level.  Significant work has been done on this.  Using an iPad, one school filmed the entire school, filmed where the child coming into post-primary would go, where the child would sit and who the teachers would be.  The parent and child were able to download that film and rehearse and reinforce it over the summer break.  There is positive work being done in regard to transition.  Special education and inclusion is well embedded at primary level.  Good work is being done at second level, but more is required in some schools.</p> <p> I am happy to answer any further questions members may wish to bring to my attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2076" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015070100002#M00200"><p>Our submission points out that training is important.  We feel there should be basic training for all SNAs and this should not just be based on their specific role in schools.  We have identified areas that should be part of training, such as understanding children's needs, communications skills and basic child protection.  All SNAs should have these basic requirements before they take up an SNA role.</p>  <p>  Much has been said about the physical care needs of children and extended training for that area.  As we said in our submission, SNAs are being increasingly assigned to children who have complex behavioural needs as well.  The recent 2014 circular states that part of the SNA's role covers preserving the safety of the pupil and others with whom the pupil is in contact and assisting to ensure the prevention of self-injurious or destructive behaviour.  The circular states this significant role is the responsibility of the SNA.  We would argue that anyone who has that role within the classroom should receive significant training to carry it out, because anyone who tries to carry out that role without receiving the significant training required may not be able to do it and children or staff could become harmed.  Also, because they are not aware of what they are doing, they could make the situation worse by not having the skills to intervene effectively or early enough in the behavioural issues.  We need to concentrate not only on the physical requirements in terms of additional training but also on the behavioural requirements.</p>  <p>  In regard to why we and parents are still not clear of the role of SNAs, while I agree with Ms Griffin, the role is also unclear because of the challenges faced by schools in terms of supporting children with special educational needs.  A principal in a school has two options for allocation of support for children, either the resource teacher or the SNA.  In terms of getting an allocation for resource hours, the role of the resource teacher is much more clearly defined regarding assessment of how many hours will be allocated to children.  The SNA is the most flexible role within the school in terms of trying to get additional resources to support children.  As long as this continues to be the case, parents will fight for any resource they can get rather than the right resource.</p>  <p>  Often, the right resource for children in schools in the need to access the curriculum are not available for the principal or the teacher to allocate.  The need might be speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or behavioural therapy.  However, these are not at the disposal of the school.  Where there is this vacuum of the right resources, the most flexible resource is always fought for, and this is the SNA.  I am not sure whether people do not understand this, but people are so desperate for a resource, that they would rather have the, as it were, not right quite fit resource than no resource at all.  We are hearing that the SNA has started to fill that gap.</p>  <p>  On transition from primary to secondary level, Ms Griffin is right about the work being done.  Over the next few years, it will be interesting to see how the new education passport works with children moving from primary to secondary level.  A section on this deals specifically with special educational needs and also a section for the child to give feedback on individual issues for him or her.  There is also an opportunity for the parent to provide feedback.  This passport has the potential to give the new school a good, rounded picture of the child coming in to it.  If these reports are made in good time, as they are supposed to do, this will give the new school good information to follow up on with families that need additional resources.</p>  <p>  A number of people asked about peer support.  Peer support is already happening as children, by their nature, support their peers.  This informal peer support is vital and I believe children provide it naturally.  There is also an opportunity to formalise peer support by way of systems such as mentor and buddy systems.  Clearly, there are roles other children within a school should not be doing in terms of care needs and toileting but there are significant areas where children can naturally support other children.  If they are supported in doing that, this has benefits that reach far beyond the two individual children.  It creates active citizenship, supports the children and supports society because of the type of society it breeds and the modelling that takes place in the school.  Peer support is not just about individual children but the kind of school we create by having that kind of support within the school system.  Peer support will not fit all the care needs but we need to see other children as part of the solution for children with additional needs.</p></speech>

Perhaps they do not need training as teaching assistants, but they should receive training in recognising the needs of the child under the direction of the teacher.  I know it is easy for members to see the SNA as providing a care need, because that is the role as described on paper.  However, it is completely different in the school.  Many SNAs already carry out a lot of these functions.  I see the need to regularise the situation and to get the balance right.</p></speech>

Children with difficulties do not naturally integrate with other children easily.  It is only with some sort of adult assistance, supervision, encouragement or training that that will happen.  They will not gravitate towards each other.  I know this from my experience in school.  Children who are different or who have difficulties and, in particular, children who do not have allocated support will be isolated, left out and excluded because they are not good at sports, for instance, and the rest of the children like to play football or sports at break time.  Children with difficulties or who are different tend to be isolated unless there is an SNA who will encourage the other children to play.  I was very active in that respect myself.</p> <p> The role of the SNA has existed for 18 years in the mainstream setting.  It was introduced in 1997 by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I do not think anyone at the time anticipated how much parents of children with difficulties wanted their children to be educated in the mainstream setting and for them to be fully interactive with other children, their peers, with whom they would be playing in their communities at home.  They did not want them to be segregated in special schools.  Until then, if a child had any kind of a difficulty or was different in any way at all, the child was sent to a special school.  We have made tremendous progress since 1997.  Everyone here would acknowledge that the success has been, in the main, down to the passion and commitment of special needs assistants in supporting the children.  All the training they have had to date they have undertaken on their own time and at their own expense.</p> <p> There are fantastic schools and principals which work very closely with us.  Mr. Dessie Robinson, my three colleagues and I, who represent special needs assistants in schools, find that when we go to a school to work out an issue, we tend to build great relationships with most of the principals.  Usually the issue is down to a misunderstanding about the role of the special needs assistant.  Clarification is brought and it is identified that the SNA is not a whole-school resource or an assistant to everyone who needs a bit of photocopying or laminating done but is there for a specific purpose.  Special needs assistants are recruited specifically to assist the school to provide for children with assessed additional care needs.  Not every child with additional needs who needs support is lucky enough to get the support.  In those cases, best practice is that the SNA will provide access to the children who need it even though they have not been allocated it.  There is general goodwill throughout the school and everyone is on the same playing field and on the same team.</p> <p> I was one of the SNAs fortunate to get one of the 100 positions in 1997.  From day one, I was involved in preparing the care plans for children, even before individual education plans were formalised, and I was always treated as part of the team.  This was always considered best practice.  We had multidisciplinary teams, including people from Enable Ireland who would come into the school, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  The teacher and I would work with the occupational therapist and physiotherapist.  We would integrate those sessions into PE and elsewhere.  We had a great awareness of the need to ensure the child was sitting properly, for example, or that the child needed a footstool to keep their posture right.</p> <p> I am aware of the system in England where there is the position of teaching assistant.  Ms Teresa Griffin is right.  The teaching assistant is for the whole school and not specifically for children with special needs.  The difference in the role of the teaching assistant is he or she can take over the class when a teacher has a course day and the children are not divided up the way they are here.  The assistants have little or nothing at all to do with children with special needs.  There are special needs assistants in England who are assigned to children with special needs.  They have three grades: classroom assistant, special needs assistant and teaching assistant.  They all have different roles and responsibilities.</p> <p> It is not fair or true to say the SNA has no role to play in terms of supporting the education or teaching of a child with special educational needs.  It is imperative that children with special educational needs are taught by a qualified class teacher.  That is a given.  Every child has a right to be taught by a qualified class teacher and we are very much advocates of that position.  However, in reality, the SNA must, when necessary or appropriate, under the direction of the teacher, support that academic work and keep the child on task and let the teacher know if the child is having difficulties in order that the teacher can spend some more time on the lesson or, perhaps, take the rest of the children and keep an eye on them while they are assigned a task when the teacher is dealing one-to-one with the child.</p> <p> I will conclude by reiterating that we are very grateful to Senator Moran for taking the matter to this level and for bringing about the report.  We are grateful for the invitation here today to give the view of our members.  It is a role about which I am passionate because I still consider myself an SNA.  Although I work with IMPACT, I work closely with the schools, special needs assistants and non-teaching staff in schools.  IMPACT is extremely committed to advocating and campaigning for support for children with special needs and to advocating for every child who needs support to get it. </p></speech>

The number of SNAs has increased each year for the past number of years, essentially since the scheme was introduced by and large.  Last year we announced the numbers to be allocated on 25 June.  This year we have not yet been in a position to make the announcement.  On behalf of the Department, I very much regret this has not been possible so far.  The NCSE has provided us with the details of the number of SNAs required to meet demand from the beginning of the next school year.  I can inform the committee that demand has increased this year.  The Department has had a long engagement over the past while with the NCSE to do the diligence bit on those numbers and ensure it is all appropriate.  It has informed the Minister of the issue and she is currently considering the matter with her Government colleagues.  Until that process is concluded, I am constrained from disclosing the numbers involved but I can give the Chairman a commitment that I will immediately inform the committee when in a position to do so.</p></speech>

I asked a question about proper respect, value, and SNAs being considered a general dogsbody by school principals.  Having said that, this debate has been useful.  I would definitely go lion hunting with Mr. Dessie Robinson.  I have no doubt if he had my back that I would be safe.  I know his first duty is to look after his members.</p>  <p>  For a long time, an SNA has been appointed to a school consequent on the needs of the pupil.  </p>  <p>               Within that construct a special needs assistant can perform many valuable duties within the classroom, including non-teaching duties.  This would free the teacher and give him or her more time to work with the pupil with special needs.  This is one of the most crucial parts of the set-up.  It links to the individual education plans and everything else.  It is a difficult situation.  As when a child is taken out of the classroom for learning support or resource teaching, in a whole-school sense the teacher and the staff must figure out the loss as well as the gain to the pupil of that withdrawal.  It is a complex situation.  I have visited many schools this year, including autism units and mainstream schools.  As is the case with all the members of the deputations, I imagine, I have seen how the role of the SNA has developed and the valuable work done by SNAs.  We can develop on that.  I am not keen to see limits being applied to the role.  Flexibility is important as well.</p></speech>

It is a concern for parents all the time when they put their 13 year old or 14 year old into secondary school and put an adult sitting alongside them as an SNA.  It is a difficulty.  Perhaps the Department, Ms Griffin, Ms Lynch or IMPACT have some views on the matter.  It is an emerging challenge.</p>  <p>  I thank Ms McCrohan for the clarification on 17 or 18 years of age.  It started out in primary school.  Secondary school is a latecomer to the party and we do not have much experience of it.  I am interested in the experience of the stakeholders and their suggestions for dealing with it.  How do they give assurances to parents on how it is being dealt with?</p>  <p>  Someone mentioned preschool.  I know it is isolated but in our area in west Cork, children with special learning needs attending preschool can get SNAs through the good offices of CoAction, the body tasked with the role there.  I appreciate not too many areas in the country have that rolled out at this level.  It is certainly in our area.</p>  <p>  I thank Ms McCrohan, who has brought a good deal of passion and understanding.  Clearly her experience as an SNA in the system has come to the fore.  I share her understanding.  In her day and in my day when I was practising in the classroom as a principal and a teacher, it was a given that the SNA attended the preparation of the individual education plans, no questions asked.  In fact, the SNA was seen as one of the strongest contributors.  Although he was not an educationalist, he was the link and he filled in.  Ms Lynch put it well when she referred to that.</p>  <p>  I referred to a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister recently on an issue and I would appreciate if Mr. Mulkerrins would come back to me or the committee on the matter.  Will the Department consider reissuing some sort of clarification?  As I understand it there is an issue given that many SNAs do not attend the preparation of IEPs.  I would be concerned if that were standard practice.  I have reasonable grounds to suggest that is more widespread than we might have thought.  Will the Department consider reissuing a directive or some clarification on the matter to schools?  Will the Department confirm whether it believes this is appropriate and whether it is willing to do the same in due course?  It need not be done today.</p></speech>

It has given me confidence that I am going in the right direction.  The information I am getting is feeding into the process.  I have no wish to stray off the point, but with regard to Ms Griffin's comments, when we are looking at getting the information out, it is not a question of one size fits all.  We can allocate teachers to a school and have a given pupil-teacher ratio, but when an SNA is allocated to a school, there are many different complex needs within that.  That is where a personalised involvement is important.  We have not mentioned them today but that is where the role of the special education needs organiser comes in.  It is vital they are involved.  I am not having a go at SENOs but sometimes they can be few and difficult to contact and communicate with parents.  Indeed, many parents are unaware of the involvement of SENOs.  That is important.</p>  <p>  The deputation from the Department of Education and Skills made certain points.  I totally agree.  This goes back to the point made about getting the information out and about exactly what parents can expect with the role.  I believe the SNA needs to be involved in all the IEPs.</p>  <p>  I know Senator D'Arcy and Deputy Daly come from the primary end.  Unlike some of my colleagues, I come from the secondary end of it.  Even today we are having a different discussion from some years ago when we discussed the role of the SNA.  I saw it myself at the beginning and, fortunately, we have moved away from the direction where the SNA's role included photocopying and making tea.  Thank God we have moved away from all that and it has not even arisen at this meeting.  That is a major point.</p>  <p>  What is the Department's view of providing continuing professional development to SNAs?  It needs to be included.  We need to have a departmental view on a review of the entry requirements to be an SNA.  I have met many SNAs and raised the point with them.  Many were unaware of the level of qualifications and automatically presumed they were higher.</p>  <p>  I have no wish to start putting a negative impact on it but one of the questions I asked in the report related to respect.  One of the questions on the survey was whether SNAs believed they were respected in their job.  While 52.9% of almost 3,000 replies answered "Yes", 8% said "No" and 39% said "Sometimes".  This is something we should consider.  There is excellent work going on, which I know from meeting those involved.  The majority will say they are respected.  I suppose it would be the same among my teaching colleagues present if we put a survey to them and asked them whether they believed they were responsible.  Some of the comments I got back were interesting.  Some said their duties included cleaning up after a child if she was sick or cleaning up after a child after lunch or whatever.  Some said this was not their role.  In my role as a teacher I have done that.  I could have said it was not my job but when a person is in a given situation, everyone is flexible with their position.  That is something that needs to come on.  We need to let our SNAs know they are respected.  They need to know they can come into the staffroom at the same time as everyone else and not be made have their breaks at a different time.  We need to ensure they feel respected.  I thank everyone for coming before the committee.  It has been very good.  </p>  <p>                 Peer support play different roles in primary and secondary schools.  We need to ensure there is someone over those children.  Often, the children who volunteer to be buddies or offer peer support can overindulge in it.  For their safety, we need to be careful.</p></speech>

We provided the information at the same time that we did last year or even a few days earlier.<br/><br/>Senator Moran asked about SENOs.  It is important for everyone to realise that there are 80 SENOs, 180,000 parents whose children have special educational needs and 4,000 schools that are seeking supports.  It is sometimes difficult to contact SENOs, but if they get calls or messages are left, they get back to parents and schools.<br/><br/>This year, we have done something that I announced when I last appeared before the committee.  We provided parental information evenings throughout the State, which were attended by 900 parents of children newly diagnosed with special educational needs and led by our SENOs.  We worked with the HSE.  The response from parents was overwhelmingly positive.  It is to try to get that-----</p></speech>

However, most of the system is good.  Probably all of the SNAs are doing their best and most of them are excellent.</p>  <p>  We propose to review the scheme shortly.  There should be an ongoing, rolling review.  We have only had the circular in place for a year and cannot say that there has been a significant amount of feedback on how well it is bedding in.  It will take time.  We did not want the circular to have such a large impact as to frighten parents, schools or SNAs, but we are trying to put a little shape on it so that everyone has a better understanding of the SNA's role.</p>  <p>  An interesting phrase was used, namely, that reality no longer matched policy.  The objective of our review will be to try to bring reality and policy closer together.  The system will never be perfect, but we will continue striving to make it grow.</p>  <p>  I get anxious, particularly when I hear that individual education plan, IEP, meetings are happening without the presence of SNAs.  It is a feature of the circular that, where an SNA is provided, a care plan should be in place.  I do not see how a care plan can be agreed without the SNA being involved in the discussion.  To respond to Deputy Daly, if further clarification is required, we will consider providing it.  It may be possible to do it by informing the system of the need to implement the circular fully.</p>  <p>  I realise that Deputy O'Brien has left, but he raised the issue of care supports.  It was also raised by Senator Craughwell.  It is a question of moving from individually allocated SNAs to shared resources.  </p>  <p>         Senator Craughwell asked whether that was a funding decision.  Often the implication is more a question of causing a problem in the system.  It is certainly not a funding decision.  The Department&rsquo;s view is that the historic association between child and SNA was inappropriate.  It was an obvious consequence of the fact that when integration or inclusion started and there were only a few children with identified special needs in schools, it would always be the case that SNAs were identified with the children.  That was an undesirable feature of the scheme and we have moved strongly to get away from that so that schools would have better control of the resource and parents would not be misguided into believing their child needed that person at his or her side the whole time.  That is generally detrimental, and becomes more so as children develop and approach the time when they are transferring into post-primary school and are achieving a degree of independence.  This answers a question we were asked earlier: as the children said to the NCSE, when it was researching this, the last thing they want when reaching independence is an adult, sometimes an unfamiliar one, stapled to their sides.  We need to be very cautious about how we determine a care need and provide for it for a child who is developing into being a young man or woman in school.</p> <p> Several people raised the issue about care needs assistants in preschools.  I sit on a working group chaired by our colleagues in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs which is considering this matter, and the group hopes to report sometime in the latter part of this year.  We are being assisted by colleagues on the NCSE.  We hope to have clarification on that area in due course.  We all recognise that early intervention is very important, but it needs to be elaborated and clarified.  There is a fair bit of work being done on that.</p> <p> Continuing professional development, CPD, was raised.  I fully accept the need for training.  There is complexity about how that should be delivered.  Ongoing CPD is meaningless unless we have a structured programme for it.  We make provision for boards of management to provide individualised, tailored training.  There is training from the Middletown Centre for Autism, to which we give funding to provide some training for schools, parents and families to cater for children with significant autism difficulties.  We will be able to deal with that in the context of our forthcoming review.</p> <p> I am concerned when I hear that 8% of SNAs said in surveys that they feel they are not respected.  We all need to consider their relationship within the school.  That can be improved with proper clarity.  When we issue clarification, we are anxious not to be over- or under-prescriptive.  We need to provide guidance but we do not need to regulate the hell out of the scheme because that would be in nobody's interests.  We are anxious to ensure that the scheme develops in such a way that SNAs feel valued and respected, that their role is clear and their engagement within the school is clear.  That means educating teachers, principals and boards of management as well as SNAs. </p></speech>

They should be there too.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Daly&rsquo;s question about post-primary, we represent parents of primary-level children, but it affects children at the higher end of primary school too.  As they get older, their voice in SNA allocation in their time in the school and how their IEP should look needs to become more important.  The young person&rsquo;s voice is very important in deciding how SNA involvement works in order to manage the stigmatisation for older children.</p>  <p>  This kind of conversation about the role of the SNA is very important, but it is also very important for us to suggest the conversation needs to move to the higher level of how we provide supports to children with special educational needs in school more generally.  People do not understand the role of the SNA.  Although a great deal of resources go into special education, as long as the system is constructed around the resource teacher, the teacher and the SNA, children still cannot access the resources they need in the sector to get their education.  That discussion needs to be broadened.  Speech and language, behavioural and occupational therapies need to be available to the school to support the child&rsquo;s access to education, rather than being separate as they are now.</p></speech>

Since then, JobBridge in the education sector has been reviewed and that role has ceased.</p></speech>

This is a new world.  It was good at the time.</p>  <p>  We need SNAs to be given the respect of knowing at the end of the school year whether they have a job in September.  No other profession within the educational system would allow that to happen and not be marching on the streets.  For the past two years they have been left till the last minute.  It is unfair and not respectful to SNAs.</p>  <p>  Everybody agrees that training must be provided, but the budget to match that training needs to be provided too.  When we sought training for SNAs, the Department said it did not give training.  We have had to use the resources of IMPACT to ensure training is provided for SNAs.</p> <p>  The real issue for SNAs is security of tenure.  If we are to develop the role we must keep the best people in place.  The majority of SNAs are female.  They are not doing this for pin money.  They do it to make a living as well as to provide a service.  They need security of tenure.  When they get that, we can develop the role.</p></speech>

We asked if we could put bums on seats by including the SNAs in the training, because we wanted them to get the same training as the teachers, especially if they were to look after children with challenging behaviour, particularly children with autism, so that they would all be singing from the same hymn sheet.  However, we were told this was not allowed.  Some education centres did allow it, but the SNAs could not get the accreditation and claim they were there.  They were like ghosts on the seats.</p></speech>

For two years we went around the country talking to special needs assistants about their role and the appropriate duties they should be carrying out.  We always emphasised how important it was that they were not velcroed to the child, but promoted independence.  The care they give pupils should be the same as they would give to their own children, otherwise they should be looking for a different job.  We also emphasised that if they were working as a whole-school resource, taking on duties that should be assigned to the secretary, caretaker or cleaner, they were diluting the service they should be providing to a child with disabilities whose support was hard won from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.</p>  <p>  I plead with the NCSE and the Department that when they are devising policies on allocating support, they bear in mind that support is vitally important in infant stages and in formative years, particularly first year in secondary school.  The support does not have to be visible but can exist in the background.  If a child is not succeeding socially in infants, that child is not going to make friends and will have a very difficult time all the way up along.  I have seen it happen.  If the teacher is fire-fighting all the time because of a child's challenging behaviour, waiting to see if the child is going to settle down, and there is no-one to assist with settling the child and the whole class down, this can contribute to a bad outcome for the child.</p>  <p>  In first year of second level, the special needs assistant's role is just to organise the child from a distance and make sure he or she is succeeding socially.  These are the children who drop out of school and for whom mental health is a huge issue.  They are experiencing a lot of change when they are just coming in to secondary school.  Even if it was just for first year, I ask that there be consideration of this.</p></speech>

(1) In this section&mdash;<blockquote>&ldquo;Act of 1959&rdquo; means the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959;<br /><br />&ldquo;Act of 2003&rdquo; means the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003;<br /><br />&ldquo;Act of 2009&rdquo; means the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Act 2009.</blockquote>(2) The Act of 1959 is hereby amended by the deletion of sections 5 and 6.<br /><br />(3) The Act of 2003 is hereby amended by the deletion of section 15 (as amended by section 11 of the Act of 2009) and the substitution therefor of the following sections: <blockquote><b>&ldquo;Appointment of the Secretary General</b><br /><br />15. (1) The Secretary General of the Service (in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Secretary General&rsquo;) is the chief executive of the Commission.<blockquote>(2) The Secretary General shall be the principal officer of the Service and the officer accountable for the accounts of the Commission for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts 1866 to 1998.<br /><br />(3) Subject to subsection (4), the Secretary General shall be appointed by the Commission following consultation by the Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with leaders or designated leaders of groups or parties in either House of the Oireachtas who are not represented on the membership of the Commission at that time.<br /><br />(4) The selection of a candidate for appointment as Secretary General shall be by means of an open competition, by the committee known as the Top Level Appointments Committee, who shall recommend, in order of preference, not more than three persons for appointment to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission provided if the Commission fail to agree to the recommendation of any of the persons for appointment, then a new competition for the vacancy shall be held and the provisions of this section shall apply accordingly.<br /><br />(5) For the purposes of this section an open competition shall mean a competition whose terms with respect of the eligibility of persons to compete in it shall not be such as to limit such eligibility to persons who are civil servants.  </blockquote><b>Assignment of Clerk and Clerk-Assistant functions in each House</b><br /><br />15A. (1) The functions of the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann may be assigned from time to time from among the staff of the Commission by the Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in consultation with the leaders or designated leaders of the parties or groups in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Commission.<blockquote>(2) The functions of Clerk of Seanad &Eacute;ireann may be assigned from time to time from among the staff of the Commission by the Chairman of Seanad &Eacute;ireann in consultation with the leaders of the groups in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the Commission.<br /><br />(3) The functions of Clerk-Assistant of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the Clerk-Assistant of Seanad &Eacute;ireann may be assigned from time to time from among the staff of the Commission by the Secretary General following consultation with the relevant Chairman of the House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>  <p>Amendment No. 1  is a long amendment but it boils down to one simple issue.  The purpose of the Bill is to appoint a Secretary General for the Houses of the Oireachtas but I propose the inclusion of a section stating &quot;the Secretary General shall be appointed by the Commission following consultation by the Chairman of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with leaders or designated leaders of groups or parties in either House of the Oireachtas who are not represented on the membership of the Commission at that time.&quot;  Essentially, the process involves the Top Level Appointments Committee and a recommendation being made to the Ceann Comhairle, who brings it to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  However, I propose to broaden the basis of that, to get a greater level of acceptability among all the political groupings and from people who are not in political groupings and who are not represented on the commission and to get a greater level of consent on the appointment of the Secretary General, rather than limiting it to members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  That is the only addition I propose.  I think the Minister can see the point I make which is to broaden that final step of the process.  It should be non-controversial.</p></speech>

The first part is a replication of the <i>status quo</i>.  The position is that the Clerk of the D&aacute;il is the Secretary General and we outlined on Second Stage, in some detail, the array of functions that the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has.  </p>  <p>               Two different issues arise from this amendment.  One is that leaders or designated leaders of groups or parties in either House of the Oireachtas who are not represented on the membership of the commission at that time be consulted.  I would not have an objection to that but I am trying to tease out how that would work.  What we are doing is providing for a formal appointment system whereby the job would be advertised in an open way, people would apply for it and the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, which, as Members know, now consists of a majority of external members, would do the interviews, do the short-listing and make the recommendation.  I wonder where the consultation would come in.  The Ceann Comhairle would make a recommendation to the commission and it would make the decision.  It would be better if the groups the Deputy mentioned were formally represented on the commission as opposed to having some sort of undefined consultative role.  What would that consultation mean other than telling them about it?  There would be no real role for them other than that.</p> <p> As I explained in some detail, because I greatly respect the independence of Parliament from the Executive, I do not believe I should be prescriptive, as a member of the Executive, about the exact composition of the commission but I am supportive of broadening the membership of it.  I know there is a further amendment on this but I do not think I should be the one to make that determination; that should be part of the debate within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It probably will not impact on the current D&aacute;il but it should on the next D&aacute;il in terms of the composition of the commission.</p> <p> I do not believe that this fairly nebulous consultation role is fit for purpose and it would be confusing in terms of a legal appointment process.  What I am trying to do is to have a process which mirrors the process by which a Secretary General of a Department is appointed where there is an open competition, a TLAC interviewing process, a short-list, a recommendation to a Minister and the Minister bringing his or her recommended person's name to Cabinet.  That is the way it is done.  </p> <p> Has a vote being called in the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

It is a welcome move to clarify how the Clerk of the D&aacute;il would be appointed.  We should use this provision to appoint the Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il in a similar manner, given the additional responsibilities a person at that level holds, as it is a very high level job.  In the event of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il being sick or retiring, the Clerk Assistant steps into the Clerk's role and, therefore, the Clerk Assistant's position carries that onus.  We saw what happened in recent times since the retirement of Kieran Coughlan.  There are occasions when a person is in an acting role and has all the duties and responsibilities that the former holder of that position had.  This proposal would allow a smooth transition in such a case but the person would have the same backing from Top Level Appointments Committee, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and from the Chairman of the D&aacute;il, the Ceann Comhairle.  It would be appropriate to provide for the appointment in this way of those two important positions.</p><p>The effect of the amendments would be to delete the section dealing with the Clerk Assistant of the D&aacute;il and in section 5(1) after the word &quot;Clerk&quot; to insert &quot;and Clerk-Assistant&quot;.  The later text would be changed in that after &quot;person&quot; the words &quot;for either of the positions&quot; would be inserted and the word &quot;competition&quot; would be deleted and substituted with the word &quot;competitions&quot;.These amendments in a sense provide that we would appoint a team when the Clerk of the D&aacute;il is being appointed as we would have two people who would, hopefully, would work hand in glove in those positions because of the importance of those roles they play in terms of the running of the House and the key role they play in the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Sin &eacute;.</p></speech>

The reason for putting the formal TLAC process in place for the Clerk of the D&aacute;il position is that it is a Secretary General level position.  With respect to the three positions being proposed by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh to be encompassed in the TLAC proposal, none of them has a current status higher than principal officer, which would not be normally a category determined by TLAC.  I am also anxious that there would be flexibility in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of Oireachtas are specialist and the power of the commission under the stewardship of the Ceann Comhairle - it would be under the stewardship of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in the case of the Clerk of the Seanad - to make those recommendations is the appropriate process on balance rather than to take it to a TLAC level, which it is not currently.  It is something a future Oireachtas might determine to do but we will make this significant change first and leave the other three categories to be appointed in the way I have suggested, which is that the appointment in regard to officers of the D&aacute;il would be determined by the commission on the nomination of the Ceann Comhairle from the existing cadre of staff, and in regard to the Seanad, on the nomination of the Cathaoirleach from the existing cadre of staff there.</p></speech>

There is a difference between them and the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  Even though the Clerk does not have the Secretary General position, he or she has the roles and responsibilities of the Secretary General of a Department and the roles and responsibilities of the head of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I am not trying to create additional work for the Top Level Appointments Committee; I am trying to ensure that when a Clerk is appointed, given the huge additional tasks, an assistant is also appointed.  The Minister listed the tasks during the Second Stage and I was concerned that some of the jobs belonged to others.  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il now has overall responsibility - as the Secretary General, via the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission - for every aspect of what happens in the functioning and security of the D&aacute;il.  If somebody is indisposed, ill or incapacitated and out of that role, someone could step in, in an acting position, during the bureaucratic three- to six-month process of advertising the Secretary General position, from job advertisement to the recommendation from TLAC to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which then makes a recommendation to the Ceann Comhairle, who then gets the D&aacute;il to sign off on it.  This acting Clerk will already have been working hand in glove with the Clerk as a deputy secretary general.</p>  <p>  The Seanad is different in many ways because its Clerks do not have the role of being in charge of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  I am on record as saying I have a problem with the way the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is formatted, and I tabled amendments to that effect, but they were ruled out of order.  I will not go through them.  I will not divide the committee on this issue.  I thought it was a practical approach to something that might be a problem in the future.  The committee has gone through the last number of months with an acting Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  I have not heard any complaint, but it is not ideal.  The proposal is to address an issue so that somebody can enjoy the full power and responsibility without having to go through some of the rigmarole that that might otherwise entail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22015070100002#C00200"><p>I fully understand the issues raised by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  I apologise; I did not mean to imply that he wanted to do the same with the Clerk of the Seanad.  At the moment there is an esteem due to the Seanad as a standalone House, even more so since the approval by the people's vote to retain the House.  It would seem odd if the D&aacute;il alone had the status of a TLAC-appointed Clerk and Clerk Assistant and the Seanad had not.  The Deputy made reference to the acting Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  There is a person of equal status running the administrative side of the D&aacute;il, so suddenly one of the two equal officers would be appointed by TLAC while the other would not.  That would be confusing.</p><p>There was a bit of uncertainty around the process of acting up when a Clerk retires and a vacancy arises.  This is dealt with in the new section 3 of the Bill, which states: </p><blockquote>Without prejudice to the power of the Secretary General to assign responsibility for performance of the functions for which he or she is responsible to members of the staff of the Commission, the functions of the Secretary General may be performed&mdash;(a) during any period of absence on the part of the Secretary General, by such member or members of the staff of the Commission as may have been authorised for that purpose by a direction given by the Secretary General or, in the absence of such a direction, by such member or members of the staff of the Commission as the Commission may authorise for that purpose, or<br /><br />(b) during any period in which the office of Secretary General is vacant, by such member or members of the staff of the Commission as the Commission may authorise for that purpose.</blockquote>  <p>So there is a direct capacity given to the Commission to appoint a person to the acting official role of Clerk of the D&aacute;il.  I caution against dislodging the balance that exists between the senior officers of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  We should take it step by step, and I suggest we do it first, in terms of the TLAC process, for the Clerk of the D&aacute;il alone.</p></speech>

Section 14 of the Bill would insert a new section 6A into the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act of 1959 so as to allow limits to be placed on the tenure of an appointment of a person to any of the four posts discussed at this committee.  It was felt that a time limit was important but I do not believe it is explicit enough as to who should actually determine that time limit.  Parliamentary counsel advises that it is implicit, but I prefer it to be explicit.  For this reason I suggest that it is explicit that the Commission will make the decision on those time limits.</p></speech>

Section 4 of this Bill, by repealing section 7(1) of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, would bring the appointment of the Clerk of the D&aacute;il within the scope of that Act.  That Act deals with normal appointments of senior civil servants, which is done on the basis of merit.  I believe the appointments we are discussing today should be made on the same basis as TLAC, which uses a shortlist of approved candidates.</p></speech>

Deputy Bernard Durkan is on European affairs business, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe is ill-disposed and Senators Walsh and Norris are also unable to attend.</p> <p>  Before we start it is important that we remember, with great sadness, the tragic loss of life in Tunisia.  I have decided to place it on the agenda of this morning's meeting to afford members of the joint committee an opportunity to offer their condolences and sympathies to the families of Lorna Carty and Larry and Martina Hayes.  They were brutally, cold-bloodedly murdered on holiday in Tunisia and we can say nothing else.  It is sad this committee is discussing the loss of life of Irish citizens abroad and the brutal manner in which this hideous crime was perpetrated.  Our condolences also go to the families of the west Cork drowning tragedy.  I extend my sympathy to the families of Lorna, Larry and Martina and to the other parents, both here and overseas, affected by this needless and senseless gun attack.</p> <p>  I also extend our sympathy to the Government and people of Tunisia and we might write to the Tunisian ambassador in London to express the sympathy of this committee to the Tunisian people on this great loss, which will have a devastating effect on tourism and the economy in Tunisia.  During the Arab spring we watched events in Tunisia and the transmission to democracy there was excellent.  Foreign tourists were also killed there at a museum earlier this year and last week's atrocity was dreadful.  Its geographical location and its close proximity to Libya make it very vulnerable to ISIL and ISIS members so we should give whatever support we can give to the Tunisian people and Parliament. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070100002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Like everyone else in this room the horror of what happened in Tunisia brings home to us in a very graphic way the horror that is happening every day in that part of the world.  Some lessons have to be learned from the triumphalism of the West, which thought it could rush in with a ballot paper and a 300-year history of democracy, with all its faults, and impose it on regimes that were carved artificially out of the sands by the Versailles treaty irrespective of the nations affected, the religious groups and the composition and location of Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims.</p> <p>  It is a very complex and very difficult situation for the West and Ireland is very much part of the West, irrespective of what individual political opinions might be on the point.  The adventure of Tony Blair and George Bush into Iraq has destabilised that country and this has led to a contagion which is very consciously targeting pro-Western, modern countries like Tunisia.  There has been a systematic attack, first on the Bardo museum and subsequently on Tunisia's tourist industry which employs an enormous number of Tunisian people.  If one destroys the economies of those fragile, semi-developed countries, one inevitably precipitates an exodus of refugees desperately trying to get to the northern shores of the Mediterranean.  </p> <p>  This was not an isolated incident from a madman who ran amok.  It was planned and he was part of the cell that previously protected the attackers in the Bardo museum.  There was a wonderful legacy of Roman and pre-Roman remains along the southern coast of the Mediterranean and Tunisia has a lot of them.  The tourist industry related both to that and the Mediterranean.  They attacked a large hotel and a museum of what is part of Europe's old civilisation, targeted deliberately to drive these people into a place of chaos and fear which is landing daily on the shores of southern Europe.  The overall view, which I have just presented in a succinct way and which other members may add to, has been brought home very specifically to us, both in County Meath and in Athlone.</p><p>Naturally, our sympathies go out to those Irish families who have been bereaved, but they have been attacked as people who represent a civilisation and culture that is now the target of an irrational Islamic extremism that has got nothing to do with the tenets of the second largest, soon to be the largest, religion in the world that stretches from Morocco right across to the far side of Indonesia and embraces all aspects of that religious culture and tradition.  We must make very clear that we do not associate mainstream Islam and Muslims, many of whom live in this country, with that outrageous attack, no more than we associated the murders of the IRA in Northern Ireland of people whose sole sin was that they happened to be Protestant workers, as being representative of the people of Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070100002#B00200"><p>I join you, Chairman, and Deputy Quinn in extending our sincere sympathies to the families of Lorna Carty and Larry and Martina Hayes.  What was witnessed on the beach in Tunisia last Friday was an absolute massacre, an appalling murder by fundamentalists who targeted people at will.  A total of 39 innocent people were murdered in a mindless way.  It is very important that Europe and the civilised world act collectively and urgently to deal with the malignancy that is being inflicted on people.  The atrocities carried out by ISIS and other extreme groups and their infiltration of communities is a dangerous position with which the world needs to deal.  It is an issue that requires urgent attention.  Today, our sympathies are with the families who have suffered so much &ndash; the three innocent Irish people murdered while they relaxed on an annual holiday, and the many people who lost their lives from our neighbouring island, some of them with Irish connections and to a GAA club in Birmingham.  It shows the relationship between our two islands as well.</p> <p>  I also take the opportunity to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Ambassador Dave Cooney and his staff on the efforts they have made to try to work with the families in dealing with an extremely difficult situation, and trying to repatriate the bodies back home as soon as possible.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh said.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the solidarity shown by so many Tunisian people at the atrocity and massacre.  It struck me that so many of the people who were murdered were of a certain age.  They were older people who probably had reared their families and were enjoying a holiday.  It really brings home the fragility of life.</p> <p>  There is no doubt the irreparable damage that has been done by Western powers with the invasion of Iraq and other countries.  When one thinks back to 2003, thousands of people marched in Dublin against the pending invasion, and in other places throughout the Western world at that time, but nobody was listening to the voice of the people.  It was a democratic protest against what was happening.  For all their faults, there were other ways to deal with the Saddam Husseins and Gadaffis.  We see the damage that has been done in those countries now.</p> <p>  It is difficult to get my head around the extent of the hatred people can have within the one religion &ndash; Sunni and Shia &ndash; and within certain Muslim people against what they call the infidel.  That brings we me back to the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA.  We had funding to bring over parliamentarians from the North African countries at the time of one of our Constitutional Convention meetings.  We had parliamentarians from Yemen, Egypt, Tunisia and Libya.  There was such great positivity and joy on the part of the Tunisian delegation.  They had just drawn up their new constitution, which was very inclusive and was very respectful of difference, and they were looking forward to going ahead into the new Tunisia that would respect people&rsquo;s rights.  The recent atrocity is a terrible blow to those people.</p></speech>

There are no words to describe the atrocity and the hurt to the families of the bereaved on their holidays.  As was said, they are people of an age with which I can identify.  I do not know how their families must feel now.  In some cases the families bought them the holiday and sent them off for a well-earned rest and that is what happened to them.</p> <p>  As Deputy Quinn said, this is not a case of an isolated one-off madman running amok; this is the new form of terrorism.  It is as effective as 9/11.  It has pretty much destroyed the Tunisian economy.  It is not an accident that Tunisia was targeted.  Tunisia is one of the countries that was involved in the Arab spring and it was a success.  The government there was building a secular economy, country and society.  The country was targeted precisely because of its success.  I do not know how we fight such terrorism, apart from vigilance, but the solution will have to come from within Islam, notwithstanding our own responsibility for what happened in Iraq and Syria.  The solution to the problem is to be found within Islam if it is to be found in our time, and to be honest, I have my doubts about that.</p></speech>

We think in particular of the Irish people, Lorna Carty and Larry and Martina Hayes from Athlone who have family connections in my town of Ballinasloe, so it very much brings home to us the awful event that happened in what should have been a lovely, peaceful setting for people who were enjoying a break, and in some cases recovering from illness.</p> <p>  The atrocity was deeply disturbing.  The terrorist act has its origins in bad political decisions made by super powers down through the years.  At this stage we need to stand in solidarity with the people of Tunisia, whose economy will be seriously damaged and dented in the coming years.  As a country and as members of the European Union, we must do everything possible to stick together and help them through this difficult time.</p> <p>  International terrorism is a difficult challenge to address.  We probably need to have a longer discussion on the issue at a future meeting but today we remember those who have lost their lives and we remember the people of Tunisia who are facing a very uncertain future.</p></speech>

We met him informally yesterday, so we have had a busy few days with him.  Ms Ashling Seely, who is the Stop Torture campaign officer, is also very welcome.  The format is that we will have an opening statement from Mr. O'Gorman, following which we will take questions from the members of the committee.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as even on silent mode they cause interference with the recording equipment.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Gorman" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070100002#C00300"><p>We are grateful to the Cathaoirleach and the committee members for their invitation to come before them today to discuss Amnesty International&rsquo;s global report on the state of the world&rsquo;s human rights in 2014.  As the Chairman mentioned, I am joined by my colleague, Ashling Seely, who is our Stop Torture campaigns officer.</p> <p>  Last year, 2014, was a devastating year for those seeking to stand up for human rights and for those caught up in the suffering of war zones.  Governments across the world pay lip service to the importance of protecting civilians and yet the world's politicians have miserably failed to protect those in greatest need.  Amnesty International believes that this can and must finally change.</p> <p>  International humanitarian law could not be clearer.  Attacks must never be directed against civilians.  The principle of distinguishing between civilians and combatants is a fundamental safeguard for people caught up in the horrors of war and yet, time and again, civilians bear the brunt in conflict.  In the year marking the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan genocide, politicians repeatedly trampled on the rules protecting civilians or looked away from the deadly violations of these rules committed by others.  Last year, 2014, was a year of international failures.</p> <p>  The UN Security Council had repeatedly failed to address the crisis in Syria in earlier years, when countless lives could still have been saved.  That failure continued in 2014, and now into 2015.  In the past four years, more than 200,000 people have died - overwhelmingly civilians - and mostly in attacks by government forces.  Approximately 4 million people from Syria are now refugees in other countries, and more than 7.6 million are displaced inside Syria.</p> <p>  The Syrian crisis is intertwined with that of its neighbour, Iraq.  The armed group calling itself Islamic State, which has been responsible for war crimes in Syria, has carried out abductions, execution-style killings and ethnic cleansing on a massive scale in north Iraq.  In parallel, Iraq's Shia militias abducted and killed scores of Sunni civilians, with the tacit support of the Iraqi government.</p> <p>  The July assault on Gaza by Israeli forces caused the loss of 2,000 Palestinian lives.  Yet again, the vast majority of those - at least 1,500 - were civilians.  The policy was, as Amnesty International argued in a detailed analysis, marked by callous indifference and involved war crimes.  Hamas also committed war crimes by firing indiscriminate rockets into Israel causing six deaths.</p> <p>  The report of the United Nations Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza conflict issued on 22 June this year marks an important step towards accountability for all the victims and their families.  It is a welcome, independent validation of Amnesty International&rsquo;s extensive research into last year&rsquo;s conflict, which found that both sides carried out a litany of appalling violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.  The evidence is overwhelming, and now the members and observer states of the UN Human Rights Council must give the commission&rsquo;s findings and recommendations serious consideration, refrain from politicising the commission or its report, and ensure the council takes all appropriate measures necessary to ensure accountability.</p> <p>  In Nigeria, the conflict in the north between government forces and the armed group Boko Haram burst onto the world's front pages with the abduction, by Boko Haram, of 276 schoolgirls in the town of Chibok, one of countless crimes committed by the group.  The committee members will be aware of other atrocities that followed late last year and early this year.  Less noticed were horrific crimes committed by Nigerian security forces and those working with them against people believed to be members or supporters of Boko Haram, some of which were recorded on video, revealed by Amnesty International in August 2014.  Bodies of the murdered victims were tossed into a mass grave.</p> <p>  There are serious concerns about the increasing use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment against suspected Boko Haram members and supporters.  Recent Amnesty research indicates that police and military personnel routinely use torture and other ill-treatment to extract information and so-called confessions, and to punish and exhaust detainees.  In contravention of national and international law, information extracted by torture and ill-treatment is routinely accepted as evidence in court.  The Nigerian authorities display an apparent lack of political will to adhere to their international human rights obligations.  The committee members will have received a copy of our report on torture in Nigeria in recent months.</p> <p>  In the Central African Republic, more than 5,000 people died in sectarian violence despite the presence of international forces.  The torture, rape and mass murder barely made a showing on the world's front pages.  Yet again, the majority of those who died were civilians.</p> <p>  In South Sudan, the world's newest state, tens of thousands of civilians were killed and 2 million fled their homes in the armed conflict between government and opposition forces.  War crimes and crimes against humanity were committed on both sides.</p> <p>  The list I have outlined, as our 2014 annual report on the state of human rights in 160 countries clearly shows, barely begins to scratch the surface.  Some might argue that nothing can be done, that war has always been at the expense of the civilian population, and that nothing can ever change, but that is wrong.  It is essential to confront violations against civilians, and to bring to justice those responsible.  One obvious and practical step is waiting to be taken.  Amnesty International has welcomed the proposal, now backed by more than 40 governments, for the UN Security Council to adopt a code of conduct agreeing voluntarily to refrain from using the veto in a way which would block Security Council action in situations of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  That would be an important first step and could save many lives.</p> <p>  The failures, however, have not just been in terms of preventing mass atrocities.  Direct assistance has also been denied to the millions who have fled the violence that has engulfed their villages and towns.  Those governments which have been the most eager to speak out loudly on the failures of other governments have shown themselves reluctant to step forward and provide the essential assistance those refugees require, both in terms of financial assistance and providing resettlement.  Approximately 2% of refugees from Syria had been resettled by the end of 2014, a figure which must at least triple in 2015.</p> <p>  Meanwhile, large numbers of refugees and migrants are losing their lives in the Mediterranean Sea as they try desperately to reach European shores.  A lack of support by some EU member states for search and rescue missions has contributed to the shocking loss of life.  The death toll this year, from 1 January to 31 May 2015, stands at 1,865.  This number will rise as more people attempt the journey in the finer weather.  It is vital that safe and legal access routes to Europe be made available to those seeking protection.  The ongoing failure to do so has placed desperate migrants at the mercy of people traffickers and forced hundreds of thousands to take to unsafe and unsuitable vessels in a desperate attempt to cross the Mediterranean with often lethal consequences.</p> <p>  More must also be done to address the reasons so many are fleeing conflict.  On Syria, Amnesty International continues to urge the Security Council to impose an arms embargo on the Syrian Government and targeted sanctions against individuals on all sides responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.  One further step that could be taken to protect civilians in conflict would be to further restrict the use of explosive weapons in populated areas.  This would have saved many lives in Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists, despite unconvincing denials by Moscow of its involvement, and pro-Kiev forces targeted civilian neighbourhoods.</p><p>The importance of the rules on protection of civilians means there must be true accountability and justice when these rules are violated.</p><p> Other areas of human rights continue to require improvement.  In Mexico, the enforced disappearance of 43 students in September 2014 was a recent tragic addition to the more than 22,000 people who have disappeared or gone missing in Mexico since 2006.  Most are believed to have been abducted by criminal gangs but many are reported to have been subjected to enforced disappearance by police and military, sometimes acting in collusion with those gangs.  The few victims whose remains have been found show signs of torture and other ill-treatment. The federal and state authorities have failed to investigate these crimes to establish the possible involvement of state agents and to ensure effective legal recourse for the victims, including their relatives.  In addition to the lack of response, the government has attempted to cover up the human rights crisis and there have been high levels of impunity, corruption and further militarisation.  Again, Amnesty has sent to the joint committee our Stop Torture report on Mexico.</p><p> In 2014, governments in many parts of the world continued to crack down on NGOs and civil society, which is in part a perverse compliment to the importance of civil society's role.  Russia increased its stranglehold with the chilling "foreign agents law", with language resonant of the Cold War.  In Egypt, NGOs saw a severe crackdown, with the use of a Mubarak-era law on associations to send a strong message that the government will not tolerate any dissent.  Leading human rights organisations had to withdraw from the UN Human Rights Council's universal periodic review of Egypt's human rights record because of fear of reprisals against them.  It now is known that approximately 41,000 people have been detained in Egypt following the 2013 protests and unrest.  I note that Amnesty met the committee yesterday to discuss in particular the case of the Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa, and we may wish to discuss that again once we have finished here.</p><p> As has happened on many previous occasions, protesters showed courage despite threats and violence directed against them.  In Hong Kong, tens of thousands defied official threats and faced down excessive and arbitrary use of force by police, in what became known as the "umbrella movement", exercising their basic rights to freedoms of expression and assembly.  Human rights organisations are sometimes accused of being too ambitious in our dreams of creating change but we must remember that extraordinary things are achievable.  On 24 December 2014, the international Arms Trade Treaty came into force after the threshold of 50 ratifications was crossed three months earlier.  Amnesty International and others had campaigned for the treaty for 20 years. We were repeatedly told that such a treaty was unachievable.  The treaty now exists and will prohibit the sale of weapons to those who may use them to commit atrocities.  Obviously, implementation on that will be key and it will be crucial that Amnesty continues, as it intends, to play a role in the years to come.</p><p> The year 2014 marked 30 years since the adoption of the UN Convention against Torture, again a convention for which Amnesty International campaigned for many years.  This anniversary was in one respect a moment to celebrate but also a moment to note that torture remains rife around the world, a reason Amnesty International launched its global Stop Torture campaign this year.  I refer to one particularly striking point for us last year when we carried out a survey globally about attitudes to torture.  It is an indication of the success of a narrative that seeks to defend the use of torture and oppression in the name of security that approximately 36% of the people to whom we spoke globally believed that torture could be justified in certain circumstances.  Our anti-torture message gained special resonance following the publication of a US Senate report in December, which demonstrated a readiness to condone torture in the years after the attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001.  It was striking that some of those responsible for criminal acts of torture seemed still to believe they had nothing of which to be ashamed.  From Washington to Damascus, from Abuja to Colombo, government leaders have justified horrific human rights violations by talking of the need to keep the country safe.  In reality, the opposite is the case.  Such violations are one important reason we live in such a dangerous world today.  There can be no security without human rights.</p><p> We have repeatedly seen that even at times that seem bleak for human rights, and perhaps especially at such times, it is possible to create remarkable change.  Our work on our latest Stop Torture campaign has already reaped benefits, as we saw the Philippine Senate&rsquo;s decision to open an inquiry into widespread police torture based on the findings in our report on torture in that country.  As the committee will be aware, that campaign has a focus on the use of torture in four countries, namely, Uzbekistan, Nigeria, Morocco and Mexico.  We have supplied the committee with copies of our reports on each of those counties and are happy to continue to provide updates to members on any further developments on the campaign.  We also supplied a number of individual cases, separate to that of Ibrahim Halawa on which we had a detailed discussion yesterday, in which we thought the committee might wish to take an interest.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070100002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and thank Mr. O'Gorman and his colleagues for a detailed report, which paints an extremely grim picture regarding many humanitarian problems worldwide, as well as the challenges these problems bring for global society.  He also referred to the refuge crises in many regions and the fact that Syria is not in the headlines daily just shows one what other competing crises exist worldwide.  The figures cited by Mr. O'Gorman regarding Syria are startling, with 200,000 people dead in the past four years, 4 million people from Syria who now are refugees in other countries and 7.6 million people who have been displaced within Syria.  Taken together, that number of people constitutes a sizeable proportion of Syria's population and this is a worrying and grim picture of a country and its people which have been devastated.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to two other areas.  Mr. O'Gorman mentioned the conflict of more than one year ago in Palestine and the Gaza region, which resulted in the loss of 2,000 lives, of whom 1,500 once again were civilians.  There was also a huge loss of life among children.  Peter Power of UNICEF wrote recently about the extremely difficult situation for the people in Gaza and for children in particular, who are lacking in basic necessities.  Again, this is also an area about which one does not read in the newspapers every day despite the huge problems that exist there.  Everyone is aware that a pledging conference took place after the Gaza conflict ended in 2014 but very little of the aid pledged actually has reached the people in need or has been received to build up and repair the infrastructure that has been damaged over the decades in that region.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Gorman mentioned the United Nations Human Rights Council and from his comments, I believe he is highly unconvinced of the value of the work done by it.  He mentioned in particular the United Nations Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza conflict and if I read the report right, is unconvinced of the merits of the work the Human Rights Council will carry out.  Everyone knows and members of the joint committee have often discussed the point that the structures of the United Nations are outdated and do not reflect the current political situation in the world.  As members are aware, the structures were put in place following the Second World War and there obviously is a need for huge change in the architecture of the United Nations.  Mr. O'Gorman went on to mention the UN Security Council adopting a code of conduct and agreeing to voluntarily refrain from using the veto in a way that would block Security Council action in situations of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity and noted that 40 governments have signed up to this.  Do they include members of the Security Council and the people who have the right to use the veto?  Are they party to that agreement to date?</p> <p>  I again compliment Mr. O'Gorman and Amnesty International on their work both in Ireland and internationally.  Again, Mr. O'Gorman has outlined clearly today the serious difficulties, challenges and major crises that affect the international community at present, as well as issues that are not being dealt with in an adequate way, be it in respect of civil and basic human rights or with regard to the need to bring humanitarian assistance to many deprived people in many regions of the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1035" speakername="Ruairi Quinn" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070100002#E00100"><p>Mr. O'Gorman said that "the world's politicians have miserably failed to protect those in greatest need".  Is that all politicians - unelected politicians, elected politicians, independent politicians, those who have the audacity to form political parties or, even worse, to aspire to get into government and implement difficult programmes that try to reconcile the problem of refugees with the problems of housing at home?  Is there anywhere in the world where a democratically elected government is doing the right thing, as far as Amnesty International is concerned?  If this is Amnesty's audit of politicians in such absolutist terms, why would any young person want to go into politics?  Why not just become a human rights activist?  The latter seems to be a much safer, comfortable place to be than the place of elected members on this side of the committee who have to reconcile the balance when politicians, such as the former US President George W. Bush and the former British Prime Minister Mr. Blair, have the audacity to intervene on humanitarian grounds and completely destroy a fragile or stable dictatorship and unleash such chaos as we have seen in recent months.  In Mr. O'Gorman's view, has any significant progress, on the ground as distinct from the ratification of certain treaties, been achieved by the post-Cold War settlement that points to a brighter future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2268" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070100002#E00300"><p>What a depressing report.  If 2014 was a year of international failures, we are only halfway through 2015 and it is looking as if this will surpass it.</p><p>Mr. O'Gorman mentioned UN Convention against Torture.  Torture continues.  The international arms trade treaty is constantly being broken.  International humanitarian law, which talks about distinguishing between civilians and combatants, is constantly being broken.  There is a complete and utter disregard for any humanitarian law that has been introduced.  I suppose one question is how Amnesty International keeps going in all of this.  Where is the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, the reason to not give up and throw the towel in, because there is so much that is depressing?</p><p>It is difficult to see what exactly the Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is a member, is achieving because of the disregard by so many human rights.  I discussed the Bah&aacute;'&iacute; with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Iran has to come back on certain issues relating to persecution of Bah&aacute;'&iacute;, and I raised it to see what would happen after that.</p><p>So much of what is happening today came from a disregard for the right to peaceful protest as a basic human right.  We see that in Syria and with what has happened in Egypt and Kiev.  One could pick anywhere.  It is that disregard for the right to peaceful protest, irrespective of the issue.  We met quite a number of groups here and one was very concerned about the massive increase in the persecution of religious minorities, particularly Christians.</p><p>I have three particular questions.  The first is about the death sentence and whether any progress has been made in relation to those countries that use the death sentence.  The second is about Libya.  Is Amnesty hearing any reports from there and can it do anything?  The third one relates to our discussion of prisoners.  We generally speak of prisoners abroad.  I want to mention here that there are prisoners in Northern Ireland, in Maghaberry Prison, who are suffering injustice and abuses of their human rights.  There are persons in prison on remand for quite a number of years.  I could cite for Mr. O'Gorman individual cases of persons whose human rights are being abused.  In one case a prisoner, who is not a political prisoner, cannot access legal and domestic visits because he is in a wheelchair.  There are serious issues that are threatening a conflict-free environment in the prison, and that are threatening the peace process and stability there, and I wonder whether Amnesty has been contacted by anybody about those issues in Maghaberry.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Gorman" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070100002#E00500"><p>First, to clarify a couple of issues, we are not unconvinced of the work of the Human Rights Council.  Our criticisms are for the Security Council, particularly the repeated use of the veto without any explanation, clarification or justification by some of the permanent members of the Security Council in situations in which there are significant concerns and in situations in which there is clear evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity.  That is why we have called repeatedly for a Security Council reform that would at least see members of the Security Council having to account for their use of the veto and in some way be required to justify their use of the veto.  I do not know whether any of the permanent members of the Security Council has supported the proposal that has come forward.  I will check and come back to Deputy Smith on it.  The proposal that they should voluntarily agree not to use the veto in such circumstances is a positive one and one that we certainly support.</p> <p>  On the Human Rights Council, our concern is that, too often, the reports of independent commissions, such as the Goldstone report into the situation in Gaza and in Israel, become politicised within the Human Rights Council.  It is the nature of the council that certain issues can be highly politicised and then the council becomes increasingly ineffective.  That is why we made that call for the council to not politicise or permit the politicisation of the latest commission of inquiry report and to engage with that and make clear recommendations and input around proper accountability for the crimes against humanity and war crimes that have been identified.</p> <p>  On Gaza, I have now been in this role for eight years and one of the first meetings I ever had with another government was an engagement with the Israeli embassy.  I can remember at that time articulating Amnesty's position that the blockade on Gaza was an effective form of collective punishment of a population of 2 million people.  That has not changed.  Let us remember why the UN Security Council was established.  Its purpose, after all, is to guarantee peace and security.  Of course, one can never ensure that there is complete peace and security, but it is a significant issue when we see the escalation of conflicts across the world and when we see entrenched conflicts, such as the situation in Gaza and in that part of world, where the failure of the Security Council, particularly its permanent members, to act objectively to discharge their mandate is undoubtedly a significant part of the reason such conflicts rattle on.  Gaza, with a population of 2 million, is half the size of County Tipperary and is blockaded into a space.  I remember talking to a former Israeli ambassador in 2009.  He denied that there was a humanitarian crisis in Gaza but said the situation was very difficult and that that was how it needed to be so that Israel would be safe.  It is a tacit acceptance of collective punishment, and yet we have not seen any accountability for that, which, in itself, is a violation of international humanitarian law.</p> <p>  On the refugee crisis, the UNHRC has made it clear that there are more than 1 million refugees.  It is the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War.  There has been a failure to properly get to grips with that crisis.  This is the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  If we look at what is happening in the Mediterranean, only this year finally did we see some focus on the issue and, thankfully, the reinstatement of a humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean.  One must remember that, until the latest round of tragedies, some European governments were saying they did not want search and rescue missions, because if people believed they might be rescued more of them might take to the seas, and that would be a pull factor for refugees trying to cross the Mediterranean.  It is extraordinary that we live in a time when it seems necessary to remind governments that people have a right to protection and that states have a responsibility to provide protection to refugees.  We can look, for instance, at the disproportionate spend by the EU on border protection versus reception for refugees.  We looked at push-backs in Greece, which, as a front-line country, along with others, is coming under particular pressure because of the refugee crisis.  In 2013 the EU provided &euro;220 million for border protection in Greece and less than &euro;20 million for reception.</p><p>That, in and of itself, says something about the European Union's attitude at the time to refugees and the refugee crisis.  There was a desire to keep out the refugees rather than discharge our responsibility.<br/><br/>We have been calling repeatedly for the search-and-rescue and humanitarian missions since Mare Nostrum was stood down.  It took an incredible loss of life in the first couple of months of this year for EU member states and the Union as a whole to act and put back in place a search-and-rescue mission.  It is fair to commend Ireland on its role in that regard and the conduct of the <i>LE Eithne</i>and its crew over recent months.  The crew have saved countless lives and are to be commended for it.  In reality, the solution lies in providing safe and legal access routes for people seeking protection in Europe.  That includes engaging in countries of departure.</p></speech>

I regard many politicians, including a number in this room, as having great stature and as having been human rights activists over many years in their work.  When we talk about politicians in the manner under discussion, we are obviously talking about politicians who are in positions of responsibility in which they have the power to make a decision that would make a difference in particular circumstances but who do not make it.  Obviously, we are not talking about every politician, either in this country or any other around the world.  I am very sensitive to the fact that politics and, therefore, politicians have in many ways been gravely and unfairly undermined in recent years.</p></speech>

We were asked to present an overview of the world's human rights in 2014 and our assessment was that it was a pretty dark and miserable year.  It was characterised by pretty gross failures at the political level - at the level of political leadership, particularly at the level of the UN Security Council and by many world governments - in terms of intervening appropriately on a range of issues.  Deputy Quinn asked whether politicians and governments had done anything useful or helpful in 2014 or 2015.  I am happy to record Amnesty's appreciation and support of some of the things the Government has done on human rights in the last number of years.  I was just talking about the role the <i>LE Eithne</i>has played in the search and rescue missions that recently started in the Mediterranean.  On the Irish level, we are repeatedly on the record as being very supportive of the introduction of gender recognition legislation, the bringing forward of the marriage equality referendum and a whole range of things that Ireland has done.  Indeed, when we talk about Ireland, particularly its role internationally, we talk about it as a champion for human rights.  As such, I hope that when I come before the committee, it would be aware of the repeated comments Amnesty makes about the role Ireland has traditionally played and continues to play as a champion of human rights at the global level.  I take that as given, frankly, but it may be that we need to articulate it more clearly in a situation like this.  However, this was a moment when we were asked to present on our view of the world's human rights and I am afraid it is a bleak picture.<br/><br/>The Deputy asks Amnesty to talk about something a bit more positive.  I was just talking about the role of the <i>LE Eithne</i>and the reinstatement of humanitarian search and rescue missions in the Mediterranean.  That is a very positive development.  In the period between 1 January and 26 April 2015, 27,722 people that we know of attempted to cross the Mediterranean, of whom 1,721 drowned or disappeared at sea.  That is approximately one in 16 or 6.2% of all people who undertook the crossing.  I take as the turning point 27 April, the date the first additional ship was added to Operation Triton, and before the expanded search and rescue mission.  Matters have improved significantly since then in terms of ship numbers.  Between 27 April and 15 June 2015, 31,418 people attempted the crossing, of whom 95 died.  That is one in 330 or 0.3%.  It is a hugely dramatic improvement in the situation.  Interestingly, it also compares very favourably with the period when Operation <i>Mare Nostrum</i>, the Italian-led mission, was in place.  Between 27 April and 15 June, 2014, 31,173 people attempted the crossing, of whom 363 died, or 1.16%.  The humanitarian search and rescue mission has obviously had a dramatic effect on the number of people who are dying in the Mediterranean.  As I said earlier, we think it is tragic that certain European leaders could only be stirred into action after two dramatic shipwrecks in a week that claimed the lives of more than 1,200 people.  The committee will be aware of those because I know it was an issue of concern to members.<br/><br/>There are a number of European countries which have really led on this and we applaud the role they have played.  We have consistently talked about Ireland's response to the Syrian refugee crisis in particular and the need to see that response in the round and in its fullest possible sense.  Ireland has had a real focus on providing humanitarian assistance to the countries surrounding Syria.  Irish Aid support to refugees in Lebanon and other countries has been particularly significant.  It is an approach Ireland has taken.  We understand Ireland was very positive on proposals for resettlement and redistribution and we welcome that even though we would have liked to see it go further at EU level.  While we welcome all of that, if the level of naval and aerial assets is reduced at all, we are concerned we will see an increase in deaths in the Mediterranean.  It is very important to keep that in place for as long as necessary.  As I said earlier, the key issue to address what is happening in the Mediterranean is to address the systemic issues that are pushing refugees and migrants to take to the seas in the first place and to open more safe and legal routes to access Europe.  Why are people washing up on Greek shores?  It is because land borders are almost completely closed to people seeking protection in Europe.  People are being forced into the Mediterranean.</p></speech>

It is interesting for Amnesty.  I understand completely that tone is important, but when we talk about international human rights law, it is important for us to remind the public and, at times, some governments that Amnesty and human rights organisations or activists did not write international human rights law.  It was written by states and voluntarily adopted by them.  When we campaign for states to live up to the obligations they voluntarily accepted in international rights law, we often have to remind people that we are talking about minimum standards.  The two major covenants - the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights - set out minimum standards that were adopted as international law in the 1960s.  As members of the committee and parliamentarians will be aware, it is not a code of law that is generally enforceable through courts.  The only international court is the International Criminal Court and it only deals with very specific grave crimes under international law.  Because that is the system that states have designed, we are dependent upon states voluntarily respecting and fulfilling the obligations they signed up to.</p> <p>  Obviously, the grave concern post-9/11 was of states undermining that.  Up until that period, Amnesty had started to recognise that we needed to talk much more about the indivisibility of rights.  The movement was gearing up very much to focus on indivisibility and the violation of economic, social and cultural rights that were intrinsically linked to violations of civil and political rights, especially in the global south where violations are linked to poverty.  A lot of the arguments internationally about civil and political rights were well advanced but post-911 we have seen states that were traditional champions of civil and political rights become some of the most egregious violators of those rights.  It is in everything we have seen since and I think the presentation we gave references a number of occasions in particular.  In consequence, we have seen an increase in the use of torture, particularly in states where there were already concerns about human rights violations.  We have seen the justification of grave and systemic abuse of civil and political and other rights on the basis of state security or guaranteeing peace and security.  For example, a young Irish citizen has spent almost two years in prison for simply and peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression and assembly.  I refer to the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  There are 41,000 people in prison in Egypt who took part in or were judged in some way to have taken part in protest.  The adoption of the protest law in Egypt was set out in a briefing document we sent to the committee a number of days ago.  The consequences of the application of that particular law are a huge issue.  This is why we have such a strong focus at all times on accountability and urging governments to strengthen accountability measures and mechanisms at international level.</p><p>This is why we are always looking to encourage states to sign up to optional protocols to the convention, so we can strengthen accountability mechanisms.  If states are allowed to simply and routinely ignore their obligations under international rights and humanitarian law, then that gives licence to the most egregious violations to continue and to do so with impunity.  Impunity is our biggest problem.</p><p> The persecution of religious minorities has been a particular concern for Amnesty for a long time.  Members referred to the Baha'i.  The committee will be aware of the case of Asia Bibi in Pakistan who is facing the death penalty for blasphemy.  It is difficult to imagine a better example of a human rights violation than sentencing somebody to death, or imposing any other sentence for that matter, for expressing a belief, even if that opinion is offensive or someone else's beliefs.</p><p> We know that Islamic State, in particular, persecutes religious minorities.  One of my colleagues, Donatella Rovera, an Amnesty senior researcher, has spent much time on the ground in northern Iraq documenting human rights violations that Islamic State has carried out against populations there, many of which are religious minorities.  This remains a grave concern.</p><p> The breakdown in the rule of law is the big issue in Libya.  It is now so lawless it has become a major push-off point for human traffickers, herding people into vessels in appalling condition and pushing them out into the Mediterranean.  The rule of law again is a significant issue from our perspective.</p><p> We are regularly contacted about individual cases in Maghaberry Prison.  However, as was rightly pointed out, the prison is in Northern Ireland and we have to communicate these issues to our international office.  We do this regularly and will communicate the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns too.</p></speech>

Several issues are going under the radar due to increased difficulties around the world.  One of these is the treatment of the LGBT, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender, community, particularly in some Third World and even First World countries.  Uganda, for example, has the death penalty for LGBT activists and even for those in LGBT relationships.  Very little change has occurred in this.  If anything, there has been some deterioration and discrimination.</p> <p>  The committee has heard from representatives of Christian communities whose members have been murdered in parts of the world where they are a minority.  There seems to be very little international outrage about the persecution of minorities, including Christian communities, especially in places like Afghanistan and by ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>  The death penalty is a serious issue in the United States.  Does it not constitute torture to keep somebody on death row for 30 years or, as Deputy Quinn said, in solitary confinement for 40 years?  Are we reluctant to identify it as this because everybody in the West is anxious to be friends with the United States?  The death penalty is outrageous in itself, not to mention having someone in solitary confinement for 40 years.  While we abhor this, do we strongly condemn having somebody waiting to be taken out of his or her cell to be executed?</p></speech>

In some instances, such as the case of Ibrahim Halawa, some NGOs have been asked not to issue statements.</p> <p>  I am surprised that in Amnesty International's 2014 report that it never referred to the case of the Hooded Men, which has been used by countries such as Britain and the United States to justify the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, or what Amnesty would call torture.  Doughty Chambers, along with Amal Clooney, is involved in the case of the Hooded Men.  The Irish Government has taken the case up again and is bringing it back to Europe.  If that ruling is overturned, the use of torture in Abu Ghraib and other instances in Iraq and Afghanistan will be deemed to have been torture.  Will Ms Ashling Seely explain why this issue has not been addressed by Amnesty?  It is our duty to overturn that case because then western countries cannot use enhanced interrogation techniques as they would call it, or torture.</p> <p>  This issue of torture is important in the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  On 21 April, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a statement claiming there were inaccurate reports some weeks ago that Ibrahim Halawa was tortured.  Amnesty International has said he was at risk of torture.  Will Amnesty clarify this?  Doughty Chambers has a 62-page report on it and believes he was tortured.  Reprieve, an NGO, has said he has been subject to torture.  A lawyer for Reprieve stated, the torture, degradation and mistreatment he has suffered at the hands of prison officials includes multiple physical beatings, use of blindfolds, the application of electric shock, denial of medical treatment for a gunshot wound sustained during the address, psychological torture from the prison guards who told him he would face the death penalty and be executed, taunting about his Irish nationality, being subject to sexual humiliation, being placed in highly overcrowded and unhygienic conditions, being placed in solitary confinement in a cell 0.5 sq.m, unable to lie down, no provision of adequate food, denial of access to paper and telephone and being held under the threat of potential death sentence.</p> <p>  That is the legal opinion of Reprieve, an NGO like Amnesty.</p><p>Reprieve's legal team has put that forward.  I suggest for the benefit of everyone that Amnesty International would get together with it, write back to the committee and someone would come up with a definition because either Amnesty International and the Department is correct that he has not been tortured or Reprieve is correct.  According to Reprieve, in respect of the very substantive issues of the charges, according to his legal team's opinion, his lawyer has yet to receive any formal confirmation of the fact the charges have been amended.  The Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il that he is now facing lesser charges.  This is very important because if he is facing lesser charges, according to the Egyptian code of criminal procedure, he should have been released last February because, under its code, he should only be detained for 18 months while facing the lesser charges.  If he is facing the more serious charges, if he is not sentenced on 2 August, he should be released on 17 August.  I will not say that the Taoiseach should intervene and ask for special favours or treatment for Ibrahim Halawa but should he pick up the phone to ask that he be treated the same as anyone else and that the law in Egypt, not any other law, be applied?  Will Mr. O'Gorman tell us whether he thinks the Taoiseach should ask the President of Egypt to get involved?<br/><br/>I took issue with Mr. O'Gorman's point that the world's politicians have failed miserably and his comment that politicians who are in a position to make a difference should do so.  We all know what the Canadian Prime Minister did about the Canadian citizen in Egypt and what the Australian Prime Minister did.  In <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, Mr. O'Gorman said the Irish Government must do everything in its power to bring Ibrahim Halawa home.  I presume he would agree that the Taoiseach should pick up the phone but-----</p></speech>

An article in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 23 June 2015 stated the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission backed down from making a statement on the case of Ibrahim Halawa after being told to do so by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  At any stage, did the Department ask Amnesty International not to make a statement or back down from making a statement?  Was it implied that it would be counterproductive, to use the word from the official?  This happened in respect of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in April this year.  Did it also happen in respect of Amnesty International?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070100002#K02200"><p>I thank Amnesty International for its presentation and report and commend it on the hugely valuable and influential work it undertakes here and in other countries.  Its commitment to addressing and highlighting human rights abuses has been second to none.  There are three key points I wish to raise, one of which relates to the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  Amnesty International's designation of Ibrahim Halawa as a prisoner of conscience along with other prisoners of conscience helped raise his profile because of the way Amnesty International is recognised around the world.  My key question is what more we can do as politicians and as a Government in respect of the case of Ibrahim Halawa and other individuals who have been illegally detained by the Egyptian Government?  Are there specific steps we can take?  What work is Amnesty International undertaking in respect of the forthcoming trial?  I know it had a meeting yesterday, which I was unable to attend.  Deputy Crowe, who is a member of the committee, is still out sick.  I apologise if I am repeating what was said yesterday.  If the witnesses do not wish to answer it, that is fine.  Ibrahim Halawa is an Irish citizen and one immediately gravitates to people one knows, people who are citizens, and then one often looks abroad.  Our job as the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade is to ensure citizens from other countries are also looked after and enjoy the rights we would expect Irish citizens to enjoy.</p> <p>  The issue of Sri Lanka has not been mentioned.  An internal investigation into war crimes is taking place.  It involves military war crimes and crimes against humanity - a plethora of abuse that occurred during a very vicious war on that island.  It has been suggested that this domestic investigation cannot be transparent because it is open to interference, particularly since some of those accused of being central to the military abuses have been promoted within Sri Lanka and that there should be an international investigation by a reputable source, as happened in other areas after wars when an international team of inquiry was brought in to investigate and make findings.  Would it be appropriate for Ireland to seek support within the UN for this type of activity?</p> <p>  The witnesses also mentioned Gaza.  The situation in Palestine in general has been at the forefront of this committee's work over the years, as well as the work of Amnesty International.  It seems that the more reports are produced by the UN to document Israeli war crimes, the more entrenched they get.  They continue their colonial settlements, to have an illegal wall in Palestine and to intern thousands of Palestinians illegally.  The witnesses mentioned the collective punishment of Gaza, which continues.  What more can governments such as that of Ireland do?  Would the recognition of the state of Palestine be enough?  How can we use the mechanisms of the UN to go beyond just another report?  How do we address the situation in Gaza?</p> <p>  I left Gaza by sea in 2008.  I was on the last boat in and the last boat out.  The situation has got far worse since then.  I have seen the reports.  I would love to go back but even politicians such as MEPs are being prevented from entering to see the humanitarian state of play.  This is partly because of the situation in Egypt but it is mainly due to the blockade by Israel.  The humanitarian situation was bad in 2008 when I was there so I can only guess what it is like now.</p> <p>  I commend Amnesty International on its work over the years and wish it well in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2319" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Gorman" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070100002#L00100"><p>On LGBTI rights, Deputy Neville referred to Uganda.  In 2013 we hosted Kasha Nabagesera, one of the leading LGBTI activists there who came to address our annual conference.  It was the same weekend that the Constitutional Convention met to discuss same sex marriage.  She was buoyed up and inspired by the idea that a country like Ireland might consider such a question.  I have sent her an e-mail to get her reaction to the recent referendum.  It is safe to say that when countries like Ireland speak out on the discrimination against, and persecution of, LGBTI people it makes a difference.  The message we sent out on 22 May to the world about LGBTI rights has huge significance and sends important messages to governments.  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign affairs policy has consistently highlighted issues in respect of LGBTI rights and we commend the Government for that.  It is all part of our work in combatting persecution and discrimination and sits side by side with our work for religious minorities.  Deputy Neville referred to the persecution of Christians.  I should have mentioned the situation of Coptic Christians in Egypt for many years.  We research and campaign on this.</p> <p>  On the death penalty, in 2014, 140 countries, two thirds of all countries, had abolished the death penalty but 22 countries carried out executions, down from 41 in 2013.  This year I think there has been a decline in the number of executions but an increase in the number of sentences.  Much of that related to the handing down of mass death sentences following mass trials in Egypt all through 2014 and into this year.  Death sentences jumped by more than 500 in 2014.  That was largely accounted for by Egypt and Nigeria.  At least 2,466 people were sentenced to death in 2014, up 28% on 2013, mainly in Egypt and Nigeria.  These are the two countries where there is significant crack down and violations by the state in the name of state security. </p> <p>  China, Iran and Iraq were the top three executing countries globally, often after unfair trials.  These three, as well as Pakistan, executed people accused of terrorism in 2014.  The number of executions fell by 22% to at least 607 in 2014.  Even though I referred to China, it executes more people than the rest of the world put together.  We stopped reporting on the numbers of executions carried out in China a couple of years ago because the application of the death penalty is in many cases a state secret there.  We know that it executes thousands of people every year but we do not know the true number.  We have stopped reporting figures because they are not reliable.  Year on year we know that China executes more people than the rest of the world combined. </p> <p>  Senator Daly may not be aware of the work of Amnesty International in the case of the hooded men going back several years.  The original case Ireland took, which was the first ever inter-state case ever taken to the European Court, followed Amnesty International&rsquo;s research that identified what had happened to the hooded men.  It was very involved in advocacy to ensure that the Irish Government did decide to refer the case back to the European Court.  We hosted an event last year when we had the hooded men in Dublin in the run-up to that decision.  We very much welcomed the Government&rsquo;s decision.  Amnesty International has had an interest in that case going back 40 years and continues to have.  Senator Daly is right, it is an incredibly important case because the decision has been used by governments around the world to justify their use of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, particularly by the Bush Administration in the US and its use of similar interrogation techniques or torture as part of the so-called war on terror.  We are acutely aware of, and engaged with, the case and have been for four decades and will continue to be.  It was not mentioned in our global annual report because it deals with human rights across 160 countries.  We cannot and do not highlight individual cases, particularly in the report.</p> <p>  On the case of Ibrahim Halawa, I would like to correct something Senator Daly said.  Amnesty International has certainly not said he has not been tortured.  We will not say that.  We have made it clear that we have very grave concerns that as long as he is prison in Egypt he is at ongoing risk of torture.  The treatment he has received certainly could constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and torture.  It is not a pedantic point on Amnesty International&rsquo;s part to make it very clear that a finding of torture has a specific meaning in law and certain criteria have to be clearly established, including intent or the purpose for which a person has been subjected to treatment.  That is part of what determines whether in law somebody has been tortured.  That does not mean that for somebody to be subjected to incredibly harsh treatment is not tantamount to torture, even though it might not meet the legal threshold of torture.  I would suggest that it does not serve Ibrahim&rsquo;s case, and I am not suggesting that Senator Daly seeks to do this, to reduce it to creating some level of disagreement in the opinions of individual NGOs.  The Reprieve submission, as I understand it, was a legal opinion prepared by a Queen&rsquo;s Counsel in London on behalf of Reprieve and it sets out its view of the conditions he is experiencing.  To be clear, we consider Ibrahim Halawa&rsquo;s case to be incredibly important.  We have been active on it for several years and we will remain active on it, nationally and globally.  We designated him a prisoner of conscience because we determined he was being detained purely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly.  We will continue to advocate for his immediate and unconditional release.</p> <p>  It is incredibly important that we stay focused on who is responsible for this.  Egypt needs to be the focus of our attention.  It is there that the solution to this case lies.  We must all continue in any way we can to exert as much pressure as possible on Egypt to secure his release and return to his family.  Senator Daly is incorrect and factually wrong when he suggests that Amnesty International has said that Ibrahim Halawa has not been tortured.  We have not said that.  We will not say that. </p></speech>

There is no issue in saying that.  Just to be clear, our concern for Ibrahim would not be elevated any further by changing a full stop or a comma or using the words "could" or "does".  We are gravely concerned for the well-being of Ibrahim Halawa.  We are gravely concerned about the fact that a 19 year old Irish kid was arrested when he was 17, that he was shot in the hand at the time of his arrest, that he was given no medical treatment and that he has been detained in an Egyptian prison for two years in contravention not just of international human rights law but also of Egyptian national law in terms of the conditions of his detention.  Ibrahim has been subjected to appalling treatment during his time in prison.  He should be home here with his family and continuing with his studies.  What that young man has been subjected to is appalling.  Our focus will remain on putting every possible pressure we can on the Government of Egypt to secure Ibrahim's release.  I hope that all members of this committee and the Irish State will do everything in their power to secure his immediate release.</p> <p>  Senator Daly mentioned Article 143 of the Egyptian criminal code.  It would be helpful to acknowledge that this is a mechanism that could be used to try to secure Ibrahim's release.  The Senator will be aware of the extent and depth of our legal analysis and work on this case and I hope he will acknowledge it.  He will also be aware, from our presentation to the committee yesterday, that when examining the situation in Egypt, it is all well and good for us to point out what law requires but the simple fact is that the Egyptian criminal justice system is not operating in any way that respects international law or, very often, national law in that country.  Yes, Article 143 of the Egyptian criminal code is a really important mechanism for Ireland and Ibrahim's legal team to consider in the context of discovering whether it provides an opportunity either to secure or permit his release.  We will seek to do so.  However, the overarching issue is that the state of Egypt, as it is currently constituted, is not respecting international human rights law or any of the laws that govern fair trial processes or due process.  It very often does not seem to have a great deal of regard for Egyptian national law either.  That is the difficult situation in which we find ourselves.</p> <p>  As we pointed out yesterday, this matter is complicated by the fact that Egypt has asserted that Ibrahim is an Egyptian national.  This is despite the fact he has only ever held an Irish passport and he was obliged to pay for a visa when he entered Egypt.  Egypt continues to assert he is an Egyptian national and is determined to try him as such.  That presents very particular difficulties for the Irish Government when engaging in respect of his case.</p></speech>

It seems extraordinary even to be obliged to say this but Amnesty International has neither received, nor would it entertain, any request from any government, including that of Ireland, to refrain from making public comment in any particular way on any case.  That has not happened.  If it did happen, it is something we would take very seriously.  We would raise it at the most senior level within Government if it ever did happen.  We would also probably raise it publicly if it were to happen.  We have never, ever been asked not to make any particular statement on Ibrahim Halawa's case.  That is not how Amnesty International operates and it is not how we have operated at any time since the organisation was founded in 1961.  I cannot ever see it being the way in which we operate.</p> <p>  On what else can we do, we are of the view that diplomatic pressure is incredibly important.  We think that the diplomatic pressure other states could apply in this instance is also very important.  We have suggested that representatives from embassies in Cairo - especially EU embassies - might be encouraged to visit Ibrahim Halawa in prison, to pay particular attention to the case and to advocate on his behalf.  We would certainly like to see increased effort on the part of the External Action Service in respect of this case.  We know the organisation is aware of the case and we raised it with Commissioner Mogherini when she visited Dublin a number of months ago, so she is certainly aware of it.  We would encourage Ireland to continue to exert every possible pressure to secure Ibrahim's release through diplomatic channels.  The State should also encourage the EU and its member states to become involved in advocating on his behalf.  That would be incredibly important.</p> <p>  I will revert to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh with a further response on Sri Lanka.  It is not a country in respect of which Amnesty International Ireland has been doing particular work but I am aware that it is the focus of priority for other parts of our movement.  From documents I have seen, I am aware there has been a strong emphasis on accountability mechanisms in respect of war crimes in Sri Lanka.  I will revert to the Deputy separately with a more detailed report on that matter.</p> <p>  On Gaza, the Deputy quite rightly pointed out that Israel seems to be emboldened on every occasion this matter is raised and it simply ignores or dismisses charges or allegations, or findings made by UN-mandated commissions to the effect that it has committed war crimes.  Why does Israel do so?  The answer is that it is allowed to do so.  This brings us back again to the question of accountability.  The recent engagement of the Palestinian authority with the International Criminal Court, ICC, is a welcome development.  We have been saying for some time that we would like to see the situation in Gaza and evidence of war crimes committed by any party to the conflict referred for investigation by the ICC.  The court is incredibly important and we would like it to happen soon.</p></speech>

For the record, I wish to state that the committee is very concerned about Ibrahim Halawa.  All members are united on that score.  This young man was arrested at 17 years of age and is now 19.  He has been incarcerated for the intervening period and has experienced a very difficult time.  Obviously, he is frustrated and wants to continue with his education.  The committee has monitored and highlighted his case, has discussed it week after week and has been in contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, from which we receive a weekly update on Ibrahim's welfare, in respect of it.  Of course, his welfare is extremely important.</p><p>I have raised it at every level, including with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  My understanding is there have been 42 consular visits by staff of the Irish embassy in Cairo to Ibrahim in prison.  We have requested that a committee delegation would visit him.  I understand the request is pending with the Egyptian authorities.  I have met the Egyptian ambassador on this and we are awaiting a reply.  We are concerned and we will continue to highlight this case.  Does Mr. O'Gorman think this is the best way?  I am sure the Egyptian authorities are well aware of the concerns of the Government, the committee, and NGOs.  It will be on our agenda week after week.  We will take on Mr. O'Gorman's recommendations to write to the external action committee to highlight the case and to the EU ambassador in Cairo.  We will do what we can to continue to highlight this case and to be vocal on his behalf as he awaits his trial in August.  Hopefully, the case can be heard in August.</p></speech>

I acknowledge we flagged this yesterday.  I have enormous sympathy with views that the family has expressed at times that if Ibrahim perhaps was ethnically Irish there might have been a different response to his case.  That is true at the level of the way in which elements of Irish society have responded to his case.  Some of the dismissals and comments about Ibrahim that I have seen, particularly online - we all know online is a particular kind of environment - and specifically some of the xenophobia and Islamophobia evidenced in the comments, are of grave concern.  It would be welcome if those views were challenged at every opportunity members have to talk publicly about the case.  This is a young Irish kid who has been in prison in Egypt for almost two years.  Some of the charges laid against him on social media and in public discourse in Ireland, never mind the charges he faces in Egypt, are particularly outrageous, and we all have a responsibility to try to uphold the integrity of this young man and his family.</p></speech>

If she is asked to speak about Ibrahim, she will say, "No, there is a court case", but there is nothing to prevent us asking her to come in to talk to us about the state of play in Egypt and the problems within prisons without being specific.  Ibrahim is not the only person suffering in an Egyptian prison.  While we are concerned primarily about him, this might be a way of getting around it.  We would, obviously, have to be careful in how we question whatever she says but there is a concern not just about the state of play in prisons, but also about what is happening in Egypt as a whole.  That brings in what is happening in Gaza and in other parts of Egypt where the country's rule of law does not seem to extend.  That might be a mechanism and we can give the ambassador a commitment that the specifics relating to Ibrahim's case may not be debated when she appears because of the court case.  I presume she will not answer questions about the specifics of a pending court case.</p></speech>

I would, however, ask him and Amnesty International to reflect on a number of comments.  Its origins were in the Cold War.  I recall the article in the <i>Sunday Observer</i>that precipitated it.  Since that time and the collapse in Soviet communism, there has been a correlation in the minds of most people that a prosperous, functioning economy is synonymous with democracy.  Many countries in the former eastern part of the Soviet Union, particularly Hungary and Poland, testify that liberation to democracy was the only way in which prosperity could be constructed.  That is no longer held as a shared view.  The relentless rise of the People's Republic of China shows that there can be economic growth without democratic underpinnings.  We are in a different world and without democracy, no government can be held to account.  Mr. O'Gorman gave evidence to that in his succinct description of why Amnesty International does not publish statistics relating to executions in the People's Republic of China.  I say to his organisation and other NGOs that an understanding of the difficult circumstances in which democratically elected politicians function gives an understanding as to why progressive politics might survive, if it is survive at all, but the defeat of the left of centre government in Denmark, even though the Social Democratic Party was the largest party elected only to be supplanted by the second largest party.  This party is anti-immigrant and is supporting a coalition led by the third largest party, Venstre, the liberal party, which is leading a right of centre, led by the nose government.</p><p>The other side of rescuing people in the Mediterranean is having European governments with a sufficient democratic mandate to take the actions suggested by Amnesty International.  Denmark has gone from being one of the most open and liberal countries in northern Europe in the other direction because of the impact of migration on democracy.  Ireland is no different from many other northern European countries.  I ask for balance in Amnesty International's annual report for 2015 between the tension of maintaining freedom and democracy while recognising that the migratory pressures worldwide should be taken into account.  In 35 years from now, the world's population will stabilise at approximately 9 billion.  The current European population of 500 million will decline to 450 million.  This Continent, the cradle of democracy and civilisation, is facing an existential challenge where, on the one hand, its population is ageing and declining and, on the other, it is being resolutely whipped up into an anti-migrant bias.  That is a challenge we all face.The minority Government partner in Greece is anti-immigrant and fascist and others but in a sweeping statement, Amnesty International by bunching together all politicians in this manner, most of whom are democratically elected, does not do a service to the organisation and the ethos of its founding members.  It does not encourage politicians to take courageous stands in the direction Mr. O'Gorman suggests because the one guarantee is they will not be re-elected.</p></speech>

We will submit a revised document with the changes I suggested we would make.</p> <p>  We share the committee's concerns, particularly about the rise of xenophobia and extremism throughout Europe.  It has been remarkable that it has not been the case in Ireland over the past seven or eight years.  It is something we should look at and understand why it has not happened or what are the different situations which have arisen in Ireland which mean there has not been a phenomenon here in recent years in the way there has been in other parts of Europe.  Colleagues in many of the countries mentioned are gravely concerned about a shift in political and public opinion, particularly regarding issues of migration and minority populations.  It will be an increasing focus for Amnesty International over the next three to four years.  As it happens, our international council, which is the decision-making body which decides strategy and direction for the our global movement, will meet in Dublin in August next year and I anticipate coming out of these decisions will be a focus, particularly for the next three years, on issues relating to migration, conflict and attitudes towards minorities seeking protection.  We will keep the committee updated on this.</p> <p>  If Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's suggestion on a wider discussion with the Egyptian ambassador on the situation in Egypt does come about, we will be very happy to supply much background information.  We published a briefing yesterday on the particular treatment of young people and youth activists, their ongoing detention and the human rights violations they are experiencing in Egypt at present.  We can give much information on the systemic issues involved and information on individual cases.  The case of Ibrahim Halawa features in the document.  We would be very happy to provide all of this.  It would be a valuable way forward.</p> <p>  On the question of how and at what level Ireland engages directly with Egypt, we are not a diplomatic organisation.  We are a human rights organisation.  It is for governments to decide how and when a particular intervention might be most useful.  We absolutely support calls for Ireland to use every authority and means at its disposal to continue to pursue the immediate and unconditional release of Ibrahim Halawa and his return to Ireland to his family to continue with his life.</p></speech>

The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with Mr. Paddy Hopkins, chairman designate of the Charities Regulatory Authority.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Mr. Hopkins and thank him for giving of his time to be here.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Hopkins to make a brief submission of approximately five minutes, after which we will have a question and answer session.</p><p>I draw the attention of Mr. Hopkins to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I ask everyone present to turn off their mobile phones or to put them in airplane mode.

I look forward to the challenge and the opportunity to work with the board, the executive and stakeholders to deliver on the statutory obligations of the authority.</p> <p>  I retired just over 18 months ago, having spent most of my work life with Enterprise Ireland and its predecessor organisations.  I was appointed a board member of the Charities Regulatory Authority in May 2014 and have also been a member of its finance, audit and risk committee.  My professional background is in financial management, corporate governance and corporate administration.  Prior to my retirement, I was company secretary and manager of the corporate services division at Enterprise Ireland.  In this position, I had responsibility for the company secretaries office, finance with a budget of &euro;300 million, grants administration, legal, facilities-procurement and oversight responsibility for internal audit.  I was a member of the Enterprise Ireland executive committee, chairman of the finance committee and a member of the staff resource committee.  I was also an Enterprise Ireland nominee director on the Crafts Council of Ireland for six years from 2006 to 2012, as well as chairman of its finance and audit committee.</p> <p>  My experience as a member of the executive senior management team at Enterprise Ireland has prepared me well for the role of chairman of the CRA in particular in the areas of strategy and policy development, corporate governance, audit and risk management and compliance.</p> <p>  Outside of work, I have a keen interest in the voluntary sector and have been involved with the St. Joseph's conference of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul based in Tallaght and its east region finance committee.  Following my nomination as chairman designate of the CRA, I have resigned from this position.  My work with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul reinforces the importance of the charity sector and the necessity that the public has confidence in its operation.  I was also chairman and treasurer of Kilmacud Glenalbyn Sports Club Limited, a not-for-profit company which administers the affairs of a large south Dublin sports complex.</p> <p>  The establishment of the CRA has come at a critical time for the charities sector.  For the great majority of charities which are compliant and committed organisations working to improve conditions in our society, the CRA framework is an opportunity to demonstrate to its support base in the community the highest standards of probity.  The successful operation of the CRA will, in no small way, assist the sector's ultimate strength and sustainability by providing it with the regulatory and developmental tools needed to operate effectively.  This is vital in restoring and building the confidence of the community in the vital work the sector carries out every day.  Charities, above all, depend on trust.  It is the primary job of the CRA to ensure they are enabled to operate to the highest standards of transparency.</p> <p>  My vision for the board is that the board members and staff of the board will work together to deliver on our mandate as set out under the Charities Act 2009 in a considered, timely and effective manner.  Section 14 sets out the functions of the authority.  It is critical the authority is seen to be effective in delivering on its mandate.  I will be working closely with the staff and our stakeholders to ensure the resources required are put in place.</p> <p>  I want to urgently build on the progress made since establishment.  Progress to date includes the development of an online system to facilitate charities applying for registration and supplying information to the CRA.  The register currently contains approximately 8,000 charities representing the majority operating in Ireland.  These are now registered with the authority.  Other progress includes the provision, through its website and active programme of stakeholder engagement, of extensive information to the charities sector on its obligations and duties under the new regulatory regime; the implementation of an interim process for the handling of complaints of alleged abuse of charitable status or fraud in charities, including an initial review and assessment by the CRA to determine whether any further action is appropriate; transfer to and set up of a new office location in Waterloo Road, Dublin 4; sanction in April for ten additional staff; and the establishment and operation at board level of appropriate sub-committees in line with best governance practice.</p> <p>  Short-term objectives for 2015 include: preparing, and having the board approve, a three-year strategy for CRA; further developing of the online registration system and website content; completing processing of new applications by charities under section 39 of the Charities Act 2009; getting necessary staffing resources in place and fully operational; commencing receipt of annual reports and accounts from registered charities; continuing broad engagement with stakeholders, in particular on charity accounting and reporting guidelines; and continuing to develop the capacity to deal with complaints as set out in the interim complaints process pending the introduction of powers under Part IV of the Charities Act 2009.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to my predecessor, Mr. Conor Woods, who has resigned as chairman for family and personal reasons.  Mr. Woods gave huge commitment and leadership to the authority since its formal establishment on 16 October 2014.  While he has resigned from the board, he has kindly offered to assist the authority in any way possible into the future.</p> <p>  I intend to fulfil my responsibilities by working closely with the chief executive officer and staff, relying on the expertise, judgment and support of the other members of the board and with the support and assistance of our sponsoring Department, the Department of Justice and Equality.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for its attention.  I look forward to the challenge presented to me by this appointment.  I sincerely hope that when I report back to the committee, substantial progress will have been achieved in delivering on the CRA mandate.</p></speech>

It sets out quite a detailed document.  There are drop-down pages to facilitate different types of charity, whether it is company or a non-incorporated entity.  When this is completed and comes into the CRA, the CRA then reviews it to check it complies with the legislation.  Following that checking and validation, it is then set up as a registered entity, or not as the case may be.  In some instances, there may need to be some deliberations or legal advice sought as to whether the entity is a charity or not within the meaning of the Act.</p></speech>

Some charities can be non-incorporated while others can be established as companies, making them subject to the rules set down by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Other charities have been established as trusts.  As a member of the CRA's board, has Mr. Hopkins encountered any obstacles or does he foresee any when consolidating the forms of the charities under current regulations?</p></speech>

If it is a limited company and registered with the Companies Registration Office, then its accounts will come from that office and we will not have to ask it to submit separate accounts. If a non-incorporated entity has a turnover of over &euro;100,000, we will ask it for audited accounts.</p> <p>  We will have to do some work to determine whether an entity is a charity.  To that extent, we have retained legal advisers, following a competitive tendering process, to advise us on that particular area as such.  Otherwise, we would have to go back to the Attorney General's office in each case.  We may still have to do that but we will now be relying, in the main, on the company of solicitors we have retained.</p></speech>

When that entity is in place and makes an application to the authority, it would be reviewed and we would come back with a definitive answer.  Personally, I would be disposed towards it if the entity certainly seems to be for the greater good.</p></speech>

In his submission, Mr. Hopkins said that he was very involved in the voluntary sector, particularly the Society of St Vincent de Paul.  In respect of his activities with the society in Tallaght, was his role full or part-time and did it just deal with financial issues?</p></speech>

We have a chapter there and get requests for support on a weekly basis.  We meet once a week and then do visitations.  I was purely on the ground meeting the people, which is I why emphasise that it brings home to one the need for charities, the good work they can do and the importance of having trust in and integrity within the sector.</p> <p>  I also mentioned in my statement that I was on the east region finance committee of the Society of St Vincent de Paul for about a year.  The society is a very large and dispersed type of organisation and the finance committee was trying very hard to bring about corporate governance structures to facilitate more effective and efficient management of resources.  I stepped down from that because of my designation as chair of the CRA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015070100002#C00500"><p>The reason I went in that direction was because I think it very important that those who work in the charities sector have front-line experience rather a purely bureaucratic role.  This is one of the problems we have had over the past ten or 15 years in respect of charities.  People working in that sector do not necessarily have front-line experience.</p> <p>  Mr. Hopkins knows that charities have taken a major hit over the past five or six years and the public has become very sceptical following the CRC and Rehab Group affairs.  People tell me regularly that if they are going to give a few bob to a proper charity, they want to know that their few euro is going directly where they intend it to go.  Can Mr. Hopkins as chair of the CRA help to win back the confidence and trust of the people in respect of the charities sector because there is a major problem?  I am part of that because following recent issues, I pause every time someone asks me for something for a registered charity.  I know members of the public want to be supportive and Irish people are very supportive but they feel there is an element of doubt there.  Can Mr. Hopkins as chair of the CRA help to win back that trust?</p></speech>

When we produce the guidelines and direction for the charities sector and when the charities make their returns to the CRA, the returns will be published on our website.  One hopes that will bring about a transparency that may or may not have always been there.  Historically, larger charities in particular would always have completed their accounts but sometimes it might have been quite difficult to interpret those accounts and get down to the nitty-gritty of what these accounts were saying.  Our website will display transactional-type information as well.  I hope that a combination of the guidelines we set out and publishing reports from charities will help and bring about that confidence.  It probably will not happen overnight.  By adopting the very best practice within our own operation, we will provide an example to charities which we want to comply with best practice.</p></speech>

One of Mr. Hopkins's short-term objectives is to commence receipt of annual reports and accounts from registered charities and to continue broad engagement with stakeholders in respect of accounting and reporting guidelines.  Does he think this is enough and that he will have the resources to deal effectively with it?  Again, because of our experiences with the banking crisis and the lack of proper auditing systems, there is an element of doubt among many members of the public.  Does Mr. Hopkins think the CRA will be able to deal effectively with accounts and annual reports effectively and bring back trust?</p></speech>

It is one thing to put them in place but another to make them fully operational.  When they are in place, it will certainly help us significantly in that part of the work.  The other piece of work that will be very important is the area of compliance and enforcement.  This relates to Part 4 of the Act which has not been commenced yet.  We will be looking for another tranche of staff.  Since my appointment as chairman designate, I have met senior managers in the Department of Justice and Equality to seek another tranche of staff to look at the enforcement side of the Act.  This will help reinforce the powers of the legislation.</p></speech>

I have seen accounts from some organisations where the remuneration of the entire staff was given but there was no breakdown regarding the remuneration of the CEO, director or the senior management team.  Does the CRA intend to address this in terms of rebuilding the trust and confidence the charities sector needs to regain?</p></speech>

It would be my view that salaries and bonuses of CEO and senior management should be highlighted in line with best practice in the code of practice for the governance of State entities.  Until those guidelines are fully in place, we probably do not have an enforcement role in it but we will certainly recommend very strongly that this be case to bring about transparency.</p></speech>

The petitioner is arguing that the public should be able to gain access to the Houses without sponsorship from a Member of Parliament.  This matter was referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  That committee is to introduce the desired approach in the autumn.  Therefore, the objectives have been achieved.  Our committee has agreed to close this petition and forward a copy of the response of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to the petitioner, noting that we will keep him informed of any progress.  That is the decision of our committee.</p><p>The next petition, in the name of Ms Bridie Cox, is No. P000013/14, which contends that injustice anywhere threatens justice everywhere.  This is a call for the introduction of procedural safeguards and legislation to prevent injustice by State officials and the HSE and for all investigations to be carried out by an independent body, such as an independent dedicated health ombudsman, and not the State body itself.  We have agreed to refer this petition to the Joint Committee on Health and Children and we have requested that it place on its work programme a full review of the Protected Disclosures Act and how it is working on the ground, with particular emphasis on how it working in regard to nursing homes.  Obviously, our committee will monitor how this concern is addressed within the health committee.  We will refer to the petitioner correspondence received from the HSE that I hope addresses some of her concerns.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Petition No. P000040/14, on disease rates linked to central heating systems, is in the name of  Mr. Tony Rochford.  He contends that, since 2000, a large percentage of plumbers have started to use single-check non-return valves to link a householder&rsquo;s central heating system and fresh water supply.  There was a different approach prior to 2000.  Mr. Rochford feels many houses are affected by this issue.  We have decided that we will invite the National Standards Authority of Ireland and officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to appear before the committee in public session later this year in the autumn.</p><p>The next petition,<b></b>No. P00002/15, on the non-compliant installation of water meter boxes in vehicle access locations by Irish Water, is from Mr. Con O&rsquo;Leary.</p><p>He claims this is not in compliance with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government circular BC6/2009.</p><p> We have agreed a number of measures concerning this petition.  We will forward a copy of the correspondence and the responses we received to the petitioner.  We will invite the Department to appear before the committee to confirm the following: why circular BC6/2009 does not apply to the current process, whether there are any new guidelines or legislation governing the fitting of water meter boxes, whether there was any specification listed in the tendering process as to the type of boxes which should be fitted by the successful company, and why the Department is not evaluating, testing, assessing or certifying the products or design solutions.  We will invite Irish Water to appear before the committee to discuss its independent testing of grade C boxes.  We will pursue with both the Department and Irish Water the issue of meter reading.  It is understood that the grade B box is made of cast iron whereas the grade C box is made of plastic.  We understand that Irish Water is going to read meters by wireless transmission.  Obviously cast iron boxes might impede the wireless signal's ability to read such meters.  Those are the measures we have agreed concerning that matter, which is to be revisited in the autumn.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Petition No. P000013/15, Our Children&rsquo;s Health Campaign, is from Mr. Peter Fitzpatrick.  This petition was referred to us from the Joint Committee on Health and Children and is supported by 65,000 signatures.  We will refer this petition back to the Joint Committee on Health and Children, which is the most appropriate one to address this petition.  I understand it is agreeable to that committee and obviously we will continue to monitor the matter.</p></speech>

We will discuss the approach she proposes to take if she is appointed to this role.  We will hear her views on the challenges currently facing the authority.  By now, we are all very aware of the Government decision of May 2011, which put new arrangements in place for the appointment of people to State boards and bodies.  Reference to this arrangement is also made in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines on appointments to State boards, which were published in November 2014.  The joint committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairperson-designate in public session to hear her views.  We trust that this process provides for greater transparency in the process of appointment to State boards and bodies.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Julie O'Neill to today's meeting.  I draw her attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I wish to advise Ms O'Neill that any submissions or opening statements she has submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms O'Neill to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

I welcome this opportunity.  I will begin by summarising my own career and explaining why I applied for membership of the board of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  I will then set out my vision and my priorities for the authority.  I have circulated a slightly longer version of this statement.  I will summarise it slightly to stay within a five-minute timeframe.  I spent the first 37 years of my career as a civil servant.  I joined the Civil Service straight from school in 1972.  I was very privileged to have a wide and varied public service career.  This gave me the opportunity to work with various Ministers and political parties and to contribute to strategic policy development and its implementation across eight Departments during a period of great change in Ireland's economy and society.  I hold a bachelor's degree in commerce from UCD and a master's degree in policy analysis from Trinity College.  I am a member of the Institute of Directors.  I have recently been designated as a certified bank director by the Institute of Banking, following my completion of its corporate governance programme.<br/><br/>In October 2001, I was appointed Secretary General of the then Department of Marine and Natural Resources.  In June 2002, following a change of Government, I was reassigned to the newly formed Department of Transport.  I left the Civil Service on completion of my term of office as Secretary General in 2009.  Since then, I have undertaken some strategic management consultancy work.  In more recent years, I have concentrated primarily on a limited number of non-executive board appointments where I believe I can make a contribution.  During my time as Secretary General, I developed and have since maintained a keen interest in the potential of sustainable energy to contribute to meeting the economic, social and environmental challenges and opportunities faced by Ireland.  I was privileged to attend Cabinet committee meetings on infrastructure and climate change.  This exposed me to the breadth of policy perspectives and the challenge of finding synergies between renewable energy targets and other policy goals.  While I worked in the Department of Transport, I oversaw the preparation of Smarter Travel, which is a challenging long-term strategy for implementing sustainable transport policy.  At that time, it was the first such policy for Ireland.<br/><br/>In 2011, I answered an advertisement placed by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and asked to be considered for just one board under its auspices - the board of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  I served on the board for three years until September 2014.  This allowed me to learn more about optimising energy efficiency and renewable energy and to contribute to the development of policy, strategy and governance at the authority.  I currently serve on two other boards.  I was appointed as a non-executive director of Ryanair in December 2012 and of Permanent TSB in January 2014.  I developed extensive corporate governance experience in the public and private sectors through my role as Secretary General, in which I had responsibility for the oversight of 37 State agencies, and more recently through my non-executive director roles.  Earlier this year, I applied to <i>stateboards.ie</i>to be considered for re-appointment to the board of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  I indicated my willingness to serve as chairperson of the authority.  If my appointment as chair is confirmed, I will adopt a pragmatic approach to the role.  I will be mindful of the wider challenges and trends that are facing Ireland's economy and society, of which sustainable energy is just one.  I am ready to draw on the specialist expertise within the authority and around the board table and to act as a critical friend to the organisation, checking and challenging it as it moves forward.<br/><br/>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is the national authority for sustainable energy.  Its legislative mission is to promote and assist the development and deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy.  Sustainable energy offers a great opportunity for Ireland, which is highly dependent on imported fossil fuels that are expensive and polluting.  The more we reduce energy waste and the more we exploit our own rich and clean indigenous energy resources, the greater the social and employment benefits to the people of Ireland.  A global transition is under way to eliminate the unsustainable aspects of our energy systems, most notably the huge environmental risk posed by climate change.  This creates an important enterprise opportunity.  As we move to address our own energy challenges, solutions developed by Irish companies can be exported to other states that are facing the same imperatives.  I have set out in my written statement some of the detail of the significant progress Ireland has made in recent years.  The authority has played an important role in this progress.<br/><br/>In the past six years, it authority has delivered 300,000 upgraded homes via Government grant support.  Some 550,000 homes now have building energy ratings.  Over 3,000 businesses have been supported in reducing their energy costs.  Energy expenditure by the public sector has been reduced by &euro;70 million per annum through efficiency improvements.  More than 16,000 people are now employed in the sustainable energy sector in Ireland.  This country's annual energy bill is &euro;700 million lower than it would be without recent progress on energy efficiency.  Our imports of fossil fuels are over &euro;400 million lower every year due to our local clean energy resources.  This is just the beginning of a long journey.  The Minister has signalled Ireland's policy intent to see the energy system largely decarbonised by 2050.  This will require decisive action across a range of sectors and will result in substantial benefits to the economy and society.<br/><br/>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will play a significant leadership role and will be a catalyst for change in ensuring progress is made with the sustainable energy agenda.  The Minister intends to publish a new White Paper on energy policy later this year.  The authority will follow this with a new strategic plan, demonstrating how it will act to support the delivery of national policy goals in sustainable energy.  I would like to say a few words about governance.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is fully compliant with the Government's code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  In 2011, it became the first organisation in Europe to achieve certification under Swift 3000, which is an independent assessment of corporate governance frameworks in organisations.  The authority has maintained its certification status in subsequent reviews.  Members may be aware that the maintenance of this standard, which was recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2009 annual report, provides assurance that the authority operates to the highest international standards.</p><p> My personal objectives for the immediate future are to work with the new board to ensure we operate in the most efficient way possible, provide strong guidance to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and monitor the activities and effectiveness of the organisation.  We will immediately move to complete our new strategic plan to support the Government&rsquo;s energy policy goals.  I want to ensure the board acts on a fully informed basis, makes its decisions in good faith and is recognised as a well run, efficient and strategic State body.</p><p> I will conclude on a personal note.  The former President, Mary Robinson, spoke about her fears about the kind of a world her grandchildren would inherit in 2050 if we failed to tackle climate change.  In the past two years, I have been blessed with a grandson born in China and a granddaughter in Australia.  I think often about how we are the generation that will take the decisions that will impact on their world, for better or worse, and how our collective decisions will have global reach.  I have seen at first hand the impact of climate change on China, for instance, and how that vast country is trying to grapple with its implications.  The arrival of my own grandchildren has re-energised my focus on playing my own modest part in eliminating the unsustainabilities in the world's energy systems.  I make this point because I believe it is possible to be a pragmatist, while at the same time being passionate about addressing the challenges of sustainable development.  There are many things in the world that divide us but in this area, while there will inevitably be differences on the detail of policies to be pursued, we all share a desire to leave the world in a better state for the next generations.</p><p> I thank the Chair for the invitation and I will be pleased to answer any questions members may have. </p></speech>

The purpose of this engagement is to learn about her plans for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Ms O'Neill outlined her personal views and vast experience.  She also indicated that she is a member of two boards.  Is there a conflict between her role as a non-executive director of an airline and her role as chairperson of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland?</p> <p>  I will ask a question I put to every other chairperson-designate who comes before the joint committee.  Is Ms O'Neill or has she ever been a member of a political party?</p> <p>  I note Ms O'Neill's comments on what has been achieved since 1990 and the changes that have taken place in the way we view sustainable energy and the world as a whole.  She was previously a member of the board of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Some 300,000 grants have been provided under the warmer homes scheme.  How does Ms O'Neill envisage the scheme evolving?  The scheme should be used for local authority housing stock because of the amount of money being spent to try to heat these homes, most of which were built at a time when less attention was paid to energy efficiency.  Having seen the difference the scheme makes in heating homes, I ask that it be expanded to ensure local authority homes are upgraded to the highest possible level.  Some of the residents in question have the lowest incomes and highest energy bills in the State. </p> <p> While much has been achieved in improving insulation for 300,000 homes, a major effort is needed to improve energy efficiency for businesses.  Significant amounts of energy are wasted trying to heat office buildings constructed in the 1960s and 1970s.  Some of the newer buildings are highly energy efficiency which creates greater business efficiency. </p> <p>  What is Ms O'Neill's opinions on wind power, solar power and biomass?  Is the number of wind farms being built and entering the grid sustainable?  </p> <p>  The first application granted by a local authority for a solar farm was recently approved in Macroom, County Cork.  I understand a solar farm has been built in County Down and another one has gone through the planning process.  How does Ms O'Neill envisage solar power developing in Ireland?  Does she envisage a future for biomass in the renewable sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2460" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie O'Neill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015070100002#D00400"><p>I will first dispense with the issue of political parties.  I am not and never have been a member of any political party.  I have been privileged to have worked with politicians of all parties.</p> <p>  On the Ryanair issue, I do not believe a conflict arises.  Aviation is part of the way in which we move people around the planet.  The challenge is to do this as efficiently and sustainably as possible.  Interestingly, an independent report produced recently in the United States shows that Ryanair is the most energy efficient of the 20 largest airlines in the world and produces the lowest footprint per passenger.  Issues such as the use of the most up-to-date fleet and achieving fuel efficiency and higher passenger load make a big difference.  There is a very wide range of performance in the aviation sector and I am pleased that energy efficiency is a priority for Ryanair, the best of the top 20 airlines in the world and the best and greenest airline in Europe. </p> <p>  On the future agenda, energy efficiency and sources of renewable energy should be separated.  As the Deputy stated, energy efficiency is an important part of what we are trying to achieve.  Achieving the target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 is challenging.  We are nearly halfway there and meeting it will involve private homes, businesses and a wide range of other ways to reduce demand for energy.</p> <p>  I fully concur with the Deputy that the warmer homes scheme is a very important initiative.  I cannot remember the figure but I understand approximately 150,000 of the 300,000 grants were provided for fuel-poor homes.  While the scheme is targeted at people who own their homes, I take the Deputy's point about local authority housing.  In recent years, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland has been placing more focus on new better energy communities approaches.  These provide an opportunity to work in partnership with a number of players, both public and private, and have certainly widened the range of impacts we can have on fuel-poor homes.  This is certainly an issue we will take on board as we formulate our new strategy in the context and against the backdrop of the Government's forthcoming White Paper.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that there are significant differences in housing stock and a combination of insulation, more efficient boilers and consumer behaviour can make significant impacts, as can impacts for business.  The Deputy will be aware that most of the businesses locating and developing in Ireland want to have a lower carbon footprint because it is good for the environment, is a good part of their sales pitch, if one likes, to the customer base they are trying to develop and also reduces their overall costs. </p> <p>  On the role the different energy technologies play, the Deputy will be aware that we are trying to meet a range of different targets to reach the overall target of having renewable sources contribute 16% of energy generation.  These include a renewables target of 40% for electricity, 12% for heat and 10% for transport.  We are roughly halfway towards meeting this target and it is clear that it will be highly challenging to move from the current position to the position we need to reach if we are to achieve our 2020 targets.  There is no doubt that wind, which accounts for approximately 18% of electricity generation, is by far the largest contributor to energy from the renewable sector, which contributes more than 20% overall.  Wind is currently the most efficient way in which renewable technologies can contribute to energy generation.  Solar power and other renewable energies such as wave power contribute only small amounts.  Other technologies are still emerging.</p><p>At the moment it is difficult to see how we could achieve renewable electricity targets without significant expansion in wind.  I believe bioenergy has a role and could achieve, perhaps, up to 5% by 2020.  One of the problems with bioenergy is that we also need it to meet our heating target.  The best return can be achieved if we use locally grown sources of biomass and use them in heating.  The committee will probably be aware that a policy document is out for discussion as to how support for that could be increased.  There are real opportunities in creating sustainable energy communities.  I know there are proposals around Moneypoint and there are suggestions that it could possibly be converted to biomass.  All those proposals should be looked at and, ultimately, the responsibility lies with the project promoter.</p><p> I would utter a few words of caution.  In order to meet the demand of a plant such as Moneypoint for biomass, one would be talking about the coverage of two countries, perhaps, my own County Wexford and Carlow covered with fuel crops to meet that demand.  Realistically, we would be very heavily dependent on imported biofuels to meet the demand of that plant.  That is a difficulty, first, because it would divert the scarce resources in biomass grown locally from heating and, second, because it increases reliance on expensive imports.  It would also have very significant capital costs.  I am not hung up on any one form of energy; I am open to all of them.  At the moment, biomass and wind contribute almost equally to meeting our renewable energy targets but they contribute in different ways; biomass primarily in heat, wind primarily in energy.  From my point of view, as we develop a strategy beyond 2020 and into 2030 and beyond, one is always looking for the changes in technology that will create other options.  As we stand, and based on the state of the science, and the relatively slow changes in technology that will produce dramatically different alternatives, it seems we will require significant wind energy to meet our electricity targets and significant biomass energy to meet our heat targets.</p></speech>

We are one of the most energy dependent economies in Europe if not the most dependent in terms of imported resources for energy.  That is a very difficult position for us.  We are on an island on the edge of Europe, from an energy security point of view as well as from the point of view of the burning fossil fuels issue, and we need to do something about increasing the resources available to us and reducing our dependence on imports.  As a windy island nation, wind is certainly the best opportunity we have.  I have looked at other countries.  I have spent quite some time in China in recent years.  The pace of growth in wind farms there is extraordinary and yet it will probably struggle to get it up to 10% of its grid because it is heavily dependent on fossil fuels.</p></speech>

I do not want to comment on the policies of other countries with which I am not familiar.  If one is importing from very long distances, the carbon footprint of what one is importing is growing because of the transportation costs.  One needs to begin to think what one is doing to the environments in those countries from which one is importing.  One of the points I made about the pragmatic approach and about balancing different policy objectives is that clearly the mandate of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is around, specifically, sustainable energy.  To the greatest extent possible, our sustainable energy goals should complement our employment goals, our energy security goals, our opportunities for innovation and a host of other policy objectives.  I would like to see those synergies.  As an island nation, the more we can reduce our dependence on imported fuels and, in particular, imported fossil fuels, the greater our energy security and the greater the potential for job creation.  The benefit in terms of job creation from biomass is far more significant if it is home grown rather than if it is imported.</p></speech>

Recent reports suggest that some of those on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland list proved to be cowboy operators.  What is Ms O'Neill's opinion on that?  There is a move to try to get the names of those who have transgressed or have not done the work in accordance with best practice.  Do I take it from her comments that she does not agree with Mr. Colm McCarthy that given the way we are moving in terms of wind farms, we will have a NAMA for wind farms in ten years' time?</p></speech>

When I was Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, I had Mr. McCarthy expressing his views on various forms of public transport.  I have huge regard for him as an individual.  I have seen his arguments.  It is clear that if one reads his article at face value he does not suggest an alternative to renewable energy - he essentially says forget about all of it.  Essentially, he implies that we should not continue as we are going, but this would mean failing to meet our targets, which are set for us at European level and which are legally binding and carry significant fines, and would mean perpetuating a dependence on imported fuels.  In this case, I do not agree with Mr. Colm McCarthy.  I do not think he has given us a plan B that is viable.</p> <p>  In regard to the policing of our grants scheme, Deputy Moynihan was referring to a small number of frauds that were uncovered a few years ago and were referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General in reporting on our accounts.  There is no doubt that when running grant schemes not just for poor homes, but wider homes, one will always be vulnerable to cowboy operators.  In the past few years, the authority has carried out a review of the arrangements in place for monitoring and systematically testing the grants scheme in place and subjecting individuals grants to review.  We do that on a risk-based analysis.  That enables us to pick up on operators who are not compliant; in other words, if any type of fraud is taking place which is designed to pretend the work has been done, it also picks up on standards.  It ensures that the work is done to the highest possible standards.  I am satisfied that we have a robust control framework in place.  Clearly, it is something one will always have to watch.  There is also a potential to be vulnerable when one is spending State money but I am satisfied that the control framework is in place.</p></speech>

She may have answered some of the questions I was about to pose in regard to renewable energy.  I make no apology for saying that I believe we are putting a lot of our eggs into one basket when it comes to wind energy.  She mentioned the targets for last year and our capacity of 2,760 MW.  As almost 2,200 MW came from wind and only one megawatt came from solar, I see it as almost completely negligible.  Is Ms O'Neill saying it is not advanced enough or that we are at the stage where we can include solar or biomass to the extent that it would make a difference?</p><p>Does Ms O'Neill see it extending past 2020 for further targets or how will it expand in the future?  We are not looking at that area, but cannot rely on wind indefinitely.</p></speech>

We must watch how the technology evolves as I believe there will be greater opportunities for solar energy.  Often there is a tipping point in regard to the cost of various technologies and when we reach that tipping point it becomes more possible to consider their contribution.  I do not want to get into setting the targets beyond 2020, towards 2050, because that is something to be considered in the context of the White Paper.  The targets will also be the subject of international negotiations.  However, I believe the overarching goal should be to move towards a largely carbon neutral energy system by 2050 and that we must aim for that.</p> <p>  Wind energy is an important part of what we do currently and, with respect to electricity, wind will remain important for the foreseeable future.  I do not see it as a case of putting all our eggs into one basket.  There is no magic bullet in this regard and we must maintain an open mind.  As Chair of SEAI, I will maintain an open mind on any ideas put forward.  However, we must consider what gives us the most efficient return on investment at this time in terms of renewable energy and whether that is the most efficient way towards meeting our targets.  In the case of electricity, this certainly appears to be wind, while on the heat side it appears to be biomass.  We must look at how we can grow more biomass crops and at how they can be used and the best way of doing that.  We also need to be open towards other technologies. </p> <p>  As we take the time horizon out beyond 2020, we would hope the kind of experimental and innovative work we are doing around wave energy and the like will begin to bear fruit because we have a wonderful ocean resource.  However, I doubt we can rely on that happening quickly, overnight or within a short timeframe.  We need to plan well ahead for that.  We must be always alive to what I would call the "game changers" in technology that might offer us possibilities in the future.</p></speech>

I know some studies show it would not be cost effective, but what is her view?</p></speech>

There are cost effectiveness issues versus onshore wind, but I believe it has potential in the export space.  Deputy Moynihan raised the UK situation and some time ago there seemed to be potential for export into the UK grid from offshore wind in the Irish Sea.  That matter has gone to the back burner for now, but I suspect it will come back into play, particularly after 2020.  I do not believe the issue will go away.  I see offshore wind as having significant potential in an interconnected Europe.</p> <p>  We talk a lot about electricity prices and the need to keep them down.  In the Irish context, there are a number of drivers of our electricity prices, not least of which is the fact that we are an island nation with a very dispersed population for such a small island and very dependent on expensive imports.  We then have to put infrastructure in place around that.  As we move forward, we will look at other opportunities to inject into the energy mix from a variety of sources.  Offshore wind may well be one of those.</p></speech>

I have difficulty understanding the extent of the role of SEAI and will go through that shortly.  I note that Ms O'Neill is a certified bank director.  That seems to be a side-road from the route she was on previously.  Why did she feel it was necessary to be certified as a bank director?</p></speech>

I had a strong view that the banking system in Ireland got badly broken over recent years and that people should roll up their sleeves and help put it back together.  Therefore, somewhat reluctantly, I was convinced that by joining the board of a bank I might be able to make a contribution as a non-banker.  As members are aware, there is a strongly improved regulatory environment around banking now and one of the requirements to be a bank director is to step up to the mark and get the appropriate qualifications and expertise to do the job.  The reason I mentioned the qualification in this context is because a significant part of that intensive programme deals with corporate governance in a general sense.  I hope I will bring what I learned about effective corporate governance with me to my role as Chair of SEAI.</p></speech>

The Government sets out a vision for energy and SEAI has a vision for energy, but should  SEAI have an input into a decision as to whether there should be defined targets and dates for a climate change strategy?  There has been significant discussion on this issue.  Should SEAI have a role in areas of policy, such as the possible introduction of hydraulic fracturing, initially in the north west of the country?  SEAI is spending significant money in terms of energy upgrades in homes, yet this cannot cover matters such as doors or windows.  People could be spending significant money to produce heat more efficiently, yet it could be escaping through the doors and windows.  In regard to the overlap between policy, vision and practicality, what input should SEAI have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.2484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Julie O'Neill" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015070100002#F01200"><p>I come at this in number of ways.  If I am asked to take on any job, the first thing I look at is what the legislation says the role of the body is, as I am being asked to do a job within that legislation.  The Sustainable Energy Act 2002 sets out clearly the functions of the authority, namely, to promote and assist an environmentally and economically sustainable production supply and use of energy, energy efficiency, the reduction of greenhouse gas and to promote research in that area.</p> <p>  To start with, our focus is on sustainable energy.  Fracking is not a sustainable form of energy, so it does not come within our remit.  Therefore, it is not something we would be directly involved with.  In terms of measures that improve energy efficiency, it is open to us to express a view to Government and to put forward proposals to it in terms of what type of grant supports we feel we could most valuably use and get a return from in the context of sources of energy and efficiency and how they might be dealt with.</p> <p>  In regard to targets, I think the Deputy is referring to whether there should be targets in the climate Bill.  This is something I believe is ultimately a matter for Government policy.  We make an input in terms of our research.  On targets generally, we make an input on the objective analysis of where we are in regard to targets and what it would take to achieve them.  The decision on what goes into legislation must be a matter for the Government of the day and for the Department bringing proposals to Government.</p><p> While I understand that discussion and debate, I can also understand that putting binding legal targets in legislation when, at the same time, trying to negotiate internationally with colleagues in Europe and beyond might be an issue for Government.  It is something from which I would stay back and on which I would not offer a view.  I would say it is something that is not within the gift of the authority to do.</p><p> I would ask what is our job.  Our job is to offer advice on climate change and sustainable energy generally and to bring forward and, if funded, to deliver efficiently and effectively, programmes and supports that will enhance sustainable energy and help us meet those targets.  Ultimately, it is the Government of the day which makes the energy policy and we contribute to it.</p></speech>

As we go through our strategic planning process, should something like that emerge, we would be open to bringing it forward.  The way I would look at it is there is a process under way at the moment to develop a White Paper on energy.  It is probably the most consultative process I have seen in developing a White Paper.  That will produce an overarching policy framework for energy.  Governments change and policies vary from time to time but, as I said in my opening statement, I suspect the underlying thrust of the policy debate is not on what we hope to achieve but how we are to achieve it.  I think we all share a view at this stage, across Government, the wider public and private sector and, I believe, all political parties, on the importance of achieving sustainability.  Our role, against that backdrop, is to see what we can do to contribute to the debate.</p> <p>  That being said, if appointed to this role, I will have around the board table, not to mention within the authority, people of considerable expertise and depth of understanding in various aspects of sustainable energy.  I will listen to those views and look at the most effective way of bringing them forward.</p> <p>  It seems to me that we have moved from a position a number of years ago where the job was to convince people that sustainable energy was a sensible objective to a point where most people now buy into that.  What they are interested in, as evidenced in today's questions, is the best way possible to achieve it.  We will have a considerable educational and public information role.  Our job is not to be the flag-carriers for any particular approach to sustainable energy but to produce the most objective analysis available which can be a good resource and input in Government policy. </p></speech>

I did not set down on paper specific positions or posts that I wanted to take on.  However, I did take a blank page and write down on it four or five areas in which I wanted to be active and I had an open mind on how I would be active in them.  One area was sustainable energy.  Another was aviation and transport and there were also wider areas, such as tourism and the food sector.  Banking was not one of them but sometimes things happen which one does not expect.</p> <p>  My interest came strongly from that time.  There was also the opportunity to see how challenging the debate is when trying to juggle very important but conflicting policy objectives with our energy targets and climate change and carbon reduction targets.  An example is Ireland's positioning of itself in a leading role in the agricultural sector.  The Origin Green approach adopted by Bord Bia is promoting Ireland as a green and sustainable country delivering a wonderful food supply to other parts of the world.  Policy making is a messy business.  It is never easy.  I have great sympathy for any Government, of any time, as it tries to juggle all the priorities.  I felt this is a particular area on which I could become involved and make a difference, which is a difference not just for this generation but for future generations as well.</p></speech>

We are a democracy/  We appoint Governments and Governments appoint Ministers to lead us and take decisions.  I would see my role in this instance as being to give the best quality and most objective advice we come up with and to feed that into the process but ultimately, the policy decisions which are made on foot of that advice - which in our case is in the public domain because we publish reports and do not just privately, behind the scenes, give advice to Ministers - are a call for the Minister of the day.  However, it is a valid question.  Sometimes things will come up where we will produce a report which may be slightly out of kilter with the direction the Government chooses to go but so be it.</p></speech>

From listening to her and reading her documentation, she appears to have a very broad vision.  Will she state what inhibitions or prohibitions she sees down the road in realising her aims and aspirations in the role she is taking on?  Does she believe the role of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is very restricted in its present format?  What are her thoughts on achieving the targets on decarbonisation coming in to 2020, for instance or, out further to 2050, on climate change, in which she has a special interest at both national and global levels?</p> <p>  There is the issue of the elimination of fossil fuels for this country and the general transition to clean renewable energies.  Another issue is our security and national reserves of fuel.  In Ms O'Neill's view, how secure are we really?  Occasionally the interconnection with Scotland with regard to gas importation to this country, for instance, can be uncertain.  What is Ms O'Neill's opinion on the delay in the construction of the gas plant by Shannon LNG in Tarbert, County Kerry?  There has been a serious delay there for some time.  It has been involved in legal aspects for a couple of years.  Would she have a part in resolving that matter with the relevant Minister?</p> <p>  There are some new techniques and materials, for instance new heat retention brick.  I presume Ms O'Neill has heard of it.  It is a new concept or a new material.  It is a quarried material.  I do not know if it is available in this country as of yet but it appears to be fairly good in terms of sustainability and retention of heat.  </p> <p> Is there enough being done by the Government in terms of energy conservation in facilities and buildings of government bodies at full State level and local Government level?  My county of Kerry has a conservation officer who has been doing outstanding work for a long number of years.  It is harnessing energy at its water sources to supply public water.</p><p> A changeover has been undertaken in some counties in respect of low-wattage public lighting and the associated areas.  Will Ms O'Neill offer her views on those aspects?</p></speech>

I will start with one of Deputy Fleming's earlier questions on whether I believe the role of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is unnecessarily restrictive.  No, I do not.  I believe generally when it comes to power or influence it is not so much what an organisation is given, it is how that organisation uses the opportunity it is given.  I believe we have an interesting and exciting opportunity in the coming years, now that the issue of sustainable energy is firmly before people's minds, to build on the good work that has been done and to become even more effective in getting that message out to a wider audience throughout the country.  As things stand the authority does excellent work with schools, school programmes and young people.  Some weeks back, before I was invited back onto the board, I went to an event in Dublin Castle.  It frankly blew my mind when I saw the kinds of ideas that young children in schools throughout the country were coming up with for energy efficiency, energy conservation and renewable energy proposals.  There is a whole new generation to whom we need to reach out.  We produce some excellent publications.  Quite apart from our grant support work, which is very important and where the lion's share of our resources go, our publications are excellent.  However, we need to broaden the reach through the media and in other ways to reach out to a wider audience.  I do not believe we are overly constrained.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming asked what will get in the way.  There is no doubt that while we are half way to reaching our 2020 targets they are challenging targets to meet.  People tend to get the easier stuff out of the way first and then it gets harder as time goes on.  Let us consider energy efficiency.  What tends to happen is that all the early adapters and all the people who move fast are on board early.  Then we have to try to reach the harder-to-reach people, who are less convinced or who have other things on their minds.  As against that, one thing that is helpful is that this is no longer simply the agenda of a small statutory authority; it is the agenda of every business, big and small, in Ireland as well as every business that is seeking to establish in Ireland, whether Google, Apple, any of the foreign direct investment companies, the major food companies like Danone, Kerry Group or others which have their origins in Ireland or whether it is a small start-up business.  Everyone sees the opportunity that sustainable energy offers in terms of reducing their carbon footprint and cost base.  Many see the opportunity for innovation and creating new job opportunities as well.  We need to work with that opportunity.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming mentioned public bodies.  Numerous large public bodies, including those with the biggest energy burn in the education and other sectors, have made significant progress.  There are others which have work to do.  I could not agree more with Deputy Fleming.  I have been astounded, even at a personal level, at how such things as switching off the lights, turning down the temperature by 1&deg; Celsius in the house and various other measures can make a difference.  Demand management, which is a major part of meeting our efficiency target, is a combination of the things we do to insulate and so on as well as changes in the behaviour of energy users.  To the extent that we reduce energy demand we reduce the challenge of achieving the targets of a certain percentage of energy usage coming from renewable sources.</p> <p>  We have talked about it already but there is no doubt that the wind challenge will be a challenge in the time ahead.  There is juggling to be done and a balancing act for the wider powers that be in government and the planning authorities to get right.  This involves balancing the planning aspects, which are clearly important to those communities where wind farms are placed, and the contribution that energy can make to the grid.</p> <p>  Heat is another question as is the related issue of finding new sources.  Transport, which is where I came from into this area, is still a significant untapped area.  I was party to producing our first transport sustainable energy policy.  Unfortunately, it was predicated on their being the ability to put in place a significant investment into public transport and so on.  Obviously, the downturn in the economy made that far more difficult.  As things stand, we are gradually moving towards 10% of our fuel coming from biofuels.  Electric cars, which had a very slow start, are now beginning to take off as their range and battery life increase and as costs begin to come down.  In recent years the shift in the mindset of individuals towards not only sustainable energy but the wider health benefits of walking and cycling has made a significant difference.  There is a good deal that is positive and under way in that area.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming asked about one or two specific aspects that I might raise with the Government.</p></speech>

We do not have a direct role in that or in energy security.  However, I know energy security will be important in the context of the White Paper.  It is something the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources monitors closely all the time.  It is yet another reason why we need to reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels and do everything we possibly can in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming mentioned some technologies.  I love game changers in technology and watching out for the disruptive technologies that might change the opportunities available to us.  The reality is that in a sector like this new things will come on-stream and they will add value, but in some cases they will be literally a slow burn over time.  We need to have that part of our minds looking well beyond 2020 and set to thinking to 2050 and beyond.  It is interesting because as we get older in life we realise that we are doing this not for our benefit but for the next generation.</p></speech>

The authority has produced a wonderful teaching pack that is used with young children in primary schools now.  It is fabulous and involves games and so on to encourage them.  It is a little like what has happened in waste management over the years.  I find it fascinating when I see five and six-year-olds coming home from school and telling their mothers and fathers to turn off the lights and not to charge their mobile telephones through the night and so on.  Exciting work is going on in this area.  There is a competition supported and sponsored by SEAI that encourages youngsters to come forward with what are essentially small business ideas.  That is in primary school and secondary school.  I would like to see more of that.</p></speech>

In the line of the pump of houses and so on the work has been a great success throughout the country.  I am taken by Ms O'Neill comments.  She believes that wind seems to be a considerable part of the way forward for Ireland.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

At the moment, wind and bioenergy contribute in almost equal share to renewable energy, approximately 30% apiece.  The reality is that from an electricity point of view for the foreseeable future it is difficult to see a significant alternative to wind to meet the target of 40% of our energy and electricity coming from renewables.  I believe that over time biomass will play more of a part.  It could get up to 5% by 2020.  However, given the fact that we need home-grown biomass to meet our heat targets, unless we are prepared to go down the road others have gone, involving significant imports of biomass with the associated costs and supply issues, I do not see it.  The knock-on consequences in terms of prices could be significant.  I remain of an open mind on it but certainly if I am asked in an honest way to say what I believe from what I know now - something I continue to challenge - it seems that on the electricity side wind will make up the lion's share of it, certainly up to 2020.</p></speech>

Does she agree that if we go down the wind road once a 50% threshold is reached we will be unable to handle it on the grid because of our generators?</p><p>There is a study being done at the moment, which will not be completed until the end of 2017, but the generation from wind cannot go past 50% at the moment because it is up and down.  Does Ms O&rsquo;Neill agree that at the moment in the wind sector we are guaranteeing prices to investors and we are not getting the net benefit cost from that?  If we use wind would she agree that for businesses employing people throughout the country, to make it sustainable, if they have to manage on their own, the price of electricity per unit will be a lot higher?</p></speech>

I made the point about agriculture that I see personally its huge value to this country.  We are very lucky that it is not an either-or situation.  If, for instance, we were to deliver on our wind targets that would add approximately 4,400 net extra jobs to the Irish economy.  Sometimes the impression is given that using wind costs jobs but it actually adds net jobs to the economy.</p></speech>

I will continue to keep that under review.  The Deputy mentioned an absolute limitation.  Our target at the moment is 40% for renewables and wind is part, not all, of that.  I agree with the Deputy about the wider issue of going beyond 2020 and towards 2050 and getting 100% from renewables.  All the indications are that the net impact of the investment in wind is positive for the economy and the Exchequer and ultimately for the taxpayer.  There are wider issues around wind, such as the planning issues, and I understand those in terms of its impact on communities but I am positive about the benefit of wind to the economy, the jobs it generates, its positive impact on gross national product, GNP, and the minimal impact on electricity prices.</p></speech>

Ms O'Neill appears to be converted in the line of wind, climate change and all these different things.  One of the Deputies spoke earlier about standing up and questioning things.  Is she a person who questions and looks at the economic viability of a measure?</p></speech>

They could certainly play a role on the heating side.</p> <p>  To pick up the Deputy's second point, I most certainly am a person who questions and challenges everything.  I described the role of the chairperson in my opening statement as being a critical friend to the organisation.  I mean "friend" in the sense that I am there to help the organisation to be as effective as possible, and "critical" in that I believe the role of the board is to challenge the executive of the authority, to look at the evidence and proposals the executive brings and subject them to critical examination before they are put into the public domain.  </p> <p>  When the Deputy says I have been converted, it sounds like I might have taken to wearing sandals, growing a beard - if I could - and going around with a tent on my back.</p><p>I do not see it like that.  In fact, what appealed to me about this role is the opportunity to build the synergies, not the conflicts, between employment creation and the other challenges of making Ireland economically, environmentally and socially sustainable and to build on those in the context of meeting our targets on sustainable energy.  While I am certainly at this point convinced of the value of wind as a contribution to this, I remain open on the role of all the technologies.  I remain open to any analysis that is brought forward to me, both from within the authority, from around the board table or from outside the authority and I will subject that analysis to the same critical analysis as what I get from within the authority.</p><p> Solar energy was mentioned.  I am certainly hoping that, over time, we may not be too far off where solar begins to be able to make a bigger contribution than it can currently.  The chief executive of the authority, Dr. Brian Motherway, has accompanied me today, along with William Walsh who is the finance and corporate services director and Mattie McCabe, who is the company secretary and whom I should have introduced at the outset.  He has made the point recently that one should beware of snake oil salesmen.  There is no new product that comes on stream in this territory that will provide the one magic bullet that will solve all the problems.  I wish there were but there is not.  Therefore, we have to keep all of the technologies under review with an open mind and watch where they are contributing.  To pick up on the Deputy's point, every single proposal that comes before my board will be subject to rigorous cost-benefit analysis both in terms of whether it is the best and most efficient use of the limited resources available to us as an authority but also in terms of its wider cost-benefit effects for the Government and for the economy.  We do this quite rigorously.</p></speech>

I compliment SEAI for its work.  In particular in recent years I have become aware of its projects which encourage innovation in industry to achieve energy efficiency.  The results are the exciting stories.  People and communities are working with SEAI and getting results in energy efficiency as well as a lowering of costs and removing their reliance on traditional energy sources.  I would like to see a widespread take-up of grants for energy efficiency in households.  I refer to the 100% grants for people on certain social welfare payments which I have found are not well known about, for some reason.  People know about the grants which provide a contribution towards the cost but they do not seem to be aware that a full grant is available.  It seems there is more work to be done in this regard.  I compliment Dr. Brian Motherway and the team for being accessible and for reaching out because that is what is required.  It is a case of a paradigm shift in that one must look at things differently.  We have had a long reliance on traditional energy generation and all our technologies have evolved around fossil fuels.  If we had started years ago perhaps we would not be in the position that we have to introduce refit tariffs, support the use of wind and support new industry in an attempt to diversify our energy dependency.</p> <p>  Renewable energy, the delivery of wind energy and the use of biomass, are real issues for both Deputy Fitzmaurice and myself on the ground in terms of community acceptance.  I am interested to hear Ms O'Neill's comments.  Some projects have not been a great success and in my view they have led to more challenges.  I refer, for instance, to those midlands wind projects which were never pinned down.  These are the big industrial wind farm projects.  Every part of the midlands thought it was going to have a turbine.  I am from the west and the aftermath of what happened in the midlands and the showmanship and the competition between two companies caused more negativity about wind energy.  It is such a vast area for discussion but the conversation always seems to be piecemeal.</p> <p>  When wind is talked about it is often as if we were looking for 100% wind energy but that was never suggested.  However, this is the conversation.  The reality is that we are supporting wind as the cheapest form of renewable energy we can support.  We rely on experts, on SEAI and other bodies for expertise in this area but I ask how much conversation has been carried on with people on the ground about this to persuade them to embrace it because this goes back to community acceptance.  When I go to national schools and secondary schools which are raising An Taisce green flags I often think that these youngsters are perhaps being exposed more to a different way of thinking while in the broader society the same attitude or embrace is not there.</p> <p>  There must be a national conversation about this whole area.  I am interested to hear Ms O'Neill's views on community acceptance and also the notion of how we deliver wind energy.  Are we really not to expect to deliver via big industrial wind farms?  We know that as technology is developed the turbines have got higher.  Should we be going for smaller scale operations and introducing more micro-generation?  For people who are opposed to wind or who have valid questions, visual amenity is one of the most valid arguments.  The environment committee has had people objecting to offshore wind, people objecting to onshore wind, people objecting to biomass, people against fracking.  I watched Ms O'Neill's presentation on the screen in my office and one of the earlier speakers referred to the recent article by Colm McCarthy.  I wonder whether it is accepted that we are going to invest.  It cannot just be a case of cost as the only basis.  If cost is the only basis then we should remain with fossil fuels.  It would be a great argument for us to begin fracking in this country.  Some members represent areas which are being explored for shale gas and therefore fracking is very controversial but neither do we want nuclear.  All these options bring their own challenges and it is a case of needing to have a real conversation about what is the most efficient and whether we build offshore when we can build onshore.  How do we bring this into communities and make it acceptable?</p> <p>  From a democratic point of view and also from the point of view of social justice, we can never remove ourselves from the question of affordability for the ordinary person.  I ask Ms O'Neill and the SEAI about the contradictions such as the contradictions with regard to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The SEAI and Ms O'Neill are pursuing a policy of energy efficiency and yet we see that when local authorities upgrade their housing stock they are installing oil-fired central heating with upgraded burners.  People who have been given new oil-fired central heating systems cannot afford to put oil in the tank but the councils will not install back boilers or ranges.  It does not make sense.  It means that people are sitting in the cold and may be left with just an open fire.  That is a very real situation because people are coming to my advice clinics who tell me the council has revamped their house, put in new windows but the central heating is oil-fired.  They might have had an old range in the house and a back boiler but these have been taken out and they are in the cold.  That seems ridiculous.  I ask if Ms O'Neill would take up this issue because it is a question of how it is consistent with what SEAI is trying to achieve in the longer term.  The people who are getting carbon tax slapped on them are these people who are in energy poverty.</p> <p>  I am always mindful that everything we do must be tempered with the reality of the burden we are putting on people.  When we think of the attitude of the United States and many of the big energy guzzling countries, and also the developing countries, with regard to carbon emissions and targets and how many European countries are way ahead in this regard even compared to ourselves, some of what we do is a drop in the ocean in the case of renewable energy.  It is not that we should not have sustainable plans and be prepared to co-exist with our environment because there is a price to pay if we do not.</p><p>We must be careful, however, where the responsibility in this regard is heaped.  We need to ensure, in particular, that we look after vulnerable people.</p><p> In regard to the energy efficiency measures, the cost of which is being passed on to the utility companies to implement, my concern is that those companies will, in turn, pass that cost on to customers in their energy bills.  If people's bills are going up, it will be difficult to get any buy-in from them.  Even if a doctor is telling me that such and such is the best thing for me, if there is no buy-in from me, I will be reluctant to go along with it.  It is often the case with experts, whether in respect of EirGrid and the transmission network, for example, or anything else, that they tend to speak at a level beyond where most people are at.  People are being asked to embrace things that are not properly explained.  There must be more dialogue and conversation.  As I said, I am concerned that this cost will be loaded onto people's bills.  They are already paying a public service obligation levy; now they will face an energy efficiency charge.  Where does it end?  Furthermore, such a charge would have an impact on the commercial side in terms of our competitiveness.  I was disappointed to see we have fallen down the rankings in that regard after being told for so long that things were improving in terms of the cost of electricity for commercial and domestic customers.</p><p> On my reading of it, Mr. Colm McCarthy's argument was purely framed around the issue of costs.  Of course we must be mindful of cost, as I have argued, but he was referring to gas generation and electricity generated from gas.  Is there any possibility of converting Moneypoint to gas?  Ms O'Neill has pointed out that gas is conventional generation, which is not what she is concerned with, but I am strongly of the view that one cannot have the conversation about sustainable energy without looking at the full picture.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her points, many of which were very well made.  I welcome, in particular, her very positive comments about the staff of the authority.  One of my main motivations in putting myself forward for this position was the very high regard in which I hold Dr. Brian Motherway and the team he leads at SEAI.  He and his staff are among the most professional bunch of public servants - they are, indeed, servants of the public - I have come across in my career.  It is a pleasure to work with them and listen to their views.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right on the energy efficiency measures issue.  The authority is doing a lot of very good work in terms of raising awareness, but I agree that much more needs to be done.  The Deputy made the point that Ireland is a very small player on the world stage, and there are many larger players who ultimately may have a greater contribution to make on the whole issue of climate change.  One could use that as an argument for Ireland being a follower rather than a leader in this area.  It would be a case of letting the big boys and girls take the burden of climate change while we continue to do our thing.  I do not support that position for a number of reasons.  Even leaving aside our binding international obligations and the value of burden sharing in a European and global context, it would be a very foolish and short-sighted approach for Ireland to take.  I am not saying that is what the Deputy is suggesting, but it could be read into her wider comments.</p> <p>  Apart from the values we hold as a society, of which sustainability in the economic, social and environmental sense for ourselves and for future generations is an important one, there are real opportunities for Ireland to create jobs and reduce our dependence on dirty and polluting imported fossil fuels.  If we allowed ourselves, for argument's sake, to go down the Colm McCarthy route, which is to forget about all this and keep going as we have been going, the problem is that nobody is coming up with a plan B.  Everybody is prepared to say what they are against, but it is difficult to get any consistency in terms of their saying what they actually are for.  The Deputy is correct that if we start saying, for whatever reason, that we do not like wind, biomass or whatever, then we either reopen the debates about fracking and nuclear or we go back to a situation where we are increasing our dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right, too, about gas generation.  Moneypoint and all those issues are not really on my radar and agenda because gas is not a sustainable form of energy.  It is for others to make that call.  Obviously, gas will be an important part of the mix for the foreseeable future, but we still have the issues of security, supply and everything else.</p> <p>  In regard to the broader issue of community engagement, I would take that at three or four levels.  One level is the role of SEAI, and I endorse the point the Deputy made that we have more work to do.  We have done quite well in terms of getting messages out, but there may be a lack of awareness about the warmer homes scheme for fuel-poor homes, for instance, despite that information being available on our website and so on.  I agree there is more we can do in that regard.  It is interesting but not surprising that over the period of the very severe decline in the economy, people's interest, even with grant support available, in investing in insulation for their homes declined because they did not want to spend any of their spare money on anything to do with renovations.  They were trying to hold onto whatever small amount of savings they had.  It is noteworthy that demand for those schemes is beginning to come back up this year, which is obviously related to the increase in demand for housing and renovations as cash flow begins to improve and the economy picks up.  We need to build on that.</p> <p>  I see a very important part of the role of SEAI in setting out its next strategy as relating to its communication function at all types of levels, including encouraging the new generation of young people and working with industry, with clients of our services and with stakeholders in the wider sense.  I take the Deputy's point about the hard analysis we can produce that might influence the decisions of local authorities and others.  Interestingly, more efficient boilers do help to increase energy efficiency, even if those boilers use gas or oil.  Gas is better than oil.  Part of the energy efficiency challenge is that even where we continue to rely to the extent we do on fossil fuels, if we can at least reduce the demand for them and use them more efficiently, that in itself will help towards meeting the targets we have to meet.</p> <p>  I distinguish between our role as an authority, which is to produce the hardest possible information about what works and what does not, costs, benefits and all of those issues, and our function in managing community engagement through the planning and other processes.  I agree that engagement has not always been done well in the past.  It is very much an objective of the White Paper on energy to increase community engagement around energy, and I expect almost every political party will have that as part of their manifestos.  Looking at some of the numbers I jotted down, to meet our target for wind, we are looking at 400 to 600 more turbines, which equates to 30 to 40 additional wind farms.  One can choose to have larger farms and a smaller number of them, in which case one must think carefully about where to locate them, or a greater number of farms with a smaller number of turbines in each.  Microgeneration and the like can make a contribution but one needs to get the sum of the total sufficient to meet the targets.</p> <p>  There is work to be done, too, by the sponsoring companies, not all of which have covered themselves in glory in the past.  There is work under way through the planning process concerning the guidelines around this.  There is a job to be done by all of us, including SEAI, in terms of getting the information out there about costs and benefits.  Another speaker said that many of these projects do not create jobs.  In fact, there is potential for wind to contribute 4,400 net jobs between now and 2020, some 2,000 of them in construction, 500 in operations and the remainder in knock-on impacts.  We do not always get that message across in a tangible way.</p></speech>

The exception is in the circumstances to which Ms O'Neill referred.  For the most part, local authorities receive substantial rates and there are other benefits which accrue and that is why it is important - all other things being equal, including a wind farm being located in the proper place - to get the community gain right.  Many of the jobs involved tend to be centralised in Dublin.  This is despite the number of wind farms that are located in rural settings.</p></speech>

As the Deputy noted, one is also obliged to try to manage the community gain aspects and stakeholder interaction at local level.  That is why we need and must have a robust planning process.  That is not our responsibility but it is certainly something to which we contribute.</p></speech>

I am particularly interested in situations where new heating systems are installed in circumstances where someone might previously have had a range and a back boiler.  People are sitting in the cold - hopefully not at this time of year - and are going to community welfare officers because they do not have enough money to fill their oil tanks.  Matters would be different if they still had their ranges and could buy a bag of coal or some turf, logs or wood chips.  The individuals to whom I refer, many of whom are elderly and cannot do things for themselves, are living in misery.  What is happening does not make sense.  I understand that local authorities are intent on replacing old heating systems with new ones because there is too much servicing involved with back boilers.  That is a contradiction in itself.  I would like this matter addressed for the good of those who have been affected.  I do not accept the idea that people cannot have ranges in their homes as a result of what is involved with servicing their back boilers.  That is not the way to go.</p></speech>
