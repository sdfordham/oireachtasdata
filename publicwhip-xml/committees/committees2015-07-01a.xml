    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#C00200"><p>Okay.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having me here today, and I will do my best to help the committee in its difficult task.  You have my statement and I won't read it all out but will summarise a few important aspects of crisis management and the new legislative framework.</p> <p>  When I started on the banking side at the beginning of November 2008, the task at hand was the assessment of the size of the problem and the possible tools to handle it.  The liquidity aspects were well measured at that time and fairly stable.  The Irish economy had been contracting all that year and by the autumn of 2008, following the Lehman Brothers collapse, the property market had collapsed, with activity ceasing and prices falling.  The solvency of the Irish financial institutions depended on the performance of the economy overall and the value of the property assets against which the institutions had lent money.  Therefore, it was clear, as the property market continued to decline, that future losses on the property would be greater than had been previously expected and future profitability would be less than previously anticipated.  This meant that the capital position of the banks had to be addressed.  The PwC analysis showed clearly that there was a serious problem with land and development loans, both because of the total volume of such loans across the system and because of the small number of developers who had huge debts across the system.  The Department immediately began discussions with the bankers on the need to bolster their capital position.  The policy parameters within which the Department approached the recapitalisations throughout the period were as follows: banks should take action, where possible, to reduce the capital need by making changes to their balance sheets; assets should be sold; subordinated debt holders should be bailed in as far as possible; money should be raised on the markets, if available; the risk to the guarantee should always be considered; the systemic risk, that is, the risk of contagion if capital were not provided, should also be considered; State support should only be considered as a last resort.</p> <p>  The initial recapitalisations of Bank of Ireland and AIB consisting of &euro;3.5 billion in preference shares, was agreed and implemented between December '08 and May '09, with detailed discussions on the amount and the terms and conditions in these capital injections.  AIB also agreed at that time to sell their US and Polish subsidiaries.</p> <p>  The chairman and chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank left in December '08 and Donal O'Connor was appointed executive chairman on a temporary basis until a new CEO could be recruited.  In view of what we knew about it and had discovered, once the announcement of our intention to recapitalise the banks was made on 21 December '08, we prioritised legal due diligence of Anglo.  Arthur Cox carried out the due diligence and their first report was with us on 15 January '09.  The options which we had at that point were to continue with the original recapitalisation, either by preference shares or ordinary shares, to nationalise or to try and disengage.  The latter was not realistic in view of the guarantee, the expectation that European governments would stand behind their banks and the extreme likely contagion effect across the Irish system.  In the event, it was decided to nationalise and replace the board and management.</p> <p>  The problem of land and development loans was dealt with, following a study by Peter Bacon, by setting up NAMA.  An asset management agency was necessary because this loan book was so big and dysfunctional that it would have been very difficult for the banks to deal with these loans while continuing to provide banking services to the rest of the economy.  NAMA has proved efficient in dealing with these loans.  However, the slow, detailed method of valuing them individually and moving them over in tranches, which was developed to meet the requirements of the European competition ... European Commission, the competition directorate, increased the pressure on Irish banks and on the Irish State throughout 2010.  The effect of this should not be exaggerated.  The size of the losses was the major issue and overvaluing NAMA loans in 2010 would have resulted in losses materialising for the State later.  Nonetheless, the transfer of loans based on discounted ... a discount calculated on a broadly stratified sample of loans for each bank would have been a better methodology and would probably have left ... given us the same result.</p> <p>  Another major issue was the haircuts for loans was significantly higher than we had estimated.  This was mainly because of lack of equity in the developments.  In addition to this, the continued recession meant that other loans, including both mortgages and loans to SMEs, were registering an increase in arrears.  The first PCAR stress test run in March 2010 by the Financial Regulator found that the banks had very significant capital needs.  Bank of Ireland met this need through a combination of raising capital on the market and a conversion of &euro;1.7 billion of their Government preference shares.  AIB sold their overseas assets, with the balance of capital - &euro;3.7 billion - being provided by the Government.</p> <p>  Following our entry into the EU-IMF programme, the second PCAR stress test in March 2011 resulted in further capital demands for the banks.</p><p>Once again, Bank of lreland was able to raise money from the private sector, but the other banks, AlB, PTSB, EBS relied mainly on the State. </p><p> Given how much the State had to invest in the banking system, the policy throughout the period was to burden-share where appropriate.  All of the original shareholders in the covered institutions saw their share value diluted to nothing, or almost nothing.  At peak in 2007, the total share value of the institutions was &euro;53.7 billion.  In addition, &euro;15.5 billion capital was raised through burden-sharing with subordinated debt holders.  Much of this was done through liability management exercises where debt holders were asked to voluntarily sell their debt back to the banks at a reduced price.  We also passed legislation to allow the Minister get a special liability order, SLO, from the courts to change the terms of the bonds.  This forced the bondholders to sell into the liability management exercise, or have their bonds extended for a long period and interest suspended.  The SLO was only used in AlB, but, undoubtedly, the existence of the legislation contributed to the success in burden-sharing with the sub debt holders in the other institutions.</p><p> The question of extending burden sharing to senior bondholders was considered seriously twice that I remember - first, in October and November 2010 when the guarantee had lapsed and the programme of assistance was being put in place.  A number of lMF officials were strongly in favour of burning any unguaranteed and unsecured bonds in Anglo.  This was opposed by the EU and ECB officials.  In the event, the matter was considered at a more senior level in the IMF and, as a result of a US Treasury veto, the IMF also came down against any such action.  It would not have been possible for the lrish Government to act without troika consent.  The question was considered again in March 2011, but it was ruled out this time, as I understand, by the ECB.</p><p> The financial crisis ... to look at the regulatory supervision and government issues.  The financial crisis lead to a reassessment of the legislative framework for the financial services, both domestically and internationally.  I will give a brief summary of the changes made.  I will divide my comments into domestic and EU, though obviously the two programmes were developed in tandem and the Department worked to ensure they were consistent to the greatest extent possible. </p><p> On the domestic side, the first action was to amalgamate the Central Bank with the lrish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Separating the supervisory and financial stability functions, albeit with a requirement to cooperate, had undermined the importance of the macro prudential aspects of the role of both organisations.  The amalgamation was effected through the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.  This was followed by an extensive renewal of the supervision and enforcement powers of the Central Bank through the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013.  This latter legislation streamlined, enhanced and modernised the powers of the Central Bank.  Again, while this was a necessary and welcome improvement in the legislative framework, the Central Bank had significant powers before it was enacted and, indeed, used them extensively in the crisis management period, 2008 to 2013, prior to the new legislation.</p><p> The third major strand of legislation was providing for resolution powers.  This was done initially through the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010, which gave extensive temporary resolution powers to the Minister for Finance to deal with the six covered institutions, as necessary, during the crisis.  Subsequently, the Central Bank and Credit institutions (Resolution) Act 2011 was passed.  This provides for the orderly resolution of a financial institution in financial difficulties.  The Central Bank is the resolution authority.</p><p> A final major piece of domestic legislation in the Credit Reporting Act 2013.  This is to enable credit institutions check what loans potential borrowers have from other institutions and organisations.  This should prevent a reoccurrence of a situation where a small number of people can have large loans from many different institutions and pose a systemic risk.  The credit register is currently being set up by the Central Bank.</p><p> On the EU front, the crisis lead to significant changes to the international regulatory framework also.  The 2009 de Larosi&eacute;re report recommended the establishment of a new European systemic risk board and three new supervisory authorities, the European Banking Authority, the European lnsurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, and the European Securities and Markets Authorities.  These bodies set technical standards, resolve disputes between supervisors and assist in developing consistent interpretation of European law.  Major legislative directives were also put in place for all the financial services areas, including the capital requirements directive, CRD lV dealing with bank capital, solvency ll dealing with insurance, and MIFID ll dealing with markets.  This was followed by the banking union proposal which centralised banking supervision and resolution for euro area countries, with a possible opt-in for non-euro countries.  The Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, was set up as a new branch of the ECB with responsibility for supervising the top 130 banks in Europe.  The bank restructuring and resolution directive, BRRD, was also agreed to provide for a single resolution mechanism to resolve financial institutions in difficulties.</p><p>All of these changes represent a major reconfiguration of the regulatory and supervisory framework.  Many of them have only just been implemented and some are not yet operational.  It will be some time before their effectiveness can be assessed.</p><p> And I'll stop at that, Chairman, and allow you ask your questions.</p></speech>

Deputy, you've 25 minutes.</p></speech>

Ms Nolan, the Banking and Financial Services Division at the Department of Finance have, as a principal directive, it's on your website, and I'll just quote: "On the one hand. to contribute to the maintenance of financial and economic stability and identify and manage potential risks to that stability...".  And then, on the other hand, a little bit later, "...to continue the development of Ireland as a centre for international financial services".  As you well know, in the 2003 Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act, responsibility was given to the Central Bank and the regulator in the Act "to promote the development within the State of the financial services industry".  And that was removed, then, in the Central Bank Reform Act 2010. </p> <p>  Can I ask you if continuing to give this mandate to the Department of Finance to develop the financial services industry on the one hand, and then to have ... identify and manage potential risks, can this impact on making appropriate decisions regarding policy and legislation in regard to the regulation of the financial sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#E00400"><p>It is a function of government to develop the economy and a major priority of the current Government and I think of previous Governments is employment development, and there are in the funds industry alone, 35,000 people working in the funds industry in Ireland.  So, you know, it is a major source of jobs for Ireland and a major and important area.  However, for us to develop that, we need a strong regulatory system.  I don't see the two as being in contradiction.  I think if our regulatory system isn't robust, then that industry isn't secure, and the jobs in that industry is not secure.  So, although I think for the regulator to have a job of promotion is inappropriate, I don't think it's inappropriate for the Department of Finance to have that job, and I don't think it influences our regulatory decisions because I think for us, we would see as a major policy issue to have a robust regulatory system, and that that robust regulatory system is necessary to develop the international financial services industry.  I don't think they can develop against a background of light regulation in the modern world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#E00500"><p>Yes.  With respect, Ms Nolan, the paper Regulating Better from the Department of the Taoiseach in January 2004 made exactly those points, that regulation was to develop in a responsible way the sector.  But we know what happened in the meantime with the bubble and the disastrous crash.  Now, several witnesses in front of this inquiry have suggested that giving the Central Bank and the regulator at that time the mandate to regulate and control at the same time as promoting the industry gave rise to a conflict.  And the Governor of the Central Bank listed it as one of the difficulties that arose with tougher regulation and allowing so-called light-touch regulation.  What's different now, one would have to ask?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#E00600"><p>Well, what's a major difference is the Central Bank no longer has that requirement.  I mean, I think you have to differentiate significantly in the role of the Department and the role of the Central Bank.  The role of the Central Bank is to regulate, and it is absolutely not the role of the Central Bank to promote the development of the industry.  We provide the legislative framework for that regulation, and the legislative framework is separate, even within the Department, to the promotion of the IFSC, which is in a different section of the Department.  But all Departments have the economic development of the country as part of their mandate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/954" speakername="Joe Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#F00100"><p>Yes.  I'm just trying to explore whether this is a conflict that still can have detrimental effects because it was suggested by witnesses that one reason for so-called light-touch regulation was that there was a reluctance to be tough on Irish banks, for example, in relation to the extent of property lending, over-lending etc. because that would make then the Irish financial services centre and the foreign banks that were there look like an offshore account.  Isn't there still that contradiction there then?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#F00200"><p>Absolutely not, in the sense that first of all, the Central Bank no longer has that requirement but far more importantly, the regulation across Europe for all financial services has become far more strict and far more uniform, so the regulatory system to which the IFSC organisations are now subject is not lighter than the regulatory system in other countries.  It is not a light-touch regulatory system and nor should it be.  It is subject to the EU directives which are implemented in Ireland by the Irish Central Bank but implemented in other countries by their central banks.</p></speech>

Then it goes on to say, "Through its work with governmental and industry committees and working groups, Irish Funds contributes to and influences the development of Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory and legislative framework."  Is that worrying, that a powerful lobby can say, in effect, on one reading, that they are writing the regulation for their own industry?</p></speech>

I mean, I'm not responsible for what they say.  They are free ... they're ... if you want to find out what they say you'll have to ask them, I can't answer for that but they most certainly are not writing their own regulation.  The regulations for the fund industry are almost entirely EU regulations and are developed by the European Commission in conjunction with the European Parliament.  We would consult with the funds industry as we would consult with any other group on those regulations as how they would affect them ... interest group.  Most of our consultations nowadays are done on the web in ... by means of public consultations.  But they do not write the legislation, it just simply isn't true.</p></speech>

I was working on the emergency budget which, if you remember happened on 15 October and was working all that weekend all right but it was on a different topic.  So I wouldn't be aware as to what ... why decisions were taken in that.  I know Kevin Cardiff has already spoken on this and is in a far better place, and probably William Beausang as well, to give you commentary on that.  On whether it would have made any difference, I honestly do not believe it would have made any difference but I can't prove that.  You can only run life one way and you only get to see it once but I personally don't believe it would have made any difference on the speeding up of resolution.</p></speech>

I refer to core documents Department of Finance Vol. 2, pages 116 and 119, but I'll quote, it's not necessary to follow it.</p><p>This is the advice from Merrill Lynch to the National Treasury Management Agency and the Department on 28 September, which is one day before the ... the guarantee.  And it is obviously in favour of what it calls "state protective custody" of Anglo-Irish Bank and INBS, and it says on paragraph (b) there, page 116, "This could occur over a very short period of time ... within days, but the point at which it occurs it will not be of surprise to debt or equity investors as knowledge of the institution's financial position will be obvious and they should expect such intervention in the absence of a private-sector solution."  And then, on page 119, under "Guarantee for six Primary Regulated Banks", it says, "This would almost certainly negatively impact the State's sovereign credit rating, and raise issues as to its credibility."  That was the advice of the, one of these groups that the Government retained quite a bit.  Does it surprise you, in view of that and in view of the fact that their prognosis about the sovereign being affected came true very strongly, that the comprehensive guarantee was still given - and, again, to reflect on the effect of that - as opposed to nationalising Anglo and INBS on the night?</p></speech>

So, the suggestion which seems to be in this document, that merely nationalising would stop all the outflow of funds from the system, our experience ... subsequent experience was not that that was the effect of nationalisation.  So, you know, apart from that, that's really all I can say-----</p></speech>

Okay.  Just to move on to a different but related area, then, Ms. Nolan, on page 5 of your statement, yes, you said, I quote you, "there was a great reluctance at the European level" ... we have moved forward to the October-November period of 2010, and approaching the crunch period and the so-called bailout, and you said, "there was a great reluctance at European level to allow the burning of senior bondholders."  And that has featured here, but what is your understanding, why was there such reluctance, where did it come from and how was it conveyed to your Department?</p></speech>

It may also have been conveyed to the Minister separately, at Eurogroup meetings and so on.  The reluctance was because of the contagion effect.  They were very concerned that it would encourage or create difficulties in other states, for example, Portugal, Spain, Italy, where it might be seen that they were likely to burn bondholders less, and that you could create a run across Europe from the peripheral states into the centre ... in bondholders.</p></speech>

So this would be going on at the same time as Mr. Trichet was writing to the Minister for Finance and, you know, demanding certain courses of action.  Would that then have been replicated in frequent phone calls or how ... between senior people in the Department of Finance and the European institutions?</p></speech>

There was the discussions on the imminent bailout, EU-IMF programme, and I think Kevin Cardiff, in his long statement, probably far better than I remember, gives details of the various meetings that occurred, so I would have taken part in some of those meetings.  But also, my colleague at the time who was in charge, our EFC member, would have been going to very frequent EFC meetings ... meeting his European counterparts at the European working group and so on.

Who was in Korea, pretending to announce that the Irish Government had decided to seek a bailout?  Who, in Korea or elsewhere, [and that's in relation to a G7 meeting, I think, that was happening] was taking these false rumours and putting them into the hands of press and financial commentators?</blockquote>Can you throw any further light on this?</p></speech>

Now, just then on ... in relation to the veto on burning bondholders, can I ask you, Ms Nolan, it's core document Ann Nolan, Vol. 2 and it's page 19.  This is a letter from Mr. John Corrigan, the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, to Brian Lenihan, TD, Minister for Finance, dated 28 November 2010.  And in the second paragraph, Mr. Corrigan writes:<blockquote><br /><br />I learnt during the course of the discussion [and that was a discussion at a meeting of the Government the night before which he attended] that the external authorities and the European Central Bank (at board or equivalent level) had taken the view that burden sharing with unguaranteed bank senior bondholders was &quot;not on the table&quot;.  It is unfortunate that, notwithstanding the fast moving pace of recent events, I was not made aware of this outcome.</blockquote>Ms Nolan, is that an extraordinary revelation that the NTMA was again outside the loop which seemed to have happened the night of the bank guarantee as well?</p></speech>

The NTMA weren't outside the loop; they were at many of the meetings we were at.  In that period 27-28 November, we had meetings night and day, I mean, literally 'til two, three in the morning.  The NTMA were at some meetings.  There were at some times five or six.  I remember one of the Saturday nights there were five or six different meetings taking place at a technical level throughout the building.  It was very unfortunate that John was not made aware of that but I rather think it was entirely accidental that people believed he had been told and that he wasn't told, rather than that anyone decided not to tell him.</p></speech>

I mean, I think the issue ... the NTMA and ourselves were <i>ad idem </i>to what we wanted, which would have been the burning of the bondholders and the question was that the European Central Bank that ... had taken a very strong line.  The word came back to us at the last minute before the Government meeting and as far as I remember and it is a long time ago ... but it was unfortunate that John wasn't told but I don't think you can read anything else into it.</p></speech>

Now, at one stage Bank of Ireland told you that it needed &euro;2 billion.  It finished up getting multiples of that.  Allied Irish Bank said it didn't need as much support as both Anglo and Bank of Ireland and it finished up getting &euro;21 billion.  Were the banks straight with the Department or were they covering up or were they even lying some of them?</p></speech>

I ... it's not a question of whether they were lying or not.  First of all, the question is whether they knew themselves what their position was at the time.  There is a question of what their position was at one point in time and the fact that the things deteriorated.  I mean the drop in GDP in Ireland in 2009 was phenomenal.  I don't think anyone at the end of 2008, which is the point where this is taking part, had any idea the extent to which the recession would be so deep as it was, particularly in 2009-2010.  So, therefore, I think the capital needs grew over that period and so even if they were right in 2008 as to what they needed at that point, that point was not even allowing for what was envisaged as so-called stress tests wasn't sufficient when the actual stress was so much bigger than they were testing for.  So I don't think there was a question of they told ... you know, in 2008 if somebody had walked into this committee and said, ''By the way, AIB need &euro;20 billion'', everyone would just simply have said, ''You're mad; you can't possibly think AIB needs &euro;20 billion'", you know, because there was no ... there was no facts on which to base such an idea.  So I don't think it's a question that they lied, that they knew they needed the &euro;20 billion and lied to us.  I think it's a question that they didn't think they needed and, at that time, they didn't really need it.  It was later they needed it.</p></speech>

Irish Nationwide, I think, is a slightly different case.  I think, Irish Nationwide, there was greater evidence that they were in difficulty.  But ironically, it took longer for it to manifest, partly because their deposit base was more sound and, therefore, they weren't as hit by the market walking away from them as some of the other banks.</p></speech>

So technically, being solvent wasn't sufficient.</p></speech>

Deputy Kieran O'Donnell.  Actually just before you ... just to clear up one thing with you, Ms. Nolan.  You were saying to Deputy Higgins about the Central Bank and the relationship with regard to promotional services in the IFSC and how that now is separated and that conflict doesn't actually exist.  Can I ask you to share an opinion or your own views as to, in the previous manifestation, as to whether that was a good operation or a good way to approach the promotion of the IFSC centre?</p></speech>

Irish Government formally notified the European Commission that they would be recapitalising Anglo to ... on 15 January, just over a week later, when you announced ... when the Government announced they would be nationalising Anglo instead.  What led to the  change of decision and what other options were considered and what advice was advised the Minister and the Government in this regard?  So it's that critical week between 8 January 2009 and 15 January 2009, where you went from recapitalising Anglo to the tune of &euro;1.5 billion to nationalising Anglo.</p></speech>

On the 21st we announced that ... we had previously announced that there was capital available, on the 21st we announced that it would be divvied up by, I think at that time, &euro;2 billion each for Bank of Ireland and AIB and &euro;1.5 billion for Anglo - any that were most in need of the capital ... of the three of them ... most immediate need.  We had deep concerns about recapitalising Anglo without nationalising it, simply because of the issues that had led to the chairman's resigning.  So we prioritised the due diligence of Anglo.  We sent Arthur Cox in to do a legal due diligence to see were there any other issues which might have to be dealt with.</p></speech>

The reality is we did look, you know, the crisis was ongoing and we couldn't allow the ... we couldn't give ourselves the luxury of taking six months to look at every single loan because the banks might have collapsed in that time, which would have left every small business in Ireland without proper banking system.  So the first recapitalisation was done on the basis of relatively little due diligence in that sense, relative to whatever happened afterwards.  But also, the position kept getting worse so even if we had looked at everything, a lot of the loans were perfectly okay at the beginning of 2009, they were very bad by 2010 or 2011.  Things got worse over the period.</p></speech>

In hindsight, it is easy say things could have been done differently but it wasn't possible at the time.  I think, you know, the Central Bank itself had in 2008, the end of 2008, told me all the banks were solvent but in reality, I don't think they had that much detailed knowledge of what was going on in the banks or indeed all the expertise they needed to do that.  Throughout 2009, they revamped their system as well.  By 2010 they were capable of doing a proper PCAR.  I don't think they could have done the same PCAR in 2009.  I don't think they had the expertise.  So I think there is an element of that in what happened.</p></speech>

Now, in that report, they stated, "[D]epending on the eventual level of haircut applied to the senior unsecured guaranteed debt (senior debt) and subordinated debt, could give rise to a capital saving to the State of approximately &euro;14.9 billion."  So, I suppose the question I want to ask is can you tell me the various ... this was March 2011, the various discussions that would have taken place with the IMF, the European Commission over the period since '08 as to where this issue would have come up?  Do you believe that if the US had not issued ... exercised their veto within the IMF in late 2010, do you believe that burden sharing in terms of senior bondholders and subordinated debt holders would have arisen at that time?</p></speech>

I mean, I suppose the problem with the banking system is that it needed to downsize very significantly and that downsizing, no matter what you do, takes time.  If you look at the trajectory, you know, it was &euro;400 million loans outstanding in '08 across the six institutions; and, 2010, there was &euro;280 billion loans outstanding; and now it's down to, oh, about &euro;172 billion and we're now at a loan-to-deposit ratio of about 112%.  So we're probably around a sustainable level now across the three banks that are left.  But that downsizing, could it have been done quicker?  It might have cost the State a lot more if we did it quicker is the real problem because there's always a trade off.  If you sell everything very quickly, you get a less good price, so, you know, it isn't a given that doing it quicker would have things better.  It might have made things worse.</p></speech>

I suppose the two ... the major things that were involved there was I was involved in the assigning of licences to IFSC companies which ... the last number of licences were done by competition, so I ran the competitions for companies that wished to get licences in the last two or three rounds of licences for the IFSC.  And the other major piece of work I did in there was to integrate the tax system between the IFSC and the non-IFSC tax system because the IFSC had had a 10% rate, it was moving up to a 12.5% rate, and the rest of the tax system was moving down to a 12.5% rate, but there were a number of other aspects where the IFSC ... of the taxation where the IFSC was treated differently to the parts that were outside, so my role was to develop plans to integrate those two.</p></speech>

You said in response to Deputy O'Donnell just a moment ago that the overall net cost of the banking crisis will effectively be the money put into Anglo Irish Bank.  Can I just ask you your view on some of the work that was done in Project Atlas by PwC?  I mean, for example, in February 2009, they produced a summary report of three previous reports that they had conducted into Anglo Irish Bank and they projected what the capital position of the bank would be on the various loss scenarios and they reached a conclusion, for example, that "Under the PwC highest stress scenario, Anglo's core equity and tier 1 ratios are projected to exceed regulatory minima, (Tier 1 - 4%) at [end of] September 2010 after taking account of operating profits and stressed impairments."  Now, when it actually came to September 2010, the losses in Anglo were almost &euro;30 billion, so how can you rationalise that conclusion in early 2009 with the outcome of a loss and a bill for the taxpayer of almost &euro;30 billion in September 2010?</p></speech>

I think there were two aspects where they were wrong in ... not necessarily that they should have been right but, in retrospect.  The first one was the issue we've dealt with earlier, the question of whether there was any equity at all in the loans and I think, if you were to ask me, Bank of Ireland did have equity, AIB had some and Anglo, as far as I could see, just topped up all the loans to 100%, or were lending to the borrowers in a different hat ... with a different hat on, so the loans effectively had almost no equity.</p> <p>  The second aspect, I think, where there's the biggest difference between the original PwC work and what actually happened is the assumption that the bank had a model that would continue to generate income.  And the other banks, and the living banks, and the reason they're still living banks, had other business where they were generating income, whereas Anglo, this was all they did.  Their model was broken and therefore there was no income to compensate, or to make up extra ... and no prospect of income to make up extra capital.</p><p>But looking back now, how would you characterise that report which, you know, essentially formed the basis of------</p></speech>

I suppose there are two aspects to that question, Deputy.  Obviously the question is could PwC have known better, and I'm not sure whether they could or not.  Obviously it was wrong, and I remember at the time, if you look at the ... the first time I saw those reports, summary report, I think it was a bit earlier than the beginning of 2009, some time in 2008, so it was the banks' own projections and the PwC's projections which were stress 1, stress 2, and I remember looking and thinking "Wouldn't it be wonderful if what happens is the banks' own projections."  Because you don't know the future at any given time, but thinking not very realistic.  And then thinking that actually there was a real chance that things were worse than the PwC stress 2 because the economy, you know, with the other side of our hat we were looking at the economy, looking at having done a budget in October, which I was involved in, October 2008, which was out of date already by January '09.  So you kind of looked at that and thought, you know, "It might be worse than they're saying."</p></speech>

What other options were being considered at that time, because we know the management of the bank, for example, were putting forward an alternative model which would have seen a surviving bank emerge, as such, from the carcass of Anglo, so what options were the Government considering in the autumn of 2010 for the future of Anglo?</p></speech>

The new management team had tried to get a business plan for an ongoing bank which would work, and we looked at those, I think in August 2010, as best I remember it, in conjunction with the Central Bank.  In the meantime, their funding model was, you know, they were just ELA almost entirely, and as every piece of their funding rolled off it was replaced by ELA, so they had a huge funding problem.  And the new bank just wasn't to my mind - that they were proposing - wasn't to my mind - and we did look at it seriously, but it wasn't actually fund-able in terms of ... it didn't have a business plan that you could convince the ECB or the markets was a funding model going forward.  So, that option was looked at and decided against.  The twin-track approach was on the basis that we were under the impression, which turned out to be a misapprehension, that the ECB was willing to fund the funding bank, so-----</p></speech>

And what was your view of the first letter received from Mr. Trichet then in the middle of October 2010 where, effectively, he's saying, "Look, you can take this extraordinary level of ELA support for granted."

But what was the view within the Department of the ELA being highlighted in that manner and the way in which it was put by the ECB?</p></speech>

So could I put the question to you, and it follows up with what Deputy McGrath was saying, is that the structure, or design of the bank guarantee along with its period of duration, have any bearing on the Irish State entering a bailout programme two years and two months after the guarantee?</p></speech>

So there were ... it wasn't just the guarantee itself, there was other things which contributed to that, but certainly that was a factor.  It was a factor in the ELA being as big as the Deputy just pointed out.</p></speech>

When Mr. Trichet was, as I say, at the IIEA event in which the inquiry engaged with him, speaking on the same issue, he says:<blockquote><br /><br />[As] you know, we could [have almost] continued on our side ... having gone up to 100% of ... GDP ... to 200% of ... GDP [this was with regard to the ELA funding that was coming into the country], and why not 300% of ... GDP?  [That would] Then what would ... the commission [of] inquiry [be] asking for?  [Talking about this inquiry, as to what would be our purpose]  You would say, &quot;Were you totally crazy at the ECB to continue, when you were going to the wall at 100 mph, to continue to provide liquidity and liquidity and liquidity?&quot;</blockquote>So could I ask you, Ms Nolan, was Mr. Trichet right?

I mean, the legislation was ready, I think, and could be made ready very quickly in terms of ... that was ready, I think, at the time of the guarantee, in that nationalisation, and that legislation was ready to go.  Part of the due diligence we did in Anglo before we nationalised it was looking at all the bond agreements to make sure there were no clauses ... there were some of the clauses that had to be bought out just before the nationalisation, you know, in terms of swaps and these kind of things, technical stuff, and that ... you know, you need ... you need to do that stuff before you nationalise, and we did do it before we nationalised.</p></speech>

It's from ... it's witness book Ann Nolan, Vol. 2, pages 85-87.  Okay.  Now, if I can just scroll down this a moment, and while it's being done, maybe to a page ... it's the third page of it, it's the last footnotes of it here.  But in doing so, as I'm pulling that up, by March 2012, it was becoming clear within the Department of Finance that a longer-term restructuring solution was needed to the promissory notes which had been provided to IBRC.  The paper was produced in October 2012 for the EMC.  This proposed replacement of promissory notes with longer terms bonds over maybe a 30 to 40-year spread, however the view was that this would require liquidation of IBRC to allow this to be acceptable to the ECB.  Now, what I'm trying to do here is to get an understanding as to who was responsible for the strategic planning of the balance sheet impact of the banking crisis and also to establish with you the level of assistance and co-operation the Department of Finance received from the European Central Bank and Central Bank of Ireland during the crisis plan and implementation of putting in a solution.  So, in this regard, who originated this idea and what level of co-operation was evident from the Central Bank of Ireland and the ECB to investigate, discuss and cost alternatives and can you also describe the interaction and level of co-operation between the Central Bank of Ireland, the EMC and the European Central Bank and your Department to work through this proposal?</p></speech>

This proposal ... I suppose, it goes back to what we were talking about earlier about moving all the deposits out of Anglo and INBS and then the following summer we amalgamated the two of them.  Now, we then had, effectively, a run-off vehicle with very big European funding which was rolling on a two-week basis, which was very unsatisfactory.  At the time of the guarantee ... at the time of the bailout, which would have been November 2010, there was some discussion about how the long-term funding of Anglo ... but no conclusion was reached at that time.  So we had various options after we had amalgamated the two of them in summer of 2011.  Various options were discussed, many of which didn't make very much sense but, from our own point of view, those discussions with the troika were very important because we knew we needed to get some resolution which would give long-term, not two-week funding, that we couldn't have a vehicle there ... you know, effectively for us, a priority was fixing it up or having a long-term solution before we left the programme.  While you were in the programme you had a kind of certain protection from the markets but you wouldn't have that when you left the programme so it was quite important to look at that.  So it was, I think ... I genuinely do not remember who first suggested it, but I think it was at some meetings at the very beginning of September 2011, no, 2012, when the liquidation of Anglo was first discussed and suddenly it became possible because, because it's kind of almost legal theology that the ECB had, this was a more attractive solution to them than the other solutions we'd been putting forward.  And it was ... had huge attractions to us as well, in that it would, effectively, remove Anglo or IBRC from the landscape, which was causing so much trouble for everyone.  So we entered into discussions fairly intensively starting at the very beginning of September 2012, ourselves, the Central Bank and the ECB.</p></speech>

We needed to make sure the Central Bank was whole, because you couldn't leave the Central Bank with a deficit in it.  We'd only have to make that up ourselves.  We needed to make sure that the ELA was gone out of the system because that was the objective of the ECB in getting involved in this.  We needed to make sure that the promissory note payments were put on a much better position ... a better schedule for the Irish Government so that when we were going back into the market, we wouldn't have this huge borrowing requirement for the promissory note, which would damage our capacity to do business in the market.  So they were our ... you know, the solution we got met most of those objectives.</p></speech>

And just moving on to point 9, and this will be my final question on this issue, it says, "If [the fair value of NAMA pays for the assets sorry, if] the fair value that NAMA pays for the assets is at a significant discount to the net value of to the assets at IBRC [this is the relationship now of NAMA and the loan book of what was formerly the Anglo Irish Bank], this may create a capital shortfall for the [Central Bank of Ireland] arising from the sale, [from] which the State would ultimately be liable as a result of the Ministerial guarantee."  Can you explain to us what that actually means there?</p></speech>

So, if the assets sold or ... the assets would be transferred to NAMA ... What happened was, the flow ... the Central Bank had a floating charge on the assets; the floating charge was sold to NAMA in return for NAMA bonds, so then the Central Bank had NAMA bonds.  So the Central Bank was okay from day one, it had NAMA bonds and they were Government-guaranteed NAMA bonds.  The floating charge then went to NAMA.  All the assets were then valued, the valuation, the NAMA valuation set a floor.  They couldn't be sold for less than that.  If the sales process had bids for less than that, they go to NAMA at the NAMA valuation.  In the event they were all sold for more than the NAMA valuation so it never arose.  But in the ... had it been that the NAMA valuation added together for all the assets and none of them had sold to the private sector and the NAMA valuation was less than the floating note charge, we could have been left with a ... with a bill, and that's what that is referring to.  But that did not happen.</p></speech>

So just to come back to maybe to summarise my very, very first question to you, all of these details very, very big numbers, very big sums, very difficult detailed, complexed issues to be unravelled to try and create another type of solution or another type of approach.  Who originated the idea, and if you could maybe summarise again as to what level of co-operation was evident coming from the Central Bank and the European Central Bank to discuss and cost these alternatives?</p></speech>

We seconded ... corporate bankers from AIB, who weren't very busy at the time ... a team of corporate bankers into the Department, and had them working directly on my team there, to look at all of these very complex details.  And they did the planning for us in co-operation with the Central Bank of Ireland who co-operated very strongly and in negotiation ... technically the ECB weren't negotiating with us, technically this was a deal between us and the Central Bank of Ireland, but of course there were technical discussions between my team and the ECB on several occasions.  The ECB, I think, blew hot and cold on it.  There were people within the ECB who felt it was a good deal and should be done, there were people within the ECB who felt it was, you know, not such a good deal and maybe shouldn't be done.  But the ones who wanted to do it were the ones whose view prevailed in the end, thank God.</p></speech>

I ... you know, in some ways it made no difference because he was pre-empting the Government's decision.  I think it probably was unhelpful to the Government but I don't think it really changed anything.  It was probably unhelpful to our negotiation position, which was probably our immediate reaction, if I was being really honest about it, because for us at that point, down in the trenches, we were more interested in the small print of what was being agreed.  You know, what are we committing to, is it things we don't want to take off it?  You didn't want someone coming along pre-empting that.  But, even in that, I'm not sure if it really made any difference.  It's more an emotional reaction when you're very involved.</p></speech>

I mean, I would've been aware that somebody had mentioned it and ... probably by May anyway, that year.  And I don't think I remember having a conversation with Patrick about it particularly.  I think we were looking at how it could or couldn't be avoided and whether it should or shouldn't be avoided because there's two aspects to that.  At a certain point of stress, you might be better off in a programme, you know, provided you could control what the programme was forcing you to do.  In other words ... and certainly by that August we were working in the Department very much on the national recovery plan, the four-year plan, because we wanted to make sure that if we entered into negotiations, that we had a version up front, ourselves, of what we wanted out of them.  In other words, that we weren't in a position where the IMF was coming in and making it up <i>ab initio</i>.</p></speech>

I think it was ... it was beforehand and I genuinely can't remember when the meetings were.  But it was looking at ... you know, one of the things we had going for us at the time - and in the end it may not have mattered that much - we had a fair bit of cash in hand with the NTMA, which certainly help our negotiation position.  And we also ...  you know, what we were looking at is were there other places where you could get cash.  But we were never ... in the event we had the bailout agreed before we were in a position where we were actually looking for cash in any desperate way.  And I think, in retrospect, that was right.  We should have ...  it's much better to negotiate from a position where you're not desperate.</p></speech>

Can I ask you now again ... and I don't want to re-cover ground that's been already covered but there's a question that I must ask you in relation to the analysis and due diligence that was carried out on .... to identify the amount of &euro;3.5 billion in capital for AIB and Bank of Ireland in February 2009.  Why did the Government proceed with this amount for AIB given that it was clearly outlined that this amount was insufficient to meet their capital needs, with AIB ultimately requiring in excess of &euro;20 billion?</p></speech>

And we gave them &euro;3.5 billion on the understanding that they would sell their Polish and US subsidiaries to make up the difference.</p></speech>

Now I want to turn to the issue of capitalisation ... recapitalisation in general.

I think Bank of Ireland were the most realistic.  I mean, I think very early on they told us that even if, technically, they could do a projection that showed they wouldn't need capital, they felt for the markets to really have faith in them, they needed probably &euro;2 billion extra capital.  And AIB told us they were the alpha male that didn't need any capital.  And ... sorry that's a bad expression ... they were, you know, well able to cope.  And Anglo told us that the private sector would give them capital.  The first time I met them I was stunned at the amount of capital the private sector was going to put into them.  But of course it never materialised.  I mean, you knew it was-----</p></speech>

I was just going to turn to the Bank of Ireland question because we have minutes - and I've referred to them in evidence - from Mr. Cardiff from 13 and 17 October 2008, where they were discussing at board level that ... the need for a taxpayer injection - actually, not just a recapitalisation but a taxpayer funded one - and on 17 October, one of their minutes said "it would be inappropriate to push the Government at [this] time, as the Exchequer budget was due to be announced the following day."

I now want to turn actually briefly to Mr. Moran.  Mr. John Moran, the previous Secretary General we've had in giving evidence already.  He in many respects was one of the first outsiders, maybe the first one, to become Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  How would you define his period as Secretary General?

And John, in his unique, inimitable way, contributed very positively to that change but it had started before he arrived - the Wright report, it indicated quite a lot of changes - and has continued after he's left, but he certainly brought some very positive things to that and contributed very positively to that.</p></speech>

It was still largely an agricultural bank, lending to farmers.  It was doing a small bit of property lending.  I didn't like the structures of the property lending but I was told I was a conservative civil servant.  In retrospect, maybe I should have brought my conservatism to all of the other banks as well.  I wasn't keen on it but it was a small portion; it wasn't a huge risk at the time because it was a relatively small proportion of their book, so it was different.</p></speech>

And you go on to say that the long-term losses essentially arise from INBS and Anglo.  Can I query and interrogate that somewhat with you for a minute or two?  In regard to Allied Irish Banks, the general figure that is put out there is that &euro;21 billion of State funds went in.  I would say that has to be added to by the following: NAMA witnesses said to the inquiry that the banks were overpaid for loans transferred to NAMA from them by &euro;10 billion.  That was the evidence from NAMA chief executive and chair.  If we allocate the Allied Irish Bank proportion of that, it would be &euro;2.8 billion, so I say if you add that to the &euro;21 billion, you get &euro;23.8 billion.  the merger with the EBS gives a further &euro;777 million in a, kind of, a hidden recapitalisation to AIB and then there's a further transfer, in February 2011, of &euro;1.6 billion or &euro;1.7 billion of Anglo NAMA bonds and deposits.  Now that brings the cost, arguably, to &euro;26 billion.

I can't remember what the third thing you said was added to it.  So I mean it's the &euro;20 billion, I think, we'll get back.  We've already got fees of about &euro;5 billion and we have our CoCos due back next year of &euro;1.6 billion, which I expect them to pay us back.

They were lending effectively into the building industry.  The bulk of their lending, directly or indirectly, was into the building industry.  And that method of financing developments can't be done any more, you know, banks will never again give more than 60% into development loaning ... lending - 60% of any given development.  So, the problem wasn't so much ... there were several problems but the big thing was that there was no capacity to regenerate profits, which the other banks had.</p></speech>

All I'm talking about there is the method of doing it.  What we did was we looked at every single loan.  So in tranche 1, they went through every single loan in every single bank.  Probably if they'd done 20% of the loans for every bank, in the different tranches, and done them all together, you'd have got more or less the same answer.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#W00600"><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My opening remarks are quite brief.  First of all, I'd like to thank you and the members for the opportunity to make this brief opening statement today.  The task of inquiring into the banking crisis and the events surrounding it will, I hope, reveal lessons for the future guidance of policy makers which will help reduce the risks of a recurrence of these events to a remote one.  I don't think we could have another such unaffordable crisis.</p> <p>  I would like at the outset to express my regret at how matters turned out for the people of Ireland and for the period of austerity that affected so many, and for the increased burden of debt that we now carry.  As set out in my written statement, my connection in this was as a senior civil servant providing economic and fiscal policy advice to Ministers and Government, who then decided on the policy actions to pursue.  </p> <p>  I believe that, as confirmed by the Wright report, that the policy advice was appropriate, although not always followed.  The advice was to run a fiscal policy close to balance or a surplus, and to avoid adding unnecessarily to demand in the economy, to improve supply and to guard our competitiveness.  I did not provide advice on monetary or credit issues, that being the preserve of the Central Bank, or on credit growth, seeing that is a matter for the Central Bank to handle.  While giving advice I also took advice, notably that the likely growth scenario was one of a soft landing, i.e. that the housing market would return to more normal levels in a manageable way.  This was the view of economic advisors in the Department as well as outside, official and private sector commentators.  </p> <p>  I did not foresee events as they happened.  Others didn't do so either.  I was aware of only limited contrarian advice at the time.  It is difficult, as I said in my written statement, for cautionary or contrarian views to be got across when the economic news is so positive and when the country has been widely complimented on its economic performance.  </p> <p>  The rise in asset prices was a factor of accommodating monetary policy and fiscal policy, strong domestic demand and certain property tax incentives.  These incentives were introduced at various times since the 1980s.  The motivation for these reliefs was to develop, restore, renew certain areas, and to stimulate employment and job creation.  Some of these were more successful than others, and all were generally supported at political level.  A number of these were terminated after 1997, some limited in extent, and some new ones introduced.  The case for such reliefs was much diminished in the strong property market, but it took time to eliminate these from the tax system.  </p> <p>  I accept that there was a deficiency in economic advice resources, which it also took time to address effectively.  The situation was improved, but the problem is not just recruiting but retaining staff.  The current Government economic and evaluation service model seeks to address these issues in a constructive way.  Fiscal policy decisions take place in a different context to monetary policy action.  That context is a democratic one.  Government must marshal support for policy actions, and justify and defend these to parliament and the electorate.  It is not easy to garner support for restraint when resources appear plentiful.  A key challenge for the future, I believe, will be the need to communicate the wisdom of restraint to the public, even when resources allow, and the desirability of using surplus funds to reduce debt now to lessen the burden for the future.  It also seems that the EU believes that closer monitoring of member states, more constraints on our freedom of action, and firmer rules on budgetary policies will bring about greater fiscal responsibility.  Hopefully this will not be at the expense of democratic responsibility.  In short, there are important lessons to be learned and there are important issues to be reflected on in the remit of the inquiry on which I hope I can help in that regard.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  </p></speech>

In terms of expenditure in your period, in the senior role in expenditure, did the Governments, successive Governments, keep their hand out of the public expenditure till or not?</p></speech>

As regards the period from 2000, I think the picture varied.  There was some years in which there was quite strong expenditure growth, and I think in 2003 and 2004 that fell to 7% or 6%.  And then, after that, it returned to a level of 10%.  So there was very strong expenditure growth.  I mean, it was a time of plentiful resources.  There were also Government commitments and social partnership commitments, so that these added to the pressures for public spending.</p></speech>

Ten years later it was &euro;62.5 billion.  That's a trebling of expenditure on behalf of the State in a relatively short period.  Did the Department do any international peer reviews with trading partners or anything of that nature to see ... to gauge the expenditure by the Irish State with other states?</p></speech>

I think the metric we used was as a percentage of GDP.  And, you know, it remained around the 32%, 33%, 34%, which was far less than in neighbouring countries, maybe with the exception of the UK, and on the same level as the US.  So that is the ... that's the main metric we used.  I mean, different countries had different traditions.  The Scandinavian countries have high expenditure, high taxes.  We were trying to run high expenditure and low taxes, which the growth and the economic resources allowed, for a time.</p></speech>

And that on the basis of that &euro;100 billion, that that is part of the national debt.  Could I ask your analysis of the &euro;100 billion and how, in the future, the future generations will be obliged to pay that back?</p></speech>

I mean, we had this problem before in the 80s when we had debt, GDP, or GNP ratios of over 100%, that you got up to 130%, or close to it at one stage.  And the interest rate regime, I think, payments were taking up a lot of the income tax receipts were going on paying the national debt.</p><p>Unless there's some debt forgiveness, then the only way we can fund that is by growing and reducing the burden in that way, so that we have more capacity to pay the interest.  We did it before.  It took some time to do but that's the main way.  Now, obviously, before there were high interest rates we weren't part of the euro.  So, you know, to the extent that the monetary policy in the euro works, and fiscal policy ... the debt burden in terms of interest rates will be a bit more manageable than it was before.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.498" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#X00300"><p>Well, there are various figures given for the reliance on these taxes.  There's a figure mentioned of 30%.  That includes corporation tax, and corporation tax is paid mainly by the multinational sector and is more related to foreign GDP than it is to domestic.  And, in the case of stamp duties, the fact is that there's no stamp duty on new houses, it's ... stamp duty is on second-hand houses; it's VAT that's on the new houses.  So, there was a concern that if the economy turned down sharply we could be exposed, but the general opinion was that there would be a soft landing, in which case there would be less tax, but there would be some facility either to raise tax in other ways or to let the deficit ... incur a deficit, which is allowable if ... to a certain extent, if growth reduces.</p></speech>

The ... can I ask, Mr. McNally, is it possible for a civil servant, even a very senior, experienced civil servant to say, "No, you can't do that, Minister, it's too far, it's beyond the pale; that it's irresponsible to implement a specific type of policy?"</p></speech>

It depends on the context.  But if you put the arguments to the Minister, and put them in the budget strategy and memorandum, then there is a matter for political decision what the level of public spending should be and what the tax to fund that should be.  So, I'd say, yes, you could say ... you could argue against it., but if the Minister decides, or the Government decides, generally, as a civil servant, you do what the Government decides.</p></speech>

The SSIAs: can I ask what was your view about the SSIAs?  They were &euro;15 billion with the State contributing a portion of that.</p></speech>

I think there was some OECD evidence to suggest that it just moved the savings around.  I don't know whether that was the case or not, but the Minister was strongly of the view that, given the - this is what he expressed to us - given the prosperity, given the level of consumption, that people had forgotten how to save, and that this was a way of encouraging people to think of the future and put some money aside.  So, my advice was against the SSIAs, as was the Department.  I didn't have an SSIA myself because I believed that if I'd argued against it, I would have been, I won't say dishonest, but I just thought I shouldn't invest in something that I had argued against myself.</p></speech>

I wasn't involved in the decentralisation  It was kept a fairly closely guarded secret until it was announced, and there was a small team working on it.

We looked at various different incentives, incentives on the principal amount, incentives on the interest, but the main reason would have been possible cost and the fact that we weren't sure that this would incentivise savings.  I mean, it may have; I don't know if it did or not.  We tried to build in factors to stop the SSIAs being used to finance consumption.  So, they were the two main reasons - the cost and whether it would be effective in stimulating saving.</p></speech>

Sorry now, it's not 101, it is page 105 onwards about economic and fiscal implications of a reduction in housing output, where it says that for every 10,000 units, private units ... would reduce that there would be a fiscal deterioration of &euro;1.8 billion.  It's 105 onwards.</p></speech>

I think the &euro;1.8 billion was that ... a question was asked, if private housing output decreased by 10,000 and you built 10,000 local authority housing, what would be the cost?  And the &euro;1.8 billion refers to that, as far as I can see from the documentation.  The actual cost in terms of the 10,000 decline, for each 10,000 decline it was &euro;570 million.  The 1,800 was made up by the increased capital expenditure on the local authority houses.</p></speech>

I think there was a figure of 6,000 or 8,000 per annum, in which case there would be lower income taxes and VAT, and higher live register payments.</p><p>If it proceeded at that rate, it was possible, I mean, it could be possible to raise money in some other ways to try and offset that or to run a small deficit.

As early as 2001, a paper presented to the MAC meeting on 26 April shows the Department were facing a specific skills challenge and had a broad spectrum of skills requirements among others in economic modelling.  Can you give us your view if efforts were made by the Department, if they were sufficient after 2001, to improve the skills shortage?</p></speech>

I don't know about the other side but the financial side, there would have been also IT skills but I do admit there was a problem in terms of resourcing on the economic side.  I found this out early on when the economic forecaster, who I think was Robert Watt, who is now the Secretary General of PER, I think he was the short-term economic forecaster.  I was seeking somebody to replace him and I had some difficulty because there was a reluctance to go on to the economic side, because people thought that their career prospects were better if they had a more broader experience and they weren't identified as being too technical or working too long in one particular area.  I said to the person that "look you will only be there for a couple of years, you will be replaced" as a way of trying to get him to agree.  As a result of that, I spoke to the Secretary General, John Hurley, who became Governor of the Central Bank and he arranged for the Central Bank to second an economist, John McCarthy, who has since gone on to be the chief economist.  That was sort of a stop-gap measure to an extent.</p> <p>  When Derek Moran, the current Secretary General came in, he conducted an analysis of the leads of the section and proposed a plan to recruit economists directly, which was done, and to bring in some other people from other parts of the Department, from the NDP - the national development plan side - who were, that was running down their engagement there.  We also took on another economist in 2006 from the Central Bank.  So something, things were done.  I don't think there was any lack of quality, it was more an issue of quantity.  The Wright report did say that the analysis presented by the economic side was as good as any else and there were no complaints that I heard from any of the international bodies they dealt with to that extent.  While they might have had a small economic side, it did work with the ESRI and the Central Bank and the Commission so, to an extent they were able to use their resources as well in their activities and the Commission would have had regular meetings to discuss the economic methodology and the economic forecast.</p></speech>

So was the IMF and the OECD and the Commission.  So it wasn't just us that were taken by surprise.  We just got it wrong and I can't explain it in any more detail than that.  We relied on... perhaps we placed too much trust in a soft landing, not allowing for the fact that these things could go wrong.</p></speech>

I mean, since 1997, some of them had been got rid of, the seaside resort scheme, the Temple Bar scheme, the Custom House docks scheme and we would have recommended to the Minister certainly that these reliefs should go and I recall reading the 2003 budget where it said they would go in 2004 but when 2004 came, they were extended because as far as I remember, because of worries that there were schemes still incomplete.  So when the new Minister came in, we put a proposal to him to try and get rid of most of these property reliefs but he asked for a special study to be done so that it could be explained to the public why this was being done, and not sudden.  So that was the main one within my purview.</p></speech>

The urban renewal scheme was brought in in 1986 and I think as was the Custom House docks scheme.  So the Custom House docks scheme certainly did help develop the IFSC and there was also a BES, which was ...  I think property was allowed in the BES scheme.  That was got rid of because property was ... the BES was supposed to be risk-taking, not investing in bricks and mortar.  The schemes were reviewed in 1996 and I think the conclusion was that there was some benefit in the areas in which the schemes were concentrated and some which ... what they call a shadow effect in areas beside it, but it was difficult to conclude whether that had led to an overall increase in output in the economy or not.  The seaside resort scheme, we were never convinced of the wisdom of it, and I think the idea was, and it may have been well-founded in the sense that some of the traditional resorts had ... were a bit down at heel and the accommodation wasn't as good as it should be and the amusements and facilities.</p></speech>

They had been proposed in 1992, I think the Department ... the Minister didn't receive but in 1995, it was decided to go ahead with them.  While there may have been some sense behind them in terms of trying to restore the attractiveness of seaside resorts in Ireland, I think most of the investment went into accommodation, rather than into facilities and I suppose that is to be expected if there is tax relief for investing in property or for investing in amusements and things, the likelihood is that property will win out.</p></speech>

I mean, the problem ... one of the issues with the stamp duty was ... the stamp duty was raised from 6% to 9% in 1996 when residential property tax and, I think, local authority charges were removed.  This was a way of restoring the ... the revenue.  But the stamp duty rates applied not on a tranche basis, not, sort of ,1% of the first &euro;100,000; 2% of the next.

You paid 2% on &euro;101,000 as opposed to 1% on &euro;90,000.  So, that meant, when prices rose, there was ... there was significant elasticity and that was one of the reasons why the yield went up so much.  We did think was there a better way of restructuring the stamp duty because, you know, 9% was quite a high rate and we didn't go to the Minister on this because this was just talking amongst ourselves in the tax division.  But the problem was that any attempt to ... to restructure the stamp duty rates would probably have meant a lowering of the rates ... just the way the process works.  And lowering the stamp duty rates could have added fuel to the fire of the house prices, so, you know, we were ... we had a system that brought in a lot of money.  It probably wasn't the most judicious system but making changes in it could have raised other problems.</p></speech>

The Regling and Watson evidence book has that after 2004, the IMF, the OECD and ECOFIN all clearly recommended a tighter fiscal stance and the building up of a cushion for the time when the income from the property-related transactions would fall.

We did have a very low debt ratio, I think it fell towards 20%.

Well, I'll give it to you again: the Department advised the Minister that economic growth would recover after allowing for a 45% decline in housing completions to 45,000 a year and a further decline of 23% to 33,000 units in 2009.

Could I bring you back to your ... your first posting in banking in the Department of Finance, I see here, 1986 to 1992.  So, I'll put that question to you: when Donal McNally was in charge of banking supervision, the banks were solvent, the bank manager in the local town was an honoured member of the community - where did it all go wrong, the &euro;64 billion of what we're investigating now?  What ... have you been keeping an eye on this sector ever since you were its ... involved in its supervision back then?</p></speech>

I wasn't centrally involved in the PMPA and the ICI events in 1982 and '84, I think it was, or 1982 and 1985, so I knew the value of close supervision.  I wouldn't have gone for this light touch regulation because, as in most of these cases, the State ends up having to pay the bill and the State should be extra vigilant.  In terms of banking policy at the time, I was involved in the Central Bank Act, which was passed in 1989, which was to strengthen the powers of the bank to ... the Central Bank to supervise banks, to attach conditions to licences, to apply codes of conduct and other matters.  But my recollection was of trying to take initiatives with the banks to get them to lend to ... especially to ... I think there was a young entrepreneur scheme which the Minister at the time, Minister Reynolds, persuaded the banks to lend ... or to provide &euro;100 million for.  I'm not quite sure how he did it but he managed to do it.  And there wasn't the ... there wasn't the culture of ... I didn't detect a culture of profit maximisation; they might have wanted to grow the size of the banks.  And I don't think there was the same culture of bonuses so, you know, the culture ... there was a cultural change in terms of seeking after profits and rewarding those who sold the most and contributed most of the profits.</p></speech>

I was surprised at the level of economists they mentioned in the finance in Canada.  I mean, we're a smaller country with smaller resources, and, as I said, even though there might have been limited numbers on the economic side, the quality, as far as I could see, was good, and they had available the economic ... economists in the other institutions that were being dealt with.  So, I was a bit surprised to find that we were so underweight, and, you know, we had tried to improve that.  And I think the initiative of the Government in the Government Economic and Evaluation Service is a worthwhile initiative in trying to recruit people to that particular job, and then giving them the opportunity for career development.</p></speech>

And there was also some documents we saw that those people should have only a three-year contract, I mean ... I think ... you're an integrationist, I think, if I interpreted you correct that those economists should be, in the general scheme of things, in the Department.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I mean a lot of work was being done on evaluation, and the ... more could have been done on the use of economists in that respect, and that's what's being done now in the Government Economic and Evaluation Service.  The idea ... there was a feeling that at interviews what people were looking for was people with broader experience having worked in different areas and not being ... I mean, it's wrong to say technical, because being an ... and having studied economics, it is broader than simply crunching numbers.  But there were ... there was a view that people were hampered in some way by being too closely defined with a special area.  I mean, I did experience it myself in interviewing people who were excellent on the budgetary numbers and on all the number crunching, but when asked a question outside their area showed great difficulty.  So there was something in what was being said, but we needed to have economists; we needed to people to work in the area, and, you know, getting somebody from the Central Bank was a help, but it was only a ... it was a stopgap in some ways.</p></speech>

I mean, as I understand it, the Finns run a large surplus because of the history they had, as do some of the other Scandinavian countries.  As to how governance should work, I did suggest that there is ... possibly it needs to be explained or some sort of social compact or social consensus that you don't have to spend all the money just because you have the money and that there's a need to ... whatever you have, rainy day funds or some way of segregating some of the surplus to be used later.  The other way is to have some sort of rule which limits expenditure.  I know there's one in the EU which was changed a bit at our request.  So it's either learn the lesson, agree something at a social level or have a rule that limits the growth to spending when the resources are there - a sort of counter-cyclical spending rule.</p></speech>

There was a recognition that, you know, it couldn't keep going at the same rate, but if you subscribe to the view of a soft landing then it was possible to cope with that when the revenue reduced.</p></speech>

It both gets the one-off taxes and has invented new forms of recurrent taxes.</p></speech>

I thought ... didn't think development levies were raising that much money nowadays.  That was one of the most cyclical taxes because when development stopped the revenue went.  I mean, the stamp duty was a good revenue earner but it could not be relied upon.  It obviously depended on the amount of transactions.  The property tax is better because it'll be more stable but I didn't detect, during my time, a great enthusiasm for property tax.  We had done some work on it for the tax strategy group in 1996 but it wasn't really on the agenda.</p></speech>

Unemployment is forecast to average 6 per cent this year, mainly on foot of the construction and slowdown, and Ireland like others is facing [significant] difficult inflationary pressures.  In terms of public finances, the Bank concurs with our assessment.  The Bank reiterates the assessment that Irish Bank's [sic] are well capitalised with good quality assets and that the banking sector's shock absorption capacity remains strong.</blockquote>Do you recall that document and that advice at the time, do you?</p></speech>

Looking back at it now, given that a lot of these figures were based upon the construction sector, incomes coming from consumption taxes, a lot of them construction-related, so you'd have the VAT on a house being constructed, you'd have white goods that would come afterwards, carpets and all the rest of it, and 24% of the Irish economy and the construction sector employment levels inside there and all the net cost that would come with that.  How do you view that advice now in terms of what actually happened subsequently?</p></speech>

I just want to pick up on that point because we've been hearing evidence from different agencies, the Department of Finance as well, and your own evidence, and from the ESRI, the Central Bank.  Can you explain to me this ... because we've heard a lot of people say, well, in terms of the soft landing or in terms of that consensus view, that, "Well, the Department of Finance said it."  And then the Department of Finance say, "Well, the IMF were saying it," and the IMF don't do their own analysis so they're saying, "Well, the Central Bank were saying it."  The Central Bank will tell us, "The Department of Finance were saying it."</p><p>So, where did this originate from?

There was also the review carried out in 2005 or 2006 ... 2005.  And then there were various reviews by ... of individual schemes, like the film relief, BES and things like that, which were carried out, one of them, by Indecon.  So that ... I mean, you could review these internally, but generally, given that we would have a particular view on tax, I think it was felt that it was wiser to get some independent advice.</p></speech>

I think Deputy Doherty has covered most of the specific questions that we'd agreed to ask.  Just to follow on slightly from the soft landing, was there ever a forum internally where assistant secretaries, senior principal officers would sit down and say, "Okay, the consensus from the IMF and the ESRI and the OECD and various other people and the data and, indeed, our own individual units, is that we are going to have a soft landing."?  So, was there a forum that that was discussed at ... that you can recall where it was decided, "Yes, that is the likely outcome so, therefore, that's the position"?</p></speech>

I mean, there could've been other ways of dealing with it rather than - as, perhaps, we thought - trying to make some sort of example of us.  So, you know, we didn't feel it was a justified ... especially when other countries were struggling to make the 3% deficit and were using a lot of one-off measures to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact.</p></speech>

And ... to my ... I'm telling a story against myself but I estimated that the cut in CGT would cost something like &euro;19 million, but over the next four or five years, the revenue increased by tenfold, so there was obviously a behavioural change.  People used the lower rate to cash in.  So I mean,  wouldn't say we opposed the cut.  We pointed out the consequences there might be, which, in my case, it was wrong, plain and simple.</p></speech>

The final question I wanted to ask was in relation to lessons for the future.  You spoke about prudent being not spending all your tax receipts in a given year, so I just wondered what the current thinking is, in relation to when you have a surplus, is it to run a surplus, is it to direct a surplus into some sort of fund like a pension reserve fund, or is it to pay off the debt?  What would be the prudent thing, looking forward?</p></speech>

But I would think that the main recommendation of the Department would be to use the surplus to run down the debt as that's a burden on the people, which, you know, if interest rates rise will be ... will absorb more of the tax revenue.  That's what I would imagine; I haven't asked in the Department what the priority is, but that would be my sense of it.  That's what I would be recommending anyway, to use the resources to get down the debt or to find some way of minimising the debt.</p></speech>

Okay, I'll just deal with one question myself, Mr. McNally, and then we'll move towards the wrap-up and I'll invite both Senator Barrett and Senator D'Arcy back in again.  If I could just relate to, and I think Senator MacSharry touched upon this with you just a moment ago, on 24 January 2001, the European Commission concluded that Irish fiscal policy was inconsistent with the broad European policy guidelines.  They further asked Ireland to avoid further overheating of its economy, and there's a document, I think, coming up on the screen there now, but you make reference to this, I think, actually in your own opening address today, where you mention, I think, it's on page four of your opening statement:<blockquote><br /><br />The only notable exception to this is the recommendation issued to the State in 2001 by the Economic and Finance Council under Article 99(4) of the Treaty to take countervailing budgetary measures during 2001 to avoid overheating.  This recommendation was not felt warranted and was not accepted by the Irish authorities.</blockquote>And if I just, the document is there, if I just move one or two pages into it, it's page 13 of the document itself, on the bottom, it's ... next one ... next one again ... just page 13 of it.  And if you look at the last paragraph of it there, Mr. McNally, just come in there about three lines down, it says:<blockquote>Against this background, the Council finds that the planned contribution of fiscal policy to the macroeconomic policy mix in Ireland is inappropriate.  The Council recalls that it has repeatedly urged the Irish authorities, most recently in its 2000 broad guidelines of the economic policies, to ensure economic stability by means of fiscal policy.  The Council regrets that this advice was not reflected in the budget [of] 2001, despite developments in the course of 2000 indicating an increasing extent of overheating.  The Council considers that Irish fiscal policy [of] 2001 is not consistent with ... broad guidelines of the economic policies as regards budgetary policy.</blockquote>And it goes on and on.</p><p>Now, we've had reports from some institutions like the IMF and others that said in around 2005, 2006, they were getting things wrong.  But this one would seem to be very, very strident in its language and in its indication of action required and so forth.  So could you, as I say, I think the document is of 12 February 2001, this, so ... and the European Council recommend that countervailing measures be taken, as I just cited.  Could you tell us what action was taken by the Department of Finance on receipt of this very, very strong advice as outlined from the European Council?</p></speech>

I would have been advised just before that meeting of the Economic and Finance Committee, that they were planning to make this recommendation and I would have reported back to the Minister, who felt that it wasn't justified, and I would have argued at the Economic and Finance Committee that the recommendation was not warranted.  I agree that they did, in the 2000 broad guidelines, say that we should stand ready to use countervailing measures.  But we had a surplus of 4.3% in 2000 and were planning another surplus of 4%, so, you know, that is taking a lot of resources out of the economy.  What they were suggesting was another 0.5%.  In the end, the economy slowed in 2001, and the Commission did not renew the recommendation, it sort of, a draw was called, I suppose.</p></speech>

So is a one-quarter observation of an economic trend sufficient to say that things have changed?</p></speech>

And the economy did slow down; the initial forecasts were for no growth, that turned out to be growth in the end.  But, you know, it's ... there was a feeling that we were being picked on, somewhat unfairly, and that did influence the view that was taken.</p></speech>

My view would be that they should have been concentrating on those issues, rather than on ourselves.</p></speech>

The relief was given at 20%, which was the standard rate, and was given by means of a top-up, so everybody got it, irrespective of income.  But I didn't see a political motivation behind it; at least, I wasn't aware of one.</p></speech>

The aim was to get legislation passed to allow banks to issue bonds backed by commercial mortgages.  The financial sector won out.  The legislation was passed in early 2007, [right] at the peak of the property boom, making it easier for banks to borrow more money to provide more loans to more customers. </blockquote>And this was the Asset Covered Security (Amendment Act), No. 13, 2007.

They also ... they note with addicts that they start recalling the past in a different type of light to the type of damaging way it was.   Would you ... considering that you are maybe now retired but you're observing things as we move into the future, do you see any sort of dangers like this?  That we look back to the past?  Things like the SSIA scheme that we were discussing earlier and we might reshape them in our heads that might create difficulties for us going into the future.</p></speech>

I was Minister for Finance from the 26 June 1997 to the 29 September 2004.  As directed by the committee, I submitted a statement on specific lines of inquiry relating to my role as Minister for Finance.  As my period as Minister for Finance ended in September 2004, some considerable time before the banking collapse, my statement deals only with those areas of interest of which I might have some direct knowledge or which would have arisen during my tenure as Minister.  This opening statement refers briefly to areas of my written statement.</p> <p>  The new regulatory structure was set up during my time and culminated in two separate Bills in 2002 and 2003.  In 1998 the Government agreed in principle to the setting up of a single regulatory authority for financial services.  Interestingly, the idea of an SRA was first mooted in 1989 but it was decided not to go ahead with same at that time.  We asked Michael McDowell to chair the implementation advisory group.  It consisted of nine persons and produced two reports, a majority report and the minority alternative model.  It took some time to reach political agreement as to the new structure, which eventually led to the two Bills as referred to above.  There was considerable disagreement and not just between the politicians.  If you read the commentary on stances of that time, there was not universal agreement as to how and where the new authority should be located.  I've noted with a certain degree of irony that a number of the politicians and commentators who wished to keep the Central Bank out of the key role at that time were to the forefront in advocating the return of all powers to the Central Bank post the recent financial crisis, and that has now been done.</p> <p>  Practically all of the debate of those years centred on the consumer protection angle, and little on prudential supervision.  I outlined in my statement the various reasons for such debate orientation.  I further outlined in my statement that the rules for the capital requirements for banks were designed internationally following the Basel committee recommendations.  There has been a recurring notion in much of the Irish media commentary of recent years that principle-based regulation, also referred to as light touch regulation, was an Irish invention.  In particular, some commentators have gone so far as to advise that light touch regulation was even a Charlie McCreevy invention.  Much as I might be flattered to think that I might own the copyright, it is not the case, and light touch, principle-based regulation was a long time in vogue internationally, and years before I arrived as Minister for Finance.  At least some of the earlier evidence to this committee has at least scotched that notion.</p> <p>  I have outlined in my statement as to how capital requirements for Irish banks were managed under the same formulae and policies which applied to all the other European banks.</p><p>As the new structures were in the embryonic stage of development before I ceased as Minister in 2004, I can only comment in a cursory way on the co-operation and integration of the new bodies.  However, during the setting up of IFSRA, I was strongly of the view that there was an excellent level of co-operation between the chair of IFSRA and the Governor of the Central Bank.  The new structure allowed the Central Bank to concentrate on the macro level and to produce financial stability reports which contain guidance for the financial regulation to follow.  IFSRA had responsibility for the individual institutions under their remit.<br/><br/>I now turn to direction from the committee on advice.  Strictly, the reprimand from Brussels on our 2001 budget would fall under the heading of &quot;advice&quot;.  The European Union was of the opinion that our budget and stability programme update were inconsistent with the broad economic policy guidelines and issued this reprimand early in 2001.  However, in November 2001, the Council of Ministers lifted its earlier reprimand and stated: &quot;Unexpected economic developments were such that the inconsistency underlying the recommendation has lost its force.&quot;  This says much about the whole art, if it is one, of economic forecasting.  In fact, during the course of 2001, the international economic slowdown had gathered force arising from a number of factors, and economic activity in Ireland had declined sharply.  In fact, the year on year increase in real GDP in Ireland decelerated from 13.1% to 0.1% in the last quarter, thus the 2001 Irish budget was then seen in a different light in Brussels.  I shall also mention that, in 2001, there was much criticism of the EU reprimand, and not just from the Irish Government.  Many commentators, nationally and internationally, were critical of the EU stance.  As many referred to at the time, there appeared to be one set of rules for the larger countries, and a different book for the smaller member states.<br/><br/>On the issue of advice given to governments from many quarters, the Department of Finance, Central Bank, ESRI, OECD, European Union, IMF, and others, the line taken by all democratic governments is that it is just what it says on the tin, advice.  Democratically elected governments must, at all times, with their freedom, do what they consider best, in the interests of their people.  Yes, this means the ignoring of some advice and the taking of others.  I note with some wry amusement that the current Government, as is their right, seems to be steadfastly ignoring advice from a plethora of sources.  The fiscal advisory council, establish in law by the present Administration, are saying that the projections for growth, consumer spending and population are too optimistic.  Also being sidelined are commentaries from the ESRI, the European Commission, and the IMF, not to mention some domestic economists and commentators.<br/><br/>My high regard for the Department of Finance and the staff is well known and has been documented many times previously.  However, it is not a criticism when I note the very obvious.  Very few worthwhile initiatives of different political Administrations would never have seen the light of day if advice from the Department of Finance had been followed.  One of the most groundbreaking changes in Ireland was the introduction of free secondary education in the sixties by the late Donogh O'Malley.  This was done without the approval of Finance, and those of an historical bent know that the Department was so exercised, that it got its Minister, the late Jack Lynch, to formally complain to the Taoiseach.  Finance were totally unaware of the proposal, and O'Malley was, indeed, in contravention of Cabinet rules for making such a major announcement without informing his other colleagues, and, in particular, the Minister for Finance.  Wasn't it a good job for Ireland that Se&aacute;n Lemass ignored the yanks of the Department of Finance?<br/><br/>I look back on the advices from a number of the already mentioned sources.  For example, in 2002 the main theme seemed to be the threat of inflation, and there was little talk of housing prices, or that general area, in any of the commentary.  In fact, a leading economist was so concerned in 2002 on the slowdown, that he suggested the diverting of funds, of the annual contribution of the pension reserve fund, and putting that money into capital projects.  Some commentary always referred to the fact that we had &euro;1.5 million people between the age of 50 and 34, and that the demand for housing would continue to be very strong.  To illustrate, again, the futility of forecasting, I would draw attention to the 2000 report from the long-term issues group of the Department of Finance.  It predicted a total population of 4.1 million in 2056.  It's about 4.6 million today.  And that the Exchequer debt would be wiped out entirely by 2012.  During my time as Minister for Finance, I was painted as a right wing ideologue, possessed of a Scrooge-like parsimony when it came to public spending.  On the other hand, post the financial crisis, I've been turned into a kind of Santa Claus and the philosophy most often attributed to me by my detractors is supposedly encapsulated in the quote, &quot;When you have it, you spend it&quot;.  It is ironic that this comment was made on the publication, in November 2001, of the following year's departmental Estimates.  The headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i>on the following day was entitled, &quot;McCreevy takes the axe to public spending&quot;.  The first line of that article reads, &quot;Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy last night brought to a shuddering halt the big-spending era that went with the economic boom&quot;, end of the headline.  Later on, in that article, it refers to me saying, &quot;When you have it you spend it.  The mistake is to try to spend it when you haven't got it&quot;.  Now, however, I think it can be fairly said that the above actual comments of mine, when I was answering a question as to why I was reducing public spending, have been distorted and non-contextualised to an extraordinary degree.  The comment at that time attracted little attention but seems to have got a special lease of life during the economic downturn.  The reason for such misrepresentation ... well, to quote from another scribe, &quot;It might just be an interesting example of the way popular quotes get distorted over time to better fit the public perception of the person who made them&quot;.<br/><br/>I vigorously disagree with the assertion that the Government, during my term as Minister for Finance, misspent the proceeds of the stellar economic growth of that period.  We did increase spending in a large number of areas to make up for lost time, and for the under-provision of services in the previous decade and a half.  As a percentage of GNP, in 1986, Government expenditures stood at 58%, and Government debt at 122%.  At the end of 2003, the respective figures would have been 38% and 35%.  In respect of spending during my time in office, I've set out, in tabular form, the percentages for total Government expenditure and gross current expenditure.  These figures are taken from the public document Budget Statistics 2014, published by the Department of Finance.  The figures I quote are in respect of GNP and, of course, the percentage figures in terms of GDP would be lower.  In terms of GNP, gross Government ... gross current expenditure ... I'll leave ... the figures for Government expenditure are in a different column; I'll just refer to the gross current expenditure figures.  As a percentage of GNP, in 1997 it was 35.2%, and that relates to a previous Government of Fine Gael and Labour.  In 1998, for me, it was 31.7%; in 1999, it was 30.4%; in 2000, it was 28.1%; in 2001, it was 29.5%; in 2002, it was 30% even; in 2003, it was 29.8%; and in 2004, it was 29.8%.  No matter how these figures are interpreted, it is quite clear that there was no splurge over the period.  This was a period of considerable economic success.  The numbers for people at work increased massively; there was practical full employment; the scourge of forced emigration ceased after 150 years; we experienced the welcome new phenomenon of migration to Ireland; the population increased dramatically; we increased spending considerably in the areas of health, education and social welfare; the pension for the aged was increased to a proper level; child benefit more than doubled; and many other improvements in public services.  And, during all of those years, we ran substantial Exchequer surpluses, except for a small minus in one year.  This was achieved after paying for a massive public capital programme, the most visible example being the now excellent road network, and yet there was still a surplus.  We also set up the National Pensions Reserve Fund, setting aside most of the proceeds from the Telecom privatisation, and setting aside 1% of GNP annually.  This fund was intended not to be touched until after 2025, and was there to provide for future pension liabilities.  Since the recent financial downturn, critics are suggesting that we should not have spent all of this money.</p><p>So if we had spent less, it would have meant larger budget surpluses and some have gone on to say we should have built up further rainy day funds, apart from the pension reserve.  Now, are these people for real?  In a political democracy, it is especially difficult to run any kind of a budget surplus and many were even against the idea of the pension reserve fund.  It is difficult to run a surplus in a democracy.  If there was one patient untreated by the health services, one family without a house, one special needs person without proper services, one pay demand unmet, what justification would any Government have had for increasing the reserve fund and initiating further buffers?  Not alone would it be politically unacceptable but I suggest it would be morally wrong also.  The next theme of the committee refers to the property sector and, by implication, the question of tax incentives in that area.  Activity in the construction sector has always been a key driver of economic activity.  Despite the gains made in residential construction over the years, Ireland's housing stock is still below the EU average in units per 1,000 of population.  This is particularly obvious in 2015, which results in rents climbing substantially.  Furthermore, it has always been part of the Irish social culture for persons to actually own their own home.  This led the Government to initiate various reports of the housing market, which resulted in some changes.  Tax incentives for the property investment have been a feature of the Irish tax code for over 50 years.  As far as I can research there are incentives as far back as the 1959 Finance Act.  Some have sought to give the impression that the property tax incentives only really started after the '97 Government came into office.  However, if you look at the list of incentives by non-Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, you will find many others, such as urban renewal, seaside resorts, designated islands and many more.<br/><br/>My attitude to property tax incentives is summed up in my budget speech on the 2003 budget, when I was going about ending the deadline for some of the schemes.  I proposed ending many on 31 December 2004.  As I said in that speech &quot;the existing demand for property investment and the desire to improve equity in the tax system, there is no justification for a continuation of these reliefs beyond 2004&quot;.  Regarding the philosophy of property tax incentives, I stated &quot;I am a supporter of properly-focused, clearly defined, specific reliefs which can encourage the development of goods and services, including public services, which might otherwise not be provided, or where provided, are too little or too late.&quot;  So to conclude, quite recently an Irish commentator wrote the following:<blockquote>The reality is that economics is a social and not a physical science.  Economic outcomes are generally driven and shaped by human behaviour, and unfortunately human behaviour is rarely possible to predict with any degree of certainty.</blockquote>During my time as a student in University College Dublin, what is now the department of economics was then known as the faculty of political economy.  The longer I was in politics, the more I understood the accuracy of that old definition in UCD.  Thank you very much.</p></speech>

I just want to deal with one item first with you if you don't mind and maybe that is just to ask your comments from contributors to the Wright report indicating that there was a lack of leadership and direction in the Department of Finance during the period of 2000 to 2010, and its effectiveness was limited.  Would you agree with the comments made and what should have been done or is still to be done to improve the Department's role and effectiveness going forward?</p></speech>

I can only speak for my time at the Department of Finance.  I found the officials there very helpful, working extremely long hours, prepared to  - at the drop of a pin - to go and do things which were way above and beyond the call of duty.  I found them helpful in every respect.  They argued their viewpoint very forcibly, they ... and then when, if you wanted to go in another direction, they went off and did what you told them to do.  That's the job of what good public servants do and I can only say that I think they vigorously fought their corner.  I found nothing during my time to say that there was anything but the highest level of intellectual capacity applied to all the problems and the best officials I think in the public service were there.</p></speech>

The question, as I put it to you, was that Mr. Wright makes a critique of leadership and direction in the Department during that period, in terms of trying to make those arguments and that it was very very limited.  Would you agree with Mr. Wright's analysis or would you have a different opinion?</p></speech>

But, like, unless we want to go to another kind of structure on ... whatever kind of democracy you want to call it, it's the Government of the day that makes the decisions and it's the Minister of the day that runs his Department.  There is no ... in the words of a former Secretary General at Finance, still alive I know, there is no such thing as a departmental view of government.  There are only Ministers' views.  I am some time intrigued in recent times to read when politicians, and we all have done this, try to get out of trouble as to why something can't be done.  They come along and say the Department of Finance won't let us.  That's only a cop out.  If you convince the Minister for Finance - that's the person to go to and he can overrule his officials if it's a good enough case.  I am sure if you go back over my 27 years in the D&aacute;il when I was a backbencher, I perhaps used that as well.  I don't recall so doing but it's an absolute ... so if the Department of Finance come along, argues it case, it puts some of those things in writing and they fight their case.  Then the Minister goes and makes the decision and the Government makes the decision based on what the Minister and the Government want to do.  So therefore, there is no difficulty, I found no difficulty with the Department of Finance giving their views.  I don't really understand what Mr. Wright wants the officials in the Department of Finance to do.  Maybe to stand outside Merrion Street with a loud hailer or something like that.  But you couldn't run any democracy on that basis.  I am sure when Deputy Pearse Doherty becomes Minister for Finance and Deputy Joe Higgins is Minister for Public Expenditure, that they will get loads of advice from the Department of Finance and they'll blindly ignore it.</p></speech>

Can I begin first of all by asking you through 1999 to 2003, the Governor and the Central Bank warned you of excessive growth in the credit markets, warned you about the housing markets, commercial property markets, overheating an economy and finally the possibility of a hard landing and this could lead to unhappy economic and social consequences.  So Mr. McCreevy, with hindsight, in giving the advice you were receiving, should you have been more cautious in taxation and spending policies in your budgets?</p></speech>

And during my ... there was, of course, an increase in house prices over that period but there has been an increase in house prices long before that period as well.  In fact, I took a little liberty of going back and looking at Central Bank kind of commendations for the last 30 years or so and you'll nearly find the same thing in every report of a central bank in Ireland and elsewhere as well.  Central bankers are by nature, and rightly so, obliged to worry about things like inflation.  They'll always advise the Government to run surpluses if they can run surpluses and even when we had large indebtedness, they were saying back years ago "well you shouldn't give any tax concessions at all and you should more or less cut down the public services entirely."</p><p>And Governments took some of that advice on board and trained their budgets, as I did in my time, in what I considered the best possible way and the proof of the pudding has been in the eating.  We achieved economic growth of considerable measure.  We did the things which I've outlined there earlier and no disaster came to pass.  So I don't accept that, in my time as Minister for Finance, until 26 September 2004, that any of these disasters occurred as predicted by all these people.  It just didn't happen.</p></speech>

So, what we ... so I would see a relevance to different decisions made at different times and the systemic consequences of them.  That's not to say that you're to blame or to fault, but whether there is a relationship or not a relationship.

And I would like to remind the witness that if you refuse to answer a question which falls within your direction, you may be subject to criminal sanctions under section 75 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2009.  Further, if you refuse to answer any question without being entitled in law to so refuse, the committee may make a finding of you that you failed to comply or fully co-operate with the inquiry in its final report under section 14 of the Act.  Also, in your direction to come before the committee here today, you were also put on notice that the committee may make a recall of you on Wednesday or Thursday of next week, at which time we can amend the directions to actually broaden out the line of questioning, if we so desire, once it falls within the terms of reference of the broader inquiry.

The Bacon report proposed a series of measures to curb price increases, including a 9% stamp duty rate for investors, a 2% anti-speculation property tax - measures that you initially supported, Mr. McCreevy, but then rejected.

There were three separate Bacon reports.  They were commissioned by the Minister for housing.  The first one was requested in November '97, and reported in April '98.  The evidence in all of that time was on the first-time buyer.  If you read the commentary in the newspapers and the Dail debates, everybody was concerned that the first-time buyer was being forced out of the market, and he or she couldn't get their foot on the first rung of a ladder, so the Minister for housing requested the Bacon report.  The Bacon report made, kind of, certain recommendations and that resulted in the Finance (No. 2) Bill of 1998.  The main reasons for ... there were a lot of other things in the Bacon report related to housing supply, etc.-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.981" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charlie McCreevy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#QQ00400"><p>But the Finance (No. 2) Bill 1998, the main things it did was it disallowed the interest on persons purchasing second homes; it changed the stamp duty regime substantially; we had a reduction of CGT and development of land from 40% to 20%, if it was to be developed within five years, and the penalty was to increase CGT to 60% if hoarded.  There was an interesting, very interesting D&aacute;il debates at the time.  The two main Opposition parties opposed it.  One of the Opposition parties was considerably against the interest ... the disallowance of interest deductibility.  And I remember him saying, and you can check the D&aacute;il debates, that all this would have unintended consequences.  So that was the effect of the first Bacon report.</p> <p>  Then we have the second Bacon report, and when the second Bacon report came out, prices had slowed down since 1998, but rents ... prices had gone down on houses, but rents had gone up 24% in Dublin and 17% in the rest of the country.  Apartment prices had gone up 24% and there were about 42,000 units completed that year.  Now, actually that report of second Bacon 2 praised the new student accommodation tax relief that I had in budget 1999.  And it also praised the new urban tax scheme for 43 towns cities that was in that time as well.  And then we had the Bacon No. 3 report that reported in June 2000.  And that report concluded firmly that rates of increase in prices on new and existing homes in Dublin were down sharply since 1998, and that's what the report said.  It also said that immigration of 200,000 to the country was expected over the next seven years, and this led to the Finance (No. 2) Bill of 2000, and that third Bacon report and the subsequent Finance (No. 2) Bill 2000, led to the introduction of the 2% anti-speculative tax, and tax of 2% of non-principal private residences.  Now, the interest deductibility and other changes were made subsequently, as Deputy Doherty has pointed out, and the reason for so doing was that we got a fair shock as to what was happening in the economy in 2001 into 2002.  As I referred to early in my address, growth had fallen off considerably.  There ... if you read the figures from the CIF and from the housing bodies, there was considerably less economic activity in the housing sector, or in the construction sector generally, and unemployment in that area was starting to rise, and that's why we reversed our approach on deductibility and the 2% anti - speculative tax did not take place.  It was ... we made redundant as well.</p></speech>

But it&rsquo;s hard to like ... since I haven&rsquo;t read the report, I can&rsquo;t comment on the specifics of it, but it&rsquo;s hard to make such a sweeping statement that all the property tax reliefs in all of that period contributed to house price inflation, in particular.

I can argue the toss about rural renewal; it&rsquo;s a fairly ...

Well, there you go.  One of the statutory objectives of the Financial Regulator was the promotion of the financial services industry in Ireland.  To what extent did Government encourage the Central Bank to pursue this role internationally?  And in your view, did the ... this objective compromise the prudential role of the Financial Regulator?</p></speech>

I couldn't see for a moment how it would've compromised the role of the regulator in terms of the prudential supervision of Irish banks.  And I'll tell you why I would believe that.  There are many reasons why financial services have come to locate in Dublin or, now, in any part of the country.  The main ... but the main reason for so doing, for the respectable funds, is to be ... is to be in an area, in a country, which they had ... is regarded as well regulated.  That's what these firms and banks and institutions want to locate in Dublin for.  You can make other cases about tax, etc., etc., but one of the primary reasons is to be located and regulated from a jurisdiction that's recognised as having good prudential rules and regulations.  So it would be a negative, in the medium to longer term, for the regulator to not go about doing his job in a sufficiently robust way because the ... it would then get out that Ireland was not the place of proper regulation and, therefore, we would lose our cachet in attracting firms there.  So, I do not believe that was the case.</p></speech>

There were strict definitions of what a tax haven was by the OECD and others and we certainly were not then, or since, a tax haven.  And so, therefore, we never ever ...

Can I ask you, you were responsible as Minister of Finance for appointing the majority of the board members to the central board and Financial Services Authority of Ireland board and the board of IFSRA.  Can I ask you, how did you come about ... how did you decide on who to appoint to the board?  And it seems, you know, your appointments to the board of the Financial Regulator included, besides others, a senior counsel, a former member of the Independent Radio and TV Commission, a journalist, a former CEO of the beef trading company and chairperson of the IDA - who was also former director general of the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC, the former chairman of a large estate agency.  And Brian Patterson, the former chairperson of the Financial Regulator, told this inquiry that he made you aware of his lack of experience in financial regulation at the time of his appointment.  So, can I ask you, how did you come to deciding who to appoint and what were your reasons to appoint persons with very limited regulatory or banking experience to the board of the Financial Regulator?</p></speech>

I don't recall the particular discussion but I know ... if Mr. Patterson said that, that's what he said.  I take it that's what did occur.  And, as I said in my opening statement and in my witness statement as well, all the ... in setting up the new structure, you can look at all of the D&aacute;il debates and all of the Shannon debates and all of the commentary and you'll see all this concentration on consumer issues to the exclusion of nearly everything else.  And bar myself and, once or twice the Front Bench spokesperson of Fine Gael, referring to the prudential area of things, that was about the only discussion you'll read at all about prudential in all of the debates on two Bills ... not alone the two Bills but all the four years that went by before we actually set up the bodies at all and all of the controversy there was about the difference between us and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, about where the location of new bodies should be.</p> <p>  When it came to the appointment, I actually ... I can't remember how Mr. Patterson came to be appointed.  I certainly never knew him.  I never knew him in any walk of life.  So I assume he must've came up through a process that maybe the Department of Finance or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment pursued at that time.  We did try to ensure when we set up the body CBFSAI, the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Services Regulatory Authority, we had them ... IFSRA here ... and we had the broader body then.  We did have, I think, about six members of the IFSRA on all - including the chief executive chairman - on the board of the larger body as well.  And that was done in order to accommodate and to meld the two organisations together because there'd be a lot of controversy about setting up this in the first place.  But regarding the individual appointments, some of these people that ... if I can recall, were appointed to the board of the Central Bank by non-Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments.  Exactly one person-----</p></speech>

I have no recollection of the meeting or the conversation.  He said he attended an event at which I was presumably the guest speaker, I'm presuming it took place in Dublin.  And I don't know whether ... after the event, whether sitting around and having a cup of tea, whether I asked him ... I told him or he asked me for an opinion.  But, so I've no recollection of what I said then.  But I would have a clear view as to what I would've been thinking around that particular time.</p><p>I was in Brussels as EU Commissioner for Internal Market and Services and financial services had come to dominate the latter half of my term there as Commissioner and most of my cabinet would have been Irish members and we would have been reading the Irish newspapers, listening to Irish media outlets and all the debate was going on about Ireland and you certainly, we were very concerned just as Irish people, as to what was happening back home - as anyone would be - and it's probably, members of the committee know, your nationalistic fervour grows exponentially particularly when you're abroad in another country because you don't want other people saying bad things about your country.  So there was all this emphasis on Ireland, so, as Kevin said at the .. the thing, and I'd say it's very accurate what he said, I said more or less to him "I think it's time", I probably said "Someone should make a broad statement about the situation."

But can I just put it; at that particular time I don't think there was ... it was just talking about broad support of the banks and I think that they subsequently to the guarantee, this legal thing about what was guaranteed became an issue.  But I'll nearly wager most people here that around that time, and that would be September, there was no much talk ... there was no ... when you're talking about supporting the Irish banks, it wasn't talked about ... these wonderful terms like subordinated bondholders etc. etc.  I doubt that there was any much comment at all about that because most people, most people were warning something will have to be done.

I know Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick since 1973.  He's a bit older than me but we qualified at the same time.  We worked in Craig Gardner accountants - now PricewaterhouseCoopers - we were there as seniors for a year and a half or so, together with the leader of the Labour Party, Joan Burton, who was a classmate of mine in UCD.  So I know Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick for that length of time but my only thing is with Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick as a banker was that at one stage he was chairman, I think, of the Irish Bankers Federation and so I think they had a lunch or a meeting one time where they met us around the big table.  This is back in my time in finance.  I ran into him many ... a few times socially.  I never played golf with him even though he's quite a ... he's a very good golfer, people might like to know that, but I actually never played with him, as far as I know.  And I know him that length of time, but like I've no communication with Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick.  And by the way, for the record, I haven't drank for over 20 years.</p></speech>

I want to go right back if I may just prior to you becoming Minister for Finance.  In opposition you expressed a number of reservations about our entry into the euro and just two months before you were made Minister for Finance you said in an interview with Jane Suiter, "It will be interesting to see if you can have monetary union without an integrated process".  So upon your appointment as Minister what did you do to protect Ireland from our entry into the euro, in terms of the shortcomings that you had seen?</p></speech>

I was the finance spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il to look at the whole area of our possible entry into the euro.  And the late Deputy Mitchell brought all types of views before the committee; people who were very for joining it, people who were against.  So we had a very robust discussion and no-one ... we learnt a lot while it was there and it worked.  We got very little headlines but actually it was very agreeing, so therefore all of the issues were thought about then.  When I, as Deputy Murphy has alluded to, I would have had concerns about us joining the euro, as most ... as a lot of people did.  Interesting enough, to show how ridiculous the economic succession is, our biggest, one of our biggest concerns at the time was that when we join the euro and our nearest neighbour wasn't joining.  That was the big issue at the time, that we were going to join the euro and knowing that the United Kingdom wasn't going to join.  Now it shows the development of the Irish economy since we joined the EU in 1973 that we were able to take that decision and consider it, knowing that our nearest neighbour, our biggest market, were not going to join.  And one of the biggest issues that we had at the committee was the fear that we would join the euro, that the rate for the Irish ... the euro versus sterling would go totally in the wrong direction for us.  And if you read some of the expert views we got done by many eminent economists who predicted that the Irish rate might go to &euro;1.10 - &euro;1.09, &euro;1.10.  Deputy Murphy will be aware that the total opposite occurred and we went in the other direction to as low as &euro;0.66, &euro;0.67.  So it goes to show what all the experts ... but when we ... when we ... when I became Minister for Finance then in 1997, I actually was the Minister responsible then for making the formal decision and it took place ... or the euro notes and coins didn't start till '02 but we joined from 1999.  And the major decision I had to make was at what rate we were going to join <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Deutsche mark and if I remember correctly, Ireland, when we devalued in '92-'93, we went to a rate, off the top of my head, the Deutsche mark from DM2.67 to DM2.41.  It was then that the Irish pound kept appreciating against the Deutsche mark in '96, '97 and '98 up along, and the rate was when we were going to join and I said ... we kept our counsel very ... our cards very close to our chest and I finally made the call and we joined I think at the rate was DM2.48667.

Plus the difficulties of that we were joining  a currency union without ... without central budgetary and fiscal policy, because take the United States for example.  Well if there was a big crisis in Minnesota, the Federal Government can make a decision to put resources in Minnesota.  You don't have that with the euro, we don't have a central government to decide.  So we knew all those downsides but we decided that it was in our best interests that we would join, knowing the downsides.</p> <p>  Now, one of the downsides was that we gave up control over our interest rate policies and that, that, if I was to make any ... if I was to ask one thing that the ... would have lessened the economic impact of the housing crash that Deputy Doherty referred to I would say ... I would say the loss of interest rate control was the biggest, because without any shadow of a doubt if we'd been there, if we had our own interest rate setting policy outside of the euro we'd have had higher interest rates.</p></speech>

So that was being written about in <i>The Irish Times</i>in 1998, on the Monday just after you fixed the exchange rate mechanism, so what did you do to prepare the economy for that?</p></speech>

That's what happened subsequently.</p><p>But in the immediate aftermath that didn't happen - I think the figures will justify that.</p></speech>

I haven't looked at it for years ... God, that's 18, 19 years ago and I certainly, I wouldn't know where to find it, but I would be fairly, I think it would have been referred to, that particular report.  But you must remember, we all decided, I mean all the political parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Labour, I'm not too sure about any smaller, were there any other smaller parties then, we all decided it was in the best interests of our country to join.  And by the way, I was often criticised when my nomination was put to go to Europe as Commissioner, I didn't always sing from the same hymn sheet as everybody about the greatness of having the euro project.  I always knew that there were downsides to it.  I would have signalled it as well, but it was in the, our overall best interests.  We all thought we'd join the euro, and I still believe that to this day.</p></speech>

You must remember, it was ... I know, I've said about high interest rates could have lessened the impact of the subsequent property crash but remember also that high, that low interest rates gave an opportunity for Irish businesses in the non-construction sector to actually try to make a bob, because we had been paying for years colossal interest rates and it was hard.  How some businesses survived over the previous 40, 50 years is a great tribute to them, so there were benefits to having the low interest rates and the Irish economy had become very, very, very competitive over a period of time.  And another thing may I say, if you look back at commentators when I was in government as Minister for Tourism and Trade when we had to devalue the Irish currency, we were forced to devalue the Irish currency, it wasn't working, and 19 out of 20 economists predicted that it would be a disaster and it would lead to rampant inflation.  In fact, it was the makings of the economy-----</p></speech>

Now you mention in your reply there about the success of your budgetary policy as part of you preparing for the dangers of, the risks associated with euro entry.  But, in 2001, at the beginning of 2001, we see the censure from the Commission, and it states:<blockquote><br /><br />Given that the monetary policy is now set for the Euro area as a whole and no longer available as an instrument at national level, other policies, including budgetary policies, must be used more actively. ... The Council recalls that it has repeatedly urged the Irish authorities, most recently in its 2000 broad guidelines of the economic policies, to ensure economic stability by means of fiscal policy.  The Council regrets that this advice was not reflected in the budget for 2001-----</blockquote></p></speech>

This is maybe a decade before the hard landing took place and I noted that in subsequent Central Bank reports and in subsequent ESRI reports, as late as 2006 and 2007 and 2008, they were predicting a hard landing was not going to occur at all.  So they were considerably wrong, in 2001 and 2002, because a hard landing certainly didn't occur in my time in office; in fact they changed their minds later in the decade and then it turned out there was a hard landing.</p></speech>

But as I said, in my opening Budget Statement, I then, we then decided and I recommended to the Government we do certain things, sometimes we did something that they were in agreement with, sometimes we didn't, but that's, as I said, what we do always with advice.</p></speech>

We know that the report argued for a different model, excuse me, of a fully independent and autonomous financial regulator but the Central Bank and the Department of Finance were both against that recommendation.  So what were your views on the model that was eventually agreed?  Was it your model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1091" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charlie McCreevy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#TT02700"><p>No, it was a compromise that we came up with in the end, which more or less could be termed "the McCarthy compromise".  That's named after the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Dermot McCarthy.  Can I just go back a little bit about this?  We decided in 1998 that we should have a single regulatory authority.  We set up the McDowell report to decide how this would be implemented.  Why did we want a single regulatory authority?  Well, I think if you read the early chapters of the McDowell report, it summarises very well the reasons for having a single regulatory authority, having it all in the one place, bringing all the supervision from different quarters.  Up until that, you had the Central Bank involved, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, you had the Department of Environment ... Local Government, now the Department of the Environment, you had different regulations to do with credit unions, you had all this all over the place.  So we thought the single regulatory authority was a good idea.  Mr. McDowell was asked to chair an implementation group that had nine people on it, from the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, the Department of the Taoiseach and others as well.  They came up with two reports, or two and a half reports; the majority came up with the single regulatory authority outside as an autonomous unit, outside of the Central Bank.  The minority alternative model, supported by the Finance person - Tom Considine I think it was at the time - and the representative of the Central Bank, I think it was Mr. Barron, came up with the alternative model to keep it located within the Central Bank.  And Dermot McCarthy, then subsequently had a slightly ... a variation of all that.  There were differences of opinion as to its location, there was not a difference of opinion about having a single regulatory authority.  The differences of opinion regarded where it should be located and constituted and that's what caused all the difficulty between us all.  And the D&aacute;il debates are very, very interesting.</p><p>Not alone was there a difference between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, namely, the T&aacute;naiste, Mary Harney, and myself, but there was also a difference between the political parties.  Deputy Derek McDowell, who represented the Labour Party, was for the independent model advocated by McDowell.  Michael Noonan, who was then the spokesperson for Fine Gael, was for the model that we were for in finance, keep it within the Central Bank.  In fact, if you look at one of the D&aacute;il parliamentary question debates, you see where Michael Noonan has a funny aside with Derek McDowell and he says, &quot;So, you're a PD at heart&quot;, or something like that.  You can look up the D&aacute;il debate to see that.<br/><br/>So therefore, it wasn't anybody was coming at this from <i>mala fides </i>but there was a difference of opinion and as I said in my witness statement, over Europe and further afield, there was not a universal way of doing this.  Other countries had different ways of doing this.  So finally, we came around and we came up with this compromise solution which I would term more &quot;the Dermot McCarthy kind of solution&quot; which had this overarching body, the Central Bank of Ireland self-regulatory authority and within that, we had the regulatory authority known as IFSRA, and we combined the two bodies together.<br/><br/>Now, subsequent to the economic collapse, as I said also in my opening statement, people have gone back to having it all within the Central Bank.  And by the way, the United Kingdom, in 1997, were also in the process of diversifying out as well and reverting and they also have gone back, more or less, to a single model as well.  So, it's not that anybody came this from <i>mala fides</i>including the politicians, it's just that there was an agreement on all this and how to reach it.  So, that's how we came about it.</p></speech>

That's the process that went through.  In all of those years that you show there, you'll see that the memorandum in June was ... and compared that with the tax and welfare package in the budget, that the memorandum in June is a higher figure except one year and that was the budget for 2003.</p></speech>

And certainly all Governments of which I have been a member and all Governments when I wasn't a member, have always borne that very much in mind.</p><p>So the answer to your question is, yes, of course, the upcoming election has always influenced measures which the Government do at election time.  We are politicians, don't forget, and we actually like to be re-elected.</p></speech>

I have given the figures for our spending as a percentage of GNP in my address earlier to the committee.  And you can see even in terms of gross current spending, which is the most legitimate one to look at, that the percentage is in or around 30%.  We did all of that, reduced the national debt and still had budget surpluses.  So, I would contend - you could have a different opinion - I would contend that we were most responsible than any other Government in the history of the State.  No other Government in the history of the State ever had budgetary surpluses and we had budgetary surpluses after large increases in spending, after large capital expenditure and that was the success of our economic policy.  So, therefore, I think there was ... we .... the things that we did in terms of expenditure were all justifiable.  I'm not saying that every euro or pound that was spent in every corner of the country was maxed to the maximum effect.  But, in general, what we did, I believe, was correct.</p></speech>

Like, I would ... some what are regarded as pro-cyclical taxes, I'm not too sure they are pro-cyclical taxes.  For example, capital acquisitions tax, I'm not too sure whether you call that pro-cyclical tax.  I don't know whether you should call corporation tax as a pro-cyclical tax.</p></speech>

Just for the ... what we did ... the Government of which I was the member, did all this tax cutting in the first three budgets, as we had promised in our election manifesto and our programme for Government in 1997.  And in the last two budgets where I was responsible, the ... in the 2003 budget, the tax package ... as it may interest you, the tax and PRSI changes cost &euro;95 million and we had a social welfare package of &euro;530 million.  And, in 2004, our tax package cost &euro;296 million and our social welfare package was &euro;630 million.  And, interestingly, if you want to know, for the budgets where I was responsible from '97 to 2004, our income tax and PRSI package total came to &euro;5,607 million.  And our social welfare package at that period came to &euro;4,507 million, meaning a ratio of about 1.25:1.  Funnily enough, for the three budgets previous to my term, '95, '96 and '97, led by the previous Government, the income tax package and social welfare came to &euro;1,171 million as against a social welfare package of only &euro;750 million.  So I would certainly say, given that the surpluses that we were generating, and also put the money aside to the ... and the pension reserve fund that our overall taxation and welfare packages and spending packages during my seven years were totally justifiable and I have no hesitation in defending it.</p></speech>

The barrier the whole time that I used, for what it's worth, was the total trying to balance the budget - that we wouldn't run a deficit.  That was the barrier.  It's very hard to do anything else and that was a fair barrier to try and keep up the whole time.  So, therefore, it was obvious that from 2003 that there ... the tax that we were expecting to ... we were judging to come in, wasn't going to be anything like the previous years.</p></speech>

So, therefore, we made ... I made decisions at that time that, even though I produced a memorandum in June to say X level of the spending, when I got around to doing the budget, I forced on Departments a lower level of spending, much, of course, to annoyance of my Cabinet colleagues, much also to ... even in the Department of Finance didn't believe it could be done and we did it.</p><p>And we did ... we, then in ... for the 2004 budget we kept spending to a relatively low level again and did a very small, as I told you, very small tax package in both of those particular budgets so, therefore, we got ... what I would term ... we had got over the difficulties and we had still a balanced budget.

Can I just explain?  And there was ... this, actually, was never corrected, despite various efforts by me at the time to try and get the right impression ... the actual facts.  At the start of every year we had the budgetary process ... we used to have the spending Estimates process.  About three weeks before the budget, I'd announce the spending for each Department.  Then in about February of every year we produced what's called the REV, the Revised Estimates Volume, which was the final figures for the Department.  During the course of any year ... and it happened in '97, in '98 and '99, during the course of any year, around June, you find that different Departments are overrunning their budgetary allocation.  And up until '99 we used to have a mid-term ... a mid-term adjustment and we used to make an announcement about it and it used to cause some difficulties, and ... because in order to make sure that for the end of year that the budgetary spend would come in at a figure that was given in the REV, Revised Estimate Volume.  We didn't do it in 2000 and 2001 because no one was noticing what we did.  We did it internally each of the times with different departments.  In 2002, after the election, it was obvious that we were going to have to take measures to make sure that the part ... that the overall REV, the overall spend I announced in February, that it was going to come in on budget, and what we did immediately after was make pretty severe adjustments to some of the spends to ensure that we'll come in at the Revised Estimate Volume figure.  And that was stage 1 of the budgetary process.  And then stage 2 then, were the Estimates for 2003 that we started the process for-----</p></speech>

Anyway, it's the Revised Estimates Volume is the book.  The abridged ... in my time we called the ... we used to announce the Estimates in November, three weeks before the budget, and that was called the Abridged Estimates Volume.  Then when we got all the figures by the end of the year, and the outturn for the year - the previous year - if you look then we published the Revised Estimates Volume, which shows the outturn for each ... departmental levels of spending for the previous year, and beside that you have then the Estimates Volume for the following year.  Sometimes there would be small adjustments from the Abridged Estimates Volume to the Revised Estimates Volume, mostly relating to changes that the Minister might have announced in the budget in terms of spending, that would be that figure.  And then we would produce a Revised Estimates Volume.  And that was the process.</p></speech>

His measures ... and we have engaged with Mr. Bacon in the earlier part of this inquiry, his measures resulted in the pace ... in the pace of price growth halving from the first quarter of 1998 to the same period of 2000.  This was largely undone in 2001 when the measure to exclude interest deductibility was reversed.  In your view, can you explain the rationale behind the decision, and were there any influencers, lobbyists, or anybody else behind that decision?</p></speech>

If you look at the lobbying document ... annual document from the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish House Builders Association, various chambers of commerce, Dublin Chamber of Commerce, you will see in those particular documents that there was lobbying from them about the interest issue in particular.  That's ... you can go back and get those documents out, I'm sure they're all here in the committee somewhere.  So there was considerable lobbying from the CIF and other bodies as well.</p></speech>

Now, there's lobbying all the time, and before the budget, you have hundreds of lobbying going on and we had a process in my time, and pre my time, of how we met all those particular groups.  We didn't meet the same groups every year, we met the people in large groups, for about two weeks, for about ... every hour, from 9 in the morning 'til 9 and 10 at night and, some of them used to come before a committee as well, in the House.  I remember that also.  So, we would have had all of that.  But like, as I've said previously, whether there was lobbying or not, the Government would have taken the decision ... would have taken into account the ... well, we would have deemed, anyway, that the massive fallback that we'd had in construction activity, which, more or less, proved Michael Noonan's point about unintended consequences.  And I ... I think that the D&aacute;il record will show, during the debate of Finance ... the first Bacon report on Finance (No. 2) Bill 1998, that I also said, there, or in another D&aacute;il debate, that one never knows when one is interfering in the market, particularly to do with housing or property, as you might have------</p></speech>

Just to summarise the response you gave to me, Mr. McCreevy, yes, there was lobbying going on at the time, and, as you said in your earlier questioning, that the Minister, the politician is independent of officials, they stand over decision, and, of course, they're independent, the lobbyists.

I don't know whether Mr. Bacon said that he ... he did or he didn't, but ... whether was a good idea or not, but I can definitely recall the reasoning for the Government so doing.  And I certainly don't ... it wasn't for a moment as a result of any particular lobbying from any particular quarter, it was what ... we had seen the figures and we didn't like what we were looking at.</p></speech>

So, during 2001 there was also a measure in place which recommended in the third Bacon report, to limit mortgage relief for investment properties.  In the 2001 budget, you withdrew these measures in order to encourage what would seem to be more rental properties.  Can you explain why you done that?</p></speech>

We had rents ... I gave figures there of rents going up by 25% in that particular period there.  So, we felt at the time, for better or worse, that the thing to do was to allow the investor more or less back into the market.  It should not also be forgotten that we made considerable changes to the stamp duty regime in all of those years, and I started off with quite a simple stamp duty regime and ended up ... with a desperately complicated one.</p></speech>

And, if you look there at quarter 1, 2001, and quarter 1, 2002, this is the period I'm talking about.  And, what we see in the graph there is that residential new house prices and second-hand house prices are kind of flat-lined going back to '92, then they're rising, then the impact of the Bacon report is beginning to kick in, and we see a modest reduction in house prices, and then we see the removal of ... just, on the same timeline, we see the removal of the Bacon holding measures, if they were described as that, and a significant increase, right up until 2007 or so, in house price property values.  In hindsight, were the decisions that you made ... did they prevent or create the soft or hard landing that was going to come in the property market?</p><p>In hindsight the decisions that you made, did they create or prevent the soft or hard landing that was going to come in the property market?</p></speech>

Because I think we what did on foot of the first Bacon report was, it stopped the upward slant of prices.  We then as I gave reasons as to why we reversed that some years later, and I think if you look from 2002 right on to 2007 or 2008 or whatever it says here ... I think it was up to 2007 when the peak occurred, I think there were other factors at play regarding the house price spiral at that time.</p></speech>

This is the ratio of average new house price to average industrial wage.  If you look at both graphs one is new house price and the other is average second hand house price.  What we see here is that the ratio is in and around '96 or '97, is about four times the income of a household in terms of wages in both the new house and the second house market, and in the period I am talking about again, we see that becoming stabilised.  If somebody was trying to buy a home for themselves between 2000 and 2002 - in and around that period - there is a stabilisation in the market.  Following the removal of those Bacon measures, we then see the graph going up quite significantly, up to 12 times or ten times, respectively, of a person's capacity to earn.  Have you any view on that?</p></speech>

By the way I will just say this graph figure 36 relates to average industrial wage.  Maybe you have another graph to show what was the net take-home pay levels in those particular years as well.  Because a lot of the reason that people were able to buy houses and buy other houses relates to the affordability relating to their take-home salary rather than actually their gross industrial or gross any other wage, as you well know yourself from paying your own bills every month.</p></speech>

Just to get that on the record Mr. McCreevy, the graphs I have shown you this afternoon, the relationship with the cost of trying to buy a home after 2002, and the relationship of that the cost of buying a home was actually having on a person's earning capacity, you don't see any relationship of the pullback on the measures by Bacon to those two outcomes?</p></speech>

Sorry I said in my earlier evidence that the effect of the Finance Act 1998 that did the non-deductibility and other changes, that certainly had an effect but it also had an effect in kind of shooting down the level of constructive activity, the level of employment in the construction area and that's why we changed it.

I think it's come out in July there under a freedom of information request and I just want to deal with that after the break, but it comes from your own Department and it's from the Office of the Minister for Finance and it relates to the pre-budget Estimates in and around the same period.  The document's dated 19 June 2003 and it relates about going into 2004.  So I'll just ask legal to give you a copy of that before we go for a break and I'd also ask just to get a clarification on the chronological kind of dates that Deputy O'Donnell is referring to.</p> <p>  So, with that said, I now propose that we take a break.  The witness is reminded that once he begins giving evidence, he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to his evidence on matters that are being discussed before the committee.

You say:<blockquote><br /><br />On tax reliefs, last year I announced the termination of a series of major tax reliefs from the end of 2004.  Since then, I have been bombarded by demands to revisit that policy, especially in the case of one particular relief.</blockquote>And that's what is there.  So the question I'm asking, you extended every relief that was to be concluded by 31 December '04 by a further two years to 31 December 2006.  And the question I'm asking you is why did you do that?  Certainly, from the D&aacute;il ... from the records we have when I made reference to it earlier, over a month between 1 October 2003 and 3 November 2003, you met once with the Construction Industry Federation, you met twice with the Irish Home Builders Association, you met twice with Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute and you met once with the Irish Property Owners Association.

This is of 19 June 2013 and it's the Office of the Minister for Finance and I'll just be ... as the investigation continued to be putting this in as an evidence document for further hearings coming down the tracks as well.  It's 2003, sorry, my apologies.  Yes, 2003.  And if you just look at the first two Roman numericals on page 1, it references a general Government deficit and then on II it says, "Ministers should prepare their pre-Budget estimates proposals for 2014, 2005 and 2006 on the basis of an overall reduction of a half a million euros in the costs of the existing level of current supply services."</p><p>Now, this was in and around the time of the decentralisation and forth ... so forth.  I just want to move on to one, two, three, four pages later.  It's to the item, Background to Budget 2004.8.  It's at the very end of the page, yes, it's actually circled there.  All right.  And there it says, ''The 2004 budget will be prepared against a continuation of a more difficult international and domestic economic climate which has been present since the second half of 2001.  The period of exceptional economic growth enjoyed by Ireland is over.'.  Do you recall that sentence because when I read that it actually, kind of, came off the page quite loudly to me?  Do you recall this document?</p></speech>

It's the memorandum for Government that we produce every year in and around that time which starts the budgetary process.  So, I actually can't ...

Like, if one ... I haven't got them here but I'm sure if one looks at the percentage growth figures for GNP, GDP, for all the years since 2001, I'm sure that statement there as well that the exceptional economic growth that we had prior to that had lessened off.

Was this the culmination of that budget strategy, that from 2004 onwards, the surpluses were going to be based upon extraordinary cyclical measures, particularly those related with the property market, and that what is called 'the real economy' was no longer going to be able to sustain the expenditure that the Department of Finance would require?</p></speech>

So what we were trying to do in 2004 was to ... in that ... for June 2003, setting out the parameters for the next three budgets, to say, ''Look, this is the background to the upcoming budget.  Growth has slowed down, we're not going to have these exceptional revenues that we had in the past, so we have to cut our expenditure cloth to meet these new circumstances.'.  That would have been the overall ... in fact there ... now in the Department of Finance and everybody else, we wouldn't ... we didn't have a big crystal ball and, like, so we could say what was going to happen in 2006.  And, by the way, everybody was understating the amount of housing that was being constructed.  Every time we were told from '98 onwards that we'll meet the housing target if we build, say, 25,000 houses a year and then 32,000, the figures kept exceeding that.  So, therefore, we were at all times saying, ''Yes, anyway, well, the exceptional economic growth that's in a whole variety of areas - not just in construction - is going to slow down somewhat'', and then we had the general economic background and a slowdown in the world economy in 2001 relating to the dotcom bubble collapse, etc., etc., etc.</p></speech>

That ... by 2004 - and you're dead right - there was ... production in property and property investment continued and home ownership and all the rest continued afterwards.  But Mr. Wright, in his report, is very critical of there being no counter-cyclical measures as far back as 2000 and 2001 and in his physical presence and ... when he gave his testimony before this inquiry when the analogy of the red button being pressed, he said, ''The red button should have been pressed at 2004 because the crisis was now commencing.  It wasn't the night of the guarantee was the crisis, it was the measures that came afterwards''.</p><p>So given this information that you had to hand at that time, do you believe that anything extraordinary was required, or was it that there should just be a modest adjustment going into next year of &euro;500 million?</p></speech>

But actually the outturn, which I wasn't there for, the outturn of the budgetary surplus was very large in that particular year, 2004, and bigger, I think, again, in 2005 and 2006.</p></speech>

What Mr. Wright and maybe other commentators seem to be suggesting, that in those years a big economic, big budgetary surpluses, that the Government should have been saying to the people, "Oh no, instead of giving you rises in social welfare, child benefit, tax reductions, etc., etc., we want to be cutting back on you."  And as I said in my opening statement, does anyone think that that would be possible?  Or does anyone think it would be desirable either?  Either it would be certainly unacceptable politically, but I suggest it was unacceptably morally as well.  We have to ... imagine me standing up in the middle of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on budget night and saying, "We're going to have an enormous surplus this year, and a bigger one next year, and I'm going to cut back social welfare and I'm going to cut back tax reliefs, etc., etc., and I'm going to impose a whole lot of stringency measures."  And then some Opposition person would rightly say, "But you're putting aside an enormous amount of money to the pension reserve fund and you intend on putting forward more and reduce the debt even further."  Like, that type of reality is, like ... and if Mr. Wright or anybody else is suggesting that that is in the realms of political reality, he's wrong.</p></speech>

Cyclical taxes are in, kind of, layperson's term, a bit like overtime.  This is extra money you're earning, but you don't plan your household budget on overtime.  You might go out and buy a refrigerator, buy a Chinese on a Saturday night, or take a holiday on it, but you don't plan your week to week current expenditure upon overtime.  This is the difficulty with cyclical taxes.  So do you actually go in and say, "I've a load of overtime," to take your, kind of comparison, there, and say, "Well, I'm going to have this overtime forever"?</p></speech>

But I have outlined to you is that we were having considerable economic success, which gave us the resources to do certain things, which we could only dream about in previous decades.  I think the ... Professor Wright, or anybody else, who's ... when he's talking about counter-cyclical measures, what is he actually talking about?  What did he or other people want you to do?  Well, the only other thing that I can suggest to you is that you impose more taxation, lessen the amount you're spending on public services, withdraw thousands of people from the public service, and, like, what would that do?  And, by the way, other studies have been done which say if you were to have counter-cyclical measures that would maybe have an effect of maybe of a quarter of a percent on the harmonised inflationary index, you'd have to take about the best order of &euro;5 billion out of the economy.  That's not realistic in those years.  What we did in my last two budgets, I lessened considerably, as I gave my figures earlier, to the amount of tax change ... the tax package.  The social welfare package continued fairly good, but the tax package was very, very small.  And I think that was the reasonable, the politically correct thing to do, and the morally correct thing to do.</p></speech>

Well, now, let's look at it like this now, about buying an election with that.  I announced that for 2001.  And people could sign up from I think 1 May 2001 to 30 April 2002.  Now, I like credit as much as the next man, and to be given great credit for winning elections, I wouldn't be adverse to great commentary about this.  But, since 1969, the same Government had not been re-elected on any occasion.</p><p>So, this brilliance of mine, of the SSIA ... I was going to be able to ... even though I was taking the money out of people's pockets for putting aside, it was going to win the 2002 election for us, which ... and bring back the same Administration, which hadn't been done for the previous 30 odd years, and I was going to be able to look forward into my crystal ball to see we'll win the following election as well, because the following election people will be getting this particular money in their back pocket.  Now, much and all ... and, great and all, as I am, Deputy, and the great sage which I know I am, and which I ... well, I'm sure you'll give testament to yourself, I didn't plan it like that.  It just wasn't like that.  And any sane, sensible person that looks forward and says, we'll bring it in a budget, asking for the savings, before an election, which was going to come up anyway, he was going to win that election ... he was sure he was going to win that one, but not alone was he going to win that one after 33 years for the first time, he was going to win in five years time as well.  I'm not that much of a genius.</p></speech>

That was the ... at the time.  And we ... I answered repeated questions in the D&aacute;il and said is that ... I didn't know what the uptake was going to be, but I hoped it was going to be the maximum amount possible.  In the end of the day, the first few months with ... many people didn't apply.  And, as usual, in Ireland, other places probably as well, everybody registered in the last two months or so.  If I remember correctly, there was about 1.17 million people originally signed up for it.  And, I think over the period of the five years, maybe 70,000 dropped off, or thereabouts.  I ... the scheme was ... it was an incentive scheme to get people to come back and save in very, very good times, the same as the State had been saving in the good times.  I'd been reducing the budget ... the overall national debt to a figure in the 30s, I set up the pension reserve fund, and ... so we were saving on behalf of the State, so, therefore, I think it was important ... people were getting used to all this money in their pockets and I decided that we'd have an incentive scheme to encourage people to save.  By the way, if you want to talk about counter-cyclical policies, Chairman, actually, that was a counter-cyclical policy because it took the order ... it must have taken in the order, over the five years ... if it cost &euro;2.5 billion, it must have taken in the order of &euro;10 or &euro;11 billion out of the economy over the five years.  So, therefore, I rest my case.  By the way-----</p></speech>

The Chairman spoke about the cyclical taxes.  Now you can count whichever taxes you wish to be cyclical or counter-cyclical.  The narrowing of the tax base, the reduction in the wealth taxes, the capital gains taxes, the transaction taxes and then the decreasing of the income tax.  Was he correct then and were you wrong?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1374" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charlie McCreevy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#LLL01500"><p>Well, let's just deal with it one by one: the transaction taxes.  The biggest transaction tax was stamp duty.  There was 0% stamp duty for first-time buyers of new houses, zero.  Regarding capital gains tax, I certainly reduced the rate of capital gains tax from 40% and we quintupled the amount of revenue coming in to the State.  The same happened to do with capital acquisitions tax as well.  And narrowing of the tax base, I didn't.  What I did was that I reduced an unfair burden at both rates of tax.  When I became Minister for Finance, the rates of tax were 26% and 48% and various other levies in between.  Well, anyway, I reduced it, as we said in our election programme from 26% to 20% and from 48% to 40% over my time as Minister of Finance.  I did most of that in the first three years.  I ... and from then on, in the last two budgets, all I did was increase the exemption limit to take the people on the minimum wage out of the tax net.  And if you look at the 2002 agreed programme for Government, you will notice that our programme for the next five years didn't specifically mention any more change in rates of taxation but said our goal was to have 80% of all taxpayers paying on the standard rate.  So we certainly reduced the rates of taxation, we widened the bands, we brought in the revolutionary concept of tax credits, which allowed a lot of different things to be done in the meantime, which hadn't been done previously and we made these particular ...  So I don't for a moment accept that we narrowed the tax base.  And some of those transaction taxes, the biggest one being stamp duty, we had a 0% stamp duty on new house purchases for first-time people.</p></speech>

In 1997, the expenditure, total capital and current, was &euro;18.8 billion.  Seven years later, it was almost &euro;41 billion.  Again the Chairman touched upon it but I'm touching upon it now.  A lot of it was based upon taxes that were going to come from the property sector, so long as the property sector kept going.  Deputy O'Donnell touched upon your change of mind in relation to the property-based taxes.  Had you any knowledge that when the property sector slowed down that there could only be a collapse in terms of because we had...  The money had been given out on an annualised basis and had you any knowledge how difficult it is to reduce these numbers when the money is not available?</p></speech>

What I was taught the whole time, for years, that there was going to be, what became the famous phrase, "a soft landing", so there was no one in the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, or anywhere else, saying, "There's going to be a total collapse in the property sector."  Not just housing, but in all other sectors as well.  Nobody came along with that ... look, even the ESRI weren't predicting that as late as 2007, I think, never mind predicting it in 2003, 2004.</p></speech>

That was the only time that I can remember that ever there was any great, detailed discussion.  In fact, I remember, in all other years, that the stability update of the Commission and their comments, if you look, was very complimentary on Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>what they said about other countries so the answer to that question is &quot;No&quot;.</p></speech>

Going back to the financial arrangements, you call it the Dermot McCarthy compromise.  The memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator dealt with the responsibilities being divided between the Central Bank and the IFSRA.  Was there clarity on what should be dealt with by the regulator and was there an expectation that the Governor could exercise his rights under the memorandum of understanding and intervene with the regulator?</p></speech>

The ECB insisted that the Governor of the Central Bank had to be totally independent and they were ... they were only anxious at that time about that particular matter, more than anything else.  Mr. ... the structure that was set up would have ... the Governor to produce financial stability reports and I'm sure that there could have been interaction, as per the law, between him and the Financial Regulator, if the Financial Regulator brought to his attention any matters that he thought would compromise financial stability because the Act itself allowed that prudence was to be exercised and I'm sure there were sufficient powers there for the Governor to intervene if he thought so fit.</p></speech>

I think the key figure to look at is the explosion in credit from 2003 to, say, 2007, 2008.  Nobody ... certainly ... maybe had a peremptory discussion at some stage, maybe with some of the officials about the increase in credit, but nobody was overtly concerned at that time because the Central Bank structure, including the regulator and the Governor, weren't saying, "There is a great danger of a desperate situation occurring here", at that time.

I'm not too certain about that, and I'll tell you why, for a number of reasons.  One of the reasons for the ... I would suggest that the banks here went very loose with their credit policy, were a number of factors, but one certainly was competition, and competition not just from the ... what we call the Irish banks but from outside as well.  And remember that, say, the Royal Bank of Scotland was involved here through their wholly-owned subsidiary.  The Bank of Scotland was also involved here, Rabo was also involved here.  And incidentally ... but they were regulated from their home base, and they ... Royal Bank of Scotland on their Irish operation, I read in the very recent past - you can correct me if I'm wrong - even though they never have announced fully the figures, have ... I think they've estimated that they lost something in the order of ... it's many, many billions, I've a figure ... I've ideas in the 20, in excess of 20.  Bank of Scotland probably the same.  Rabo who took over the ACC, very, very big figures as well.  And the regulator in their home jurisdiction didn't spot this collapse in the Irish economy as well, and a massive credit growth.  So I am not ... I can argue, I ... we can debate it, and you might be correct in some things could be put in place, but I actually don't see it like that because it was missed by there.  And by the way, in the United States, they missed AIG, Bear Sterns, Wachovia and a few others as well, you know what I mean?</p></speech>

It's a desire that is very well worthwhile, that we'd have the same principles for accounting worldwide.  Americans use US GAAP,  that's general accounting accepted principles.  Irish and UK used to use Irish GAAP.  And there always has been a move since the 60s to try and have an internationally accepted standard the way we look at accounts, whether it be in Australia, America, Ireland, whatever, you'd be interpreting the same thing.  The IASB, the International Accounting Standards Board, was set up in the 60s and it's funded from a variety of independent sources. They started to produce then IAS standards over the years.  The European Commission decided in 2002 that they would endorse IFRS the new standards - International Financial Reporting Standards.  And the European Commission, even though not a member of the IASB, which is totally independent, adopted all these particular standards, and public companies had to apply these IFRS standards as and from, I think the accounts starting January 2007.</p><p>Those particular standards, some people ... those particular standards generally use mark-to-market.  They all said there were some difficulties over standards, IAS2 and 39.  And all these difficulties, some people would say, is that ... contributed somewhat to the financial crisis internationally but Ireland ... Ireland was ... Ireland was the one country, the same as all the other member states, bar one, who had ... who implemented exactly what the new regulation was.  So the accounting professionals have been before the ... before the committee here, but they were doing their accounts on the basis of IFRS and there are certainly some anomalies in the IFRS standards which may have contributed globally to some of the financial problems and particularly in the EU.  But that's a matter you can discuss with some accountants rather than me.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1416" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charlie McCreevy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#OOO00300"><p>I think, Deputy, we ... Senator, we could have a discussion maybe another day over this.  There'll be a whole variety of reasons.  I said ... I mentioned earlier about low interest rate policies but if I can say one thing about ... I said competition among the banks, which we all thought, in Ireland, was a very good thing.  And, as you rightly have ... over your long career as an academic have advocated competition, and competition is a good thing, but in certain areas, too much competition can be a very bad thing because you can't compete to the lower base, financial products being one of them.  Auditing on price can be a bad thing as well because you can compete all the time on price for auditing ... you may end up with a very, very low base.  So, therefore, competition has been recognised as being a very good thing and, as you well know, all of my political career I have been pro-competition, but in certain areas it can lead to these problems and, as I said earlier, the competition, not alone among Irish banks, but banks from the outside contributed to the lessening of credit standards being applied by banks.</p> <p>  And one final thing, may I say, if I was to ... from my experience in Brussels, and looking across what happened in the financial sector throughout Europe and throughout the world, the remuneration policies of financial institutions have led, in my view, to a lot of these difficulties.  Very ... we'll make it very simple, here is bank A over here, led by a very conservative chairman, chief executive, lending officers etc., in business for 60 years, doing a nice ... doing a nice dividend at the end of the year for their shareholders.  Along comes bank B over here, bright new sparks, new chief executive, incentivisation and bonus shares etc. etc.  Profits keep going up and up and up.  Every year at their annual meeting, old Mr. Fogey over here, "Why aren't your profits going up and up compared to bank B over here?"  What happens, out is turfed conservative Mr. A and his team.  In come a whole lot of new whizz kids anyway and they're going to compete for more and more business, because they are being remunerated on results.  And everybody's being remunerated on results, including the Government.  The Government is being remunerated because they're going to get increased taxation and corporate taxation plus PAYE etc. etc.  The shareholders are going to get more and more dividends.  The employees are going to get more wages and more salaries and more bonuses baked in share schemes.  And this cycle keeps going.  And if you were to look across the world, not just Ireland, you will see that is one common denominator.  Now, I'm making a comment, which I probably didn't intend to do, because it's post my time as Minister for Finance. </p></speech>

So before asking you ... you've given your opinion and so on but what kind of struck me when I was reading your statement is that you described it as an independent body funded from a variety of sources.  Do you know what the sources are?</p></speech>

They had very eminent people involved with them, such as Mr. Paul Volcker and people like that, because they want to be seen to be clearly independent, because, you see, they would see it, and rightly so, that, you know ... that you shouldn't have influence in setting accounting standards from anybody, that it should speak definitively, coldly, etc. etc.</p><p>So they fund themselves.  They got ... you see they don't need an awful lot of money to keep going.  But the small amount of money, so they've always guarded their independence jealously.  But ... and they have a wide consultation process, they don't come up in the middle of the night and say "we're having a standard here", they go through an exhausting operation that might go on two or three years.  And bodies from all over the world are ... represented in various fora there.  And the, the process they go through is exhaustive, could go on for three or four years and everybody gets a chance to comment about it.  But, I just, some people have commented that some of the IFRS standards have contributed to this.</p></speech>

Are you aware that their biggest funders are the four biggest accountancy firms, PwC, KPMG, E and Y, and Deloitte, who last year contributed $2.5 million each.  Ireland's Central Bank and Financial Services Authority gave &pound;6,000 sterling.  So how independent are they actually, given that the agencies that are carrying out the tasks are funding the structure that does the regulation?  So, given your statement that you're saying they are independent, given that funding structure-----</p></speech>

I'm only commenting on it because ... I, for completeness, I was asked in my ... direction as to influence of outside bodies from Europe etc. etc.  And I thought I should mention it because there are people that have this view.  You'd have to ask the IASB, but you must remember, this whole accounting standards thing is not something that was ever run by a government.  No government came along to ... like in the 1960s, '70s, '80s, '90s to say we want independent accounting standards.  This body came ... was a body that came about itself from the accountancy bodies from day one ... that they say, "Look, worldwide we should have the same accounting standards."  But what gave it great momentum was, in Europe, was the EU decided that we will recognise this, the independence of this body, and we will put this into effect by issuing a directive and regulation and that's what gave them ... their, their strength.  They didn't come along to us in Europe and say you have to do this ... Now by the way, the United States had signed up to do this as well, but until the time that I left office in Brussels, they hadn't actually put all of it into effect.  So they were, it's not ... to be fair to this body, this IASB, it's not ... it was never a government that said we'll have an independent accounting standards body, this body grew up itself from, there was a, quite a famous individual in the '60s, who had this idea for years and he kept pushing it and pushing it, and ... it is a very, very good idea that there would be one international set of accounting standards.  But ... therefore it's an idea that came from the professions and the accountancy bodies, it's not an idea that came from any government.</p></speech>

Senator Barrett touched on this or not  but I just want to come back to it as well, that the memorandum of understanding between the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator dealt with the responsibilities of both the ECB, CBFSAI and IFSRA, and this was the structure that you were discussing earlier.  Was there clarity in what should be dealt with by the regulator and was there an expectation that the Governor would invoke his rights under the memorandum of understanding and intervene with the Financial Regulator, and did this ever happen?</p></speech>

I think the, the memorandum of understanding was, was agreed by ... was ... came about due to Europe intervening.  For a long number of years, in ECOFIN Councils, there had been debates about a cross-border banking crisis, and finally in the middle 2000s  they agreed anyway we'd have memorandums of understanding for cross-border financial institutions, and that's were the memorandums of understanding came from.  Then in Ireland, I think in 2005, 2006, but you can check this record, but post my time in any event ... the domestic standing group was set up, which incorporated the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the Department of Finance and-----</p></speech>

Was there an expectation, when you were putting this architecture together, that the Governor would, at some stage, if required, invoke his rights, under the memorandum of understanding?</p></speech>

Mr. McCreevy, during your tenure as Minister, there were obviously the difficulties that arose around Ansbacher and also the DIRT inquiry and in 2001-2002, the problems with Allfirst, the AIB subsidiary.

The only time, in my political career, that I can think of when that danger was about was around 1985 or so when the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, had run into some difficulty and the ICI, or AIB, came to the then Government and asked them to take some measures because they, if I remember correctly, thought that the financial stability of AIB could be put at risk.  I don't remember, since that time, and certainly not during my period, that anybody ever had the remotest possibility of thinking that any Irish financial institution, like mainly the major banks, was going to collapse.  In fact the ... in fact, it was totally the opposite.  Both of the major banks were having ... announcing enormous profits every year and enormous dividends and accordingly going from strength to strength.</p></speech>

You raise a good point.  You've mentioned about Ansbacher and those three things, and the one ... from another angle, that did impinge upon the thinking leading up to the financial ... the single regulator and the structure.  Because there was ... if I ... we had National Irish Bank and the overcharging scandal there; we had the Ansbacher issue regarding tax issues; we had the Allfirst thing somewhat later with the ... that was outside of the State so it's probably unfair to mention that in the same area; and there were some other ones as well.  And all of that, the criticism the whole time, both in the D&aacute;il and in the commentary was that the Central Bank, as constituted, was not up to the mark.  And also there was an all-party committee sat back in those days as well and they, more or less, said the same thing.  And out of that, the idea came then, we'll have a single regulatory authority and out of that then came this great debate that went on as to where it should be located.  And from that also the whole debate was about consumer protection ... in fact, if you read the commentary at the time and including the McDowell report, there was nothing but praise for the prudential regulatory section of the Central Bank.  All of the discourse was on the consumer angle which all of those things are.  And they are very important.  And I think ... I haven't been able to find it before I came to this committee, but you'll find, I think, at the committee, where I said, when I was being harangued by certain Deputies who are still in the House, about not doing anything about this ... I think I did make the comment, saying, "Well, I think actually Mary Jones would be actually more worried about her deposit in the bank and keeping the bank from going under than the extra &euro;3 that she might have been charged incorrectly"-----</p></speech>

I applied for a loan in the normal way and gave the normal documentation and it was got nothing to do with my time in finance or anything else.</p></speech>

I applied to Irish Nationwide Building Society, sorry myself and my wife applied for Irish Nationwide Building Society, for a loan.  In all, I got many loans personally over the years from many people, and I only got one ever before for Irish Nationwide in 1984 - 1985 when I neither was a Minister or had been a Minister at that particular time.  I was elected in '77, I just applied for it in the normal way and in 2006 I applied for it in the normal way because I had a relationship with that particular institution.  It was got nothing to do with ... I could do.</p><p>I was out of Finance at the time.  I was in the European Commission and there was nothing to do with Irish Nationwide or anything else.  In all my years getting loans, some for myself, but mostly during my time as a partner in an accountancy firm, I would have got hundreds of loans or facilities for clients of mine from all types of institutions, and individuals, I never, ever, in all those years, ever knew it to be the job of the borrower to know what the processes were of the lender as to how he was going to get the loan.  All I ever did, for either clients or myself, was to apply, and we received the loan.</p></speech>

In relation to the cost of tax expenditures, and I know you've discussed this with other members, according to the OECD, by 2005 the cost of tax expenditures had become larger than the remaining income tax receipts.  This is in the Regling and Watson report, page 27:<blockquote><br /><br />As a percentage of total tax revenue, tax expenditures in Ireland are more than three times larger than on average in the EU.  Again, this excessive reliance on tax relief narrowed the tax base.  In addition, it contributed - again - to the property bubble, as some of the tax relief was directed to the property sector.</blockquote>So, I just want to know, because you said earlier on, Mr. McCreevy, that there had been tax breaks, if you like, in Ireland for 50 years.  And I've no doubt that that's true.  All I'm saying is that the OECD's observation was that by 2005, they were way higher than in any other country, and they were narrowing the tax base and they led to a property bubble.</p></speech>

It's not primarily to give a tax break to individuals, but to stimulate investment in the area, which is lacking such investment, and I referred to it quite considerably during my opening statement.  Now much of the commentary in recent years, and I note that during the inquiry, the little I've looked at, that the Senator seems to concentrate totally on the tax foregone and very little credit is given for the economic activity created.  There were tens and tens and tens of thousands of jobs created in the construction and other ancillary jobs.  There were hundreds and billions collected in PAYE-PRSI, etc., etc.  Now, there seems to be just an over-concentration in all of those years as to, "What is the tax foregone?"  And also, a, kind of, belief, well it's tax foregone, but it really isn't tax foregone because if the incentive wasn't there-----</p></speech>

So, therefore, there wouldn't be any tax foregone in any particular thing.  It's a tax break, to give to ... in order to allow activity to take place, as I said in my opening address, in areas where it wouldn't take place, or if it did take place, it would be too little, too late.  Yes, like when the more uptake there is, the more tax there'll be foregone.  But, yes, there'll be more and more people employed, and, yes, there'll be more and more taxation.  Like the question to Deputy, or Senator, D'Arcy about the SSIAs; the more people took them up, the greater the income tax foregone was going to be, but the benefit to the people who took up the SSIAs have lasted until the present day.  So on your question, Deputy, there is certainly tax foregone, the greater the activity there would be in any sector.  By the way ... but there seems to be an ideological bias against some type of tax incentive related to the construction sector.</p></speech>

Sorry Mr. MacSharry, or Mr.  McCreevy, could I reframe the question for you?  The question has been put that there was over-stimulation of tax incentives in the property sector; it wasn't that there was an incentive here to get something going, the broader sector, residential, commercial, above the shop, parking schemes, student accommodation, there was a litany of stimulation taking place there.  So there was a menu of numbers.  The question has been put to you, if I can come back to Senator O'Keeffe ... it's in that context that the question has been made.  There's a plethora of tax incentivisations, all property-related.</p></speech>

But the greater the benefit there was as well.  There comes a time, Deputy, unquestionably I agree with you, there comes a time, as we had a debate earlier with Deputy O'Donnell, when you have to cut off these particular reliefs and say, "Well, if we've done enough now at this area, so it can get on by itself."  And there is a debate, and you can have an argument about whether you should do it, whether it's too late or whatever, I accept that as a kind of general kind of point.

And the Government, of which I was member, all of the initiatives that we took place before Bacon, post-Bacon, was to try and increase the supply in the belief that in any other area when you increase supply, the price of the product falls down.  That was ... various measures that we took place were all intended to increase the supply in that, maybe somewhat mistaken belief, which maybe proves that in this particular sector, the normal laws of supply and demand did not take place and the reason that my colleague, the then Minister for housing, I think it was Deputy Robert Molloy, initiated the first Bacon study.  I think there might have been studies by Goodbody Economic Consultants as well but someone else can check that, is that was on this belief is that the first-time buyer and the ordinary person on the average industrial wage and people starting off with young families or whatever, couldn't get on the housing ladder.  We may not have ... Deputy, you're correct, we definitely did not succeed for a lot of that period, but that was the intention, you can take it from me.</p></speech>

And for example, an 11-acre site in Stillorgan was bought in 2000 by a group of very wealthy individuals, sat on for four years and sold for &euro;85 million in 2004.  A &euro;53 million speculative gain on which apartments were to be built which would cost each young person buying, maybe &euro;120,000 extra, just as a result of that gain.  Mr. McCreevy, can I ask you, is it fair to describe that as inordinate greed and can you justify doing nothing to curb that profiteering and how do you justify the fact that your cuts in capital gains tax put an extra &euro;10.5 million into the pockets of those speculators?</p></speech>

It was the market ... in the ... I know Deputy Higgins doesn't accept the principles of the free market.  He has another view, which I have always respected.  I don't.  I am a free marketeer and I make no secret about it.  It was the market that decided those particular issues.  I certainly ... but I want to tell you the <i>modus vivendi</i>of all Government initiatives in the housing area and all these other matters was to increase supply in the belief - mistaken as you might contend it was - that the more supply that we put in place, that the price of housing would stabilise and come down.  And if you go back and see all of the studies from '97 onwards predicting what the proper number of houses that would be completed the following year and what was the proper number to take account of the population of the country, they were understating it by zillions.  Like, there was ... I think the number of units completed in the last year before the crash was something like 90,000 or whatever.  But you would have thought a long time earlier - due to the measures we put in place to increase supply - that some sync would have occurred between the price of property ... the price of housing and the market would take account of that, which would've allow the people that you represent get their foot in the housing ladder.</p></speech>

Every year Fianna F&aacute;il had a marquee at the Galway Races which became notorious in media circles, etc., for the property interests, speculators, etc., who assembled there to fund Fianna F&aacute;il.

I actually ... I think it is common knowledge that developers are close both ... to the major political parties.  That's very obvious.  Like, the major political parties, until the recent election, represented maybe upwards of 75% to 80% of the electorate since more or less 1930.  So, therefore, it would be expected that developers and the builders would come from that large constituency from both parties.  I personally am not close to any of the builders.  I know lots of builders and know lots of tradesmen and I know lots of accountants, I know lots of punters, I know lots of other kinds of people.  I know lots of politicians, or I used to, in any event.  And in regarding the Galway tent, I find the whole thing about the Galway tent a bit disingenuous and I think so ... I've always thought so about through the years.  It was a big social event, right.  There were not just builders in the Galway tent.  In fact, I didn't attend that often because I found it a terrible pain in the backside because I'm a punter and people know I am a punter and like a bet and I used to have to put in my time and decide one day to go into this bloody tent.  And most of the people ... what ... the biggest thing I remember of the Galway tent was, if people want to know ... was one thing anyway, you would be inundated for about three weeks previously, or my office would be, with loads of journalists wanting a freebie into the Galway tent in order to get plenty of drink and food.  That's the more thing I remember about it and that definitely was a pain in the backside to me as well.</p></speech>

The first Bill in 2002, the Central Bank Financial Services [Regulatory] Authority [of Ireland] Bill in 2002 set up the structure and all things relating thereto.  During the course of that debate, I signalled that I would be bringing forward a second Bill that was going to do other things.  The second Bill we did in 2003.  That second Bill dealt with things like administrative sanctions, penalties, set up the Financial Services Ombudsman, did a whole lot of things like that.  So, in the second Bill in 2003, there were adequate legislative measures put in place to do all of things to do with penalties, sanctions, etc., etc., and that's what the purpose of the second Bill was in 2003, and that was done.  I can't ... I'm not in a position to know as to how that was implemented post my leaving the Department of Finance.  There always would have been, even pre the old Acts, before we had a new structure ... there would have been provision in the Central Bank Act of 1942, as amended on many occasions, for that type of sanctions and penalties.  Panels have to be set up, and the lawyers around here will know it, and you had to, the minute ... one of the jobs of the Minister for Finance was to publish a list of ... the panel lists that would be ... banks could appeal some of the decisions of the regulator.  So, therefore, there were always provisions for sanctions and penalties in the old Central Bank Act, and in the new Acts as well.</p></speech>

This is the SSIA ... you can have daring views as to its impact.  You said it had a counter-cyclical impact.  It might have had in the short term, in the longer term, because it was a five-year scheme, it arguably didn't have a counter-cyclical impact because there was an increase in expenditure.  We've had evidence from David Doyle, from John Fitzgerald, from other witnesses, that the major increase in lending to property took place in or around the years just preceding or just following when the SSIAs came to fruition.  And I'm asking you about why you didn't do that analysis.</p></speech>

Is that, when the money became available to the SSIA person in 2006-2007, my ... I would think that most of the money was ... people didn't rush off and start buying houses with it.  Some did; some used it as a deposit which ... I remember saying in the D&aacute;il at the time that would be a good thing, whatever they were going to do, maybe some did.  My own view is that the majority of people spent a little of it, did whatever they wanted to do, maybe send children to school, tuition, holiday or whatever.  A lot of them kept a good bulk of the money there.  But it can't ... so, and it was counter-cyclical, if you want to argue about that, because they were taking at least &euro;2.5 billion out of the economy every year, so we can't ... the two ends of this thing.</p></speech>

And that applies from Mulhuddart all the way to Graiguenamanagh and all the way to Letterkenny as well.

I got my chance at government given to me by Albert Reynolds and more or less I was on the Front Bench and Minister for the second half of my career.  I enjoyed my time in the backbenches as well but probably caused a fair amount of mischief to my own party more than anything else.  Certainly, the late Mr. Haughey would think like that anyway, but ... and I got my chance as Minister for Finance, and I always thought if I ever got the chance at being a Government Minister that I was going to approach every day as if it was going to be my last day there.</p></speech>

Can I put an assertion to you, Mr. McCreevy, that the ingredients of what would eventually become a major crisis were very much in place by the autumn of 2004.  For example, there was a rapid expansion of the balance sheets of the banks in the two or three years leading up to the end of your tenure.</p><p>There was a growing dependence on property lending by the banks at that time, a growing dependence on wholesale funding from the international market.  The states were becoming increasing dependent on transaction taxes, and, from 2001, current expenditure was growing at a faster rate than nominal GDP every year and there was a distinct lack ... or, loss of competitiveness from 2000-2001.  Now, all of those elements, it could be argued, certainly accelerated after your tenure, but do you accept that those ingredients were in place when you departed Merrion Street in the autumn of 2004?</p></speech>

I didn't and there's no point kind of speculating on it.  I would have ... I certainly have recognised since I left, and looking at the figures from 2003, 2004 to 2007, that there was massive increases in the property lending area, which I alluded to earlier.  I have dealt earlier with the questions of increases in Government expenditure, both capital and current, and given you the figures as a percentage spend on GNP.  If you like, I can give you other figures relating to what the spend was in various years.  So I think that, all in all, that what was ... in the time that I was Minister of Finance, I am quite happy that I dealt with the issues as presented to me.  If it became very obvious some of the things that have occurred since my time there in Finance, I'm not too sure as to what actions I would have taken or whatever but there's no point ... there's no point ... you do what you do when you're there.  There's no point in speculating what you would have done when you weren't there.  So I regard that as a total futility for me to be speculating about that.  I think that the changes that we brought about in the Irish economy, the things that we done, were all very, very worthwhile.</p></speech>

You must remember the economy was expanding at a very fast rate, the population was increasing, there was greater demand for services, which were going to cost more.  You can't have a good medical service, a good education service without people, and people cost money.  So, therefore, if you want to do things in the big areas of public expenditure ... do something worthwhile in those areas, then you have to put the resources, and that's what we did.  At the same time, we ran ... the biggest thing we could have done was to keep reducing the national debt.  I was in the House here, Deputy McGrath, when the national debt was 122% of GNP, when the country was practically bankrupt and we never thought we'd get out of it.  And we did, and we saw the percentage debt-to-GDP ratio coming down, which freed up massive resources, because we didn't have interest payments to be paid to all the money that we had borrowed, and that allowed other ... that money to be used for worthwhile social purposes.</p></speech>

By the way, there seems to be a body of opinion that seems to suggest, well, maybe we shouldn't have got unemployment down to 4%, maybe the safer rate for the economy was 6%, 7% or 8%.  Maybe it was done too quickly.  Well, I don't subscribe to that at all.  So you're going to tell the ... the people that have that theory seem to advocate that Joe Smith, "Well, Joe, you should stay there - you're unemployed and stay unemployed."  And "Mary Jones, you don't have to go to work, you stay in the home and don't come out to work, you could bury income," whatever the case may be.

And, can I ask then Minister ... Mr. McCreevy, in light of the fact that there was a lot of horse-trading from that memo in June to the announcement of the Budget in December; did the advice of the Department change from June to December or how otherwise can you explain the fact that in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, the income tax and welfare package announced on budget day dramatically exceeded the recommendation made by the Department the previous June?</p></speech>

And I said in my first budget in December 1997, that I wanted my ... the first lines of my first budget were that they should ... that I want to be judged over the period of the five budgets that this Government was going to bring in, and that all those ... and in many interviews afterwards I said, it had to be judged in the totality.  And as I said earlier, in my, in the five budgets that I introduced between '98, '99, 2000, 2001 and 2002 and then 2003, 2004, the total income tax and PRSI package came to &euro;5,607 million-----</p></speech>

The taxation ... decisions on the budget are made separately, or they were in my time.  We, we made them  but certainly in ... within ... I dealt with spending and culminating in the publication in November of the Abridged Estimates Volume setting out the Estimates for the following year.  And then I dealt with the taxation package mostly on budget day.  The Government has gone back ... or has for some years now to have a unified system, of announcing about tax and expenditure changes on the one day, and it's all done together.  That was actually done some previously ... all the years up until about, I think, my predecessor, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, might have got into the form I followed in 1996 ... having a separate process, or maybe I did it myself, I just can't remember that.  So ... the ...we then , went along then ... the memorandum was put to Government and you can note that all years bar the Estimates, bar the memorandum for 2003, that the spending figures for all years, except for 2003, the figure in the ... in the budget day or the Abridged Estimates Volume was less than ever and I think that's the first time, someone has told me, in the history of the State that has occurred.</p><p>Is that we didn't ... we must ... I'm sure it's ... I can't say it's the same now, but it I ... it may just be.  When the Minister for Finance sets out in budgets in his memorandum in the middle of the year, he's trying to get the process started.  He's trying to get some law and order on the figures because every Department will come back immediately with gigantic figures, so if you didn't start the process by putting some guidelines down what the totality will be, you'll always be beaten up by the various Departments, and that I'm sure has occurred long before my time and probably occurs to this day as well.</p></speech>

That speaks for itself.  But I'm also saying quite openly, anyway, is the Department of Finance would say, "If we don't get this process started and put down some particular figures into these boxes we'll never get any type of order when it comes to the final Estimates."   Because when ... the Estimates demands that come from Departments are usually ginormous and way above our ... the indicative allocations.  And that was the situation every year during my term and pre my time and post my time and the only year where I got something different was in 2003 when I actually went lower than the figure that the Department wanted to.  By the way, I know that in some of the earlier evidence of the committee is that the Department contended after my 2003, 2004 budgets, is that the line Departments were complaining that I had left them at least &euro;2.1 billion short in the moneys that they needed to provide for existing services.  I accept that as well because I went in 2003 and 2004 in very, very heavily on Departments in order to get back to a better baseline for the future.  That's what I did.</p></speech>

We used to have the broad economic policy guidelines which are, kind of, recommendations in a, kind of, a way.  I know things will be slightly changed now in the last two years or so.  You don't ... so, therefore, you don't have what you'd have in a normal, say, country like Ireland, the United Kingdom, America, Germany, whatever, where all those things are melded together.  So, therefore, you have a currency; you have the individual member states running their own economic policies; you have various differences between cultures and everything else; and, yet, you're supposed to run a single currency.<br/><br/>Now, before we set up the euro ... for example, there were five criteria that countries or member states were supposed to meet before they joined. One was inflation; one was the 3% debt - the 3% debt every year; one was the total debt ratio which meant that every country was supposed to have a debt-to-GDP ratio of less than 60%.  There were two others as well about that you had to ...  your currency was supposed to have stayed within a band, I think, not greater than 2.25% of the central ... and I forget the last one.  Incidentally, Ireland was one of the few countries to meet all of those criteria.  Sorry, inflation was the last one.  In the inflation one ... that you weren't supposed to be, I think, more than 2%, or less than 2%, outside the average of the three lowest countries and, actually, Ireland was one of the three lowest countries.  Ireland had a debt ratio less than 60%.  <br/><br/>Now, some countries that were allowed to join the euro, like a founding member state of the European Union like Italy, had a debt ratio of 100% where all ... the country where all the struck ... all the bodies are, Belgium, has a debt ratio of over 100 % as well, so that was a long way from 60%, but, lo and behold, <i>mirabile dictu, </i>the 60% absolute rule that the German Government had insisted upon in negotiations then came to be interpreted as &quot;approaching 60%&quot;.  So, therefore, the Italian Government was approaching 60% because I think the ratio came from 114% one year to 110% and the Belgian Government did something similar.</p></speech>

But the Irish Government and the Irish political parties, after all considerations of everything, and we were a very small player picking up less than about 2% of the EU's GDP at the time, we decided, in our long-term best interests, it was better to be in.  And the most worrying factor for us at the time was not actually all those other areas because we more or less thought we were doing very well in those other criteria, but our main worry at the time, both my party, the Fine Gael party and the Labour Party, we were going to join knowing that the United Kingdom was staying out.  So, therefore, from day one the structures were a bit less ... sorry, the foundations were less than certain.</p></speech>

From 1997 on, exports were decreasing, so as a proportion of national income, it was transaction based taxes that were beginning to drive things.

I would have debated with myself and with others the whole interest ... the tool of interest rate that a central bank has, and we're going to give that away.  But I concluded, and I think rightly, that for a small country like Ireland, although we had the interest rate tool available to us since the foundation of the State, what difference ... what great thing did it do for us?</p><p>Effectively, for all that period of time, we followed... went along in the ... London.  And up until 1979 or so we had a one-for-one exchange rate but, generally then, even in the interest rates after that, we more or less followed after London.  So we ... so although we had the interest rate tool available to us for all these years, it didn't seem to have done an awful lot to grow the Irish economy, give or take, say. the glorious period in the '60s.  So, therefore, I, kind of ... I came to the view that losing the interest rate tool at the time was not the worst thing that could happen.  Subsequently, I would look back on, say, what happened from, say, 2003 to 2008 and I would've said "Well, if we had the interest rate tool then, that it might have made a whole big difference."  But like that's ... now I'm going back and I must chastise myself because I'm now doing Mr. Hindsight as well, the same as the rest of the country.</p></speech>

But they're not ... they're not against one another, the fact that a politician wants to be re-elected and doing the right thing.  Like, I gave various examples earlier of things that we had done which couldn't have had the political impact in the short term of a positive nature.  So, I think, look, a democracy such as Ireland is less, well, nearly 100 years now, I'm sure things ... the way we do things now are different to the way of doing 60 years ago and hopefully, we learn all the time and do things somewhat differently and improve things.  I think that's what we're all about.  We might disagree about how doing it, we certainly disagree on economic philosophies ... the way of doing things.  I don't have any difficulty with people that stand up for a strong view, such as Deputy Higgins, and I have said that publicly when I was a Member of D&aacute;il Eireann.  I would like to think the same right exists for people like me to have strong views, not of the same type.</p></speech>

And I'm going to wrap up and then invite both Deputy Doherty and Deputy Murphy to come in and it's on that very point, as to what the essence of a liberal is, and on your earlier engagement with Deputy Higgins about the free market and so forth is where I maybe would like to begin the wrap-up.  I maybe put the question to you, Mr. McCreevy, and it comes back to my earlier engagement with you today that was demonstrating the residential house prices and the period in which the Bacon report was most active and how that was actually playing out in the market.  So, could I maybe begin by putting a question to you: is the property market entirely free and neutral, given that when tax interventions take place, they do have an impact in the market in one capacity or another?</p></speech>

I refer to what Deputy Noonan said back many years ago when I brought in that, there'll be an unintended consequences and there can be.  So ... by the way, not just he said that, I said it subsequently some years later during the D&aacute;il debates.  There can be ... yes, you have an effect but you can have unintended effects also.</p></speech>

You must remember, we increased stamp duty dramatically and left it at zero, it went to zero for the first-time buyer and we increased stamp duty enormously, up to 9%, which is a fair old hike, anyway, and it had damn all effect on the housing market or very little.</p></speech>

We tried to penalise, if that's the appropriate phrase I should use, the investors and benefit, by having lower rates of stamp duty, for the first-time buyer.  That's what we attempted to do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1739" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Charlie McCreevy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#FFFF01800"><p>Well, that's the same argument, Deputy, that you can make and justifiably so, with grants.  Like, when you give grants to new houses or things like that over the years, in fact, it's built in, or new grants for anything in areas of construction, it's built in then to the price, it's taken up by the person that's doing the job or building the house or selling the house.  There's always that particular difficulty.</p><p>What we tried to do with stamp duty and I made so many changes that we made ... I made quite a simple system that I started off with into a very complicated one and my goal all the time in all the years of taxation were to make things simple because I think that's the best way to get the maximum amount of money from any area.  You'd have a very simple system and a very transparent one.  But what happened in the stamp duty area to do with price we were trying give a benefit and trying to skew the market in favour of the first-time buyer.  It just didn't work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-01a.1741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070100002#GGGG00200"><p>So that comes back to whether it was the first-time buyer or whether it was people trying to buy a home and trading up and trading down or whatever.  And if I can bring up the next slide there.  What we see in that slide is the ratio of new house prices to the average industrial wage and the ratio of average second hand prices to the average industrial wage.  And we see it, they are the kind of more or less ... you can nearly put one on top of the other for both markets.  In 1996, the purchasing range is in and around just over four times the national industrial wage for somebody trying to buy a home which would be in the Central Bank's sort of ratio levels, and likewise for the new market, it is just over 4%.  And going into 2007, we are seeing ratios of 12 times or so the national industrial wage in trying to buy the average sort of house.  In that regard, Mr. McCreevy, in reviewing your tenure as Minister for Finance and the property-related tax measures that you implemented or increased or elongated or put off by means of deferral, do you think that these actions benefitted one sector of society over the other and, if one, which?</p></speech>

But there are other ratios that you can use as well, such as affordability.  People had more money in their pockets due to less taxation, greater money, etc.  So there are other ways of measuring that.  But at the end of the day, Chair, whether we like it or we certainly ... and maybe we don't, it is the market that spoke.  The price of houses went up, people were prepared to buy them at the prices they went up to.  Banks were prepared to lend at ratios which turned out to be, later on, weren't so good for the banks either.  So therefore, the ... now there are various-----</p></speech>

The market spoke and from our earlier questioning, we know that the market is not neutral, that the market takes direction from the tax incentives that put in place.  The market was speaking loud and clear that affordability levels were running beyond the capacity of people in this country.  To be able to buy a home in ratios of four to five and you are dead right, Mr. McCreevy whenever we talk about affordability as well.  Because what we have found since the crash, it's not actually people losing their jobs, has been the main difficulty in terms of them servicing their mortgages and the Keane report is very explicit in this, it has been their affordability to be able to service their mortgage.  So I put the question to you again, do you think your actions as Minister for Finance either impacted on one section of society more than the other, favoured one side of society over the other or had legacy issues that related in terms of hardship or benefit to one side?</p></speech>

And it certainly allowed people to move up the property ladder if they so wish.  What some of these issues about affordability relate to is the ratios which the lending institutions decided to operate.  What the regulator was doing about same.  I read interestingly enough, with the regulator that he seemed to, that he did increase as far as I can make out the ... their issues of risk-related assets of what he was imposing upon the banks.  That didn't seem to have any effect either and I referred to earlier different things that I believe contributed to the whole chasing one another.  But I don't ... I find it hard to believe that things such as that the park ... tax incentivisation ... regarding, say, things like park and ride schemes, small towns renewal, docklands relief, enterprise only, another, contributed say to housing-----</p></speech>

It was in around the period I'm talking about.  The tax relief that was giving to investors of residential property gave a more favourable position to somebody, who in terms of tax relief who was actually trying to buy a home or if they were trying to trade up or whatever.</p><p>So the mortgage for an investor in the buy-to-let sector was cheaper for a mortgage than a person who was trying to buy a home through the tax reliefs.  Now, if somebody was competing in the market to buy a home, and you have a first-time buyer or an existing homeowner trying to trade up, they're competing with somebody who has an additional edge on them because their tax relief is actually greater.</p></speech>

The mortgage was ultimately cheaper for them.</p></speech>

I say that you should go and, say, have an investigation or a study into, say, the housing ...the number of houses that were sold during that particular period on which there was any tax relief given at all.  You must remember, and I should have referred to this earlier, the biggest change in doing the tax relief came about after the initiative I had in the 1998 Finance Bill, when I restricted to a level of &pound;25,000 - &euro;31,000 and something subsequently - as to the amount of money that an investor could cross over from, say, his rental property area and set against his other income as well.  That actually was the biggest disincentive and control of that particular time during tax reliefs.  That's the ... in my first budget I did this.  And it had more of an effect.  So then because not every part of the country had tax ... had section 23 relief for ... you see, section 23 relief would have started in 1981 and we reintroduced it in 1984, so most of the houses built in the boom period, as you call it, didn't have section 23 relief at all.  And I think ... I think if you get an independent study you will find that.</p></speech>

I haven't lived to the ripe old age that I am without meeting a large cross-section of people and some of them happened to be builders and developers.  Now that you mention Sean Dunne, I would have met Sean Dunne in 1983-'84 when, I think, it might have been his first or second venture out on his own.  He's a chartered ... he's a quantity surveyor.  And Mr. Dunne was building, I think, about 40 or 50 houses under some type of licence for the National Building Agency.  It was local authority housing he was building.  So I know Mr. Dunne from about '83-'84 and he comes from Carlow.  So that's the length of time I know Mr. Dunne.  So he's a friend of mine, together with lots and lots of friends of mine.  He ... by the way, the housing ... by the way, he's quite a good builder as well and I regard him as a long-standing friend of mine, and I ... it's common knowledge that I was invited to his wedding.</p></speech>

You've also acknowledged that you, in your 2004 budget, which was delivered in 2003, extended many of the property tax reliefs to 2006.  Can I ask you, in light of that, when you travel around the country, and particularly if you go to the Shannon region, if you go to Leitrim, if you go to Roscommon, what do you think when you see the ghost estates, some of them that were built as a result of the tax policies that you introduced and extended?  What do you feel when you hear, for example, the fact that 40 ghost estates are to be demolished, and the fact that a report in 2006 showed that, during your tenure as Minister for Finance, that individuals who used these schemes were able to reduce their tax bill to zero?  And they were ... those numbers were being increased year on year as a result of your measures?</p></speech>

So, therefore, I'd prefer if that hadn't occurred, naturally, but it's the whole property market collapsed and I, of course, would be very pleased if some local authorities or public bodies would take over some of these estates and make them available to people who cannot own their own homes.  But that's a matter for the Government of the day.</p> <p>  I would prefer ... I would prefer ... the idea of the incentivisation was to allow people to get on and do this particular type of work.  There were lots of jobs and incomes created in that time.  I'm also very pleased to go around the country and notice lots of facilities in the country which local business people and local developers kept ... did for the community, including sponsoring everything from football teams to everything else.  That has been missed as well, and I'm very glad of the economic activity that people in the more rural parts of Ireland, who didn't get the same great benefits, say, from ... say, the Celtic tiger that occurred in Dublin, say, Cork, and say, Galway, that they got some benefit as well.  I'm disappointed that it didn't end up to ... it didn't end up in a way that I would have envisaged, but I think it did generate a considerable amount of economic activity, and there were spin-offs from it at that time.</p></speech>

I said that at the time, so therefore, it was a matter for the developers and construction people, and their financial institutions, listen ... to look at all the aspects, were they going to be able to a) finance on this, could they sell them at an affordable price?

It's all the market's fault, in your view, in that area.  But can I put it to you, and I mentioned this here, a review of the 400 top earners in Ireland during 2002 and 2001 ... and they benefitted ... the review shows that the way that they were able to reduce their effective tax rate was through these schemes.  These schemes that allowed you to have the schemes such as the Shannon Basin property-based capital allowance incentives.  For example, there were six individuals of the top 400 earners that paid no tax in 2002, which was an increase from 2001.  There was 37 of the 400 that paid between 0% and 5% effective tax rate.  That was an increase from 25 the year before.  Do you believe or can you agree that because of some of these schemes and because of how individuals were able to reduce their tax rates, houses were being built to effectively reduce your tax rate, not with the intention that somebody will live in it?  If it worked out that you could you flip them in a couple of years' time, you would benefit on the double.  But these individuals were able to reduce their tax rate, in some cases, to a level of zero, as a result of the policies that you introduced.</p></speech>

As I referred to a few minutes ago about the change I made in the 1998 Finance Bill regarding the capping of the reliefs that could be carried across, that was the total amount you could bring across, which was, I think, the most significant change I made.  Subsequently over the years, my successor made changes regarding some of these reliefs as well and put in an overall threshold for them.  All of that is a job that you review every couple of years to see, "Well, are we getting ... is there too much avoidance in this particular area and should we even it up?"  That's the job of what a Finance Minister does previewing a finance Bill.  The Revenue Commissioners come along and say, "Well, the figures show this and this relief has been overused or this relief has been abused or this particular section of a finance Bill was never intended to give this particular type of relief", and we take anti-avoidance measures all of the time.  That's what I did and my successor did as well.</p></speech>

Just a couple of brief questions if I may and it's just in relation to your approach to budgets, to try and understand the level of analysis done by the Department because throughout various points of your evidence today, it has not been clear what degree of analysis had been done prior to a budget proposal and what degree of analysis had been done after it is implemented.  In your first budget, the budget for 1998, you proposed having the capital gains tax from 40% to 20%.  I'm not interested in the actual proposal itself or its impact but was this proposal out of the blue for your officials or did it come from them?</p></speech>

Just a second now .. if you look at that particular budget, my officials insisted that I would put in a figure that the cost to the Exchequer would be &euro;19 million.  I said in the D&aacute;il during a PQ subsequently - I didn't believe a word of it - but I put it in for good prudence because I knew from my own experience down through the years a rate of 40% capital gains tax - and it was higher in other years - that it was stifling a lot of people doing anything and that if we reduced the rate, a lot of people would sell everything from shares to property, etc., and we'd get a gigantic amount of money.  My officials did not believe that but I did and we did it and I was proved correct.</p></speech>

The Government under Bertie Ahern used to have a number of ... a series of meetings throughout the year, usually ... often on a Saturday, where we would discuss, on Estimates side, as to what we would like to do in terms of public expenditure the following year; everything from social welfare packages etc.  The detail was never decided in those particular meetings.  Then, later on in the process, we, the decision was made that taxation changes will be discussed with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance.  At some of those meetings that we had on the Saturdays, or different other times we had them, Ministers would come forward with various ideas that they might like done in the taxation area and they'd be taken on board and then we'd come ... so, there was an ongoing process, so therefore Brian Cowen is correct.  It's no different than the process I did.</p></speech>

But that has ... that has been the way that it was always done in my time and, might I say, it was done in the previous Government as well.  There may ... on account of the previous Government was a three-party Government, if I remember correctly, I'm sure there had to be more liaison between, say, the three parties with their programme managers in all these areas, but with us it was ourselves and the Progressive Democrats and it was done between the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste on taxation matters.  So, all the Government at various stages was along.  Now, there were people, there were people who perhaps post all of that over the years sought maybe to give the impression that some changes, maybe taxation and some spending measures, were done without other Ministers knowing.  That was not correct.</p></speech>

It would be the sensible and logical thing to do.  Like, if I was ... if I had been there, I probably would have done the same.  So there was ... what the Department and the Minister would want would be some empirical evidence how ... what the effect of all these schemes were, what the effect now is and what we should do and the way you have a book of evidence.  That's why you would consult ... why you generally commission a consultancy review.  We did many of them in our time, in a whole variety of areas.  The Department also conducts its own review in these areas as well, or did.</p></speech>
