The report gives members the details of dossiers progressed and will give them a full sense of the strategic importance of that period.  It was a busy time for the Department, coming at a crucial juncture in two very important EU negotiations.  We had two major priorities, namely, to complete the negotiations on the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, while at the same time, we had the additional responsibility of managing the rotating Presidency of the EU.  Our interaction with key players in advance of the Presidency, through numerous meetings with other member states, relevant Commission officials at political and technical level and contact with the European Parliament, particularly the rapporteurs for the major dossiers, paved the way for excellent working relationships, which I think assisted us in achieving the objectives.</p><p>  At the January Council, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, outlined Ireland&rsquo;s plan for the six-month Presidency in the agriculture and fisheries sectors.  While the key priorities were the reforms of the CAP and of the CFP, the list of legislative dossiers in the agriculture and fisheries sectors covered a broad spectrum of proposals ranging from small and low key to significant and politically challenging.  The joint committee already has the list of files on which agreement was reached and the list of dossiers advanced during the Irish Presidency.  Before turning to the CAP and the CFP, I would like to briefly highlight a few and update members on where these dossiers now stand.</p><p>  We reached first reading agreement on the farm accountancy data network, an instrument for evaluating income and the effects of the CAP on farmers.  We also concluded on the so-called breakfast omnibus package.  This is a series of five directives, which set out specific composition and labelling rules for various products associated with breakfast foods.  First reading agreement was also reached on the pet passport regulation, which makes it easier for EU citizens to take their pets into other EU member states and on the directive on the health requirements governing intra-Union trade in and imports into the EU, of dogs, cats and ferrets.  Following on the overall agreement reached in June with the European Commission and the European Parliament on the aromatised wine proposals, the Lithuanian Presidency, which currently is in the chair, obtained political agreement on the text in October and the dossier is now concluded.</p><p>  We had expected publication of the package of five proposals on animal and plant health, seed marketing, official controls and food and feed expenditure early in the Presidency and it had been our intention to expedite examination of these in working groups during the first six months of the year.  It was not until 6 May, however, that the four proposals, known collectively as a new package for healthier animals and plants for a safer food chain, were adopted by the Commission.  The fifth proposal relating to the management of expenditure in these sectors was adopted by the Commission on 7 June.  Department officials attended this joint committee last month to assist in the scrutiny of these proposals.</p><p>  Turning to the major dossiers, political agreement was reached on reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in May and the newly reformed policy comes into force from 1 January 2014.  The reforms agreed will govern the nature and operation of Irish and EU fisheries for the foreseeable future and are designed to usher in a new era of more economically, environmentally and socially sustainable fishing across EU waters.  The new policy will allow for the rebuilding of fish stocks in European waters through long-term management of stocks, reducing and eliminating discards where possible and rebuilding stocks to maximum sustainable yield.  All of these measures hold the potential to substantially increase catches by Irish fishermen in the short and medium term.  The successful conclusion of the basic Common Fisheries Policy regulation, as well as the common organisation of the market in fisheries, involved a huge amount of effort by the Department, involving ten trilogues and numerous technical meetings.  In addition, a significant body of work was carried out on the European Maritime Fisheries Fund by the Irish Presidency, thereby enabling the Lithuanian Presidency to reach a general approach at the July Council.</p><p>  As to the Common Agricultural Policy, political agreement between the three EU institutions was reached on its reform on 26 June under the Irish Presidency.  It was the result of months of intense negotiations, initially within the EU Council of Ministers and subsequently between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.  More than 40 trilogues were held with the Commission and Parliament, with similar numbers of technical meetings, informal contacts and high-level groups.  Ireland represented the Council at all of these meetings.  Leading up to the agreement, in May the Minister, Deputy Coveney, hosted the informal Council of Agriculture Ministers in Dublin Castle.  In a departure from normal practice, given the dossiers on hand &ndash; indeed for the first time ever &ndash; the Council was joined by the European Parliament rapporteurs on each of the four CAP reform dossiers and the co-ordinators from each of the Parliament's political groups.  Normally, the European Parliament attendance at such meetings is limited to the Chair of the Agriculture Committee.  However, this additional attendance allowed all three institutions to have a meaningful exchange of ideas and to better understand each other&rsquo;s positions on some of the key outstanding political issues.</p><p>  The agreement reached in June sets the policy framework for the EU agriculture sector up to 2020 and secures strong and sustainable growth in the agriculture and food sectors into the future.  Elements related to the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, were finalised under the Lithuanian Presidency on 24 September and the reform package was endorsed by the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament on 30 September.  The package was adopted by the Parliament at its plenary session on 20 November and it will be formally adopted by member states at the Agriculture Council on 16 December.  This paves the way for the entry into force of the regulations on 1 January 2014.  However, to allow member states sufficient time to organise implementation of the reform, the majority of the new measures will apply from 2015.  While financial elements, such as the new financial ceilings and share-out of funds between member states, will apply from the beginning of 2014, transitional measures have been put in place for the bridging year of 2014 for the majority of measures.  Initial negotiations on the transitional rules took place in the first six months of the year under the Irish Presidency and the Lithuanian Presidency has now finalised this dossier.</p><p>  I mentioned a moment ago that parts of the CAP agreement hinged on the parallel negotiations taking place on the multi-annual financial framework for the next EU budget from 2014 to 2020 . Although the Heads of State and Government reached agreement on the MFF at the European Council on 7 and 8 February, final endorsement of the MFF elements of the CAP package was only obtained from the European Parliament at the end of September.  Last month, after months of difficult discussions, the European Parliament adopted the MFF for the 2014-20 period, setting the expenditure ceiling for heading 2 at &euro;373 billion.</p> <p>For Ireland the CAP will deliver in excess of &euro;11 billion over the next seven years.</p><p> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, already addressed this committee on a number of occasions regarding the substance of the reform agreement.  Without going in to excessive detail, and as a useful summary, the key aspects are: a greater emphasis on sustainability through Pillar 1 "greening" measures and Pillar 2 environmental measures; generational renewal through supports for young farmers under both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2; a continuing move towards greater market orientation, with support measures available only as a safety net and specific provision for crises; and flexibility for member states to adapt the policy measures under both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 to deal with their own specific competitiveness and sustainability challenges.  One of the key elements that we were negotiating throughout the package was that member states would have flexibility to adapt the policy to their own specific needs.</p><p> One of the most important issues for many member states was the method for distribution of direct payments within member states.  On this issue, we faced proposals from the Commission for mandatory movement to a flat rate of payment per hectare which would potentially have had a negative effect on our capacity for sustainable production.  The agreement that member states have the option to apply the partial convergence model, as suggested initially by Ireland, subject to a minimum payment of 60% of the national or regional average payment per hectare by 2019, is a reasonable and balanced compromise and a good outcome for this country.</p><p> Some of the other important issues of the package from Ireland's perspective are as follows.  On greening, the reform package guarantees a minimum level of environmental protection which, for the first time, is enshrined in direct payments under Pillar 1.  There is a good balance struck between the three institutions on the practical implementation of the three greening criteria of crop diversification, maintenance of permanent grassland and ecological focus areas.</p><p> On young farmers, Ireland was one of the first member states to propose such a payment so as to encourage generational renewal in the agriculture sector.  The agreement to introduce a mandatory top-up to Pillar 1 payments was welcome.</p><p> Under rural development, that is, Pillar 2, a new framework for the drawing up of rural development programmes has been agreed.  Programmes must contribute to the achievement of three headline objectives, fostering the competitiveness of agriculture, sustainable management of natural resources and achieving a balanced territorial development of rural economies and communities.  Also, there was agreement to abolish sugar quotas by 2017 and confirmation that milk quotas will cease in 2015.</p><p> I mentioned earlier that the agreement reached gives a high level of discretion to member states regarding implementation.  Consequently, in July last the Minister initiated a process of consultation with all relevant stakeholders to ascertain their views on the most appropriate application of the Direct Payment Regulation in light of Ireland's unique agricultural profile and circumstances.  The consultation process closed on 20 September with a total of 46 submissions and these are receiving careful consideration.  In addition, modelling of the various scenarios that have arisen is also ongoing within the Department.  This committee has already received a detailed briefing from senior officials on the various options involved and the Minister indicated publicly his hope to be in a position to make decisions across the range of alternatives during the next few weeks.  Incidentally, the committee contributed to the consultation process with a useful document which is on the table as well as part of the issues we are considering.  Drafting of the rural development programme is also already well underway but we will leave that until later.</p><p> That concludes my opening statement and I am happy to take any questions or provide clarification on points that might arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013120300004#D00200"><p>I thank the Secretary General for the outline.</p><p>  We will be discussing Pillar 2 later but in terms of the wide negotiations, why did the Presidency agree to a co-funding rate in Pillar 2 that was as low as 25% and 20% on such a wide range?  Across Europe that had the possibility of reducing funds to farmers dramatically because there is the temptation now for national governments only to co-fund at the minimum rate to draw down all the European funding.  Normally, when one sets a co-funding rate, the idea is to keep the rate up to force the other party to come up with the money.  Does this potentially take a great deal of funding out of European agriculture that would be guaranteed for agriculture if the co-funding rate was higher?</p><p>  There have been ongoing negotiations between the United States and the European Union and I understand that the committee has considered extending a memorandum of understanding between the United States and the European Union that would allow hormone-free beef into Ireland.  I wonder how is this likely to affect us if we allow the big cattle rangers of America into the Irish and European markets.  I understand that more than 90% of our beef is being sold on the European market and there is little in the way of third country exports.  I wonder about the ongoing Mercosur negotiations.  If we open up all our markets to international beef that might not be produced at the same standard as our beef and that might not be subject to all of the animal health regulation of Europe in terms of animal health and the method of farming of which would be totally different, what effect is it likely to have on beef prices here?  We already have an agreement with Canada.</p><p>  What will be the effect of all of these agreements?  One agreement seems to lead to another.  My understanding is that there is domination in Europe by those who want access to all of these markets for industrial goods.  There is, to put it bluntly, a willingness to sell out agriculture by the powerful industrial countries in Europe in order to gain access to the industrial markets of the other countries and that one of the down-sides for Ireland of all of this pressure from Europe could be that agriculture, particularly the beef sector, would be the big loser.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013120300004#D00300"><p>I thank Mr. Moran for his presentation.  He states that a mandatory movement to a flat rate of payment per hectare would potentially have had a negative effect on our capacity for sustainable production.  Was there any consideration given to a flat rate with front-loading up to 32 hectares and if such were the case, what would be the negative effect?</p><p>  Mr. Moran mentioned that the Department received 46 submissions on its deliberations.  Can he give a breakdown on these submissions?  Were they wide-ranging or specifically focused on a direction on which they would like to see the negotiations concluded?</p><p>  Regarding Pillar 2, I do not want to go over the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on something that would be serious for many of us.  On the co-funding or shared funding of Pillar 2 payments, is there any indication of what will be the percentage from the Department?  The farming organisations are adamant on it being 50:50.  There has been speculation on this in newspapers and elsewhere.  Can Mr. Moran give us any indication of the position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013120300004#D00400"><p>I thank Mr. Moran for his presentation.</p><p>  On the Common Fisheries Policy and the conclusion of the new policy, individual transferable quotas are part of the policy at a European level with individual countries having at this stage the right to opt out.  If Ireland decided to opt in, is that an option?  What would it require for that to happen?</p> <p>As I understand it, all that is required is that a Minister decide we are opting in.  Is that the case?</p><p> What is the input of the Department on Ireland's stance on the EU&ndash;US free trade agreement negotiations?  A controversial element of the agreement concerns investor-state dispute-resolution processes and it could have implications for Irish agriculture.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is leading on this but I am wondering about the consultation in which the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is engaged.  Have the witnesses any views on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013120300005#E00200"><p>I thank the officials for attending.  I note the very significant contribution they made during the CAP negotiations.  The period of our of EU Presidency was acclaimed across the board.  Negotiating the CAP in the manner of the Minister and his officials was the key.  I congratulate them on it.  I wish to highlight two phenomena that had the Irish stamp all over them.  One concerned young farmers and the other concerned the abolition of the sugar quota.  Both were very difficult to achieve.  There was much opposition but the achievements will leave a lasting legacy.</p><p>  For young farmers, in particular, it is important that the issues of land inheritance and mobility be borne in mind.  It is important that we support young farmers.  We all accept that the sugar industry is one that we should not have lost.  I hope we will have an opportunity to get back into it.</p><p>  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to certain free trade agreements being negotiated by the European Union and a number of countries.  This week, the Taoiseach and Minister announced a very exciting development that will work wonders for our reputation.  Japan is to import Irish beef for the first time in a number of years.  What effect would a positive conclusion to the EU&ndash;Canada free trade agreement talks have for our agriculture industry?  I am interested in hearing the views of the officials on that.</p><p>  Regarding the US&ndash;EU memorandum of understanding on the exportation of US hormone-free beef to Ireland, it has already been said there are concerns about imported beef that might not meet the very strict Irish standards.  We know the added cost incurred by the Irish producer in meeting our standards.  We need to ensure that there is no trade-off that posits agriculture in general in the European Union, but particularly in Ireland, as a poor relation for industrial reasons.  This ties in with the ongoing EU-Mercosur negotiations on allowing Mercosur countries to gain access to the EU beef market.  Could we have a brief overview on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013120300005#E00300"><p>I compliment the officials on their work.  This is an important area, particularly the method of distribution of direct payments.  This will be the kernel of the discussions from here on in.  The structuring should achieve one of the central tenets of the CAP, namely, to keep the maximum number of farmers on the land.  This will not be achieved without the structure I advocate.  It means large payments to corporations, etc., must go off the agenda.  We must ensure the money is diverted to where it will have the maximum impact.  I hope this is what we have achieved.  For too long, the payments have been lopsided and have not achieved what they should have achieved.</p><p>  In this context, the Department has received some detailed submissions from the representative group of the organic farmers.  They want a review and to increase the scheme payment rates in light of the significant costs associated with organic production in the areas of fish, beef and sheep.  They have a number of structured ways of payment.  They say the target, even that in Harvest 2020, will require a fourfold increase in the area of organic farming land in a short period.  Has cognisance been taken of this?</p><p>  I compliment the Minister in respect of the initiative on young farmers.  It is necessary to ensure dedicated support for young farmers under both pillars.  An instrument that was very useful and important in the past was the installation aid scheme.  Will any such scheme be considered again? The educational structure has been built up and is very well fleshed out but there is no use being under 35 and having all the education in the world if one cannot get out of the traps.  Installation aid was only &euro;10,000, and &euro;7,500 eventually, but it even helped significantly with legal costs and resulted in free flow in that regard.  It is critical that we promote intergenerational transfer and adopt a positive view on partnerships.  We must redefine these concepts and not be afraid to grasp them.</p><p>  A free trade agreement between the European Union and Canada is being negotiated.  Will the officials reflect on this?  What will its impact be on the agriculture industry in Ireland?  It runs in parallel to what other Deputies have said in regard to Mercosur, the issues pertaining to the importation of US hormone-free beef and the lifting of the quotas.  I would be interested in seeing how this will feed into the overall distillation of the effects on Irish agriculture in the longer term.</p></speech>

In so far as I can, I will answer them in the order they were asked.</p><p>  On co-funding, I mentioned that flexibility was one of the key tenets discussed in the negotiations.  The option of providing different rates of co-funding achieves two objectives.  First, it gives member states flexibility to apply and use the second-pillar arrangements, depending on their budgetary circumstances.  Much of the pressure from member states throughout the negotiations was to maximise the EU contribution.  It is not mandatory in that one can spend more than the contribution.  The Commission provided for higher levels of co-funding in areas it wants to promote across the programmes.  The environment is an example.  Member states, but not only Ireland, are afforded the best option.  No decision has yet been taken on the way we will apply the measure.  I will return to this.</p><p>  There have been some very useful comments and concerns expressed about international trade, particularly in beef.  Reference was made to Canada, the United States and Mercosur.  There are others also.  We are concerned.  Throughout the negotiations with the WTO, Canada and Mercosur and the negotiations on the EU-US trade agreement, the Department had concerns about beef.  Our concern is that certain countries would be in a position to target high-value EU markets to which, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v rightly pointed out, the vast bulk of our beef now goes.  Half our beef exports used to go to third countries, with the assistance of export refunds, etc.  Half our exports amount to 90% of the total.</p><p>  The vast bulk of our exports now go to the high-value shelves in the European Union.  A policy that we have succeeded in, along with the industry, Bord Bia and the farmers, has been a shifting to an area where we are more secure.  If that kind of market is targeted, particularly if third countries can send in high-value cuts, it is a source of concern.  What does one do about it?  The first step is to participate actively in the negotiations involving the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Government.  We have been doing that and reflecting the views outlined.  Our approach is to try to ensure that concessions given to other participating countries in a trade agreement cannot simply result in the cherry-picking of high-value cuts.  Our negotiating position has been to separate high-value cuts and low-value cuts, for example.</p> <p>That is to try to get the tonnage reflected in the fall of the animal; in other words, that strip-loins and fillets would not be the dominant tonnage, and that one might have to take forequarters and sides as well.  We have been trying to do that in the various negotiations.  </p><p> The Canadian figure, which turns out as a carcass equivalent of 50,000 tonnes, has to be hormone free.  Standards will be paramount, so if that beef is coming in over time it will have to adhere to EU standards.  Current indications are that in order to produce that much carcase equivalent beef, they would nearly have to produce 600,000 or 700,000 tonnes of beef in order to get that much to the EU with the kind of cuts they send.  In addition, it would take them seven to eight years.  There are risks in that but looking at the up-side, we have positioned our industry within Europe to hold a strong position in higher value markets.  Our focus now is on developing the competitiveness of the sector, as well as knowledge, quality and profitability.  That is what we are doing at the moment and our policy is quite consistent.</p><p> In the last budget we introduced a genomic scheme which is just one example of how we are focusing on the quality of what we produce, as well as the economics to ensure that we remain competitive.  In the context of international trade agreements we can argue for account to be taken of the sensitivity of the beef area.  I have given the committee some ideas of how we can do that.  At the same time, we can focus on making our own beef sector as competitive and secure as possible, which is what we have been doing. </p><p> As negotiations with the United States progress, we will be conscious of the need for that country to take full account of our concerns.  Only recently, the US has taken the first step towards reopening the market for Irish beef, which is a huge step for us.  It will not be a major market in the short term, but it will be a niche market.  Some of our exporters, and An Bord Bia, would concur with the view that there is plenty of space in the US for high quality, grass-fed Irish-style beef, although not in huge numbers.  That is particularly so on the east coast of the United States.  It is a big step and we are already engaged with the US on how to bring the first step forward to opening up the market.  We pressed heavily for that before.</p><p> The reopening of the Japanese market, as announced yesterday, was a major boost to us.  It is not just a boost in terms of volume, because at this stage export volumes are not large.  It is a high status market, however, and a big payer.  The kind of beef they used to take before we were banned was of the offal type.  Japan is a big market for pork and beef throughout the world, and probably one of the biggest importing markets in the world.</p><p> This morning, a team of four or five from the Department left Dublin for Beijing to push for the next step of opening the Chinese market.  In April 2012, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, signed a memorandum of understanding with them to start that market.  One of the key elements in that was to get a working group of technical experts together, although it is not always easy to get that up and running with the Chinese.  We have done that, however, and it is starting tomorrow in Beijing.  We are hopeful that it will come to fruition.</p><p> We are conscious of the threats of international agreements.  There are ways in which we try to address those but we also try to focus successfully on the competitive side, as well as the quality and safety of our own beef. </p><p> I will deal briefly with some of the other points.  Young farmers were a key priority in the negotiations.  We are now at the stage with Pillar 1, as we are with Pillar 2, of putting in the nuts and bolts on how we use it.  Having taken it as a priority in the negotiations, we will be conscious of how young farmer prioritisation will apply throughout our policies.  There are many ways in which it can be done.  We did it a long time ago in the milk sector and we always prioritise young farmers in milk quotas.  We can also do it through the tax regime, which is being done and budget 2014 provides for that.  We can do it in Pillar 1 mandatorily under the single payment, which we negotiated at EU level.  We can also do it under Pillar 2 when designing schemes so that we prioritise the advantage given to young farmers.  We have done that in the past and it will probably be considered when we get down to the nuts and bolts of writing the schemes and putting them in place.  </p><p> The key point is reflected in the committee's own document.  The committee is correct in stating that one will not have a forward-looking profitable sector unless one is rejuvenating it by whatever mechanism is used.</p><p> I have dealt with the percentage of co-funding in so far as I can.  We have not yet formally made any decisions on the flexibility of Pillar 1, although we have received submissions.  The 40 submissions we have got range across the board.  They are from the groups and organisations that we would fully expect to contribute and from others who have much more limited sectoral interests.  We have taken them all and considered them seriously.  </p><p> As regards the payments convergence mechanism, we had serious difficulties from the outset with the European Commission's proposal to move to a flat rate.  It did not suit our policies and we fought tooth and nail from a difficult position when we held the EU Presidency as well.  From the beginning, the Minister and his officials pushed strongly for flexibility in this matter.  What became known as the Irish model was part of the final agreement.  It is in the mix and a betting person would not go far wrong in betting that that is the position we will avail of when we announce our decisions, because that is the one we fought for.  </p></speech>

Organic must be part of the tapestry of a food sector like ours.  It is on our fish side and on the agricultural side also.  Deputy Pringle will be aware more than anybody of where we were concerning the fishery negotiations, including the risk of losing quota.  That was a key element from the outset.

Mr. Moran mentioned the team that has gone out to China, but I would like to hear more about what they are hoping to achieve there.  It sounds as if negotiations with India are more bogged down for all kinds of local reasons.</p> <p>Will the officials update us on the position concerning exports to Vietnam and Thailand?  Will they expand on the <i>ad hoc</i>group on forest financing?</p><p> I know the Department has been heavily involved in CAP reform and trade agreement negotiations?  What progress has been made at European level on the horsemeat scandal, as well as food safety and standards in general?  While it would not be part of the CAP negotiations, were there observations or conversations about the scandal, given that it involved almost every member state?  Were any agreements or promises made in this regard to prevent it happening again in the future?</p></speech>

The trade agreement between the EU and Canada has been hailed in Canada as a win-win for its agriculture sector, particularly for the Canadian beef and pork industry.  The only benefit for the Irish sector, according to the industry, will be in the dairy sector.  There is a challenge to the Irish beef and pork sector from this agreement.  Has the potential impact been quantified by the Department?</p><p>  The Canadian beef industry is based on ranch-style farming and grass feeding.  Canada is the second largest landmass in the world and it has the acreage to produce a lot of grass-fed beef.  This will be a challenge to Irish beef.  What discussions have taken place at European level to safeguard the Irish beef and pork industry against this challenge?  There is also the issue of Canadian and US hormone-free beef production.  How could this become a competitive threat to Irish beef?  Has there been any cost-benefit or strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats analysis, SWOT, on the possibility of cheap, grass-fed and hormone-free Canadian beef imports?</p><p>  I welcome the work done in emerging markets and the news from Japan yesterday lifting the 13-year ban on Irish beef exports.  There is, however, another market closer to home, the British beef market, which was discussed at a recent committee meeting.  What work has been done to develop that market for live Irish beef exports?  The farming organisations are anxious that we do more to open up the live export market there.</p><p>  On the greening issue in CAP reform, how will the Department implement it?  Will it be a flat-rate greening?  Will there be additional incentives to those farmers who work and protect natural heritage areas, NHAs, special areas of conservation, SACs, and special protection areas, SPAs, given the designation of their lands?  Very often, farmers in such areas did not have the opportunity to make the case to be exempted from a designation.  For example, farmers on such lands are so constrained that they cannot cut their grass without the prior approval of the State.  We have to be careful with greening.  If greening measures are to be introduced, those providing the most greening in co-operation with the State have to be taken into account.</p><p>  What is the Department&rsquo;s thinking on a maximum payment under internal convergence?  When does the Department envisage having Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of the CAP finalised and agreed with the European Commission?</p></speech>

I would be interested to hear the Department&rsquo;s view on this because I understand there would be a need for its strong input to protect the right of Irish farmers to use Ireland as their country of origin for their beef.</p><p>  Many Southern cattle go to the North to be processed.  We need to have that open market because it is bad enough not being able to get cattle into the British market.  If we do not take a firm stand on this proposal, cattle slaughtered in the North will become stateless.  They will not be Irish because they were not slaughtered here and they will not be British because they were not bred there.  What is the Department doing about this?  I am of the view that in the long term, taking a chauvinistic Twenty-six Counties view of the world does not serve us well because of trade across the Border.  I am always reminded of Sean Quinn describing Derrylin as some things South of the Border, others North of the Border and everything on the Border.  He knew all about working the Border.</p></speech>

The team that is going to China today is still in the air at this stage and probably looking at films if it is lucky.  The purpose is to get down to the technical negotiations on standards that would apply to the export of beef.  It is a big market for dairy products and baby food and has huge potential.  Beef would be another string to our bow.  I visited there with the Minister in April of this year and I am confident we can succeed because we have a very good reputation in China for food safety.  I might have said this before at the committee, but when we brought President Xi Jinping to a dairy farm in Limerick, I never saw a head of state or government who was so impressed with the specifics of dairy production in Ireland and the control we had over such a large sector.  They had an issue with baby food at the time and a subsequent one.  Given that we supply about 12% to 15% of the world's baby food, there is a huge market there so I would be confident enough.  The only area where I would urge caution in respect of China is the fact that things take a bit longer than one might like.  The Minister visited there in April 2012 and the working group is now going out today.  It is not for want of trying on our part or that of the Minister, the embassy or Bord Bia.</p><p>  Believe it or not, the products that would be a possibility for us in respect of India under a free trade agreement would be dairy and whiskey.  Whiskey would be a large opportunity for us and is one of the most exciting products that comes within our family basket in terms of the world.  The market is growing exponentially and the potential is enormous.  It is origin-rooted in Ireland and there are possibilities in respect of that.</p><p>  Senator O'Keeffe asked about horsemeat, the knock-on effect on food safety and whether this was raised.  The answer is "yes".  It came at us out of left field at the beginning of our Presidency and we had to take it on board.  It was a big issue for us and a big source of concern.  The Senator is right.  It did become a Europe-wide problem.  It was identified here and went on to become a European problem.  It highlights the fact that in any food industry and bio sector as big and as export-dependent as ours, the broad spectrum of issues that can arise in respect of food safety can come out of the blue and one must have one's systems, mechanisms and risk assessment and mitigation in place.  We would not be the only ones in that regard.  Go and ask New Zealand how it feels at the moment about the exposure when it exports the volumes it does.  We took that issue extremely seriously.  It went on to the European stage.  There was a special Council of agricultural Ministers devoted to it, with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the chair.  A number of EU decisions were taken in respect of that and I think the members are aware of them because they have been aired again and again in the D&aacute;il.  It is an indication of the kind of thing that happens when one is involved in the food or agri sector.  It is a bio sector and one never knows what will happen so one maximises controls and trades on one's reputation.  </p><p>  The more we put our heads above the parapet in terms of international trade and the more we rely on the reputation that will sell our product and differentiate it from others, the greater the risk of an issue arising of any type and in any sector.  That is why we must rely heavily on controls, inspections and audit throughout all our sectors.  I cannot emphasise how important they are in any area.</p></speech>

Am I satisfied that they will always be successful?  No - nobody can be.  No major company or country can be.  We have had these discussions with the biggest food company in the world.  We spent a day with Nestl&eacute; and went through these kind of issues with it.  If one asks Nestl&eacute; the same question, that would be the answer one would get.  One can never stop improving or consolidating the controls one has.  It is something that needs to be spread right down to primary production level and right up to the final moment.  The Senator will be aware of that.  I know I am preaching to the converted.</p><p>  In respect of greening, we are not in a position to say precisely how we will apply the flexibilities we did get.  I made a point in respect of convergence that the Irish model was something we fought for.  People can draw conclusions from that.  We also pushed very strongly for the logic of variable greening so that the greening would relate to the payment of the individual.  That is a green point as well an equitable point because if somebody was getting a large payment and the element of that which related to greening was so small that it did not make a difference, it would be an anti-greening mechanism because the incentive is not there.  By making it a percentage of a person's single payment, one is enhancing the greening element of the CAP.</p></speech>

If I gave two people &euro;70 for greening, surely if the incentive for one is such that he does not engage in the process, it will be the same for the other guy?  Why would he bother with greening?  My understanding from a parliamentary question I asked is that greening is a bit more complicated for the arable sector, but peculiarly enough, it does not have particularly high single farm payments.  I got from the breakdown from the Department.  For everybody else, greening is virtually having permanent grass except in designated areas where one might have to comply with all sorts of directions in respect of the designation.  Thus, the person with the least incentive to engage in greening is likely to be the person in the designated area because there will be a huge onus on him or her in respect of stocking numbers, rules and a load of things one can lay down that will not apply to anybody else.  For everybody else, it is just permanent grass.  Is that not correct?  Therefore, the biggest cost and downside of greening relates to designated areas where if one does not engage one will not be caught by all these rules.  According to figures provided to us by the Department, once one gets to &euro;400 per hectare, productivity does not increase if one measures productivity by livestock units per hectare, so the argument does not hold water.</p></speech>

If he is on the lowest possible payment, which is around &euro;150 per hectare, he is very restricted because of stocking rates and rules concerning what he can do.  He has 39 conditions from the National Parks &amp;amp; Wildlife Service to comply with in respect of a SAC or SPA.  Surely that person needs to be compensated for that and the only way to do that is through greening?</p></speech>

The money is in play, depending on the co-funding.  On Pillar 2 if there is an upland environment scheme, an agri-environmental options scheme, AEOS, young farmers package or anything else, it will have to be agreed how such schemes will be structured.  The money is still in play.  There is &euro;313 million from Pillar 2 that still has to be negotiated.  The whole package has to be approved with a series of schemes proposed for Pillar 2 that have to be agreed.  There can be a robust political debate on that, if it is not up to everybody's satisfaction, which will be 47% or more.  If that is not in place, there will be an argument about that internally, but that does not affect Europe's approval of the CAP.  Is that correct?

We have flexibility points in Pillar 1 and would have to let the Commission know what we are doing.  However, there is no programme under Pillar 1 to be agreed with the Commission.  It applies directly.  Pillar 2 is a programme which is an amalgam of schemes which must fit into a framework set out in the rural development regulations.  The first step is to get the money and co-funding right and see what is what and what is possible.  Next we must send the draft report with the outline of the schemes to Brussels and start negotiating.  From our experience with the rural development programmes, the Commission will have views on every one of those schemes and the balance between them.  Even though there are different levels of co-funding between them, they will sit down with us and there will be robust discussions with the Commission.  There will be lots of time along that journey.  This committee made a very valuable contribution to the Pillar 1 discussions.  It can make known its views on the nuts and bolts and the operation of the schemes.</p></speech>

There is a commercial issue with cattle being slaughtered in the Republic and then going off to Britain and whether commercially people want to take them as such or take in live exports in the UK and slaughter them in the UK.  That is really a matter for the commercial operators in the sector.  I know there are some tensions over that and I can understand why.</p><p>  On the origins of meat, proposals are going through at the moment to extend the beef-origin issues into other meats.  The origin of beef and other meats is, if one likes, a departure from the normal Single Market arrangements because if standards are the same throughout the EU, then, as with other products, the origin does not really matter.  However, when a product can be reared in one place, finished or fattened in another and slaughtered somewhere else, it gets complicated.  What is unusual is that sometimes the origin issue for meat depends more on where it is being sold than where it was produced.  It might suit some people to have meat described as Irish, British, Northern Ireland or whatever.  It is possible to shine the light in two directions: where it is being sold, which might determine one approach; and where it originates.</p><p>  From our point of view, origin always relates to the standards, guarantees, safety and quality that apply under the jurisdiction we are in.  If we can stand over the product, then there is product.  I agree completely that it is not possible to stop borders either within or outside.  Product moves; milk, meat and live animals all move.  It is a complicated area and it has also regard to where the product is being sold.</p><p>  I take the point on the forestry.  I have just read the paragraph.

I think there is no prospect of offers being exchanged this year.  So the conclusions of those negotiations will be a long way off.  The same point I made earlier applies.  Our interest in those negotiations was to ensure that the sensitivities of our concerns over beef in the European market were fully taken into account at EU level.  We must not forget that the EU is the negotiator on this.  It has the mandate and the legal competence.  I believe we have made our points very clear in that context.  I do not expect that in the near timeframe.</p></speech>

He is here to discuss how the ConnectIreland initiative has been operating since its establishment.  He is joined by Mr. Michael McLoughlin.  I need to go through some formalities before we begin.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask Mr. Clune to make a presentation to the committee on how ConnectIreland attracts companies to locate in Ireland and on related issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terry Clune" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013120300003#C00300"><p>I was invited to attend the Global Irish Forum in 2011.  Many people in the audience, including people from overseas with Irish connections, were looking to do something to support the Irish economy.  I was involved in proposing an idea to the Government on foot of that.  The idea developed to become the Succeed in Ireland initiative, which was rolled out a few months later.  ConnectIreland is doing something simple but powerful.  We ask people to use their connections abroad to help us find companies that might expand to Ireland.  Everybody here has family members, friends or business contacts abroad.  They might hear about a company that is expanding into Europe.  When companies expand into Europe, they typically go Germany, France or England.  They do not necessarily consider Ireland.  If we have connections in a company who can tell us when it is expanding, we can use that lead.  In such circumstances, ConnectIreland works with IDA Ireland to approach the company and explain the many advantages of locating in Ireland.  That is the simple premise.</p><p>  As part of the Succeed in Ireland initiative, the person who introduces us to the lead, or their preferred charity or club, is offered a Government reward of &euro;1,500 per job that is created by the company in question.  The programme was launched last year and will have been in operation for two years in March of next year.  We have already announced many success stories involving jobs that have been created in Ireland through this programme.  The person on the cover of the document that I sent to the joint committee as an example is the CEO of a Michigan-based company, Magni Group.  He was looking to set up a company in the Czech Republic.  He was flying there via Dublin because he had heard that Ireland is a great place to play some golf.  He flew into Dublin Airport and got a driver to bring him to the Heritage golf club in County Laois.  He played some rounds of golf with his colleague.  When they were having their dinner and a few drinks in the bar afterwards, they met a local businessman from Portarlington - Mr. Kieran Leavy, who is shown on page 2 of the document - who knew about ConnectIreland through his local GAA club.</p><p>  After Mr. Leavy spoke to the CEO about the golf, he asked him what he did for a living.  The CEO mentioned that he intended to travel to the Czech Republic the following day to try to set up an office or a factory there.  Mr. Leavy asked him whether he had thought about doing the business in question in Ireland and said he knew someone who would love to speak to him.  On foot of those two sentences, he put the CEO in contact with ConnectIreland.  We met him when he returned from the Czech Republic a few days later to give him the pitch on Ireland.  Four or five months later - two months ago - the company announced that its new factory will be located in Portarlington rather than in Prague.  Some &euro;15 million is being spent at present on the construction of the factory, which will create 50 jobs.  It will take a while for the factory to be finished.  This is a great example of how simple this initiative is.  Fifty jobs are coming to Ireland thanks to Mr. Leavy.  If we had several hundred or a few thousand people like him, we could create thousands of new jobs in this country.  That is essentially what the programme is about.  It is working.</p><p>  We have rolled out key partnerships with certain bodies, such as the GAA.  We have piloted this scheme with various GAA clubs.  As members may be aware, one of the big challenges being faced by the GAA is that its players are emigrating.  It is difficult to find funding for clubs.  When the GAA presented this initiative to its board last year, the logical simplicity of it was apparent to all concerned.  We are now piloting it with certain clubs, which are simply asking their members to spread our message of keeping one's eyes and ears open for Ireland.</p> <p>One may have a daughter in Florida who is working for a small medical device company.  That company, ultimately, will plan to set up an operation somewhere in Europe.  Ireland is a great location for it but the CEO of the company may not know that.  The person's daughter or son or brother or friend working in the company can be a great conduit to help us find companies that are expanding.  We all know that Ireland is a fantastic location for business.  IDA Ireland has done a tremendous job during the past 40 years at selling Ireland to major multinationals and attracting thousands of jobs as a result.  There are thousands of smaller, medium-sized companies who do not yet know the advantages of Ireland.  By harnessing our diaspora, our connections around the world and incentivising them through a reward we can build and create many more new jobs for Ireland and build on the great work IDA Ireland has done.  That is what ConnectIreland is doing.</p><p> The funding model is unusual.  In my day job I run a financial service company called Tax Back Group.  In Ireland we have 160 people, worldwide we have 1,000 people and we have locations in 22 countries.  I proposed at the outset that given the funding model I fund this project in total.  We have a team of 26 people.  As the company sets up in Ireland and as jobs are created, we get paid by the State.  It is a no foal no fee model which is new.  It has never been done previously by any country that we have seen.  We are already off to what we think is a good start.  Our target over a five-year period is 5,000 jobs.  We anticipate that by March we will have 1,000 jobs.  In regard to the companies we are helping to attract, the connectors, people like Kieran Leavy, can let us know about the companies and can be very influential in bringing the jobs not only to Ireland, but to the regions.  Recently, we had a company announced in Kells, County Meath, where the connector got to know the company quite well and explained the advantages of Ireland, but also explained the many advantages of Kells.  As a result it has announced 70 jobs in Kells, County Meath, and a new factory there.  </p><p> Some time ago, when giving a talk in Seattle, an individual in the audience had a connection to Ireland.  We asked the audience what connections they had to companies and this individual said he did not know any businesses but we suggested that he ask his neighbours.  His next door neighbour in Seattle, who was not Irish, knew of a company that was expanding.  It was originally seeking to set up in Holland.  He told us about the lead and we gave the pitch for Ireland and it set up five weeks ago in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, with 55 jobs.  That is the simplicity of the model and it is working.  </p><p> We are approaching the end of year two.  It takes a while to get started from absolutely zero, with nothing in one's Excel spreadsheet, and no names of companies to get the message out there.  Committee members may have seen us at Dublin Airport where we have a stand and explain to people as they are leaving the simplicity of the initiative and how they can benefit their charity or themselves through their reward and also their country through the jobs that come.  We are extending the initiative to universities.  The other document I gave to the committee is on an alliance with Notre Dame University.  It has a huge network of business people, past pupils, all around the US who can help us find companies that are expanding.  This is a new channel for IDA Ireland and a new channel for job creation in Ireland.  We are only in the early stages but I look forward to explaining more as time progresses.</p></speech>

To date, just under 1,500 people have registered with us to be the eyes and ears for Ireland and they are introducing companies on a daily basis.  The process is to work in conjunction with IDA Ireland.  We submit those companies' names to IDA Ireland to ensure it is not in pre-existing dialogue with those companies.  If not, we go back to the connector and ask him or her to give us an introduction.  It is incremental to what is already being done in the system.  Any companies we are dealing with are new from a State perspective.</p><p>  An issue of note in terms of approvals is that we have had another approval at IDA Ireland.  All our business cases go to the management investment committee of IDA Ireland at a minimum and, in some cases, higher if grant aid is involved.  We had another approval yesterday for a further 20 jobs.  We are at the stage where we have 318 jobs, 266 of which are in non-Dublin locations.  We have been able to do a drive from a regional perspective working with the connectors, as Mr. Terry Clune mentioned, such as Kieran Leavy or Hugh Morris, locally in helping sell their location.  Based on personal connections, the early stages of influence can be very important.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Clune a few weeks ago.  The model is phenomenal.  So many people say they will do something but the witnesses did it and are still doing it and putting their own resources into it.  During the summer I came across Mr. Tom Dowling, a member of the board of ConnectIreland, who was adjudicating the Pride of Place competition.  He told me about this project and said they should link up so that the pride of place in one's country, where one is willing to put one's own buck where one's mouth is, gets behind this really successful initiative.  The initiative has absolute substance behind it in terms of progress.  I say, well done and continue the progress.  What can we do in terms of promoting the scheme or spreading the gospel?</p></speech>

We ask people to ask their friends if they know of any companies that are expanding.  It is simple; that is it.  With Mr. Tom Dowling we are planning a launch for next year.  In addition to helping attract jobs, the reward can benefit communities, community groups or charities.  For example, in the Kieran Leavy case, he can help create jobs for Portarlington but also in his case an element of his reward will be given by him to his local GAA club.  With one piece of information he can help a community group from a funding point of view and create jobs.  In the new year we are planning to develop a significant roll-out of our initiative to community groups right around the country.  For Deputies who are interested in supporting the initiative, they can play a part in helping to assemble those community groups and to spread the message.  That would be tremendous for us.</p></speech>

I have been involved in the tourism business for some time to the extent that it is interesting how individuals can do the same for tourism.  What the witnesses are doing is admirable.  Some ten or 15 years ago I was bringing a congress from around the world to Dublin.  Some came a few months early before they had made a decision.  They asked the restaurant to get them a taxi to take them back to the hotel but they were told they could have to wait two or three hours for a taxi.  In those days there were two or three hour queues galore.  What are the hurdles we can do something about overcoming?  We overcame that taxi hurdle.  On that occasion we nearly lost that congress of 1,500 people coming to five star hotels.  They almost did not come because the two bosses who were going to make the decision said they would not go to a city where one cannot even get a taxi at night.  I was thinking particularly of the potential ESB strike on 16 December.  Are there hurdles and things that could go wrong, where somebody could say he was thinking of coming to Ireland until something or other happened and then decided to go to the Czech Republic, Holland or elsewhere?  Are there steps that we in the Oireachtas can take to ensure that people who are tempted to come to Ireland will definitely come?</p> <p>Are there hurdles we are not thinking of and about which we have not done anything?  I think particularly of an ESB strike or a taxi difficulty, which would have deterred investors in the past.  If I was planning to come to Ireland to open a factory and there was an ESB strike, I would question whether I should come.  I have a concern with regard to how we handle the various hurdles that could stop people from coming here.</p><p> I found the witnesses stories very interesting.  I read their documentation and about the awards for people who bring jobs here.  In some cases people do not claim the award, but others do.  The award system is certainly an incentive that encourages people to bring in jobs.  However, I am more interested in what we can do to remove the hurdles.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Terry Clune" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013120300005#E00200"><p>We are carrying out a pilot programme in Dublin Airport with Dublin taxi drivers, because for people coming into the country taxi drivers are probably the most influential people they meet during their first hour or half hour in the country.  In our pilot we are developing a simple slip of paper for taxi drivers informing them of some of the simple, positive features about Ireland.  Until I became involved in this area, I was not aware that over the past five years Ireland was twice voted the friendliest country in the world by Lonely Planet.  That is a positive point we should be aware of as a people, because we have gone through challenging times over recent years.</p><p>  There are many positive points and reasons that companies choose to locate in Ireland and we should all become familiar with these.  This would also help improve our self confidence as a country.  Developing a simple top ten list of what is so good about our country would be a great starting point.  If we all carried that list in our wallets and had simple positive messages to give to visitors, whether family or business friends or customers, that would greatly improve our ability to promote our country.  We could provide the simple facts on why some of the big foreign companies are choosing Ireland.  There are financial reasons for choosing Ireland, but there are also many other positive reasons. </p><p>  When my business expanded internationally, where we expanded was very much to do with the encounter one had with the people of the country.  This is a significant factor in deciding whether to choose a location.  Making everyone aware of the positives about Ireland would be a good first step.</p></speech>

In that regard, what about the hotels in the immediate vicinity of the airport?  I assume people who are fairly high up in businesses often stay in these hotels before they leave Ireland.  Is there any initiative in that regard or is there space for these hotels to be incorporated in the plans?</p></speech>

We propose the document we have supplied to the committee would be available in all the bedrooms of the hotels to deliver the simple positive message about Ireland and point out what Ireland is doing to fight back in terms of economic recovery.  We have also met with people from the top golf clubs in the country with regard to how to inform golfers and caddies about this positive message.  Caddies are there with the big businessmen who come here to play golf and they spend four or five hours with these people.  After a while they get bored talking about golf and talk about business and other stuff.  If the caddies are informed on our ideas, they are the perfect conduit to inform the golfers of X, Y or Z about Ireland and to suggest that if they are looking to set up a European operation, they could talk to this or that person.  This is the simple model and if we can extend it to this and other areas, it will be very effective.</p></speech>

The more companies we can identify, the greater our success will be with this programme.  We find people are very pleasantly surprised by what Ireland has to offer.  They are not always aware of some of the advantages and benefits.  Once we are engaged and have the opportunity to talk about the availability of our young, educated workforce and can show them the demographics in terms of the percentage of the population under a certain age - their future workforce - the availability of facilities, the infrastructure etc., we find we get a very positive response.</p><p>  Our biggest challenge now is to get the word out to more people and companies so that we have an opportunity to pitch to those companies.  We are quite confident that once we engage with them, we will succeed.  Our success rate is very good.  In one of the brochures Mr. Clune has passed around, Ted Berry is quoted on the announcement made for the operation in Portarlington.  His first comment related to the welcome he received in Ireland and to how he was led to understand that people wanted the jobs here.  This was very important.  He was well down the road towards investing in the Czech Republic and had identified a site there and was engaged there, but from the outset he was made feel that we wanted his company and jobs in Ireland.  His opening comment on the day of the announcement was about the warm feeling he got, not just from ConnectIreland or the IDA, but from dealing with people locally in regard to the availability of land, from working with recruiters, accountants and legal people.  They all wanted to sell Ireland because they felt they had something to play for in getting these people to come to Ireland.  Their engagement was key and remains a crucial role.  It is something at which Ireland Inc is very good.</p><p>  Our biggest challenge is to identify more companies.  We would love to be back here next year saying that as a result of this meeting, we have identified 100 or 200 more companies due to the committee helping us spread the word.</p></speech>

I welcome their enthusiasm and positivity for what they do and the potential ConnectIreland has in terms of supporting the creation of jobs.</p><p>  The target of 5,000 jobs over five years is ambitious, but ConnectIreland would argue it is realistic and deliverable.  I welcome every job that has been created through the connections made through its work.  I understand that the first announcement from ConnectIreland indicated that seven projects had been approved, with the potential to create 215 jobs.  The second announcement indicated there were four investments and 83 jobs in Cork and Dublin.  How many of these investments and jobs have materialised?  How many companies are <i>in situ?   </i></p><p>  What is the target for this year?  Does ConnectIreland have annual or quarterly targets?  A general target over five years is great, but it was suggested we would have 1,000 jobs by March next year.  How many jobs have been created up to now?  What is coming down the tracks to make up the 1,000 it is hoped will be created by March?  Is ConnectIreland making a profit?  Please do not take this question as a negative, but why do we need an organisation like ConnectIreland?  Is this not the type of work Enterprise Ireland or the IDA should be doing?  Can ConnectIreland justify what it does and explain how what it does is different to what the IDA or Enterprise Ireland should be or are doing anyway?  What extra does ConnectIreland bring to the table that they do not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.118" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael McLoughlin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013120300005#E00700"><p>I will deal with the last point first.  For many years, the IDA has successfully targeted international companies and brought them into Ireland and helped them establish operations here.  The idea of our programme is to leverage off the expertise and capabilities that exist in the IDA and to try to bring new incremental opportunities through.  As Mr. Clune mentioned earlier, there are many leading companies in the world, a number of which have substantial operations here.  However, there are many thousands of SMEs and emerging sector companies and emerging country companies coming up.</p><p>  To be fair to the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, they cannot be everywhere, but Irish people are inclined to turn up everywhere, from Peru to China, to Australia, to Russia and further.  What we are trying to do is to leverage off who these people are, where they are and their affection towards Ireland.</p> <p>As they come across opportunities relating to companies that are growing, they plant the idea that as they come to Europe or expand in Europe, they could do so in Ireland.  Our programme is over and above what IDA Ireland does.  IDA Ireland's target and approach is, by and large, direct to companies.  We have been recognised by the <i>fDi Intelligence</i>magazine, which is owned by the FT Group.  We were recognised at the global IPA innovation awards as identifying and creating a new channel into markets.  What we have done, potentially, is create a new channel for the State in the world of foreign direct investment and that has been recognised now in the industry.  That is where it sits.</p><p> Is it something that would have been done naturally in IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland?  I am unsure, given the nature of the model.  We have a strong customer interaction.  It is almost the retail end, which is the connector side.  It is probably not something those organisations would have been as <i>au fait</i>with in that sense.  It was a totally new programme.  It has never been done before not only in Ireland but anywhere on the globe.  There was a strong element of experimentation, especially during the first year.  I hope that addresses that issue.</p><p> &quot;No&quot; is the straight answer to the question on profitability.  We are pre-revenue at the moment.  We receive a payment up to two years after what are deemed to be sustainable jobs have been created.  The payment comes from the State through IDA Ireland to ConnectIreland.  It is based on employment that is in place 12 months and 24 months after the job has been created.  From that perspective, we are not even two years in operation.  The first year of operations was based on trying to identify connectors who can host introductions to companies.  That is what we have stuck to and, I believe, that is what we have done successfully.  This year we have been looking at more conversions.</p><p> We have approved 12 companies to date this year.  Reference was made to some that were announced.  Not every company has made an announcement.  It is the company's right not to make an announcement and we have to honour that process.  We can inform the committee of the number of overall jobs approved but we cannot say who they are.  From a profitability perspective, we are pre-revenue and we are a long way off.  To be fair to Mr. Clune, who is behind this financially, this is about giving back to Ireland as well.  This is not a traditional business model by any means.</p><p> The final issue is related and is based on employment created.  Our companies were all included in most recent Forf&aacute;s employment survey.  They have put in returns.  We expect approximately 35% to 40% of the jobs announced are in place at the moment.  There are other projects, including The Magni Group, which currently has indirect employment.  The opening date for the Magni facility in Portarlington, with 50 people on board, is September next year.  It is going through an approval and build process.  That operation will be in place.  The group has a capital investment of &euro;15 million.  There are other companies such as Mafic going through.  That company now has in excess of 30 employees.  Flagship Management has five people in Kinvara, County Galway.  There are different companies at different stages, depending on when they were announced.  The company that was approved this week will have eight people by the end of the year and is in the process of making the offers.  Different companies are at different stages.</p><p> Reference was made, rightly, to our target, which is 5,000 jobs over a five-year period.  Within that, our target is to have 1,000 jobs approved and as many as possible in place by March next year.  We are currently working with several projects in terms of conversions.  They range from eight jobs upwards.  The majority of the projects are in the region of 20 to 30 jobs but we have some projects in excess of 100.  The bigger projects will help us get to the larger number of 1,000.</p></speech>

Since then, some of our companies would have taken on employees but that will be the figure announced from a State perspective and we have to adhere to that figure.</p></speech>

I do not really have any questions, save to say it is a fantastic idea.  I congratulate the witnesses.  I wish we had more people like them in Ireland.  The positive message that comes from this is fantastic.  It is a great idea to work with some of the communities.  We have serious issues in Ireland with philanthropy, where it is going and where new funding will come from.  Communities working in this way with ConnectIreland is a good idea.</p><p>  We are involved with the Cork Foundation and we go back and forth to America several times a year.  We meet American business people.  We are certainly keen to work with ConnectIreland.  I suggest American Ireland Fund could be an organisation of benefit to ConnectIreland.  Representatives from the fund are always meeting people and they have a huge database.  If ConnectIreland has not done so I would be pleased to make an introduction.  Well done to them.</p></speech>

My comments are similar to those of Deputy Collins.  Well done to ConnectIreland.  It is a great idea.  The fact that ConnectIreland developed it at the forum was also great.  Rather than simply put a hand up and throw out an idea, the witnesses followed through.  That is important because often these fora can produce great ideas but it is left to the initiators to carry them out.  Well done to them.</p><p>  I particularly like the idea of using networking through the GAA, taxis, hotels and caddies.  These areas are under the radar and would not be on the desk of IDA Ireland.  ConnectIreland is doing the work in conjunction with IDA Ireland.  It is a simple idea but one that has proven to be very effective among others.  I congratulate ConnectIreland.</p><p>  I hope that by appearing today Mr. Clune and Mr. McLoughlin will trigger us to spread the word.  This Christmas I have one member of my family coming home from the United States and another from the United Kingdom.  Christmas time is probably an opportunity to get the message out.  The Irish communities tend to communicate well when they are abroad.  I hope that by being here today ConnectIreland will give it another kick-start.  I imagine the challenge is to get the word and the message out.  We would be pleased to do whatever we can to help.</p></speech>

Like my colleagues, I commend, compliment and congratulate the representatives from ConnectIreland.  I hope that the organisation goes from strength to strength.  We will do our best to spread the message to try to promote Ireland.</p><p>  Reference was made to the welcome and appreciation shown in certain communities, especially communities that do not have the level of investment of a capital city such as Dublin.  That is not to suggest that the people there are not appreciative, but there is probably a higher level of appreciation in certain parts of the country for new jobs.  Even a relatively small number of new jobs would be very welcome in many communities.  I commend the representatives from ConnectIreland on the work they are doing.</p></speech>

A colleague, Hugh, introduced a company, Mafic.  He had been registered with us for several months.  He had heard about the programme and liked it.  Through an encounter he had subsequently, he suggested the company name and then we were in a position, after we received approval from IDA Ireland to the effect that it was not in dialogue with that company, to proceed.  Then we entered into a dialogue with the company.  Thankfully, we have been successful in getting the company over the line and it is currently taking on several good employees.</p></speech>

I have been asked by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, to serve as chairman of Science Foundation Ireland, a role in which I would be honoured to serve.  In the first instance, I will provide a brief overview of my business background, share my initial impressions of Science Foundation Ireland and outline my personal objectives in the first three months of my term.  Apropos the above I will welcome any question members may wish to ask.</p><p>  My career began many years ago with the Alliance and Dublin Consumers Gas Company.  Some of those present will not remember the era of the marriage bar during which I was required to leave my job when I got married in 1970.  When my daughter, Lisa, was two years old and my son, John, six weeks old, I discovered that I had to assume the role of family breadwinner.  I moved with the family to London, as I had no option but to emigrate to find employment to support them.</p><p>  My career in the IT industry started with Wordplex in London.  The IT industry was in its infancy when I found employment with a start-up company, Wordplex Information Systems, a word processing company.  No one here will remember that before word processing it was a world of typewriters. <font color="#808000"> </font>After some years working in London, the company was developed into a PLC and I returned to Ireland as managing director of Wordplex Ireland.  In 1990 I was approached by Microsoft to set up Microsoft Ireland.  Microsoft was an unknown name at the time and had two customers in Ireland.  As a result, on Bill Gate&rsquo;s first visit to Ireland I had to go out into the highways and byways to find an audience to whom he could present the company&rsquo;s vision and strategy.  The rest is history.  In 1996 I was most fortunate to be presented by Bill Gates with the chairman&rsquo;s award for excellence as top contributor in Europe.  Having built the business and the brand successfully in Ireland, I retired from Microsoft in 2001.  I served on the information society steering committee and the science, technology and innovation advisory council.  In the wake of the Good Friday Agreement, I was appointed vice chairman of Tourism Ireland in 2000.  It was start-up company, with a remit to market the island of Ireland internationally.  After serving for seven years, I was reappointed to the board and served as chairman for the remaining two years of my term. </p><p>  While still at Microsoft, I was appointed by the then Taoiseach to the board of MIT MediaLab Europe, a new, independent university level research and education centre specialising in telecommunications and information and multimedia technologies, including Internet and digital commerce.  The Government provided MLE with seed funding and accommodation in the Guinness Hop Store.  The balance of the required funding was to be raised by MIT and MLE from research contracts, industry sponsorships and private contributions.  However, this was in the period of the dotcom crash and a dramatic reduction in research by industry had a severe impact on MLE's ability to reach a critical mass of sponsorship.  The collaboration agreement between MIT and the Government was terminated in 2005.  I served on the board until 2005. </p><p>  During my tenure with Microsoft there was a serious dearth of skills in the IT sector which was impeding growth for Microsoft in Ireland.  To overcome this shortfall, I instigated a programme with the Ballymun jobs centre to train long-term unemployed persons to qualify as Microsoft-certified professionals.  The 25 participants all qualified and found full-time employment.  When other multinationals in Ireland heard about the success of the initiative, they overwhelmingly supported the programme which resulted in an industry-wide training initiative, FIT - Fast Track to IT.  To date, over 12,000 long-term unemployed persons have been trained in the FIT partners technology, with over 80% securing full-time employment.  At the European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, cited FIT as a model for corporate social responsibility.</p> <p>As a result, many organisations across Europe, as well as further afield in Canada, emulated the program in their respective countries.  I served on the board of FIT from 1998 to 2009.</p><p> Earlier this year my term at the National Standards Authority of Ireland expired.  I served on the board of that organisation for five years before my appointment as chairman in 2007, a position I held until this year.  Rather than listing the authority's achievements, I refer to the reference to it in <i>The House Always Wins </i>by Deputy John McGuinness:<blockquote>The NSAI is an example of how a State agency should be run.  It applies the highest standards to itself in developing standards for others and actually operates at a profit to the Exchequer.</blockquote> Other roles I have filled include that of public interest director on the board of the Educational Building Society and chairman of the Dublin Regional Tourism Authority from 2007.  After serving on the council of the Institute of Directors in Ireland for six years, I was elected president of that organisation in 2009.  During my time as president I instigated the development of a code for the independent assessment of companies' compliance with existing codes on corporate governance, including the recruitment and selection of the consultative committee that developed the code.  That code, known as SWiFT 3000, was launched in March 2010 and I will refer to it again towards the end of my contribution.</p><p> I was delighted to receive a telephone call from the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, regarding the post at Science Foundation Ireland.  Since then I have had the opportunity to meet the director general of SFI, Professor Mark Ferguson, and the chief operations officer and secretary to the board, Mr Donal Keane, who is here with me today.  Both of them have given me a comprehensive briefing on the operations and goals of SFI.</p><p> Earlier this year, SFI published a document called Agenda 2020 which sets out its vision of Ireland as a global knowledge leader which places scientific and engineering research at the core of its society in order to power economic development and social progress<i>.  </i>Its strategic plan for realising this vision was subject to a consultation process with key stakeholders and the public, with 59 written submissions received and 65 people attending the public consultation meeting.  The plan, based on four primary objectives, is ambitious and not for the faint-hearted .  I look forward to working with the board and the executive as we strive to achieve those goals.  The key performance indicators for each year of the plan are unambiguous and measurable, which will help the board to track performance and ensure the strategic goals are delivered in line with the plan and the vision for the organisation.  I am particularly excited about the role SFI can play in enabling Ireland to gain international global advantage in the areas of biotechnology and ICT.  As an early evangelist of the economic benefits that knowledge-based industries can contribute to this country's prosperity, I am committed to working with the board, the executive and the Government to realise SFI's vision.</p><p> It would be presumptuous of me to assume, at this early stage, definitively to identify areas that require particular focus.  I am impressed by the enthusiasm for the implementation of the strategic plan, the professionalism of those I have met in SFI and the openness and transparency that exists in the organisation.  The expertise and experience of the members of the board are impressive, and I am convinced their attributes, along with my broad experience, will assist, support and challenge the executive in its efforts to ensure SFI is the best science-funding agency in the world and an exemplar among building partnerships which fund excellent science.  Our aim is to have an engaged and scientifically informed public, with SFI representing the ideal modern service organisation in line with its primary objectives.</p><p> My personal objectives for the first three months are to work with the board, the director general and company secretary on a number of specific issues.  I intend to agree a schedule and format for board meetings that will facilitate discussion, ensure decisions are kept at strategic level and that sufficient and appropriate information is provided to the board to meet its fiduciary duties.  I am seeking to achieve SWiFT 3000 certification through independent assessment of SFI's corporate governance performance and compliance to the highest standards of corporate governance codes and ethics.  I hope to explore areas of focus for applied research and develop a funding model in accordance with the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) (Amendment) Act 2013.  I intend to ensure that the 2014 annual plan, key performance indicators and budget are approved by the board in a timely manner.  I will assist the director general to secure the appointment of a director for programmes, enterprise and international affairs, one of the key positions required by the organisation in order effectively to manage its core function.  Finally, I will familiarise myself with the overall public funding of research in Ireland, in an effort to understand SFI's role within that context.</p><p> I again thank the Vice Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee today.  I will be pleased to take any questions.</p></speech>

Her achievement in bringing Microsoft to Ireland and developing its presence to where it is today was particularly influential.  I now invite questions from members, beginning with Deputy Dara Calleary.</p></speech>

I suspect she is the first nominee from the Department ever to cite approvingly comments by Deputy John McGuinness.  I take this opportunity to thank her not just for what she is about to do but also for all she has done.  She has given a huge amount of time to public service while at the same time maintaining a very demanding career.  If more could see their way to doing the same, the country would be in a better place.</p><p>  Science Foundation Ireland has set itself a target of securing &euro;1 billion under Horizon 2020, much of which will be laid out during Ms Riordan's term as chairman.  Does she have any specific strategies in mind in this regard?</p></speech>

I was aghast when I became aware of the figures showing the low level of take-up.  The Deputy can be assured that I recognise the importance of setting high targets in terms of moneys pulled down.  SFI should and will be working with the higher institutes of education, in the country's interest, to ensure we access as much of that funding as possible.</p></speech>

We are hoping to get in the region of &euro;150 million to &euro;200 million of that funding.  It is a developing process and I understand a group has been established under Enterprise Ireland that will see all the agencies coming together with that target in mind.  We will have a significant subset of the funding.</p></speech>

Hers is a very impressive CV.</p> <p>I have no doubt Ms Riordan will bring her own unique experience to the job in which I wish her the very best of luck.</p><p> Regional disadvantage is the first issue with which I wish to deal.  I have raised it at previous meetings of the committee and at other forums.  It is one with which we must grapple, particularly in the context of the various strategies organisations have for the different regions.  I am a big believer in research and innovation as drivers of the economy.  I support Government policy on the move towards technological universities.  I am from the south east and, as Ms Riordan will be aware, Carlow and Waterford institutes of technology have submitted an application for a technological university in the region.  What is her view on that matter and what is the view of Science Foundation Ireland of the improvements to which this could give rise and the opportunities it could present for the region in the area of research and development?  She may be aware of the work done by TSSG-ArcLabs in Waterford.  It is one of the best research and development facilities in the country and very good at co-location in encouraging the private sector to become involved in research and development, new technologies, etc.  It should be considered as a model for other locations.  Will Ms Riordan outline her thoughts on the matter?</p><p> How does Ms Riordan see the work of Science Foundation Ireland impacting on tackling regional disadvantage and unemployment?  The south east has higher levels of unemployment than elsewhere.  Does Science Foundation Ireland have strategies to assist in this regard?  </p><p> Research is obviously publicly funded.  Some time ago the joint committee discussed with the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Sean Sherlock, the OECD's commentary on patents and intellectual property.  Who owns what is developed?  The State invests a great deal in research and development and the OECD was somewhat critical of it in that respect.  What is Ms Riordan's view on the State obtaining a return on its investments?</p><p> What changes would Ms Riordan like to see in Science Foundation Ireland as an organisation?  Agenda 2020 states, "Ireland will be a global knowledge leader that places scientific and engineering research at the core of its society to power economic development and social progress".  How does Ms Riordan see this being implemented?</p></speech>

Ireland is a small country.  I will provide an analogy.  Many years ago I was standing on D&uacute;n Laoghaire pier when the aircraft carrier, <i>USS John F. Kennedy</i>, sailed into Dublin Bay.  As we were waiting to get on a tugboat to visit the ship, the <i>HSS Stena Explorer</i> entered the port.  As it did so, it was literally obliged to perform a 180<sup>o</sup> turn in order to allow passengers to alight.  I was amazed by this.  If we equate the <i>USS John F. Kennedy</i> equates to Europe and the <i>HSS Stena Explorer</i> to Ireland, we can see that the country is small and versatile.  I am extremely passionate about this matter.  If we work together for the good of the country and people do not seek to hold on to certain things, we can achieve whatever we want.  It would take hours to turn the <i>USS John F. Kennedy</i> about.  However, Ireland, like the <i>HSS Stena Explorer</i>, is versatile and can manoeuvre much more quickly.  That is why I am passionate about Science Foundation Ireland and the vision for it.  I cannot provide an answer today to how I can have an input into that vision, but the Senator may rest assured that I will be happy to return to the committee when I have been in the job for a few months or one year to answer some of his questions.  I hope I can help in progressing the agenda already in place.  I cannot see any reason it should not be progressed.</p><p>  On the issue of regional disadvantage, for many years I was involved with the long-term unemployed in disadvantaged areas and responsible for the Tramlines programme which later became Fast Track to IT, FIT, across Ireland.  It was primarily a Microsoft initiative which I led.  I may be coming at it from a financial perspective, but those who survive in disadvantaged areas are very skilled.  I fundamentally believe it takes a great deal of creativity to survive in such areas.  Just because people are disadvantaged as a result of their being, for example, long-term unemployed, this does not mean that they are disadvantaged intellectually.  The Smart Futures programme will help the areas to which I refer.  People do not need to have fantastic academic backgrounds to work in biotechnology or, in particular, ICT.  Regardless of the level at which one enters an organisation, one can, if one has the necessary skills, proceed on an upward path.  </p><p>  Perhaps Mr. Keane might provide some information on the Smart Futures programme.</p></speech>

We are looking at technology being the driver for certain regions, of which the south east is one.  From a research and development perspective, would the establishment of a technological university help the south east?</p></speech>

I am not yet familiar with Science Foundation Ireland's funding.  I understand the level of public funding equates to &euro;800 million a year, which is fantastic.  We are behind some countries, but it is still a large pot of money, of which Science Foundation Ireland receives 20%.  As stated, I want to become familiar with what is involved.  I am not in a position to provide the Senator with a direct answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donal Keane" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013120300010#K00500"><p>I will attempt to be of assistance.  The simple answer to the question on regional disadvantage is Science Foundation Ireland would not, <i>per se</i>, have a strategy in that regard.  It is important to say what we fund is excellent science.  No matter from where such science comes, it will attract funding if it is good enough.  If it is not, it will not nor should it attract funding.  </p><p>  The Senator referred to TSSG which was established by Dr. Willie Donnelly.  We are very familiar with the work done by him and his people.  He is connected with the Centre for Telecommunications Research, CTVR, in Trinity College Dublin, one of our big CSETs.  The way forward for regions, not just the south east, which might have their disadvantages is through collaboration.  Through our centres awards this year, we put up &euro;200 million which was matched by &euro;100 million from industry.  Most of these involve collaborations by more than one university.  It is not the case that small institutions must seek big partners.  There are big partners with other big partners, small partners with big partners and small partners with other small partners.  Dr. Donnelly's group punched above its weight through building on the success of TSSG by collaborating with CTVR.  We do not have a specific strategy, but if projects are good enough, they will be awarded funding.</p><p>  Smart Futures programmes are more downstream-oriented and involve attracting the interest of those still in school who could, I presume, be prospective students for a technological university.  As matters stand, however, Carlow Institute of Technology does a good job.  Waterford Institute of Technology is very significant in its own right and I would have no worries in that regard.  As Ms Riordan stated, one attracts both interest and people and then takes matters forward.</p><p>  The Senator inquired about intellectual property.  The principle is that the inventor owns.  Our funding is exclusively related to universities.</p> <p>In other words, the money we give out is to the universities.  Every letter of offer we issue is to a university; it is not to the individuals or for the individuals' principal investigators.  They are the deliverers but very clearly accountability rests with the university presidents who are also the owners of the IP.  In some programmes where we have industry involvement, agreements need to be put in place at the outset between industry and the researchers such that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are protected.  In that work we are guided by the national guidelines on IP which were refreshed earlier this year.  That would very much drive those negotiations which are set at a national level to protect Ireland&rsquo;s position.</p></speech>

I appreciate that she is getting to grips with Science Foundation Ireland but that she has much experience in the area.</p><p>  Similar to Deputy Calleary I wish to raise EU funding.  The issue has come up previously that we do not do enough to leverage funding in the EU for our research spend.  Ms Riordan probably has that in her sights, which is a good thing.</p><p>  Ms Riordan might have an insight into ICT skills from her work with Fastrack to IT, FIT, which has been before the committee.  It is an impressive operation.  The committee produced a report on the area of ICT skills shortage.  That coincided with the publication of the Government&rsquo;s ICT action plan.  Perhaps Mr. Keane would wish to respond also in terms of whether the plan is having an effect.  I am aware there is a big take up in postgraduate reconversion.  The programme is in its infancy in that it has only been going for approximately two years but we should have begun to see results at this stage.</p><p>  I was pleased when I heard the witnesses were coming before the committee.  I was interested in Ms Riordan&rsquo;s reference in her opening comments to the marriage bar and having to give up work.  A couple of female PhD students were in contact with me who had to go on maternity leave.  Their payment as researchers is a stipend, it is not accredited pay so they are not entitled to any maternity leave or sick leave.  I know the situation in the United Kingdom is similar but that is not the case in other countries where they recognise the payment as insurable income, which does make a difference, in particular when one considers that such people can be in their mid to late 20s and they want to build up contributions or they might have mortgages.  Many issues arise but maternity leave in particular was raised with me.  Ms Riordan might not have a response but she might consider whether the issue could be resolved in the course of her work.</p></speech>

I read the action plan.  Senator Clune said FIT was in before the committee and that there is still a skills shortage in certain areas in ICT.  That is what prompted the FIT programme in the beginning and there is still a need for it.  I do not know whether it was said at the time that there are probably openings for approximately 4,200 staff.</p></speech>

Many of the jobs are not at a very high level.  The problem with ICT is that based on being in the industry for so long, we are going a lot for graduates, which is very important, but certainly in my early days in Microsoft it was apparent that graduates got bored.  If a company just recruits people at a certain level such as with a primary degree or master&rsquo;s degree, some of the jobs can be quite routine and they get bored and it is hard to hold on to them.  It is very hard in work to challenge someone at PhD level all the time, in particular in some areas of ICT.  It is essential to have another skill level for those coming in with skills and which allow for progression within an organisation.  The IT industry is very good at that.</p><p>  I started off in the computer industry as administration manager but then with experience I progressed.  Skills change every 18 months so one needs a very versatile programme to keep people on-skill all the time.  It is impossible for our educational institutes to keep up with the rate of change.  One has to leave that to the companies because they will keep abreast with their technologies.  There must be some way of getting what is being called, associated professionals.  I will come back to Senator Clune about maternity leave and PhD students.</p></speech>

In terms of the issue raised, to clarify, when researchers are PhD students they get a stipend but when they graduate and become part of a post-doctoral research team they are part of the staff of the university, albeit they might be on a contract, and under the fixed-term workers act they now get rights whereas five years ago they did not have many rights at all, they just got a succession of short-term contracts for between one and four years depending on funding.  Now I understand they get rights from the moment they are signed up and if they do not get a further contract they must be made redundant.  It would be a matter for the universities, not us.</p></speech>

There is more than one way to achieve the skillset that is needed, in particular in the IT sector but not only that, the model FIT has proposed would be transferable to other sectors in a new age apprenticeship type model for the pharmaceutical sector and wherever else we want to apply it.  Is it correct to say that we still have too many people going through the university route for the IT sector when some of the jobs could be done by an associate professional which allows for a better fusion between on-site experience for the people working in the environment rather than the fusion with the higher education model?</p></speech>

That is what FIT is about.  It should be used as a model right across the broad industries.  At this stage I would be reluctant to say we are wrong.  Let us fix the problem of the long-term unemployed and those who need reskilling first.  When we are back to 4% unemployment we could look at the issue again.</p></speech>

I am most encouraged from what I have heard from her.  The experience she outlined is fantastic.  I thank her for taking up the position.  Science, research and innovation, commercialisation, entrepreneurship and building companies is what we must focus on if we are to solve the unemployment problem.  We need strong leadership.  We need people who can make decisions who are not afraid to take on challenges and can be innovative in doing that.  Ms Riordan seems to have all the skills required.  We are very lucky to have her.  I wish her well and look forward to working with her.</p><p>  I appreciate that Mr. Michael McLoughlin has just arrived but he might be able to help me with a question I have on not-for-profit research technology organisations.  We are the only country out of 38 in Europe that does not have them.  All research and innovation is currently funded through universities.  There is much collaboration around the country between PhD students coming together with multinationals or smaller SME companies coming together to collaborate but they must go through a college in order to get funding for research or innovation.  We are the only country in Europe that seems to have this model, which seems to me to be a deterrent for research and innovation.  I would appreciate a comment from Mr. McLoughlin.  I am aware there is talk about trying to change the system at the moment and there is much impetus in that regard.</p></speech>

It is difficult.  Going back to what I said earlier, when excellent science is funded the excellent science translates into the individuals who deliver the excellent science.  By and large, they tend to be located within the universities, although not exclusively.  We are precluded from funding companies but we have companies that partner with SFI awards.  For instance, there are Intel scientists embedded in the CRANN CSET in Trinity College.  They are people who are not of the universities but are within a corporate entity.  There is a linkage to the universities structure.  It is difficult because it comes down to the skills set.  It is not a question of being profit or not for profit.  Profit implies a company, and legally we do not fund them by way of remit.  Regarding not for profit organisations, we have done work with charities, sometimes off their own bat where they commissioned research and sometimes in collaboration with another partner, but it is a difficult one.</p></speech>

That is a model we would have examined.  Seismic changes are needed.  To use Ms Riordan's analogy, that is the JFK liner we are trying to deal with rather than the HSS.  We are aware of those models but within the structure we need the incentives.  People in universities have contracts.  The principal investigators, PIs, in universities have tenured contracts.  They have a level of security which they build upon to win funding from various agencies to do research.  If we create one of these institutes, we have to have a clear idea of the funding that is available to pay the people involved, which may be over and above short-term research contracts.  It is a challenge but Professor Mark Ferguson has raised it and he will be examining it.</p></speech>

I was to the forefront of that.  The Government at the time approached the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  It was trying to set up a digital hub beside the Guinness hops store and its success in attracting MIT MediaLab as an anchor tenant was very much welcomed at the time.  It attracted a number of organisations to set up that digital hub.  It was very successful from that perspective.  A number of patents had gone to Enterprise Ireland which were being worked on just as MediaLab Europe was closing down.</p><p>  In terms of the way MediaLab approached research, it was based on demonstrations rather than research papers.  As it was in the area of media, demonstrations would be used as evidence of the research.  We worked with a number of universities.  It was the early days when everybody was scrabbling, so to speak.  I remember it was the beginning of the Internet and everybody was wondering what would be the killer application, so to speak.  At Microsoft we spent years trying to define what would be the killer application on the Internet.  It turned out to be e-mail, which was in front of us all the time.  At the same time, as we all know when moving into the digital economy content is very important.  That is what MIT Media Lab was all about.  It was very exciting.  </p><p>  PhD students, principal investigators and others were studying there.  They went to Cambridge on many occasions and worked with MIT MediaLab.  That was a great transfer of knowledge.  Likewise, many of those working in MIT came over to Dublin.  It was a fantastic experience but then the dotcom crash happened and sponsorship was no longer available.  It was completely reliant on public donations, as are the universities in the United States.  It is staggering to see what individuals put into those organisations.  It did not work here because of the time it was, which was very unfortunate.</p><p>  In terms of what I learned from that and the reason I refer to it is because as a board member, it was an experience for me.  I had been involved in managing research teams in London previously with Wordplex but it gave me an insight, especially into this demo-model, which is very valid, particularly in the ICT area.  I picked up valuable lessons from that but I do not want to discuss what happened at board level.</p></speech>

If I am given the position I will be very excited, and I would love to appear again before the committee.  I welcome the input of all the members of which I have made a note.  If I come before the committee again I will have the answer to all the questions.  I thank the members for all the time they have given us.  I promised that I would give a little push for corporate governance, and SWiFT 3000 is the code.</p> <p>I say that because maybe the committee would put it to any semi-State companies that come before it for corporate governance reasons.  The people involved in putting the code together for the certification of organisations compliant with corporate governance include the Institute of Directors, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, University College Dublin, the Corporate Governance Association of Ireland, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, the Electricity Supply Board, F&Aacute;S and the Employment Authority, the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Financial Regulator, the Dublin Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, and so on.  We have managed to pull everybody involved with standards and corporate governance together.  I wrote to every Minister at the time but the Government changed so I want to push it again from a corporate governance perspective.  I thank the committee for allowing me to do that. </p></speech>

Although straightforward in terms of text, inserting the word &quot;Reform&quot; signals in an unambiguous way the intent and scope of the Bill in relation to the radical reform of the functions, structures and governance of the local government system to ensure it will be at the heart of public service provision at local level.  The change also takes account of the fact that the Local Government Act 2001 continues to be the core statutory basis for the local government system.  The Bill provides the legislative framework to implement the reform programme and will deliver significant structural changes at county, sub-county and regional level.  It will reverse the trend in past decades of marginalising local government by providing new roles for the sector in community development, enterprise support and economic development.  It will deliver changes across a range of local governance and management issues, including the replacement of the traditional post of manager by a new post of chief executive and the introduction of innovative measures such as the establishment of a national oversight and audit commission.  It will provide for the holding of a plebiscite on a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  It will provide the legal basis for implementation of the ambitious reform programme set out in the Government's policy document, An Action Programme for Effective Local Government.  It is appropriate that this be reflected in the Title of the Bill.  </p><p>  Amendments Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, also amend section 1 which, in addition to the Short Title, sets out the collective citations for the various legislative codes referenced in the Bill.  As a result of the numerous consequential amendments to the Acts in question provided for in the Schedules, the citations in a number of areas need to be updated.</p> <p>The citations in a number of areas need to be updated.  Amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, provide for the necessary changes in this regard.  Section 1 also provides for the standard commencement provisions in subsection (8) and amendment No. 6 adds to these provisions which will commence on enactment to include Part 11, which deals with the local government fund and Irish Water and an amendment to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997 provided for in Part 12.  It is important that the local government fund provision is commenced as soon as possible to allow the Minister to make payments from the fund to Irish Water.  This funding is required by Irish Water to make payments to local authorities for water services provided for under the service level agreements from January 2014.</p><p> The amendment in relation to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is to provide legal certainty underpinning the fast-tracked planning process in the docklands area.  Again, it is important this provision is commenced.</p></speech>

Otherwise, local authorities will be short changed by a considerable amount of money.  I am providing Irish Water with the powers to do that under the service level agreements.  As I understand it, &euro;490 million, which is a significant amount of money, will be required to be transferred to local authorities as part of their Estimates process.  They will need to have certainty in this regard.  The legislation provides the Minister with the power to do so by way of the allocations being made by way of various measures, including the local government fund and general purpose grants.</p></speech>

This is a huge missed opportunity.  I will avail of every opportunity to make that point.  The Minister would be surprised if I did not.  I do not propose to labour many points because I spoke in detail on this matter on Second Stage.</p><p>  I presume we will deal with the &euro;600 million being set aside for Irish Water when we come to the amendments under Part 2.  However, like Deputy Cowen, I do not understand how this amount was calculated when we do not yet know the detail of the service level agreements.  How was this amount calculated?  Was it a back of an envelope exercise?  Clearly, this amount will met from local property tax receipts, which is not what people had anticipated.</p></speech>

Some of that funding has been transferred to the Exchequer for deficit reduction and the remainder will go into the local government fund for the purpose of making provision for Irish Water funding.  The Deputy is wrong in saying this money will be taken from property tax receipts, rather it will be met in the traditional way.  When water provision was the responsibility of local government, funding in this regard was not met through the local government fund.  We want to ensure continued funding of local authorities for water provision, operation and maintenance.</p></speech>

This is being backfilled by household charge and property tax receipts.  The Minister is splitting hairs in terms of saying funding for Irish Water will not be met from the local government fund because the property tax receipts are being used to shore up that fund, or will be in the future.</p></speech>

This means that money that should be spent on fixing leaks in the system will now be spent on the creation of this new super-structure.  Up to now calls were taken by a clerk in the area office.  Under the new system a councillor will, as a I predicted a year and a half ago, have to contact the call centre to report a burst pipe that is half or quarter of a mile from his or her house or on the same street as his or her house.  The Minister, in creating this structure, is creating something that is not needed.  The responsibility should be retained by the local authorities.</p></speech>

While that is the reason being given, the Minister is aware that both local elections or a local plebiscite as proposed would be paid for by the local council.  Every local council meets at budget time to put aside a certain amount of money for local elections.  For example, Portlaoise Town Council is doing so this afternoon and will put by some money for local elections.  This does not place a burden on the Exchequer and there is no cost to Revenue in this regard.  If one considers the example of Dublin, the Minister proposes to hold a plebiscite on the same day as the local elections.  In other words, such plebiscites could be held on the same day as local elections, the only cost being the provision of a certain number of ballot papers and a couple of extra ballot boxes.  There would be the same number of staff, election tellers and everything else.  Consequently, I believe the reason these amendments have been ruled out of order does not hold up and is not valid.  I argue strongly that people in Waterford, Limerick and the other areas affected should have the right to a plebiscite on whether they wish to retain the city councils.  The question of a cost on the Revenue does not exist because such a plebiscite could be carried out on the same day as local elections and local councils pay for such elections.</p></speech>

The Part 17 in question deals with the establishment of a town council and will no longer be relevant following dissolution of town councils as provided for in Part 3 of the Bill.   The deletion of Part 17 itself is provided for in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Bill, which deals with miscellaneous and consequential amendments to the principal Act.  Amendment No. 16 is cognate on amendment No. 17 and amendment No. 15 is a straightforward drafting change to section 11.</p></speech>

The changes will place a huge strain on part-time councillors who will be trying to represent vast new municipal districts.  I tabled amendments in this regard which have been ruled to be in conflict with the Bill.  Any amendment tabled by a member is in conflict with the Bill because one is seeking to have certain parts of it changed.  Moreover, I seek this change in good faith, as Sinn F&eacute;in has drawn up figures based on the ratio of councillors per head of population.</p> <p>We have tried to do it in a more realistic way to be more in line with what is being done in the North and in other jurisdictions across Europe.  There are councillors, particularly in Kerry, west Laois and other areas, who will be representing areas that are 40 or 45 miles across bad roads.  That is the reason I tabled the amendments.  I am disappointed about this.  Who takes the decision as to what is ruled out?  Did the Minister do it or did civil servants do it for him?</p></speech>

We feel there should have been room for manoeuvre.  For example, County Laois, which has 43 councillors, will be reduced to 19 councillors, which includes the abolition of the two town councillors and six fewer county councillors.  Even Fine Gael councillors will be under pressure.</p></speech>

Members may speak on the section.  Amendments Nos. 18, 19 and 196 in the name of Deputy Stanley form a composite proposal to delete the proposed amalgamations of six of the local authorities, that is, Limerick City and County, Waterford City and County, North Tipperary and South Tipperary.  The merger of the three sets of local authorities is a key principle of the Bill.  I know the point the Deputy is making, but in terms of the interpretation of the amendment, it would have that effect.  It would also propose a number of members of local authorities to the membership proposed in the Bill.  The amendment had to be ruled out because it was in conflict with the principle of the Bill.  The point the Deputy is making can still be made in the context of the section.  Cork South-West constituency is very long.  I could get to Dublin faster than from side of the constituency to the other, given the road network.  Even though each councillor will represent approximately 7,000 people, in terms of geography that is not reflected in terms of ease of travelling.  We have gone from 12 elected members to eight in a massive geographical expanse and it is a huge consideration for those who will be left to service the area.  It is difficult enough to do it.</p></speech>

People will become aware of a significant difference very quickly.  The point that has been made about people putting themselves forward is a valid one.  There is a world of difference between representing a smaller number people where one can manage it with a job.  I do not know how many have said that the good people will drop out of the political system right across the spectrum because of this proposal.  It is not that I think the distribution proposed in the amendment is great.  It is trying to make a bad situation slightly better.  If anything, it exposes the thinking about how communities are represented.  That should have been a district council tier rather than trying to stretch people to what will be breaking point for many.  It is not only rural areas that will be affected.  For example, in County Kildare there is an imbalance in terms of where the population is located and, therefore, the smallest number of councillors will have a huge landmass to cover.  That creates its own resentment within a local authority.  We have had experience of that in the past and this proposal will exaggerate it.</p></speech>

It comes down to the fact that rural areas are under-represented while urban areas are over-represented, given the number of new councillors in Dublin as against the wide mass of geographical areas councillors have to cover in rural areas and the commitment and effort required to do that as against the over-representation in Dublin.  My proposals are contained in amendment No. 21, section 22A(3), which provides for the number of members on each community council to fill the gap left by virtue of the provision proposed by the Minister which, as I said earlier, is inevitable in its process.  Having said that, we are making constructive proposals to address the deficiency that will exist after the change has been made resulting in the loss of many councillors on county councils, not to mention the severe loss to town councils and local democracy.  However, that is for another section and another debate.  In this regard, if the Minister is not willing to reverse his proposals and the method by which he has arrived at them, I suggest he look at amendment No. 21, section 22A(3), which provides for the number of members on each community council in all towns and villages.</p></speech>

Historically urban citizens have been grossly under-represented.  I accept we all speak about distances.  I accept that town councils have served the country well.  However, the democratic imbalance between urban and rural has been enormous since the foundation of the State and this provision in some way rebalances the position but does not go the full way.  I think there are reasons for that.  I am aware rural Deputies work extremely hard, but urban councillors work almost full-time because of the volume of work per head of population.  I accept there is a move to address that issue in the Bill but I would have liked it to go further.  I accept there are other issues such as distances, as mentioned by the Chairman.  Sometimes it takes as long in an urban area to travel a quarter of the distance the Chairman would take to travel across west Cork.  When traffic does not move, it takes quite a long time, about two hours, to travel across one area.</p></speech>

I know she is looking at the issue from the point of view of the glass being half empty.  An increase in the number of councillors from 25 to 40 is not bad and reflects the population.  On the previous occasion when the boundaries were looked at, the Minister of the day told the local authorities to examine the boundaries themselves without changing the overall figures.  I set up an independent commission to do this work, based on certain criteria.  There is the notion that local authorities had an input, they made submissions but that was it.  For the first time in many years, the local boundary commission looked at the issue independently and arrived at the boundaries involved.  I note that Deputy Brian Stanley wants to increase the number of councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown or in Fingal to 69.  That is an unwieldy number of councillors.  I know they will have a difficulty in Dublin City Council which has 63.</p></speech>

I am aware a national oversight and audit commission will be set up but there will only be oversight of what is being established.  If local government reform is to mean anything, it should not be an event but a process.  If we are to have the devolution of functions and powers from a variety of Departments, a means of doing that is required.  Many of the areas I have included are covered by the European charter.</p><p>  One of the things which is very different about Irish local government compared to very developed local government systems in some European countries, in particular the Nordic countries, is the lack of functions.  I accept new functions will be allocated but there must be a mechanism to do this on a continuous basis.  This amendment is intended to provide for that and to be consistent with the charter, which this country has signed.  It is one thing to review the effectiveness of something that is static but in terms of something that will be dynamic, there needs to be something else.  That is the reason behind this amendment.</p></speech>

In the policy document itself, we got agreement from the Government that no new services would be established in this State at Department or agency level without first seeing if it could be done at local level through local government.  That was a major statement of intent on the part of the Government, for which we got approval.  I am doing everything I possibly can in this legislation to ensure we devolve as many functions as we possibly can in the first instance to county and city level but also to municipal level.  That might deal with some of the issues raised in an earlier amendment about distances to travel.  Many of the functions at county and city council level currently could be devolved to municipal district level in the future.</p><p>  The action programme, which sets out the policy decisions for which the Bill provides, emphasises that local government reform is an ongoing process.  It has to be that way but there will always be occasions when there are new programmes or new decisions will be made by Government but we have agreement from Government now that local government will be the first port of call to see how it can be accommodated in regard to implementing a decision.  Therefore, if one was to set up an advisory panel on the future development of local government, it would be contrary to that principle.  The Deputy acknowledges that the national oversight and audit commission is a mechanism that could probably merge into what she has in mind.</p><p>  The Bill caters for many of the objectives about which the Deputy spoke.  It provides for the national oversight and audit commission which will scrutinise the performance of local government to see if it is fulfilling its national, regional and local mandates, promote value for money where State funds are channelled through local government and will look at best practice in regard to the delivery of services between local authorities and how those best practices can be implemented everywhere. </p><p>  We are trying to strengthen role and responsibility of the elected members in enabling the members to have a more effective input into the development of policy nationally, building on the work carried out by the elected members working group which I established early this year to tease out the issues in regard to this Bill.  I am very grateful for their input. </p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the European charter.  We are subject to regular monitoring by the Council of Europe, and the most recent monitoring report was published.  This report pointed out some weaknesses in Irish local government.  These have built up over a long period of time and they were acknowledged in the action programme and are being addressed in this Bill.  I am glad to have the opportunity to refute some of the misleading information which has been put about on this matter, even by some councillors in Strasbourg recently.  The report welcomed the overall action programme and the council secretariat of the Council of Europe has specifically confirmed to my Department that references in the report to legislation relate to the position at July 2013 when the report was approved by the congress and not to the current Bill, as some have tried to imply.  The report also specifically endorsed the changes at sub-county level, contrary to some other comments about which I read.</p><p>  I strongly support devolution.  We are already reversing the trend of recent decades by bringing micro-enterprise support and local and community development into local government.   We are looking for wider devolution to local level and I also propose a local government proofing procedure at Government level in regard to any new public services at local level.</p></speech>

However, I have read through some of the sections of the Bill and have thought about how this will happen in practice.  We will come to this later and I will draw attention to it then in terms of what I mean by this.  I am trying to visualise how it will work in practice.  For example, the local authority can remove some of the functions from the municipal authority.  If one was really going to position the municipal authority as the key, in terms of where decisions will be made, that would not be possible without municipal level having to agree to it.  I can see how the officials at local authority level will, more or less, be driving that.  Having sat on a local authority for years, I know how this will play out, as do most who have had that kind of involvement.</p><p>  I would have liked if the Minister had accepted that there is a need to do this in a more formal way, where we look at the charter and give it a little bit of autonomy.  For example, rather than things being handed down, there should be an independent assessment to try to point to areas which could be drawn down.</p> <p>We all accept that Ministers are very busy people and will not go through lists of things that will be devolved to local government.  If we are to have a proper devolution process we have to show how that will happen rather than rely on the goodwill of a particular Minister who is committed to doing that.  This could continue for a considerable time into the future.  That was the intention behind including this, to make it more dynamic and more formal, without depending on goodwill.</p></speech>

Councillors are very concerned, with good reason, that the new districts would not become another area committee.  Some of them are very large and should be called district councils to give them their proper title and status.  In some cases these districts are half a county, for example in Carlow and Leitrim, and a third of a county in the case of Laois and other counties.</p></speech>

We want to confirm that there is nothing underhand intended on the part of the Department to omit the word council or district council from the various references in this section.  This amendment would enhance not only the image and the authority of municipal districts but would also satisfy me from a legal perspective that there is no sinister effort in drawing down funds or in respect of the transfer of assets in existing town councils.  That is very important.  Will the Minister say whether there are any costs associated with the transfer of ownership of assets not only in the area of public water networks but public parks and buildings and so forth?  What are the legal implications?  Does the Bill provide for them?  Will extra costs land in the laps of the local authorities to meet these transfers? </p></speech>

Is that successor authority the municipal district or is it the local authority?  For example, the town council on which I sat for years was quite prudent and put money aside towards its future and in terms of securing a building, and had accumulated quite a substantial sum of money.  That will go to the successor authority unless it is spent in the meantime and that requires the agreement of the Minister in our current circumstances.  This is precisely the kind of issue that will cause very deep resentment especially where a local authority had been prudent and its money was to be spent or to go into a big fund to be dispersed all over the place.  It may well cover the losses in other areas where local authorities had not been so prudent.  A fixed asset, such as a park, is different because people will have the benefit of that.  For a mobile asset, such as money, it would be important to define where that goes and which is the successor authority.</p></speech>

Communities require a structure by which they can interact with the local authorities, whether that is a municipal district or a county or city council.  I hope that before the conclusion of this legislation we will be able to consider additional advice from a working group chaired by Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy to see how the community and voluntary fora, and the community in general, could interact with the local authority in a structured way.  Citizens&rsquo; and community engagement is important.  I am considering that.  Between now and Report Stage I might have more information arising from the report of that working group next week, which will tell me what it believes is the appropriate structure to ensure proper citizen engagement and community focus through the local elected members.</p><p>  At the end of the day, the elected members have to make the decisions.  I presume that the Deputy is referring to how people consult with elected members, before those decisions are made.  There is provision in section 128 of the Local Government Act 2001 for local authorities to declare an appropriate local body to be a recognised association.  The Deputy could read that section in the principal Act to see whether that is appropriate or sufficiently robust for the purposes of consulting, providing advice and entering agreements to carry out certain functions.  In light of that section we may not need to approve this amendment but I would be open-minded enough to discuss this at a later stage, having considered the matter and seen what the working group on the community and voluntary sector gives me in the next few days. </p></speech>

I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s response to my amendment and accept that when we reach Report Stage he may be in a better position to accept a variation of what I propose, which is essentially a replacement body to reflect the views and aspirations of those confined to an area such as a town council that is lost, or a town or village lost within the larger geographical spread of a municipal district council.</p> <p>What I am proposing here would be voluntary by nature.  I accept that a consultation process is ongoing and will be making recommendations.  I hope those recommendations will reflect some of what is proposed here.  While I do propose to press the amendment, I hope the Minister might be in a better position on Report Stage to accept at least some part of what I am suggesting.</p></speech>

Deputy Cowen introduced a Bill on town centres which I opposed for that very reason.  However, if his proposal for community councils can be implemented on a voluntary basis, with no extra cost arising for rate payers or taxpayers, then it would be a very worthwhile amendment.</p></speech>

That is one of the advantages of elected town councils, as opposed to voluntary fora, and it gives them a degree of authority.  Having been a member of a community council prior to the establishment of the town council, I can say that there certainly was a noticeable difference between the two.  Community councils are often ad hoc by nature.  A structure is required in order to prevent their domination by certain groups, which can skew things and prevent them from being inclusive.  While I have no difficulty with the spirit of the amendment, it is important to bear that aspect in mind.</p><p>  Part of the problem I see with the municipal districts is in terms of their engagement with the various communities within those districts.  Going back to my own experience in local government, I found there was a very different focus as between town and county council.  In the case of the former - I accept it might just be my own particular experience - there was a great effort to be inclusive of the community, with sub-committees made up of local people which could make recommendations in the area of arts, culture, tidy towns and so on.  The county council, on the other hand, was much more legalistic and stuffy in its attitude to that type of engagement.  Much will depend on the functions the municipal districts will have and where their focus lies.  Such initiatives as annual awards nights, people of the year events, front garden competitions and so on - the types of activities that are run of the mill for a town council - are very useful in terms of community building.  The municipal districts will have to take on board some of those issues.  Otherwise, they will fall to community councils, which will not have even the minor administrative powers currently available to town councils.  These types of voluntary community fora can be important from the point of view of consolidating communities, but they will have to function at a much lower level than the town councils they might be replacing.</p></speech>

What we are seeking to achieve is an integrated system of administration with devolved functions at a municipal level.  We do not want a situation where separate councils would be established in a municipal district area; that flies in the face of what we are trying to achieve.  In order to eliminate duplication and administrative overhead, municipal districts will not be  involved in budgets and so on to the extent to which town councils have been.  We are aiming for a more integrated administrative system with proper devolved functions.</p><p>  As it stands, town councils account for 70% of all local authorities and 46% of councillors, but are responsible for only 7% of local government activity and 14% of the population.  We are all familiar with the arguments that can arise in regard to boundary changes.  Through the municipal district system, we will eliminate that type of disagreement at local government level.  I am interested in what functions the municipal districts will have, not in more administration.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the budgetary situation in Leixlip.  That is worked out every year and, especially in recent years under the troika, with reference to the general Government debt.  The county manager and his officials in Kildare, with the approval of the councillors, have no option, unfortunately, other than to make do with a ceiling on the allocation to town councils.  As we look forward to more flexibility in these matters from the middle of this month, I expect that town councils, like Leixlip, which have been prudent will be in a position to negotiate a better deal under the new municipal arrangements and in the context of county council budgetary arrangements.  I have seen a great deal of activity in town councils recently; in many cases, they are cleaning out the decks financially.  It is good that they have been prudent, but they also want the latitude to be able to spend money locally.  That will be worked out in a more flexible way, working with the county manager, as part of the budgetary process.</p></speech>

In fact, I have stated clearly that some are very tiny and effectively unsustainable.  Clearly, however, a district council, as most people understand it, is very different from what is being proposed here.  A district council tier would be autonomous, first and foremost, and that is where I see the major flaw in this legislation - that it fails to give people control over their own affairs at a level with which they can identify.</p> <p>That is the case in most organisations.  Most of the successful initiatives happen at a community level.  People trust the organisations at community level.  It is where people have chosen to live but the disappointing aspect of this opportunity for reform is that that is not the way it has played out.</p><p> On the general Government deficit, is the Minister telling us that restrictions in that regard will be relaxed once the programme has concluded next week?  Is he saying there will be a difference in that respect?  I am trying to understand it.  If the county councils and the local authorities are part of that general Government deficit and the purse strings are relaxed for local authorities with funds on deposit, how will that play out generally?  Will those restrictions be relaxed only for the town councils that will be disbanded or will that be the case generally?  For example, a good deal of funds from development contributions are sitting in bank accounts and cannot be spent because of that restriction.</p></speech>

At the end of the day much more flexibility will come into the system but it will be governed by what happens in Kildare County Council's budgetary process.  There was much less flexibility in recent years because the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform needed to know where every euro was being spent.  I suspect that in 2014 the county manager will have some more flexibility in terms of allocations to districts.</p><p>  Some 70 devolved additional functions are being given to municipal districts.  Some of those are minor, some major.  Many more distinct functions are going to municipal districts.  Seven councillors will be looking after the budgetary situation in Leixlip.  They will be getting some help from Celbridge, and I know the Deputy will look after them as well, but there will be seven local authority members in a small geographical area with a large population.  Obviously, the means and resources Kildare County Council will have, in conjunction with the municipal districts, in sorting out the budgetary arithmetic is a matter for the councils.</p></speech>

Councillors from Abbeyfeale, and I have nothing against councillors from Abbeyfeale, may be a little lost in Garryowen or some of the other districts.  In fairness to them, they have distinct problems in Abbeyfeale and other such areas but a councillor from the far-flung areas of west Limerick, down to Knocknagoshel, would have a different ethos and different priorities compared to the problems councillors must deal with in some of the suburbs of Limerick.</p></speech>

I am pleased that Deputy Stanley also respects them.  For example, it reiterates the recognition given in the Local Government Act 2001 to various historic charters for civic or ceremonial purposes.  Consistent with this approach provision for the use of the titles of Lord Mayor or Mayor in respect of the city is discontinued by the Bill.  Similarly, in the case of a merging authority in Limerick and Waterford, it will be open to the overall authority to adopt the title of Mayor in view of the fact that these will be city and county councils.</p><p>  The Government decided also that following the mergers of Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council the municipal districts which incorporate the metropolitan areas of these two cities may continue to use the titles of Mayor and Deputy Mayor.  This will provide an additional means of maintaining the identity of the cities in the context of the merged entities.  Deputy Stanley's amendments would seem to have the effect of removing this entitlement in the case of the metropolitan districts.  </p><p>  The Bill provides that it will be a matter of democratic choice on the part of the elected members in Limerick and Waterford, both at municipal district and plenary council level, to decide on the appropriate allocation of titles.  I consider that this is the most appropriate arrangement.  Overall, I am satisfied that the provisions of the Bill relating to the use of mayoral titles is appropriate and, therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

As the orders for local electoral areas will in future be made under section 23 of the Local Government Act 2001, this is the appropriate reference to be included in section 32(2) of the Local Government Act 1991.</p><p>  Amendments Nos. 28, 29 and 32, although relatively minor, deal with key provisions in the Bill setting out the legal position relating to the functions to be exercised by municipal district members under the new sub-county configuration.  Amendment No. 28 is necessary to make clear in section 63 of the Principal Act that the performance of functions by municipal district members relates to the performance of reserve functions in respect of districts as provided for in the new section 131A of the Principal Act to be inserted by section 21(3).</p><p>  Amendment No. 32 inserts a new section after section 131 of the Principal Act, which deals with the reserve functions of an elected council and provides a linking reference to the new Schedule 14A to be inserted by section 21(4).  The new Schedule 14A sets out a standard set of reserve functions to be performed exclusively by municipal district members in Part 1(a) of Schedule 14A, by municipal district members or by the plenary council in Part 2 of Schedule 14A, and by the local authority alone in Part 3 of Schedule 14A.</p> <p>The new Schedule 14A is significant as it is the first comprehensive listing, in a single Act, of the reserved functions of local authorities.  Subsection (2) of the new section 131B makes clear that the validity of the local authority function specified is not called into question because it is not listed in the new Schedule.  Amendment No. 29 is consequential on amendment No. 32.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to give discretion to cede powers solely to the members of the municipal district council.  This reverts to the point members were discussing earlier.  Is it the case that the county council will pretty much determine what the municipal district council will do, or will the latter have significantly more power to have control over its own affairs?  If people will not be travelling from one side to the other of a large county such as Cork but will deal with matters that primarily have importance to their own particular area, then they must have the power and a sufficient range of functions to so do.  The intention of the amendment is to provide certainty at district council level.</p></speech>

Section 21 of the Bill will insert a new section 131A and a new Schedule 14A in the 2001 Act.  Provision is made for certain reserved functions of a local authority to be performed in respect of each municipal district by the municipal district members concerned and others to be performed by either the municipal district members or by the overall local authority membership.  However, there is nothing to prevent a local authority membership from devolving greater responsibility to the municipal district in addition to those functions listed in the Bill.  Moreover, I note such municipal functions have been listed for the first time.  The reserved functions listed in Part 3 of Schedule 14A can only be performed by members of the local authority sitting in plenary formation.  These are functions relevant to the county as a whole.  However, this brings clarity and visibility to the powers of elected members for the first time, as well as eliminating the duplication of work between the town and county councils.  Councillors will now have a clear understanding of both their powers and their responsibilities.  I also point out the allocation of functions that is set out in the Bill was decided almost entirely on the basis of the recommendations of the local authority members associations' working group, which gave valuable advice to the Department and its officials.  I therefore am reluctant, because of the checks and balances and the debates between the Association of County and City Councils, ACCC, and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, to depart from this suite of functions.  However, there is nothing to stop the local authority, in plenary session, from deciding on the provision of additional functions to the municipal district level at a reserved level.</p><p>  On amendment No. 31, I am happy to give consideration to the suggestion in amendment No. 31 and to a possible change.  The word "consent" is highly prescriptive and with the wording, "A local authority may, by resolution and having received the prior consent", the question arises as to how one would change the consent were one to change one's mind subsequently.  While it is somewhat prescriptive, I am prepared to consider amendment No. 31 before Report Stage to ascertain whether it is possible to capture the spirit of what Deputy Murphy wishes to do and to give additional certainty to the municipal district functions.</p></speech>

My essential point is that municipal districts are almost penalised in the legislation.  While I do not believe that was the intention, it could be how it is applied.  I accept completely that some things must be done at a county level if that is the primary unit, such as more strategic matters or combined policies that should be applied universally in respect of housing or similar functions for which there must be overall rules.  The greatest level of discretion should apply outside of such cases.  As for local authorities having a culture of devolving functions, I do not know how to inculcate such a culture when it has not been there from the outset.  Area committees existed long before they were formalised in the Act of 2000 but all sorts of predictions were made that the world would come down on top of us were responsibilities devolved to areas because they did not have the right to make decisions.  It was suggested that it might have an impact on budgets or that the impression would be given that decisions had been made which would require subsequent rubber-stamping or reversal at county level.  An attempt must be made to overcome such a culture, which might be better changed by forcing the centre to have more respect for the periphery.</p></speech>

This is the reason I am trying to rebalance powers in favour of both the local level and the elected members.  While elected members also must have respect for one another, there has been a cultural change and shift, particularly in the community and voluntary sectors.  Over the years, suspicions have grown up on both sides of the argument in respect of local authority officials versus community representatives and I wish to try to eliminate that.  Putting the democratically elected council members centre stage in adopting the programmes and policy provides a significant shift in responsibilities and in respect of where power lies.  However, I agree completely with Deputy Murphy that a cultural change is required.  A better spirit of devolution and respect, manifested in a structured way, between the role of the elected members and the council officials would remove the need to put into legislation a great number of matters.  I hope this new legislation will help to develop such a spirit over a period.  Thereafter, it will be up to the councillors to use the power and responsibility they have for the first time.  The area committees were formed on a non-statutory basis and while they could make recommendations, they had no power or influence.  The difference between such committees and the municipal districts is that the latter will have power and opportunities to make decisions.</p></speech>

Elected members are to be more central to the development and oversight of policy at local level, and it is necessary to provide for a structure that can support the delivery of this wider and more substantial role.</p><p>  For a council to be effective, its business must be undertaken in a professional and respectful manner.  At the moment, there is no effective sanction on a member who is persistently disruptive or abusive at a meeting.  At best, the meeting can &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo; him or her, and require him or her to leave that meeting.  Should the member refuse to obey such a motion, and continue to be disruptive, the final outcome can only be a suspension of the meeting by the cathaoirleach.  This may be the intention all along, but it plays into the agenda of the disruptive member.  The Bill provides a mechanism section 52(c), in such circumstances, by inserting a new subparagraph (4) into Schedule 10(13), for the council to progressively reduce the expenses of a member where the behaviour persists at a meeting.</p><p>  On reflection, I consider it appropriate to extend this provision, allowing the members, where the sanctions heretofore have proved ineffective, to remove the disruptive member, initially for between one and three months, and if on return the behaviour is repeated within three months, for further suspensions of between three and six months.  Associated with the suspension will be suspension from facilities linked to meetings, including attendance at committee meetings, meetings of municipal district members, automatic right to receive copies of meeting papers, and the right to add his or her name to a call for a special meeting of the local authority.  This is a proportionate response to address persistent unacceptable behaviour, and will only come at the end of a process during which the member will have it made abundantly clear to him or her that the behaviour is, and has continued for some time, to be unacceptable.</p><p>  Elected members who disrupt meetings are doing the public no favour.  It may create a few column inches and enhance a profile, but time wasted because meetings are disrupted is a direct cost on the business community and householders who fund the council through rates and the local property tax, and an indirect cost through the delay in the transaction of the business of the local authority.  Councillors who have placed themselves in the position of not being able to represent the public or who are a cost on the local authority on account of their own behaviour cannot expect to be funded from public funds.  Therefore it is only appropriate that any elected member that has had to be suspended must face forfeiture of his or her representational payment and expenses for the period specified in the motion imposing the suspension.</p><p>  The proposed amendments Nos. 184 and 185 confirm that the suspension with a consequential cessation of payment of remuneration and expenses for the suspension period will be a reserved function.  The proposed amendment No. 33 confirms that the power to suspend a disruptive elected member will also extend to municipal district members&rsquo; meetings, as part of the overall provision in section 22 applying a range of provisions in the principal Act to meetings of municipal district members.  The suspension from the municipal district members meetings will not exclude the elected member from meetings of the council or committees of the council.  The proposed amendment No. 105 confirms that the extension of the suspension power to a committee or joint authority will only allow the suspension to apply to that body itself.</p><p>  By way of the proposed amendment No. 101, I am also amending the provision in the Bill imposing a sliding scale of penalties to any allowances for expenses incurred by the member concerned, by extending this to now include remuneration.  It is appropriate that the application of the sliding scale reductions should apply to all payments to the member who has been sufficiently disruptive to be the subject of this form of censure, and not just expenses.  The financial penalties will be incremental and therefore proportionate.</p><p>  The proposed amendment No. 98 provides clarification that a finding that a member caused a meeting to be adjourned, and which results in a reduction of payments, must have been the decision of a resolution at a meeting.  The proposed amendments Nos. 99 and 100 are necessary to ensure the correct drafting references to &ldquo;sub-paragraphs&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;paragraphs&rdquo;.</p><p>  The remaining proposed amendments Nos. 96, 102 and 104 are technical amendments consequential to the insertion of new text.</p></speech>

Reading what the Minister is proposing here one would think that council meetings down the country are a bit like the wild west.  We have all seen robust exchanges in town councils and county councils.  However, council meetings seldom have to be adjourned due to disruptive behaviour.  Much of this is wide open to interpretation by the cathaoirleach who is elected by the majority group.  This measure is wide open to abuse to penalise members of smaller parties and independents.  A cathaoirleach backed by a majority grouping could impose these heavy penalties on such people.  Over the years, I have seen people acting the clown and wasting time at council meetings, but they were not from the smaller groupings.  They might kick the table to get attention and grab a headline, hoping the local media will pick up on it.  They then go home and the job is done for another month.  We have all sat through such frustrating sessions.</p><p>  In general, however, there are robust exchanges at council meetings.  Councillors argue their case according to their political philosophy and represent the community.  It is therefore unnecessary to impose these serious penalties on councillors.  By and large, councillors of all parties are committed to their civic duties.  They are there to represent the public.  If they behave robustly at times, a cathaoirleach - who may not like them for whatever reasons, personal or otherwise - may impose penalties like these by ramming them through.  We will be opening up something that has the potential to penalise members of smaller parties and independents in particular.</p></speech>

I do not recognise the kind of behaviour the Minister has described, although perhaps it is just that the local authorities I was on were not like that.  There certainly were robust exchanges but there was rarely a need to ask somebody to leave the meeting.  If they were asked to leave, they generally did so.  There may well be a perception that things are different.  I would not have a problem with it if I thought there was an appeals mechanism or some way of having a different evaluation of it, other than within the local authority.  It is open to abuse, however.  For example, the behaviour could be described as unacceptable because of positions raised, rather than being disruptive.  When I chaired a council meeting and had to ask somebody to leave, it is not a nice feeling.  I fully accept that there is limited capacity to impose a sanction when somebody is not allowing the meeting to continue, but that is rare enough.</p><p>  The proposed measure is heavy-handed and there is no potential counterbalance.  I am concerned that the measure could be abused.  I would like to see some sort of control or appeals mechanism so that the proposed powers cannot be abused.  As things stand, there is a serious prospect of abuse.</p></speech>

However, a deterrent is required for a small number of examples around the country where, if officials were behaving the same as councillors, they would probably be suspended.  There is no mechanism whatsoever to oblige elected members to behave properly after a due process that has gone on for a considerable period.  It can only be applied at the end of a process of members deciding that behaviour is unacceptable.  It is a reserved function of the entire council and has nothing to do with the powers of the chair.  The chair may have asked a particular member to recant and the member might refuse to do so.  If the member comes into the following meeting and recants, there is no difficulty.  There is great flexibility but the entire membership of the council is involved in this, not just one individual.</p> <p>In some local authorities, public representatives are in some cases preventing local authority meetings from happening because of their behaviour.  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

We all know some councils are becoming dysfunctional because of the actions of certain individuals.  There is no mechanism given to the local authority.  I have received representations across all parties and none for some mechanism that would allow a council to do its business, and I have become very frustrated.  I welcome the inclusion of this measure in the Bill.  I agree with Deputy Murphy that there could be an appeals mechanism.  We could have a look at it at a later stage to see whether we need an appeals mechanism in case it was abused.  I respect of the integrity of councillors and believe they will be able to use this quite efficiently.  I do not envisage any councillors using it as to dampen down robust debate.  It is a problem where elements are using to stop local government from functioning.</p></speech>

I know of one council that has not met since last February because of the behaviour of a councillor.  The purpose of the measure is to capture that.  It will not be abused in any way.  It is the majority of the council that must make this provision, but if the Deputy feels that two-thirds of the council need to agree this decision, so be it.  We will have a look at that.

I think that is self-explanatory.  The Minister commented earlier about the forthcoming local government Bill.  I am sure he is aware that many councils throughout the country have yet to meet to discuss their estimates in the absence of a clear indication of commitments in respect of the local property tax and the provision of water charges and in the knowledge that, for example, there are 9,000 appeals on the books in Dublin in respect of re-evaluation of commercial premises and the difficulties that exist there in the absence of an overhaul of that system of funding.  The amendment asks that municipal districts have the power to vary the local property tax and the commercial rate in order to carry out specific projects agreed among themselves.</p></speech>

The intent of that is clear.  It devolves to each municipal district the power to take into consideration its own area.  Such businesses may have significant or lesser ability, but the people to judge that are the democratically elected councillors in that municipal district.  That is why I am putting forward this amendment.  I will bring forward a further amendment on Report Stage in respect of section 29.</p></speech>

Something similar was included in the 2000 Act and I do not believe it was ever used.  It would most definitely come down to the judgment of the local authority members because in essence it would mean increasing the amount, which would probably be done very selectively.</p><p>  This section will be quite difficult anyway as it tries to align different rates where there is a former town council or where a county and city council are amalgamated.  It provides for ten years to do that.  There will be difficulties anyway.  The Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, asked us to seek this change to allow for such flexibility.</p><p>  On the section overall, is it intended to send out two or more separate rates bills?  How will that work in practice?  I would expect considerable resentment if a larger amount is to be paid with a reduced service provided.</p></speech>

That being given, I ask that the Minister accept amendment No. 40 on the basis there will be a consolidation of the rate across an entire county.  There are substantial differences, and as the Minister will be aware, the rate set by many town councils would be much lower than the county rate.  The amendment is tabled in that spirit.  We accept it will be harmonised over time.  This seeks to give the municipal district members a strong input into that because it will cause problems, particularly where there is a variation of 20% or 25% between the town council rate and the overall county council rate.</p></speech>

This was something I mentioned in the debate on the Bill I brought before the House a few weeks ago.  This would be along the lines of the model introduced in the North where there is a 15% surcharge based on turnover or size.  Municipal districts should be allowed to consider applying such a levy to address the continued decline in commercial and social activity in town centres.</p></speech>

The council varies by plus or minus 15% and if the municipal district varied by a further percentage, it would result in greatly diminished yields.  I understand the importance of local authorities having reserved functions allowing them to vary this rate.  However, the same people at the municipal district level will attend the plenary session of the council.  They are not different people.  Many people do not understand that or do not want to.  The municipal district councils have a say in budgets and financial matters, and they have a say in proposals to be made.  They are the same people who will be present at the plenary session of the council where many of these matters will be decided.</p><p>  There will be a single rating authority and a single valuation list with one single unified annual rate on valuation, ARV.  It is the intention that the new structure of local government, including the establishment of municipal districts, will provide a coherent approach to rates and charges countywide having regard to funding requirements of each municipal district.</p><p>  I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 37 and 38 relating to large commercial entities.  Rates are levied on the independent valuations applied by the Valuation Office.  The proposal set out in the amendments tabled by Deputies Cowen and Stanley would result in a significant change in the operation of the rating system and would threaten the principle of equity on which both the rating and valuation systems are placed.  A system that must have regard to economic factors on an ongoing basis could be considered under the Valuation Act.  Local authorities need to have certainty regarding the funding of local government.  It is not appropriate to use economic factors alone as a basis for increasing or decreasing these funding opportunities for local government.  We need to have a stable basis for funding local government.</p><p>  Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 propose to provide that the base year adjustments should be agreed with the municipal district members in the area where the base year adjustment is to apply.  It is likely the boundaries of the new municipal districts will differ from the former rating authority areas or specified areas.  Therefore, this proposal may not be practical in that context.</p><p>  My amendment No. 41, however, seeks to ensure that municipal district members are consulted annually on the determination of the base year adjustment to be applied.  The amendment ensures that where an area of a former rating authority is included in a municipal district, the municipal district members are to be consulted on the base year adjustment to apply there.</p></speech>

I accept this is about valuation and all the rest and cannot be accepted.  However, it flags the very serious issue of the large commercial entities.  It comes down to the planning decisions to position large commercial entities on the periphery of towns, which are displacing jobs and ruining the viability of town centres.  Something needs to happen on that.  There will be another opportunity elsewhere to make some changes in that regard.  Car parking leads to the big distortion given that a big shopping centre on the periphery of the town offers free parking and typically there is inadequate provision in the town centre.  There needs to be a community gain.  If these entities are approved, that community gain could be through delivering better car parking arrangements for the areas that are going to be disadvantaged.  We are seeing it all over the place.  We are very often losing the passive security in a town centre of having shops occupied and we are losing the commercial rates from them as well.  There is an issue in that regard, but it may well be for other legislation.</p></speech>

I presume that the Minister is trying to achieve consistency across all local authorities but, where there are vacant properties in Waterford city, for example, the situation might not be the same as that in Dublin or Cork, where there is high demand and high levels of business.  In Waterford, city centre locations are struggling and I am not sure that imposing the rebate on vacant properties is the solution.  Will the Minister consider devolving this power to local authorities?  I put this matter to city managers when they appeared before the committee.</p></speech>

Local councillors in the new local authorities would be best placed to decide on whether a 50% rebate should apply in their areas.</p></speech>

My party has concerns about the matter.  During an economic downturn, we need incentives to get business premises back into use, not penalties while they are empty.  Loans are outstanding on many of the properties in question and there is a high level of negative equity because people bought at boom time prices.  I know some such people, as I am sure every other elected representative present does.</p></speech>

One cannot but notice them.  People are not leaving premises vacant for any reason other than insufficient income.  If it is a question of applying no rates remission for vacant properties, what would be the knock-on effect?  There would be no loss of income, as the local authorities would be flat out going through the District Court trying to get money that is not there in the first place.  Deputy Stanley is right, in that it is a question of how to turn this situation around and use those premises.  Some of this relates to the car parking issue, which is decimating some areas.  I do not see how there could be a potential loss of revenue.  In fact, this provision could cost a fortune in terms of administration, District Court time and so on without accruing a great deal of additional income, given the levels of vacancy.</p></speech>

A business needs a clean slate when it starts.  The situation is difficult enough and profit margins are tight.  At a time when we are trying to create jobs, this will create penalties.</p></speech>

I understand what the Minister is trying to achieve in the amalgamated valuation list.  The Minister referred earlier to an entire council area being taken over by one local authority.  He will be aware that the city and county councils in Waterford are amalgamating.  The Minister is on record as saying that in that scenario he would not like to see rates rising.  The additional complication of the revaluation under the Valuation Act 2001 is resulting in serious increases in rates for Waterford city businesses, particularly retail businesses.  While I am aware that the Valuation (Amendment) Bill 2012 comes within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in the interests of fairness and ensuring a successful amalgamation in terms of bringing stakeholders with us, including those who pay rates and have been for many years contributing revenue to the local authorities, there should be no further increases in rates during the amalgamation process, as this would cause serious problems for business.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position in this regard.</p></speech>

There will always be winners and losers in revaluation.  In the case of the local authorities in Waterford, 56% of businesses have been classified as losers and the remainder as winners.  One always hears from the losers and not the winners.  I am unable to do anything in the context of this legislation to allay Deputy Coffey's concerns in relation to this matter.  However, I have engaged and will continue to engage with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on the matter to see what we can do alleviate the pressure in the short term on those businesses whose rates bills have been substantially increased.</p><p>  In regard to what is proposed in relation to the amalgamation in Waterford, which is a separate issue, I am anxious to harmonise the rates situation in Waterford in a quicker timeframe than the ten years set out in order to give more certainty to businesses there.  I hope to harmonise rates bills downwards rather than upwards.</p></speech>

Perhaps the committee might take up this issue as it is going to affect other local authorities and is related to the Valuation (Amendment) Bill 2012.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Howlin, could be invited to this committee at a future date to discuss the implications of that legislation.</p></speech>

Many other parts of the country have not been touched.  This  committee could investigate why this might be the case, following which we could make recommendations to the Minister.</p></speech>

We are looking at that with a view to an amendment later in the process.  With regard to the harmonisation of rates and the valuation system, I am not in a position to deal with it in this legislation because there is a Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012.  That Bill is going through a long process in the Houses of the Oireachtas and there are many good provisions in it, so it will make an enormous difference to the businesses the Deputy mentioned.  I hope that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will be in a position to proceed with that.  I also hope representatives of the Valuation Office could come before the full committee to have a conversation about issues relating to valuation, as they are important.  There is an opportunity through the Bill that is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas to address some of those matters.</p></speech>

Local authorities can play an important role in community development but this must be done in an inclusive way.  Amendment No. 55 states:<blockquote>In page 43, line 32, after &quot;inclusion&quot; to insert &quot;and address causes of social exclusion&quot;.</blockquote>It is important that such a provision is included.  Amendment No. 56 states:<blockquote>In page 43, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:&quot;(g) the allocation of resources to areas of most social and economic disadvantage, and<br />(h) the specific needs of minority groups and hard to reach groups in relation to social inclusion.&quot;.</blockquote>This would give local councillors discretion in how they target resources.</p></speech>

Essentially, it echoes some of the points made.  The wording positions one community development committee at county level but I am concerned because community development happens at a much lower level.  This changes the nature of much of what is happening.</p><p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan wanted me to speak about what happens at Dublin City Council level with regard to many of the projects that are run and enhanced by the people with a direct impact.  The projects would not function without their input.  These include youth projects, after-school initiatives and cr&egrave;ches in areas that may, for example, experience very high levels of unemployment, including generational unemployment.  In essence, the point the Deputy wanted me to make is that there must be involvement by those communities within any kind of community development element.  That is critical if community development projects are to be about community and not economic development.</p><p>  There should be a development committee or focus at municipal level that is about building the capacity of communities.  At a lower level it is much easier to understand what is required, and that varies around the country, depending on demographics, the wealth of an area and the capacity of an area to deal with issues.  Having one committee per county - except if there is approval of the Minister - will position this issue in the wrong place.  I am interested in the Minister's view of community development, and perhaps I have a different view on what is intended by these committees than what the Minister proposes.</p></speech>

I ask that there be at least three local authority members on such a board and that one of those be the chairperson of the board.  In essence, this reflects the thrust of the proposition on the part of the Minister for integration of those companies into local authorities.  If this is the case, there should be a maximum amount of possible accountability on the part of the board and how it disburses funds or agrees a plan to address the social exclusion areas, as detailed by Deputy Stanley.  I would have no problem with the composition if it was on that basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.591" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12013120300016#P01100"><p>I indicated that we are trying to strengthen local government functions, especially in economic and community development.  In particular, I referenced the provisions for alignment of local and community development with local authorities.  Most people are beginning to accept that we must have people at local level, either on a voluntary, community or statutory basis, working together.  There is much interaction anyway but we want to ensure this can be underpinned by statute.  This is the first time the community and voluntary sector will be recognised in statute as part of the structures of local government, although many within the community and voluntary sector do not realise that.  This will not be an <i>ad hoc</i> committee and it will not be set up by a private company for the purpose of carrying out particular operational matters for a Europe-funded programme.  It will be underpinned in statute with a relationship with local government for the first time.</p><p>  The community projects mentioned by Deputy Murphy will be protected under these structures, and it is not a case of dismantling structures that are working effectively in the north side of Dublin city, where Deputy O'Sullivan has a keen interest.  There is close work with local community development programmes, and that will continue to operate in a seamless fashion under these structures.</p> <p>There will be no fear there.  In fact, there is &euro;47 million to be spent on the local community development programme next year.  There is effectively a 1% cut, which can be found in administration.  We will protect the front-line projects for next year, and the 1,650 people who work in the sector will continue to do that.  There will be no difficulty whatsoever.  When one hears some of the background noise in the rural areas, one would think all the structures we have in place are going to be dismantled.  They are not, but they and local government, under the alignment proposal, will have to work more closely together.</p><p> Deputy Stanley's amendment refers to addressing the causes of poverty and social exclusion.  I agree with him.  We will look at the spirit of what he says in the amendment and address that with amendments later in the process with a view to capturing that.  The local community and development plans that will be drawn up will have to undergo a major consultation process with municipal districts, and the municipal members in plenary session will have to adopt the plan.  However, a great deal of consultation will have to take place with the community sector.  I envisage that there will be a strong relationship with that sector.  Again, however, there will have to be an enhanced cultural change at local authority level to deal with the local community sector.  Over the years there has been a breakdown in the relationship between the community sector and local government and we are trying to bring that back together.  They must work with each other in a more structured way and take each other's concerns into account.  The democratically elected persons will be the final arbiters on policy and the disbursement of money.</p><p> There are many people working in the community and voluntary sector at present, particularly in private companies, who do not fully understand their obligations under company law and employment law.  There is a burden on them now, at the end of programmes and the start of others, to realise that they have these responsibilities under company law, which perhaps they should have known before they took on the responsibilities.  I know there are people leaving companies because of those responsibilities.  These will now be handed over or taken more on board by the local authority structures and the people in the community sector will be able to get with the job they are best at, which is animating projects and bringing forward proposals and projects to the local community development committee, LCDC, for the purpose of financing and implementing them, based on the local community development plan which will be approved by the councillors.</p><p> Deputy Cowen mentioned the membership of the committee.  Due to the bottom-up approach under the rural development programme, there must be a majority from the community on the LCDC.  If there are 15 members, for example, eight of them must be from the community sector and seven from the statutory bodies, including the local authority.  We have three members in mind as a proposal at present.  That could be two councillors and a director of services.  We are leaving that flexible to allow the local authorities to decide what the combination would be.  However, certain statutory bodies in a local area would have to be represented on these committees as they will have a huge input, such as the HSE, SOLAS and the local enterprise boards.  Equally, however, the community sector will have a big input, so it will have a majority of representation.  If there are 15 members, for example, they will decide who will be the chairperson among themselves.  It need not go to the full plenary session of the council.</p></speech>

Obviously, a major change is taking place.  I have been a member of two local development companies, one of the original companies and a later one.  With regard to the corporate entity, I am aware of some companies whose members are now finding themselves with responsibilities that they did not realise they had.  To clarify, the funding will come to the local authority, the local authority will be the corporate body and there will not be another corporate body outside it.</p></speech>

This will ensure the full integration between planning and economic development through coherent regional spatial and economic strategies and these will be formulated by new regional assemblies in collaboration, in particular, with the various enterprise and economic development agencies.  This will deliver integrated national and regional co-ordination in spatial planning and economic development in order to provide a broad framework underpinning the enhanced role of local government in economic development.</p><p>  Among the main changes to the planning Acts are those made by the following amendments.  Under amendment No. 120 the new regional assemblies are being provided with the power to make regional spatial and economic strategies in place of regional planning guidelines, thus providing for a strengthened economic dimension.  It provides for the insertion of a new section 22A to provide for the necessary consultation, assistance and co-operation by all relevant public bodies, namely the key Departments, such as that of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, including bodies under their aegis with regional assemblies in the preparation of regional spatial and economic strategies including support and follow through in the implementation of those strategies.  There will therefore be a statutory requirement on all relevant public bodies and agencies to participate fully in the adoption of the regional strategies and critically to follow through in their own functions on the measures to which they have subscribed in their strategies.  It also provides that in preparing their own strategies, plans and programmes, all relevant public bodies at national, regional and local level must ensure they are consistent with the national regional objectives set out in the national spatial strategy and the regional spatial and economic strategies.  This is to ensure that both the regional assemblies and the relevant public bodies engaging in a process of dialogue and policy development in the formulation of the regional spatial and economic strategies while also informing each other in a two way process that will result in clearer more integrated policies and actions.  This will deliver improved co-ordination of the regional economic development policies and investment across the State and private sector in general.</p><p>  It also provides for the strengthened economic dimension in the content and objectives of regional spatial and economic strategies, including the requirement to support the economic policies and objectives of the Government in this regard.  For example, it provides that a regional economic strategy will address <i>inter alia </i>enhancement of overall regional economic performance by identifying the strengths and opportunities, having regard to economic and employment trends; proposals for augmenting the economic performance of the region across all relevant economic sectors; enhancement of regional innovation capacity, including investment in research and development.</p> <p>It will also address proposals for augmenting the economic performance of the region across all relevant economic sectors; enhancement of regional innovation capacity, including investment in research and development; identifying the regional attributes most essential to enhancing regional economic performance, such as the quality of the environment, qualities of cities and towns, the infrastructure, and the social, community and cultural facilities; and proposals to maintain and-or augment such attributes in such a manner as will be implemented under the strategy through the activities of relevant public bodies, private sector investment and the community.  It also provides for the insertion of a new section 25A to provide for reporting every two years on progress on implementation of the strategies by the public bodies, by each local authority and the regional assemblies.  Together with an important role for the National Oversight and Audit Commission, it will make recommendations to the Minister on the relevant measures to further support implementation of the strategies.</p><p> It provides for the insertion of a new section 268A to provide for transitional provisions consequent on the enactment of the Local Government Bill, such as providing for a successor authority consequent on the dissolution of certain local authorities and the town councils; providing for all acts duly done and decisions duly made continuing to have all such force and effect; and providing for the purpose of completing any matter outstanding by the planning authority for the local government area concerned as the successor authority.  It also provides, in section 21, for transitional arrangements in order that the existing regional planning guidelines 2010-22 prepared and published by a dissolved regional authority shall continue to have effect until a regional, spatial and economic strategy is prepared and adopted by the new regional assembly.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 147 to 169 are consequential amendments to the provision of regional, spatial and economic strategies in place of the regional planning guidelines.  These consequential amendments are to provide primarily for: the substitution of regional assembly for regional authority; regional spatial and economic strategy instead of regional planning guidelines; and the National Transport Authority, NTA, for the Dublin Transport Authority, DTA, on foot of the change in name to the NTA pursuant to section 30 of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, with effect from 1 December 2009.  Accordingly, amendments Nos. 147 to 149 provide for an updated definition for the Dublin Transport Authority and an associated new definition for the National Transport Authority.  Amendments Nos. 57 to 59 and 113 are accordingly providing for consequential amendments to sections 35 and 57 of the Local Government Bill to provide for the substitution of regional, spatial and economic strategy for regional planning guidelines.</p></speech>

Does that pose a question in respect of Report Stage?  Much of it was anticipated but it is quite a large section and I would have liked more time to give it further consideration.  The Dublin and mid-east authority has worked well in respect of the spatial strategy.  One reasons is the diversity of membership.  It does not work so well at official level.  The engagement at council level worked well.  I could see a change in culture in terms of the development plans where there was a national spatial strategy and regional guidelines linking with the development plans.  It fell down at local level where there was deviation when people were dealing with the practical issue of land being rezoned.  That must be closely monitored.  Perhaps we need more checks and balances at county level where it functions well.</p><p>  The expansion into other regions is good and the linkage of land use and transport planning is essential and positive.  I would prefer to see regional authorities or regional assemblies elected.  It is a better way and it creates a system of checks and balances.  Nominations onto the regional authorities will be very large if large numbers are nominated from each local authority but we will not get diversity if we have an equal number coming from each county.</p><p>  Deputy Kevin Humphreys made the point about the rural imbalance in the local government system.  The imbalance will be carried on if we proceed in this way.  Some local authorities will have been brought up to the minimum of 18.  Where two people are nominated, using the western region as an example, there will be a rural bias in terms of strategic planning.  That will not necessarily produce a good outcome.  Most of the land that will be rezoned will be in city districts or large urban centres.  Where there is an imbalance in respect of the rural focus, we will not get the outcome we are getting in the Dublin and mid-east region.  They are compatible areas and there is a Dublin focus in the mid-east region.</p><p>  It is not clear in the wording of some of the amendments whether planning authority refers to councillors or officials.  Who will be engaging?  This is a concern I have in a number of sections.  I am pleased to see the phrase "consistent with" used because "have regard to" was meaningless.  I also have concerns about references to being consulted at local election level, which does not mean anything.  Using the term "consistent with" should be included because a spatial strategy should be consistent with the national spatial strategy.  I presume written submissions also includes e-mail.  Perhaps the Minister can reply on that point.  I presume that is not a problem with definitions.</p><p>  We must seriously examine the expertise required at each local authority level in respect of strategic environmental assessment.  I do not have a difficulty with them being done but I would rather see a roving team, for want of a better description, carrying them out.  </p></speech>

It needs monitoring and consideration.  It does not necessarily need a change in the legislation but it poses questions.  Local authorities want to comply with legal requirements but sometimes, in doing so, they lose sight of, or do not have the ability to deal with, the spirit of what was intended.</p> <p>I refer to relevant planning authorities and the regional authority.  I would like that defined.  When we talk about the relevant planning authorities, about what aspect of them are we talking?  Is it the planners?  Does it exclude councillors?  Very often one sees something very late in the day and we had experience of that in one of the early plans in regard to the Dublin region and mid-east region where one location was designated for major development.  That plan was overturned at council level.  Had there been an input from both planners and councillors, I think there would have been a better outcome, so I need a definition of that.</p><p> I refer to the local area plan.  I have seen the same pattern of behaviour in one particular development plan in Kildare quite recently.  All of the land will be zoned at LAP level rather than at county level, where one would set out the broad framework.  I am almost speaking against the point I made earlier but I am all in favour of local input.  However, the area committee or, in this case, the municipal authority will work on the particular plan which will go to the full council.  The area committee or the municipal authority will have done all the work on it.  If it deviates from the plan adopted by the council, it will run into serious difficulties.  I do not know how one would remedy this.  The council will want the municipal district to do the work on it but it must be consistent at council and at regional levels.  There is a fault line there.  I do not know how I would frame an amendment to remedy that but there could be problems at district council level.</p><p> I have seen the same behaviour in terms of wanting to rezone piles of land outside the national spatial strategy.  The culture has not changed.  We have to change the culture by putting some checks and balances in place which force it back to municipal level if it is not consistent with something or other.  It will come down to changing behaviour.  Unless we change the behaviour, we will get the same outcomes and the same nonsensical disconnect between zoning land and the consequences of zoning it in the wrong places and in the wrong quantities.  Further up the line, the Department will have to deal with it because it will not be consistent with something or other.  There is a fault line there and something further is required.</p><p> Section 58 refers to the objectives of providing physical, economic and social infrastructure in a manner that promotes balanced regional development.  Are we talking about balanced regional development within those regions or between the regions?</p></speech>

Where is the oversight?  Is it at national spatial strategy level?  I can see myself proposing a few amendments on Report Stage.</p><p>  It is positive that the National Transport Authority will be involved.  That is critical.  Are there other essential services which should be part of that framework?  I see the need to link land use and transport planning but I wonder about some of the social services.  This may well be about physical development but we see the relationship between many of the social supports required at community level.  For example, will there be any facility to link or even redesign the health service in order that it is co-terminous with the regions?  There is no point having physical plans if one does not have the ability to put the social supports in place in line with the development that will take place.</p></speech>

I mention something which came up a bit on Second Stage - I think Deputy Humphreys and others mentioned it.  The two local authority members per constituent authority will be on the regional assemblies.  It does not reflect the population so we will look at that in the orders.  The point would have been made that a large local authority would have the same representation as a small one, which would not be exactly fair.</p></speech>

We will reflect the fact that population concerns raised on Second Stage might be reflected in the membership of the local authorities.</p><p>  Even though there are a lot of amendments and I suppose what we are doing is updating the language and the changes to reflect the fact there are regional economic spatial strategies.  The economic dimension is much stronger in these amendments.  Ultimately, it is a devolved function to the municipal level in terms of the local area plan.  We cannot have it every way.  The councillors have to take responsibility and, notwithstanding what Deputy Murphy said, they must be consistent with the regional and national spatial strategies and their own development plan which, ultimately, will be adjudicated on by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>  The elected members will have to be responsible and be guided in the advice they get, but equally I would like to see councillors getting independent advice from time to time on matters like planning and legal issues.  They do not always have to rely on officials.  Officials might have a view which might not exactly conform with what councillors might want and they might have good reason for it as well.  It works both ways but, ultimately, there is a responsibility on the elected members to make the decisions at the lowest possible level and the nearest place to the citizen where it impacts.  That is a summary of the concerns Deputy Murphy expressed and of the amendments we are seeking to oppose.  We are trying to focus on a stronger economic dimension to the planning Acts.</p><p>  On the community side, there will be a national community policy and a local authority community plan but there will have to be some consistency across the board.  Not one size fits all but nevertheless there will be certain principles at national level which we would expect from a funding flow point of view and we would have national objectives we want to achieve.  That will permeate down to the regional level.</p></speech>

The local area plan has been very useful, especially in urban areas.  The control and balance are in the order plans are dealt with - the regional plan is taken first, followed by the local authority plan and then the local area plan.  One has regional assemblies, local authorities and local area plans and the change in the wording from "having regard" to "be consistent with" will be useful.  The wording "having regard" is just too loose.  If one begins with the hierarchy of regional, local authority and local plans, the local area plan has to be consistent with the local authority and regional plans.</p></speech>

Those who were councillors for a number of years would have known that the term "having regard to" was widely used and sprinkled over everything, a little like confetti at a wedding that one could shake off when going to the reception.  One could then get down to the serious business.  This is a welcome change.</p><p>  The question of numbers will arise later, but I have another concern that I expressed on Second Stage.  If one only has two representatives from each local authority, the two dominant political parties, whatever they may be, will control these positions.  One must try to achieve a political balance.  The Minister knows that members of smaller parties and Independents may comprise more than 50% of the members of a local authority.  I know that tends to happen at town council level, but one third of the membership of the county council could be comprised of members of smaller parties and Independents, none of whom will ever see the inside of the door of a regional assembly or have an input into its meetings.  I would like to see the Minister and his officials come up with some mechanism so as not to exclude them.  Under the current system, at least 40% of the representatives of the electorate will be excluded.  We must respect their mandate.  I might not necessarily agree with the views of Independents and members of smaller parties, but there is a point in taking on board the need for broader representation.</p></speech>

It will mean that in the case of a great many local authorities there will be more than two representatives.  In other words, only a small number of local authorities will have two representatives.  The idea that a political party or Independents will not be represented in a regional assembly will not come into play.  Following the results of a local election, arrangement are entered into and coalitions formed.  I believe Deputy Brian Stanley was involved in one such arrangement.</p></speech>

It should be done because there is always some plan or other being decided on at any given time.</p><p>  It is very important to get this section right, as we cannot do what we did before.  What was done in the past led to scenarios where we had to pick up the pieces such as in ghost estates and land in inappropriate locations being zoned, as if it did not have a cost to society.  Such zoning had a very dramatic cost in terms of servicing land for development, the provision of water and wastewater services, roads, public transport and social services and so on.  The composition of the boards of regional authorities matters, as it has major significance in decision making.  Because of the way it was handled in my local authority area - I do not think it was too different from the way it was done in other areas - some of us who were in favour of strategic planning were branded as the "NIMBYs" or the "anti-crowd", whereas much of what some of us were saying had a great deal of merit.  If it had been replicated, perhaps we might not have ended up with the disaster that happened.  The composition of regional assemblies matters if we do not want to find ourselves in the same position.  I do not understand the level of resistance to electing individuals to take that responsibility.  It produces a good range of checks.  We are talking about three regional assemblies which must dovetail with the local authorities.  People could put themselves forward in both elections and one could find a mechanism for them to do this.  I accept that the Minister is looking to find a better balance.  If he is not going to agree to hold separate elections to the regional assemblies, it is better that he seek to achieve a more proportionate balance.  The regional assemblies will be of critical importance to the balanced and sustainable development of the country.</p></speech>

Equally, we have amended the corruption Acts to deal with the issues arising from the various tribunals to ensure that if people are caught, they will face a much more severe penalty than in the past.  If I am devolving responsibility to elected members who have a mandate from the people, I want to see as much power vested in them as I possibly can give them.  I do not want power to be centralised but localised and regionalised.  One must trust those who have been elected by the people.  With all due respect, what the Deputy is suggesting is that the councillors from the major parties who were members of the regional authorities were in some way contaminated and had no mandate.</p> <p>We have to trust people who are elected.  There will be punishment and penalties if something untoward goes on.  They have to be consistent with their development plans, their regional spatial strategies and the national spatial strategy.  Many checks and balances have to be adhered to.  I have decided not to provide for directly elected regional assemblies at this time because I want to see what will happen in Dublin.  The plebiscite on having a directly elected mayor that will take place in Dublin will have an important impact on the regional dimension of Dublin.  It is obvious that the extent of the powers and responsibilities of that individual will have an impact on the regional dimension, especially on the east coast.  If the people of Dublin vote in favour of having a directly elected mayor, I think it will lead to a newly invigorated regional dimension.  I expect it would ultimately lead to a directly elected regional authority.  That might be replicated in other parts of the country.  The fundamental decision about reforming local government in the regional sense will be dictated to a fair extent by the result of the plebiscite in Dublin.</p></speech>

The Minister can address it all together.  I think the election of a mayor for Dublin would be very welcome, if that is what the people decide in the plebiscite.  I ask the Minister to have a look at the time period.  If the people of Dublin vote next year in favour of a single mayor for the four local authorities, they will have to wait until 2019 for that to happen.  Perhaps the Minister will get an opportunity to look at that.  I think it far too long to have to wait for a reform.  If the people of Dublin vote in favour of this proposal in 2014, I suggest they should be allowed to directly elect a mayor for the Dublin area much earlier than 2019.</p></speech>

To facilitate and co-ordinate local authority activities with those of relevant public authorities, the strategic policy committee may invite the attendance of public authorities at a meeting of the committee to assist the committee in policy development.  The chair of a strategic policy committee will have discretion as to whether to report to the full council on a failure or refusal of a public authority to attend.  If such a refusal or failure is reported, the committee must also advise the council of the reasons for non-attendance given by the body.  In this amendment, we are making an effort to enable local authorities to bring in people in the public arena who are not part of local government at the moment if they wish to do so.  At the moment, that cannot happen unless the amending Acts in the relevant Departments are amended by the other Ministers.  If I am waiting around for that to happen, it might take some time.  In the meantime, I want to name and shame them if they do not come in.</p></speech>

(1) A local authority to which this section applies may establish by resolution a committee in respect of a local electoral area or of 2 or more adjoining such areas or any other area in its administrative area to be known by some appropriate name followed by the words &lsquo;Area Committee&rsquo;, or by such other title, as may be designated by the authority. <br />(2) This section applies to the following local authorities: <br />(a) Cork City Council;<br />(b) Dublin City Council;<br />(c) Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council;<br />(d) Fingal County Council;<br />(e) Galway City Council;<br />(f) South Dublin County Council.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote>In the published Bill, section 50 of the principal Act was mistakenly deleted.  Section 50 provides that city and county councils may establish area committees for a local electoral area or group of such areas.  It will be necessary to continue to provide such a provision for those local authorities where new municipal districts will not be established.  These authorities are set out in the new subsection (2) of section 50.  This relates to some city authorities.  Area committees will not be required where municipal districts are being established.</p></speech>

We have also asked them how they envisage local government in general developing in the municipal district concept.  I have an open mind on how the system will operate.  It appears, however, that the geographical entity we are seeking to create in a municipal sense is a good approach.  Again, this will be a matter for people to decide in May when they are asked whether they want to have a directly elected mayor of Dublin.  Their response will open up many additional reforms for the Dublin region and other major urban areas that have been identified in the recent Boundary Commission report.  While this issue is open for discussion, we must make a fundamental decision about what powers and responsibilities the directly elected mayor will have in Dublin in the event that people in Dublin vote for that option next May.</p></speech>

I do not know from where the requirement to treat registered political parties differently from independents and small parties with less than 20% of total membership comes.  It is not democratic.  It is unclear from subsection (c)(i) and (ii) which size a registered political party must be.  Subsection (c)(i) refers to a figure of 20%.  Does this threshold also hold in subsection (c)(ii)?  What is wrong with a system of allocation based on proportionality following a democratic election?  Under the provision, as worded, political parties will be treated differently from political groupings.  One has a wide variety of groups at local level, including single groups consisting of small political parties and independents.  Such variety is positive in terms of diversity.  I strongly oppose the section, which is the reason for the amendment.</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy is correct that there is a danger of corporate policy groups becoming unwieldy.  The unintended consequence of the amendment would be that it would remove the requirement that chairpersons of strategic policy committees, SPCs, be members of a corporate policy group, CPG.  As the corporate policy group has the brief to manage the flow of business of the council and ensure an integrated approach is taken to business, its membership must include the chairpersons of the various strategic policy committees.</p><p>  I have often believed that where the leaders of the political parties and groups are not represented on the corporate policy group, the group will often operate as a secret society and will not keep others fully informed.  My intention in this provision was to address this issue.  However, I do not want the unintended consequence to which Deputy Murphy alludes to arise, nor do I want corporate policy groups to become unwieldy with most members of the council on them.  While my intentions were honourable, I do not believe the measure will work in practice.  I will, therefore, remove the provision and find other more appropriate arrangements.  I will introduce the relevant amendments later.</p></speech>

The membership of the latter includes the chairpersons of all strategic policy committees, all of whom are elected members.  The local community development committee is an important new committee of the local authority.  Owing to the more diverse membership of the LCDC, there will be many instances where the chairperson will not be an elected member of a local authority.</p><p>  The corporate policy group is central to the management of the business of the local authority and it will be important that the voice of the local community development committee is heard at the CPG.  This amendment provides that the person representing the LCDC on the CPG will normally be the chairperson of that committee, with provision for a substitute where the members of the LCDC have selected, from their membership, an official of the local authority as chairperson.  It would not be appropriate for an official of the local authority to sit on the co-ordinating body for policy making within the local authority.  As drafted, this amendment reflects the importance of the local community development committee, while respecting the differentiation in roles between the elected members and officials of the council. </p><p>  Amendments Nos. 78, 82 and 83 are technical amendments consequential to the insertion of the text to include representation for the LCDCs on the CPG.  Once we remove provision for representation of political parties from the CPG, as I outlined, and add the representative of the LCDC, the membership of the CPG will be as follows: a cathaoirleach; the chairs of the strategic policy committee; the chair or representative of the local community development committee; and the cathaoirleach or nominee of each municipal district if a municipal district is not already represented with an SPC chair.</p> <p>This will be the appropriate membership to allow the corporate policy group to discharge its role of co-ordinating the business of the council with greater efficiency.  </p></speech>

district members within its administrative area and for necessary consultation for that purpose.&quot;.&quot;.<blockquote><b></b></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>The Bill provides, for the first time, that the statutory powers of elected members are being set out clearly in one Act by way of comprehensive a schedule of reserved functions.  The increase in the number of reserved functions gives greater power, responsibility and accountability to the elected members and is recognition of their role within the council.  The provision of customer service delivery plans is a key element of the continuing focus on implementing the local government efficiency agenda.</p><p>  Service delivery plans provide for a new methodology whereby local authorities can clearly identify the services they will be providing, and the standards to which these are expected to be provided.  It is increasingly important that citizens and communities can see what services they are getting for the taxes they pay for local authority services, via the local property tax.  They must also be able to see whether the local authority has delivered what it promised, and whether they are getting value for money compared to the services provided in neighbouring or similar local authorities.</p><p>  Accordingly, ongoing evaluation on performance, and year-on-year assessment of how delivery can be improved, is a critical element of this provision.  The service delivery plans will be tied in closely with the proposed move from the current service indicators reporting system to a more qualitative performance indicator-performance standard model.  Service delivery plans must be based on a realistic understanding of the choices made by the local authority in finalising its annual budget and reflect the prioritisation of the elected members.</p><p>  Accordingly, the service delivery plans will be adopted promptly after the finalisation of the budget and I will be providing for timeframes for this to be done.  Ideally, the plans will be prepared as much as possible in parallel with the annual budgetary cycle, to maintain a realistic link between the services the local authority needs to or would like, to provide, in the context of the budgetary decisions made.  It is intended that the service delivery plans will reference and recognise the work of the National Oversight and Audit Commission being established under the Bill.</p><p>  Furthermore, each local authority annual report will include a comprehensive review of performance of the service plans against certain performance standards by reference to the performance indicators.  Reporting on the annual service delivery plans will show where a local authority is improving, or not improving, as the case may be.  This will allow the public see how local authorities are performing against their agreed targets and decide for themselves whether they consider that their local authority is providing real value for money.</p><p>    Amendment No. 131 is a related numbering change.  Amendment No. 182 provides for the insertion in the schedule listing the reserved functions of the local authority that the adoption of a local authority service delivery plan is such a function.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12013120300024#X02700"><p>Obviously it is important there is a quality of service and the performance indicators are a good way of doing that.  I have been looking at the issue from a practical point of view.  The delivery of service requires people.  There is a very unequal distribution of local government staffing.  I realise that issue cannot be rectified overnight.  For example, Meath, which is a rapidly growing area, has half the staffing level that is available in Kerry, although Meath has 40,000 more people.  It is not possible to deliver services without people.  It will be a real challenge to service the municipal districts where the staffing is at skeletal level.  There will have to be a relaxation of the embargo and a rebalancing of the local government fund to take account of that issue.  That imbalance occurs mostly in the more highly populated areas or in the periphery of not only Dublin but in the periphery of Galway and Cork one will find the same scenarios.  Clearly the distribution of the general purposes grant shows the areas positioned on a per capita basis on the lowest level are those that are in those particular locations.  The staffing and funding elements cannot be ignored in the context of the outcomes sought.  We cannot compare like with like around the country.  There will have to be a minimum level of service that people can expect to get.</p><p>  A more critical look will be taken at local authorities.  Already, people are asking what they are getting?  They see a direct relationship with payment of the local property tax.  If they see that vastly better services are provided in one location over another and if the origin of the problem is that the staffing level is half that in an area that has a larger population they would have every reason to feel aggrieved.  As the local government fund will continue to part of the funding mix there has got to be relook at how it is distributed. </p><p>   I do not have any difficulty with an equalisation element but a number of issues are not taken into account in the needs the resources model.  For example, population increases have been inadequately counted.  For example, if a county has four swimming pools it has a need to fund four swimming pools.  If it happens to have two swimming pools then it does not have to maintain four swimming pools, essentially, it must be funded on the basis of two as opposed to four, when in fact it needs four.</p><p>  The section is meaningless unless other things come with it.  I do not disagree that it is needed but if there are to be outcomes that will be visible to people, there has got to be a commitment to the other issues.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12013120300024#X02800"><p>My comments are in much the same vein.  It is a peculiar sort of exercise.</p> <p>The county development plan is a service delivery plan which sets outs the aspirations and goals of the local authority, the mechanisms that govern it and the way in which it does business over five or six years.  The roads programme in any given year is a service delivery plan, as are the arts programme and the housing programme and the means and mechanisms by which these programmes are implemented are determined by the amount of funding that is made available to the local authority.  I hope, therefore, that when the Minister is measuring service delivery plans, he will leave a large space available to examine the lack of available funds to carry out the function for which they were put in place.  This should be measured so that responsibility and political accountability can be measured by the public, rather than lay the failure to deliver at the feet of the local authority members.  The failure lies at the feet of central government which did not make the funds available to deliver many of the programmes.</p></speech>

Any lack of funds will have to be taken into account.  If authorities do not get the money at national level they feel they should get for a particular key piece of infrastructure, that is important.  However, local authorities will fund themselves a lot more than previously, through the provision of the local property tax.  There will be a responsibility and obligation with that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12013120300025#Y00400"><p>If there is a significant gap, that will have to be taken into account.  The delivery will be assessed based on the criteria the local authority has laid down in terms of how it wants to measure itself.</p><p>  Let me explain where I come from on this.  Whether it was a privilege or an honour, I was once a member of the south eastern health board, for a period of nine years.  The way the board worked out its budget during those years, between 1991 and 1999, was an eye-opener for me in terms of service delivery plans.  One could see exactly where the money was earmarked for delivery, to the extent that if one was on the community care committee, one could see which organisations were getting money and how much.  As a member of the health board, one could suggest changes and get support to change an allocation.</p><p>  This was a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the pressure points and prioritise which area to which moneys should be allocated.  I believe this is a principle by which local authorities and their committees could operate also and that is where I am coming from on this.  I saw at first hand how people could be given discretion to move moneys allocated around to deliver results for key organisations that had been ignored by bureaucracy for far too long.  This also provided an opportunity for outcomes to be measured and if necessary, one could come along the following year and say this or that did or did not work or was not implemented properly.  Adjustments could be made or other areas could be prioritised.  The service plan concept worked well in the old health board system.  While that system had problems, it did not have as many as people see in the system since then.</p><p>  To return to the issue raised by Deputy Murphy, a workforce plan is required in each local authority.  That work is going on currently in the context of the reform.  Far less administration work will be required because of the changes we are making in the context of the town councils.  Tipperary, for example, has seven town councils and two county councils.  This ties up a lot of people, but that will not be necessary in the new arrangements, in a Tipperary county council entity.  These people will be able to do other things, apart from being tied up in administrative arrangements such as annual reports, annual audits, corporate plans, development plans and so on.  This will no longer be necessary because that will be done at county level.  This is the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of what we want to achieve, to have an integrated approach, less duplication and less waste and administration so that we can prioritise the areas the Deputy spoke about, in terms of administrative structures.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have been working with local authorities on a workforce planning exercise for the past year.  Hopefully, in the context of the employment ceilings in place, they will be able to release staff from some duties and place them in the priority areas mentioned by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Therefore, the number of people that will be freed up may not be as large as the Minister thinks.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact the Department is doing some workforce planning, because the fault-lines will be seen.  There are areas that need attention, such as the planning system which is discredited due to large numbers of unauthorised developments.  It is taking forever to deal with the estates that have not been taken in charge in a timely way.  These areas must be part of the performance indicators because they affect people significantly.  It is areas such as this where the local authority has no legal responsibility that need attention.  If there is a legal responsibility to deal with an issue, such as to deal with a planning application, that responsibility will always be met.  However, other issues get pushed aside when staffing is inadequate.  While the staff in the local authorities may be very good, if there is not enough staff, we run into difficulties.</p><p>  The Minister stated there will be more independent funding.  Since 2008, there was &euro;1 billion in the general purposes grant.  That is down to &euro;640 million this year.   It is proposed to take moneys from the motor tax fund, which had been ring-fenced previously, so that is, essentially, a diminishing fund.  It may well be the moneys available are different moneys, but that does not mean there is more.  I cannot see there is any more money.  Will the Minister give us a run-down of the moneys?</p></speech>

Better training for elected members will be necessary to ensure they have the skills and expertise to better discharge their enhanced policy development role and their greater role in the oversight of delivery of policy.  The amendment will complete the provision to reduce expenses in the event of a member not attending training, if required in the regulations, to include the option for a reduction in remuneration, such as the representational payment.  The ACC and AMAI view the provision of better training for councillors as important for the new intake of councillors in June 2014 and I agree with them.  Once the structured training and development programme is agreed with the amalgamated association, I will be disappointed if elected members fail to attend.  This amendment, which provides for reductions of expenses and remuneration, will act as a financial incentive to ensure attendance.</p></speech>

This was the position agreed with the authorities in Brussels as the appropriate way in which it should be done in order that we constitute the LCDCs as local action groups.

The amendment would give them a great deal more power over budgets.  I am concerned about the preparation of the plan following the adoption of the budget.  It seems to focus almost exclusively on hard services such as roads, lighting etc.  A great deal of the work town councils did was on services that relate to people impacting directly on community building etc.  I do not see that included, as it should be.  There should be some mention of the budget in that regard because it comes with a, perhaps small, cost and certainly a staffing cost.  The amendment would move the balance more to the municipal districts as opposed to them merely being consulted.</p></speech>

Will it be equalised or what method will be used?</p></speech>

The first step is the preparation of the draft local authority budget, an internal working document prepared under the direction of the chief executive.  That forms the basis of the initial discussions with the CPG and the members of the local authority.  It will set out in broad terms the necessary local authority expenditure for the year, including the central management charge and including an amount to be provided as a general municipal allocation.  The draft local authority budget will be balanced by the amount of rates to be levied.  The format of this document, which will be set out in regulations, will be based on the current budget with a number of minor amendments.</p><p>  The proposed amendment provides that the level of the general municipal allocation will be set with due regard to the broader needs of the local authority and the resources available to it.  In providing for the general municipal allocation, the chief executive must consider the non-discretionary expenditure that must be met as a first call on the resources of the local authority.  When agreement has been reached on the parameters set out in the draft local authority budget, including the overall level of the general municipal allocation, the chief executive will proceed to determine the amount to be made available to each of the municipal districts.</p><p>  The municipal districts will have their priorities and populations may differ significantly among them.  They will have a fair and equitable distribution of the general municipal allocation to each municipal district, as provided for in my amendment No. 107.  The chief executive is required to have regard to each municipal district including, when appropriate, the population of each municipal district when making that allocation.</p><p>  With the general municipal allocation for each district determined a draft budgetary plan for the individual municipal districts will be drawn up.  The draft budgetary plan will set out the general municipal allocation and provide a basis for discussion with the municipal district members on how they wish to allocate that amount to services and sub-services.  The municipal district members will consider the draft budgetary plan and may, by resolution, make amendments to that plan.</p><p>  Whether to provide further discretionary funds to enhance the level of essential services or provide for local initiatives are decisions for the members of each municipal district to make.  The members at district level may vary the level of local charges, for example, on parking or leisure charges, thereby increasing or decreasing the level of discretionary funding available in the district.  This final step sees the chief executive completing the allocation of the central management charge and the general municipal allocation to divisions.  In allocating the general municipal allocation to divisions the chief executive shall take account of the draft budgetary plan adopted by the municipal district.</p><p>  The draft local authority budget will reflect the broad overall parameters agreed at the outset with the CPG and the outcome of the draft budgetary plans adopted by the municipal district members.  The draft local authority budget will be published prior to the budget meeting at which it will be available to the public and for adoption by the members of the local authority.</p><p>  While it might seem like a long, drawn out process, it is not as cumbersome as it sounds from what I just read out.  It is trying to include the municipal district members in the process and include their priorities based on criteria and a needs and resources model that will take account of the population they serve and the services they need.</p></speech>

In this case the municipal district will be able to make amendments to the budgetary plan.  The chairperson of the municipal district, or his or her representative is already on the CPG at the initial phase, which ensures that area is well tuned into what is going on in terms of the resources needed to run the services in that district.</p></speech>

Most of the local authority funding will be spent on services such as wastewater, planning, housing departments, staff and pensions.  The focus of attention will be on discretionary funding and that will be at the minor end.</p><p>  Local authorities - county councils in particular - are really quite legalistic in terms of looking at how that spend happens.  I believe the bulk of it will be spent on roads and footpaths - and is probably needed in that area.  If the municipal districts are going to pick up on anything the town councils have done, there must be scope for a wider engagement with the tidy towns competition and other community initiatives.  There must be some level of discretionary fund that can pick up and do something meaningful there.  While what the Minister has outlined might be logical, the ability to do it will be the real challenge.</p></speech>

It will be up to local authorities to ensure they make financial provision for them.  The municipal district members will attend the plenary session of the local authority which provides for the final adoption so they will have two bites of the cherry.  Town councils must work within small resources at present and must take what they get from the manager.  There is very little discretion.  The plenary session of a local authority will be an opportunity for a good robust exchange of views, depending on who and where one represents.  In amendment No. 107 I propose to clarify the principles to be applied by the chief executive in making resources available to municipal district members for their consideration in a draft budgetary plan.  It provides for the chief executive to have regard to the resource needs of the municipal district and the broader needs of the local authority.  It will go some way towards meeting Deputies' concerns about ensuring municipal district members have a say and are able to make changes to the draft plan.  Equally, they must return to the plenary session to balance the budget at the end of the process.</p></speech>

No. 394 of 1993), on the dissolution of such authority or authorities and the transfer to such assembly&mdash;<blockquote>(I) of the assets and liabilities of such authority or authorities, or<br />(II) in so far as the designation relates to part of the administrative area of a regional authority, of specified assets or liabilities of such authority or of a specified portion of any of those assets and liabilities,</blockquote>and any land to which the order relates shall, on the date specified in the order in relation to that land, vest in such assembly without any further conveyance, transfer or assignment,&quot;.</blockquote>In accordance with section 43 of the Local Government Act 1991, eight regional authorities and two regional assemblies have been established by ministerial order.  These amendments relate to section 57 of the Bill under which the enabling provision in section 43 of the 1991 Act is being substituted in its entirety.  A number of amendments are required to the substitution proposed in the published Bill.</p><p>  Amendment No. 115 provides that the Minister, in making an establishment order determining the new regional assemblies, may provide for consequential matters such as the transfer of functions, assets and liabilities.  This is achieved by the insertion of an additional sub-paragraph (xii) to section 43(4)(<i>b</i>) of the Local Government Act 1991 to provide specifically that an establishment order can provide for the designation of regional assemblies to be &quot;successors&quot; to regional authorities.  Amendment No. 116 is consequential on amendment No. 115.</p><p>  Amendment No. 117 inserts a new paragraph (<i>c</i>) in subsection (4) of section 43 and provides detail on the type of matters the Minister may provide for in the establishment order.  Amendments Nos. 118 and 119 provide for some minor changes to section 57(2) in the interests of achieving greater clarity and for a textual change to subsection (13) of section 43 of the 1991 Act, amending the term &quot;the establishment order&quot; to &quot;an establishment order&quot; for consistency with references in earlier subsections.</p></speech>

The Putting People First document was clear on the numbers involved, but the legislation is not.  Earlier we discussed having two representatives, which as I recall was what was in the Putting People First document, but this is not in the Bill.  What is the intention?</p><p>  Deputy Murphy expressed a view there should be direct elections to regional assemblies, and although some of us would like to see this, it is not what will happen and people will be delegated from local authorities.  If the issue of the number of people cannot be dealt with on Committee Stage, I will table an amendment on Report Stage.  Various political groups on local authorities have made representations on this matter.  A mechanism must be put in place because if it is not, regional assemblies will reflect the two largest parties.  The Minister issued kind words earlier but I assure him there is very little kindness at local government meetings when it comes to divvying out positions.  In the North the d'Hondt system is used but it will not be used for the regional assemblies.  There is no mechanism to allow in the plebs.  The Minister is deliberately excluding the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, Independents and many others.  Unless the Minister speaks to every Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il councillor before Christmas to get them into good spirits and ensure that after the local elections they will allow in an odd Labour Party person or Shinner, it will not happen.</p></speech>

More specifically, it updates section 2C and inserts a new section 2CA.  The amendment to section 2C is to provide for the transfer from the LGF to the Exchequer during 2014 as a necessary measure towards the reduction of the national debt, and the new section 2CA provides for payments out of the fund to Irish Water in respect of water services functions transferred from local authorities to Irish Water.</p><p>  An amendment to the Local Government Act 1998 is necessary to allow for the legislative underpinning of these transfers.  The transfer to the Exchequer is in respect of 2014 only.  In 2013, the legislation provided that up to &euro;150 million of motor tax income could be transferred from the LGF to the Exchequer.  For 2014, an amount of up to &euro;600 million is to be similarly provided.  Section 2C continues to provide that, in determining the payment to the Exchequer, regard must be had to the balance in the fund when all commitments have been made.  The total to be transferred to Irish Water will be agreed and published as part of the 2014 Revised Estimates Volume.</p><p>  It should be noted that the projected income to the LGF for motor tax and local property tax in 2014 is in excess of &euro;1.8 billion.  The amendments provide a balanced approach to meeting the financial needs of local authorities, Irish Water and the Exchequer towards national deficit reduction.</p></speech>

When people pay motor tax, they expect it to be used for the LGF, for which it has been ring-fenced for a considerable period, or for the upgrading of roads.  The money is clearly being transferred for the purpose of repaying the national debt.  Why do we not call things what they are?  Ministers keep telling us that direct taxation has not been increased, but this amount might as well be taken from PAYE.  There is a dishonesty in calling something motor vehicle (duties and licences), as it gives the impression that the money raised is for roads.  People can see the distinction between that and servicing the national debt.</p><p>  I wish to address the &euro;600 million transfer to Irish Water.  For several years, money has been taken from the LGF and replaced by the household charge and property tax.  In effect, property tax is being used to effect the transfer to Irish Water for the purpose of introducing a water charge.</p> <p>This is a dishonest way to proceed and is an undermining of local government.  I am opposed to this and propose to call a vote on this section, which in my view is the most offensive section in this Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister is keeping his commitment in this regard by virtue of what is proposed in this Bill.</p><p>  In regard to the proposed transfer of &euro;600 million from the fund to Irish Water, how much of this will come back next year to local authorities in the service level agreement, agreement on which the Minister mentioned earlier is nearing conclusion?  Will local authorities in the main be doing next year what they did last year?  How much of the &euro;600 million will go towards paying the salaries and administration costs of Irish Water, including in respect of the recently announced additional staff?  In other words, how much of the &euro;600 million will go towards administration of what appears to be a second master given that staff, both management and on the ground, in local authorities associated with water services will continue to do what they have being doing?  It now appears that additional funding is to be made available to pay management in Irish Water and the costs associated with its establishment yet it will in effect only be overseeing what has always been done by the local authorities.  Is it an accounting exercise to do the same thing?    </p><p>  We were told in the context of the establishment of Irish Water that there would be huge reform.  Many of the management personnel recruited to Irish Water are former local authority staff.  Many staff of the local authorities whose remit is responsibility for water services, among other aspects, will continue to have responsibility in this regard and their pay will have to reflect this.  Have staff who have moved from the local authority system to Irish Water been paid severance payments by the State in respect of that move and for how many more years will this be the case?  Was it not the case that separate funding was to be obtained from the EU to fund this into the future?  As things stand, there will be a double payment on the part of users in the form of water charges when introduced.</p></speech>

In sound-bites in the D&aacute;il chamber and outside it on the plinth the Minister and other spokespersons for the Government have over the past number of years trumpeted that the local property tax would be spent on local services.  A new corporate entity has now been established.  The Government promised to reduce quangos yet this mammy and daddy of all quangos has been created.  The Minister is providing in this Bill for the taking of up to &euro;600 million from the Local Government Fund.</p><p>  Last year, &euro;120 million was taken from the Local Government Fund in respect of debt related activities.  How much has been taken from motor taxation receipts this year?  What the Minister is proposing by way of this amendment is very troubling.  I always pay my car tax.</p></speech>

The Minister is now taking from the fund and using that money to erect meters outside people's homes so that he can impose another charge on them.  What the Minister is proposing is very bad in terms of local government.  It is odious and should not be included.  It goes completely against everything that the Minister said in the Chamber during the past two years.  I ask that he stand back from this.</p><p>  The Minister might when responding also indicate how much the call centre will cost.  There are 34 call centres under the local government system, which are operated by experienced staff, some of whom have been working in that area for years.  These are local authority staff who have been doing this job for years.  In regard to the call centre to be established by Irish Water, how much will be taken from motor tax receipts to fund it?</p></speech>

To cater for the big demand that there is for water in areas where there is pressure, including in the areas represented by Deputies Cowen, Catherine Murphy, Stanley and, in particular Kevin Humphreys - Deputy Coonan does not want water coming from the River Shannon to Dublin to meet this demand - we have to borrow the money on the markets and must have a stream of income to repay those loans.  That is the purpose of the water charges.  We are extending water charges by way of meter from the business and group water sector to the remainder of water users in the country.  It is not a popular decision but it is what we have to do.  I have no doubt that as a result of the introduction of water meters there will be a reduction in demand for water and the amount of water being used.  The experience in the group water sector was an immediate reduction of 20% to 25%, which is huge.</p> <p>That will happen in many cases because when people do not pay by metering, they will have less respect for the resource.  The recent experience at Ballymore Eustace clearly indicates that there will be difficulties in providing a very good quantity of the resource in the years ahead.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy should know better than anybody, if one wishes to provide for the expansion of Intel and many other companies in her constituency, good quality water will be required and that costs money.</p></speech>

We have every reason to be concerned about the extra administrative burden, a burden which the Minister says he is relieving, on the other side, by the abolition of town councils.  Clear commitments were made and there was an expectation that the property tax paid would produce additional services.  In fact, there were advertisements about cutting grass, parks maintenance and all sorts of other things.  People are going to ask what they are getting in return and they will not see anything additional.

That is not bad from the car tax fund and the local government fund, but it is completely counter to what the Minister told us in the Chamber in the past two years about the property tax.  He said it would be used to fund local services.</p></speech>

Contrary to what the public was led to believe, the proceeds from the property tax are not staying in the local authority system; they are not being spent within the local authority system in its entirety.  That was the case last year and will be the case next year.  It remains to be seen what will be the case in the year after.</p><p>  With regard to the funding that has been taken from the local authority fund and given to Irish Water, only one legislative measure has been passed by the House relating to Irish Water and that was legislation to give effect to its establishment and configuration.  There has been no legislation dealing with the transfer of assets currently in the ownership of local authorities to Irish Water.  There is also no legislation to give effect to the type of billing system we can expect to see in place in the future, yet we are being asked to agree to &euro;500 million being taken from the central Government allocation and given to Irish Water.  I understand part of this sum will come back to local authorities in the form of service level agreements, but that is duplicity.</p></speech>

It is being asked to do it again under service level agreements and a new management structure is being put in place within Irish Water to manage the same thing also.  As Deputy Brian Stanley and I have said in the past, there is a call centre in which almost 400 people are being asked to take calls from all areas of the country-----</p></speech>

I told the Minister previously that I would have preferred to see a regional structure retaining ownership for most regional local authorities rather than transferring it.  The configuration of Irish Water leads me to believe that at some time in the future it will be sold and privatised.</p></speech>

There are approximately 30 staff employed in water services provision, be it at management level or on the ground dealing with the pipe network and so forth.  They will remain in place under the service level agreement and will have to be paid the same rates of pay they have received heretofore.  Management within Leitrim County Council and other councils has responsibility for many services, including water, and that does not change, but the Minister is putting an entirely new structure of middle management and so forth in place within Irish Water which will have to be paid to do the same thing.  The 400 call staff will have to be paid, even though many people are well able to do this work and are doing it.  This is a runaway train that is getting out of control and the Minister is asking us to pay for it without adequate legislation being brought before the House to explain what is happening.</p></speech>

I wish we could have done this on 1 January 2014 but the work on the financial systems will not be in place by that date.  Irish Water has be bedded in.  The members will know from their contacts with local authorities that their officials will have significant work to do and it takes time.  We could have had the work done for 1 July 2014 but that is in the middle of the financial year.  We decided to wait until 1 January 2015 to bring in the local property tax retention rate.

These arrangements are not expected to be in operation until the second quarter of 2014 as the SDZ is under appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The current docklands master plan recently expired on 27 November 2013.  This plan is fundamental to the fast-track planning system as it sets the overall planning framework for the docklands area.  In order to avoid any legal risks associated with the continued operation of the fast-track planning process in the period from 28 November 2013 until the SDZ becomes operational, it is essential that a valid master plan is in place.  Amendment No. 197 is a consequential amendment to the Long Title of the Bill. </p></speech>

The amendment refers to the definition of "sanitary authority" under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960.  My amendment substitutes the previous definition of "sanitary authority" with the new definition under the Local Government Act.  The change should probably have been made in the Local Government Act 2001 but it is being done here.  It is a purely drafting matter.</p><p>  No matter what one's view is on the fluoridation of water or otherwise, all we are doing is transferring cross-references that have been there over the years.

Amendment No. 183 is a technical amendment arising out of the separation of the provisions in regard to attendance at conferences, seminars and so on from attendance at training or training events.  A new subsection (5A) is inserted into section 148 of the principal Act by section 48(2)(d) of the Bill providing for training for elected members.  The separation of the treatment of conferences from training will enable the Minister of the day to apply more robust rules to restrict attendance and claiming of expenses at conferences compared with attendance at training specially developed for elected members.  This amendment is to represent more correctly the different approaches to conferences and training in the listing of reserved functions.</p><p>  Amendments Nos. 186 and 187 are technical amendments to provide for the correct legal references to the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 and to those sections of the Coast Protection Act 1963 under which reserved powers are to be exercised by local authority members.  Amendment No. 188 is related to amendment No. 187 and amends the text in regard to reserved powers under the Coast Protection Act 1963 to include a reference to section 18.</p></speech>

What the Minister is doing here makes a lot of sense.  If we are to be honest about it, given the difficulties many councillors had trying to pay their own expenses and bills, many of them had to rely on conferences and so on to carry them through.  That is the way it was.  In the 1990s, when there was no representational payment or otherwise, that was the only way they could get a few pounds to keep going and to service the constituency.</p><p>  If the Minister gets the balance right here, everything will okay.  By all means tighten up this but in recognition of the reduced number of councillors - in some cases less than half the number of councillors in a county - and in view of the fact there will be larger areas and that we are trying to get people into local government and national government, will the Minister look at the monthly allowances for people where they are justified on the basis of the distances to the county hall and the increase in the size of areas?  That should be done in a very transparent way.  Councillors will be servicing larger areas and there will be fewer councillors on the ground.  Will the Minister take that into consideration?  I hope he will take that on board.</p></speech>

In some cases, it was abused and it became an embarrassment.  This should have been addressed as soon as a salary was paid but it was not.  Some of the local authorities took measures and limits were put in place, which was right.  It is positive that a more strategic approach is being taken to training, that it is more localised and that one would have a particular standard.  From that point of view, this is a reasonably welcome initiative and I do not have a difficulty with it.</p></speech>

There should be a statutory underpinning of the organisations which can arrange conferences for the benefit of local authorities.  Individuals and community groups arrange conferences - good conferences are being held throughout the country - that require the attendance of councillors from time to time.  By separating out the training element, we will ensure councillors get the resources to be trained properly.  That may not necessarily have to count as part of their 80% attendance at meetings, which is required at the moment.  There could be a separate way to deal with whatever resourcing of the training they need.  It could be a separate issue from the normal attendance at council meetings, committee meetings and conferences.</p><p>  In addition to that, we need to tidy up a few loose ends which have been a little bit lax for a good period of time while at the same time meeting the spirit of what Deputies Stanley and Murphy said in regard to training as well as ensuring councillors are properly resourced.  That is something we could consider around the time of the local elections or shortly afterwards.</p></speech>

The Minister has anticipated Irish Water in regard to one particular change.  I do not know if the pilots for the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme have started yet.</p> <p>I presume the changes will be included in the HAP scheme.  In the administration of the housing list leasing has been the predominant solution in the medium term.  There has been a shift in the role from the Department of Social Protection to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It does not look as if there will be a shift in personnel, from what the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton is saying.  Is there something to anticipate and future proof it in terms of the changes that will be made?  It is quite difficult to see how a person in receipt of rent assistance will fit into the HAP scheme?  It is not going to be on the basis of an allocation scheme.</p></speech>

It is difficult enough to streamline the work to be done in this area between the Departments of Social Protection and the Environment, Community and Local Government and it will require primary legislation.  These are technical drafting amendments which do not tee up anything that will happen in the housing assistance legislation.  They will be dealt with separately in that legislation.  The supports available under the housing Acts and the Department of Social Protection are disparate and the HAP scheme is trying to bring all issues together.  Community welfare officers have significant information at their disposal and are not as aligned to the local government system as they should be.  This must be captured in the legislation.  The amendment does not deal with any of the issues the Deputy has raised because they will be dealt with in the new legislation.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I am delighted to welcome Mr. James Doorley, deputy director of the National Youth Council of Ireland, and Ms Orla O'Connor, director of the National Women's Council of Ireland.</p><p>  There is a growing debate at European level on the role social indicators could play in Economic and Monetary Union.  A recent European Commission communication on the social dimension of EMU outlined how such social indicators might form part of the formal economic surveillance under way as part of EMU.  These indicators include unemployment, youth unemployment rates, changes in rates of disposable income, at-risk of poverty rates and inequality.  In the past few weeks a range of speakers have come before the committee to talk about their views in this regard, including the Irish Business Employers Confederation, IBEC; the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU; the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU; and Social Justice Ireland.  Today we are holding the final meeting in our deliberations.  We look forward to hearing the valuable perspectives of the National Youth Council of Ireland and the National Women's Council of Ireland.  The views expressed will form part of a submission we will be making on the committee's political contribution to the European institutions on the social dimension of EMU.  We hope to make that submission in the next few days to give them time to review it. </p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing ruling of the Chair that they should not comment on, make charges against or criticise a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.</p> <p>I invite Ms Orla O'Connor, the director of the National Women's Council, to make her presentation to the committee.</p></speech>

The organisations include diverse organisations such as community-based organisations, organisations dealing with violence against women, and trade union and political party women's committees.  I intend to bring their perspective to the table in this presentation.</p><p>  The objective of promoting equality between men and women is enshrined in the EU treaties whose articles oblige the EU to mainstream gender equality in all its activities.  This is crucial for the social dimension of EMU.  EU gender equality policy is underpinned by the European pact for gender equality and the strategy for equality between women and men, 2010 to 2015.  Europe 2020 contains clear commitments for gender mainstreaming.  Those are the core documents for bringing gender equality to the social dimension of the EMU.</p><p>  The National Women's Council of Ireland gives a general welcome to the inclusion of a social dimension to EMU.  As Ireland has gone through the fiscal stability process the outcomes of an absence of a social dimension can be clearly seen, such as the alarming increase in levels of poverty, debt and deprivation.  Those statistics highlight the impact on women and on lone parents whose poverty rates have increased during that period.</p><p>  Social and economic issues are intrinsically linked and this link is highlighted by the communication on the social dimension of the EMU.  In order to develop a social dimension of EMU, we need to maximise opportunities to prevent further economic crises.</p><p>  From the perspective of the National Women's Council of Ireland, I wish to draw the committee's attention to three issues.  The first issue is the employment and labour participation of women with the purpose of maximising women's participation in the economy.  It is noted that within the EU there is increasingly a focus on the comparatively low levels of participation of women in the labour force.  Europe 2020 notes that 63% of women are in work in comparison to 77% of men.  The labour force participation rate in Ireland is 53.3% for women in comparison to 68.4% for men.  Women are far more likely to be working part-time.  Almost 70% of all part-time workers are women and of all women who work, 36% work part-time in comparison to 14% of men.  In addition, having a family has a significant impact on women's participation in the labour force whereas it does not have an impact on the participation of men in the workforce.  In 2011, the Irish employment rate for women was 85.7% for a woman with a partner but with no children but this rate drops to 51.5% if the youngest child is between the ages of four to five years.  OECD statistics show that if a family has more than three children, the participation rate drops below 45%.  Children have a significant impact on women's participation rate in the labour force.  The same does not impact on men's participation rates.</p><p>  Failure to maintain women in jobs means that many organisations and businesses are losing very highly skilled workers.  This impacts on women's equality and also on competitiveness and growth.  In our view, in order to encourage women to work and to remain in work, there is a need to invest in early education, after-school care provisions and flexible working arrangements.  There is a need for much greater paid leave arrangements and also paternity leave which is important for fathers and also encourages the distribution of the work of caring for children.</p><p>  The involvement of women in decision-making is an important aspect of gender equality.  The National Women's Council of Ireland argues that the low numbers of women involved in economic decision-making in both the public and private sectors as well as in political decision-making, is another contributing factor to the economic crisis and is an underlying factor which should be addressed by the social dimension of EMU.  There is increasing evidence to highlight the impact of the absence of women in decision-making on the financial crisis.  A report by the European Commission in 2010, entitled, More Women in Senior Positions - Key to Economic Stability and Growth, stated clearly that a crucial resource for the future growth in Europe lies in the untapped economic potential of women and their full integration into the decision-making processes in all areas of the economy.  While women are under-represented in key decision-making areas across Europe, the situation is particularly bad in Ireland with this country rated 19th on a par index.  We are much lower than the EU average.  Each of these areas can link to indicators that can be used on the scoreboard discussed as part of the social dimension.</p><p>  The third area is the importance of integrating a gender perspective.  The increasing tendency towards gender blindness is a significant factor.  Experience has taught us that when policies are gender-blind, the experiences of women are often side-lined.  Therefore, policies to support the issues being faced by women are often not appropriate or relevant.</p><p>  It is known that employment in Ireland remains highly segregated by gender and that the recession and austerity have had different impacts on women and men at different times.  While men were highly impacted by the crisis in construction, women were much more affected by consequent job cuts in the service sector and in the public service.  We need to take into account these different experiences in assessing how women and men get back into work.  The National Women's Council of Ireland has recently launched a piece of research, a woman-friendly model of activation in Ireland, which examines how women and men can be activated differently in order to achieve better outcomes.</p><p>  On the issue of integrating a gender perspective, we wish to highlight the issue of gender budgeting which is key to future development of EMU.  Gender budgeting is an approach to economic policy-making and planning that places gender equality at the centre of decisions on public expenditure and income.  For example, the use of gender equality audits and impact assessments can assess how different sections of society are impacted and potential outcomes can also be assessed.  This process is under way in other European countries and was used in the past in Scandinavian countries while Scotland is the closest example of the use of gender budgeting and equality budgeting processes.  We would like this to be introduced in Ireland incrementally.</p><p>  I wish to address the issue of social dialogue.  The National Women's Council of Ireland welcomes the focus on the importance of social dialogue and the acknowledgement of the contribution it makes in advancing the economy.  It is important that in strengthening the social dimension of EMU, social dialogue must go beyond the traditional social partners and be extended to civil society.  There must be a deliberate effort to include women's organisations and those directly affected by the recession.  This is critical in an Irish context where we have adopted fairly sophisticated methods for consultation with civil society but which do not necessarily lead to changes in outcomes or the impact of the consultation is not often visible.</p><p>  I refer to the indicators and the scoreboard.  From the perspective of the National Women's Council of Ireland, it is important that all proposed indicators need to be gender-disaggregated but there also needs to be specific indicators which target women's equality such as percentages of women with children at work rather than the use of general indicators about employment participation.</p> <p>There should be indicators that consider, for example, the availability and affordability of child care.  It is also important to look at financial investment in the social dimension.  From our perspective, gender budgeting is core to that.  In addition, budgets should be allocated with reference to the mainstreaming of gender equality and positive actions that seek to address inequalities experienced by women.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Doorley to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.1250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Doorley" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013120300004#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to discuss with them the issue of strengthening the social dimension of the economic and monetary union.  The National Youth Council of Ireland is a representative body comprising some 50 organisations working in every community in Ireland with some 380,000 young people aged ten to 24.  The contribution of the European Union is becoming greater in many social policy areas, including the youth dimension.  Some years ago, for instance, we saw the first European youth strategy, and there are youth dimensions to the Europe 2020 initiative.  During the Irish Presidency earlier this year the Government took a lead on the youth guarantee, which I am hopeful will have a fundamental impact in terms of addressing youth unemployment in this country.</p><p>  We welcome any strengthening of the EU's commitment to the social dimension, which cannot be separated from the financial side.  As Ms O'Connor said, the economic and social are essentially two sides of the same coin.  We need economic growth in order to enhance the social dimension, but progress on social issues such as education, equality and the provision of decent housing all, in their turn, contribute to economic growth.  If we have large numbers of very poor people or people who are otherwise excluded, that will have an inhibitive effect on growth.  In addition, the OECD has pointed out that youth emigration inhibits growth.  We must see the two dimensions as working in tandem rather than a case of having to sort out the economic issues first and only then seeking to deal with the social dimension.</p><p>  We welcome the references in the Commission document to a focus on youth employment indicators.  There is a sense that if something is counted, then it counts.  If, on the other hand, it is not reckoned or monitored, it may be forgotten about.  We welcome the emphasis on such measurements as long-term youth unemployment, the numbers of young people not in education, employment or training, NEET, and the numbers of young people at risk of poverty.  The proposal to include these indicators in the alert mechanism report as part of the European semester process will give them more emphasis at both a European and member state level.</p><p>  We would like to see some reference in the indicators to the types of jobs being done by young people.  After all, it is not just about employment versus unemployment but also the quality of employment secured.  Some years ago the Lisbon strategy talked about not just more jobs, but better jobs.  One of the issues we have come across in our work is that those young people who are working are often in poorly paid, temporary and precarious employment.  It would be very useful to have indicators regarding the numbers of young people in temporary versus permanent employment, average wages and the numbers on the minimum wage.  Those types of data give us a bigger and better picture of what is happening.</p><p>  In the document I circulated to members, I included a snapshot of where Ireland stands at this time in respect of several of the social indicators we are discussing.  There is some good news.  For example, we are doing very well on school completion, with a significant reduction in the numbers of young people leaving school early.  On issues like youth unemployment, however, we do not score so well, even though the current rate of 26% actually represents a decline on recent years.  Moreover, half of that cohort are long-term unemployed.  We have one of the highest rates in the European Union of young people not in education, employment or training and the highest percentage of people aged 16 to 24 at risk of poverty and social exclusion.  If these indicators were centrally compiled and transparent, there would be a greater impetus, at both European and national level, to address them.  Progress has been made on the youth guarantee scheme, but more investment is required in terms of integrating young people into the labour market.</p><p>  In terms of the process itself, it is important that it is meaningful and effective.  Ms O'Connor and I spoke before the meeting about our involvement in a previous co-ordination of policies initiative at European level called the open method of co-ordination.  That was a useful and interesting exercise in terms of sharing best practice and so on, but it was very process-intensive.  There was a great deal of work involved for organisations engaged in different policy areas, but it was sometimes difficult to see the results.  Having said that, the incorporation of the social dimension into the macroeconomic imbalance procedure has significant potential.  There is also a reference in the Commission document to a linkage with EU funding.  Whatever about the economic side, it might well concentrate minds if funding were dependent to some extent on member states meeting agreed social targets.</p><p>  Those of us who work in this area are familiar with the range of indicators already in play, such as employment policy indicators, the social protection performance monitor, Europe 2020 targets and the youth policy indicators the Commission has developed.  It is a question of ensuring there is effective co-ordination in compiling those data.  We acknowledge there will be limits, constraints and challenges in terms of implementing these measures.  We are subject to the monetary policy set down by the European Central Bank and to the provisions of the fiscal compact and the Stability and Growth Pact.  While the inclusion of social indicators would be very welcome, the question is whether the economic and fiscal parameters within which we must operate will still trump anything on the social side.</p><p>  We must keep in mind, too, that indicators can sometimes be very crude mechanisms which do not necessarily capture the full picture.  They can also have perverse outcomes where, for instance, they create incentives for governments to force people into poorly paid or otherwise unsatisfactory jobs in order to get the unemployment figures down.  There must be mechanisms in place to ensure there is real progress and not just progress on paper.  A particular question that struck me, and it is obviously a debate that will have to take place at European and national level, is what might constitute a good or bad score in regard to youth unemployment, long-term unemployment or the NEET level.  Should countries be aiming for youth unemployment of 20%, for example, or 10% or zero?</p><p>  There is an issue for us in that much of this process will happen at a European level, as part of the semester structure, and will not, therefore, be very accessible to organisations at a national level.  There is a question - it is a question on a broader level, not just for our organisation but for the committee and the Oireachtas - as to the nature of the engagement at national member state level.  If the Commission decides there are problems in a particular member state and begins the process as outlined, with country-specific recommendations, corrective plans and so on, what engagement will there be at national level?  Will the Oireachtas have an input into that and will there be a role for our MEPs?  From our perspective, we can engage with this committee and with the Oireachtas, but we probably cannot engage with the Commission in Brussels.  In a situation where the Commission has identified that Ireland is falling down on a particular social indicator, how then do we as a member state engage with that and how do we as an organisation get involved?</p><p>  We very much welcome the emphasis in the document on social dialogue.  That is a key point in a context where it is governments and European institutions which make the decisions.  I would welcome an acknowledgment that it is good to make decisions based on all the information and having heard the views of all parties.  A problem with many EU policy documents is that they limit the definition of social partners to include only employers and trade unions.  We acknowledge that these are important players, but they are not the only players.  Unemployed people are automatically excluded because they are not members of trade unions and are not represented by employers.  Ireland has a good tradition of looking beyond the standard European model of social partnership.</p> <p>We certainly need to engage with a wider range of parties in order to be effective and legitimate.</p><p> We welcome the proposal and we are of the view that it has the potential to influence the policy agenda.  We would like to see reference to broader indicators in respect of young people, including those relating to the number of young people in temporary employment and minimum and overall wage levels.  We are of the view that these would provide a more complete picture.  There is a need to ensure that the process is effective and meaningful and to acknowledge the limitations and challenges involved.  We would like some clarification in respect of what will be the role of member states, the Parliament and the actors at national level in the context of engagement with the process.  There is also a need to consider social dialogue in the context of engagement with civil society.  In most democracies, that is how it is viewed and there is not just a very narrow focus on employers and trade unions.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time and I will be happy to answer any questions members may wish to pose.</p></speech>

Is she in a position to provide examples of other countries which employ similar methods or in which social indicators of some type are used?  How easy would it be to achieve consistency in respect of indicators across the European Union?  In that regard, I refer to the PISA statistics published this morning.  One of the difficulties faced by those responsible for PISA surveys in respect of literacy and numeracy is ensuring that there is some form of consistency in the questions asked in the states in which those surveys are carried out.  In the context of indicators relating to women, how easy would it be to ensure consistency across the Union?</p><p>  Mr. Doorley referred to the need to use different indicators and stated that one relating to the numbers in temporary employment should come into play.  How would such an indicator contemplate the fact that many young people who are students might take up part-time or temporary work during their summer or winter recesses?  How can we ensure that the statistics relating to these individuals will not skew the results?  Mr. Doorley also referred to a general indicator in respect of youth unemployment.  Is he of the view that there is also a need to examine migration rates?  It is a well-accepted fact that the youth unemployment rate in Ireland would probably be higher were it not for the fact that people take the boat or the plane and travel abroad.  Should migration rates be included in the indicators?</p><p>  My final question relates to funding and is for both of our guests.  I take the point that benchmarks are currently not in place and I presume that action will have to be taken in order to address that fact.  Are our guests of the view that the Commission should have a role in the context of fining those who do not make the benchmarks or should it support them through the provision of additional funding or whatever?  Will they indicate if the carrot or the stick be used in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.1253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013120300005#D00300"><p>I concur with a number of the points made by Mr. Doorley.  As I understand it, we are trying to tackle the fact that 20 million are unemployed across the European Union.  A wonderful aspect of the Union is that attention is paid to the social dimension of the development of European societies.  I welcome the fact that a debate is taking place in Europe and that the 28 national parliaments are in a position to engage with that debate.  This is a very complex issue.  The 28 national parliaments and the European Parliament are using various formulae in respect of benchmarking, etc., and are creating indicators to assess how they should act.  The briefing notes presented to the committee state that the Employment Social Policy, Health and the Consumer Affairs Council, EPSCO, considers that reaching alarm thresholds should not trigger any automatic actions or measures.  To be fair, the European Union clearly recognises that youth unemployment and long-term unemployment are major social problems and has created the youth guarantee in response.  If the EU understands that the problem of youth unemployment should be targeted and has provided &euro;6 billion in funding to combat it, why can it not put in place some form of  mechanism that would kick in when alarming levels of social alienation, exclusion or marginalisation are reached?  This matter needs to be teased out.</p><p>  The EU is trying to measure education, training and protection of human health in the social exclusion field.  I do not like to read the rankings relating to the educational standards in schools.  By anyone's standards, my constituency, Dublin South-Central, is a very challenging one <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> social exclusion.  Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard in the constituency were both targeted under the EU's URBAN I and URBAN II programmes and the people who live there benefited immensely as a result.  The rankings to which I refer indicate that 50% of students from Loreto College in Crumlin now go on to third level.  Leaving aside the debate about private fee-paying schools, I am under the impression - our guests can correct me if I am wrong - that we seem to be doing very well in the context of children, even those from working class communities, gaining access to further education.  I presume this is one of the indicators of whether we are doing things right or wrong.  Do our guests agree that we have made major strides in the context of providing a good educational base in working class communities throughout the country and in facilitating access to third level?</p></speech>

Ms O'Connor referred to women's participation in decision making.  If there was a scoreboard in this regard, what position would Ireland hold on it?  What indicators could be used to best monitor this?  Ms O'Connor also referred to gender disaggregation of indicators and provided some examples.  Are there any more specific indicators which are urgently required in order to track development in this area?</p><p>  Mr. Doorley spoke about engagement at member state level.  He referred to the role social actors should play in terms of such engagement and stated that they should have an input into country-specific recommendations and corrective plans.  My question relates to the funding for the youth employment initiative - which is coming from Structural Funds - and macroeconomic conditionality.  That latter is being attached to EU Structural Funds for the next budgeting period.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is on record as stating that "Macroeconomic conditionality or measures linked to sound economic governance will ensure that Cohesion Policy is consistent with wider EU economic governance".</p> <p>If countries are found to be in breach of some of their obligations and they fail to take effective action on economic recommendations repeatedly, payments may be suspended.  Would Mr. Doorley have concerns that the youth employment initiative might be affected perhaps not in Ireland, but in other member states?  It was mentioned that if that happened or there were small breaches of the macroeconomic conditionality, there would have to be dialogue and it would be up to member states to make changes to partnership agreements, but would Mr. Doorley have a fear that it could affect the youth guarantee?  A reply to a parliamentary question stated that it would be up to a member state to review and propose amendments to partnership agreements.  Would Mr. Dooley's organisation feed into the Oireachtas or the Ministers to ensure that youth guarantee or youth employment funding is not affected by any potential imbalances?</p></speech>

On the issue of the maximisation of women's participation in the workforce, to what extent has she examined the European experiences in that area and compared them with ours with a view to addressing the issues that prevent women from participating in the workforce here and how they have dealt with those issues in the European context?  She referred to the issue of rearing a family.  Some women wish to take time out to rear their families.  It is a choice they would have like to have as opposed to being forced to go in one direction or another.  To what extent does she consider women here have a choice in that area in comparison to their European colleagues?  The issue of choice in some cases is important, particularly in times of economic difficulty.</p><p>  How does Ms O'Connor envisage the youth guarantee affecting the younger generation of women in this country, given the work incentive schemes in place to draw people away from unemployment?  What needs most to be addressed in that area?</p><p>  Ms O'Connor mentioned young single parents and I agree with what she said.  One of the biggest problems in that area is the lack of adequate housing, certainly in the area in which I live where matters have reached an appalling state and young people are regularly in tears at the prospect of being homeless.  It is sad situation.  That is the way it is.  There are no rented properties available for them other than at a rent they cannot afford.  Local authorities ceased building houses ten years ago which leaves them in a very difficult and vulnerable situation.</p><p>  I saw a recent study on young people, boys and girls aged ten to 17, which is a very vulnerable age group, who were referred to accident and emergency departments with suspected self-harm arising from self-harm.  To what extent, does the Ms O'Connor's organisation have the wherewithal to focus on and address such subjects.  It is a sensitive and difficult subject but one which remains with us.  Oddly, twice as many girls as boys in that age group presented at accident and emergency departments.</p><p>  Turning to Mr. James Doorley, how does he consider the youth guarantee is likely to work when it percolates down into the Irish system in addition to the systems already in place to deal with youth unemployment?  In Europe, research has been done which suggests that young people do not wish or are reluctant to work, but I do not find that to be case with males or females.  There is some research to back up that view and that may well be the case throughout Europe.  However, given that disincentives to encouraging young people into workforce has been largely removed, albeit through necessity in this jurisdiction, how does Mr. Doorley consider the situation is affecting young people's morale, their sense of well-being and their confidence?  What is the best way to address the issues presenting to them in terms of gaining access to the workforce?  He mentioned that many young people are offered temporary jobs, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  It gives them experience, an opportunity to gain confidence in the workforce and realise what work is like and what they have to do in order to compete with those around them.  From my experience, a high proportion of temporary job placements have led to permanent jobs in the same firms.  I would like to hear Mr. Dooley's comments on this area.</p><p>  We have a high proportion of young people, much higher than some other European countries, although the Latin countries also have a high proportion of young people, but we do not always compare like with like.  Given that youth unemployment levels are extraordinarily high throughout Europe, in the context of an upsurge in the economy, does Mr. Doorley consider our young potential workforce will be well placed and have sufficient skill to access that employment?  I attended a seminar on this subject not so long ago at which it was indicated that many employers consider the skills of the young people presenting to them are inadequate to meet the challenges in today's workplace.  How do we deal with that?</p><p>  I presume I mentioned the matter of individualisation.</p></speech>

If I did not mention it, this is an issue for Ms. O'Connor.  I should have led on to individualisation from my point regarding women having a choice of going to work or not going, that being their entitlement and right.  Individualisation has been cited as an obstacle or a method whereby women were forced to work in all circumstances even though it was not advisable for them to do so in certain situations.  I apologise for going on so long.</p></speech>

It was very interesting.  I suggest that we ask Ms Orla O'Connor to respond first and then Mr. James Doorley and if there are any outstanding questions we can return to them.</p></speech>

It is a good example as it also experienced a huge financial crisis and recession.  It has also used processes of gender budgeting and equality budgeting.  The Icelandic experience is interesting in its use of these processes.  It implemented austerity measures but it used those processes to ensure that they did not particularly impact on women and women with children.  After each budget it assessed where things fell and in one budget it highlighted that a measure had a particular impact on women and reversed it in the next budget.  Therefore, it used these processes as a tool.  We had a speaker over from Iceland who spoke about this and that speaker said that now that Iceland has shifted into growth it also using this process - having regard to all the data that has been gathered by using a gender budgeting process - to highlight what it needs to focus on, who got particularly hit from measures and who needs to be focused on now.  In its last budget, it increased payments such as children's allowances.  That is one example of the use of that process.  While they have not necessarily called it gender budgeting, the Nordic countries have used a series of indicators around women's equality and they have been using those for a long time.</p><p>  On the issue of consistency, I agree it is important. </p> <p>I agree that it is important.  It is difficult.  The gender pay gap is an example of where there has been real attempts across the EU to bring up consistency of data in order to get good comparisons.  There are areas where the work on consistency has already happened.  The other area is child care.  The Barcelona targets have been set for preschool child care places.  Data have been brought up to a level where they can be consistent.  I accept it is an issue but a lot more work is being done, in particular now through the new European Institute for Gender Equality which is based in Vilnius.</p></speech>

The institute is compiling a lot of comparative data and baseline data on gender in order to get consistent indicators.  There are huge advances in that area and it should not hold us back.</p><p>  You mentioned funding, Chairman, and the carrot and the stick.  I agree with what Deputy Byrne said.  It is important that the sticks do not all relate just to the hard economic stuff and that the social dimension is all about the carrot because that is part of the problem.  Our experience of the open method of co-ordination and the series of action plans on poverty and employment is that they were all about the carrot and did not push countries other than to say they were falling down in certain respects but it did not make them do anything.  There must be obligations in terms of the social dimension.</p><p>  Senator Reilly&rsquo;s first question was where Ireland is in the EU.  I will come back to her.  I think we are about 19th but I want to check because I am not fully sure.  I am happy to e-mail the information to the committee.  In terms of indicators that could be used around women, the participation of women with children is an important issue so that we do not get lost in overall employment rates.  A really good series of indicators were developed in Ireland when we put together our national women&rsquo;s strategy.  Indicators included the availability of flexible working options.  That is an issue being examined in other European countries as well.  The Barcelona targets were used to assess child care places.  The number of after-school child care places available was also assessed.  An indicator used quite a lot by the OECD is the percentage of child care costs as a proportion of net income.  That is important in terms of Ireland because our child care costs are such a high proportion of net income.  A number of indicators can be used.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan referred to how we compare in Europe in terms of women&rsquo;s participation.  The labour force participation of women is 53.3% and the average is approximately 63% at EU level.  We are about 10% less.  What is indicative in terms of Ireland is the drop when children are present, in particular when there are more than two children.  The same drop is not experienced in many other European countries.  Ireland stands out in that regard.</p><p>  In terms of part-time workers across the EU there is a high level of women working part time so we are not particularly different in that regard, other than the Nordic countries which have a much higher proportion of women in full-time work.  Choice is an important issue.  From our work with women and from existing evidence a number of things limit choice for women.  The issue is whether the choice for women in Ireland is extremely limited; if they choose to work part time or if they choose to leave work because they want to leave work when they have two children.  One factor which constantly emerged both from statistics from research and also anecdotally is the cost of child care in Ireland and the impact of that.  If one has more than two children the cost is prohibitive.</p><p>  There is limited paid parental leave in Ireland.  If one compares Ireland to Scandinavia and the Nordic countries, one has generous proportions of leave in the early years of children&rsquo;s lives and then women go back to full-time work.  As there is no substantial paid leave in Ireland women drop out and will not necessarily go back into the workforce.  In the Scandinavian countries the connection to the labour force exists all the time.  That is a huge difference in Ireland and really inhibits choice.  It does not support women to return to work.  We know that the longer women stay out of work it becomes much harder to go back and to keep one&rsquo;s status in the labour market.  Many women who have two children in a cr&egrave;che say the only reason they stay in work is so as not to lose their place.  All their wages go on child care.</p><p>  The youth guarantee is something the National Women&rsquo;s Council has been raising with the Department of Social Protection.  We think there does need to be a gender dimension to the youth guarantee and how it plays out.  The National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland has a youth initiative called the Y Factor and a lot of the young women in that have been talking about their experiences of unemployment.  We are doing research on the different experiences of young women in comparison to young men in terms of unemployment.  The European Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men has also said there needs to be a gender dimension to the youth guarantee.  I think I have answered all questions.</p></speech>

That is a valid point.  There will always be a cohort of young people who will be in a temporary contract by choice when they are receiving college education.  The issue of temporary contracts was one of the indicators.  There was an examination of temporary contracts on a voluntary basis and an involuntary basis.  That gives a sense of the number of students, for example, who want to work part time but also the number of young people who work involuntarily on a temporary basis.  That has already been captured by the youth indicators in the work done by the Commission.  That probably deals with that issue.</p><p>  Reference was also made to migration rates, which is a big topic in Ireland at the moment.  EUROSTAT brought out figures in recent weeks on migration rates per 1,000 citizens.  Ireland has the highest rate in the EU in terms of the number of people per 1,000 in 2012.  The European Commission wants more mobility.  It is in favour of people moving around the European Union but it is probably not too enthused with young people going to Australia and Canada.  From its point of view it would like to create a scenario such as exists in the United States.  If there are jobs in California then people move from Massachusetts to California to get the jobs.  The Commission laments the fact that mobility is quite low in terms of the percentage of people who migrate to another member state.</p><p>  From our perspective there are opportunities in Germany or on the Continent that are closer to Ireland than Australia or Canada but unfortunately language skills are a big problem.  Ireland scores very low in regard to language skills.  That is something that is in the document that I did not raise in my presentation.  If that was an indicator Ireland and the United Kingdom would score badly in terms of people having a second language or a third language.</p></speech>

In terms of sanctions, the carrot and stick approach is an issue.  Deputy Byrne mentioned that as well.  The European Union always worked in this area on the basis of voluntary participation and more on the name-and-fame approach rather than the name-and-shame approach.  It is a question of whether a member state is trying to do something and failing or is not bothered.  If a member state, through its economic or social policies, were to create instability in Europe or social unrest, that would be an issue for the rest of the European Union.  It could create a problem whereby a member state which has limited resources would get punished for not doing more, which punishes people in the state more because there is less money going into an area.  It is a catch-22 situation.  As Ms O&rsquo;Connor said, the carrot approach is preferable but there must be a sanction.  That brings me back to the point made by Deputy Byrne that as a last resort we need some sanction if a member state is failing to act on youth employment or other issues because it does not care or is not bothered.  If they do not deal with it then it will probably become an issue for the rest of the European Union.</p></speech>

We know that if member states infringe a treaty, a directive or the other legal mechanisms they can be referred by the Commission to the European Court of Justice from which there are potential financial implications, but a treaty change or some other change would probably be required to have that happen.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne spoke about progression on education.  That is probably one of the areas where we have seen a good deal of success in Ireland.  In terms of the Europe 2020 strategy on school completion rates, Ireland is doing very well in keeping young people in education for as long as possible.  On employment, data was published some years ago indicating that youth unemployment for third level graduates was approximately 18% whereas for young people who left school after the junior certificate it was approximately 65%.  There is a big correlation, therefore, between educational attainment and employment.  That is a success.  Nobody can deny that we have done well in that area but the question is whether we can do even better in that regard.</p><p>  Senator Reilly raised the issue of the macroeconomic conditionality.  That is a major concern because if on the one hand a member state is told it must meet all the social indicators while, on the other, it is required to reduce spending or debt to GDP or whatever, there is a clash between the two objectives.  It is being told to spend and invest more in young people or women, in terms of addressing issues of inequality, while another arm of the Commission is telling it that it must reduce its spending.  That is a dilemma.</p><p>  We had a meeting with the official regarding the European social funds.  In the past the process was that the member state produced the plan at the start, was required to do a mid-term review of spending following which the funds might be adjusted on the basis of its performance, and then it would be reviewed at the end of that process.  The European Commission is now insisting on an annual review of the work being done and, therefore, if a member state is not seen to be implementing what it promised at the start of the programme or whatever, the Commission is stating clearly that it will examine the amount of funding that has been given.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan spoke about the youth guarantee.  There is a good deal of progress in that area.  The European institutions have allocated &euro;6 billion to this area, which is very welcome.  Ireland must submit its youth guarantee implementation plan by the end of the year.  The Department of Social Protection held a consultation meeting a number of weeks ago.  We have made a submission.  We are concerned that what is being guaranteed, which is a quality offer of education, training and work experience within four months of becoming unemployed, will be a big ask.  The funding currently available, which is approximately &euro;200 million in 2014 and 2015, is not sufficient in our view in terms of having enough resources to provide the places or the actual staff to engage with young people because the individual plan each young person is meant to undertake is part of that.  We may need to examine from where we should start in that regard.  Obviously, we will not start with all young people who meet the criteria.  There might be a question of starting with those young people who need it most.  Young people who have been the longest unemployed would be one criterion.  We are making progress.  We would hope there will be some engagement with civil society before the Irish plan is submitted to Brussels.  We would be anxious to contribute to it.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy Dara Murphy.</p><p>  We are dealing with item No. 1 Supplementary Estimate - Vote 18 [Shared Services], Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The D&aacute;il, by order of 26 November 2013, referred Supplementary Estimate - Vote 18 [Shared Services] to the Select Sub-Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform, pursuant to Standing Orders 82A(3)(<i>c</i>) and (6)(<i>a</i>) and 159(3) for the select sub-committee to report back to the D&aacute;il by no later than 12 December. </p><p>  I welcome the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and his officials.  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.  </p></speech>

Those are three that we have set out.  2013 was the first year of the Vote and, following Government approval, certain projects have transitioned from design stage into implementation.    </p><p>  As part of the implementation phase, the Office of Government Chief Information Officer entered negotiations with suppliers for the provision of licences for the IT equipment.  The result of these negotiations is that certain licences have been purchased on a once-off basis rather than annual payments.  These licence costs are deemed to be of a capital nature and the costs will be depreciated over the useful life of the equipment in the appropriations accounts of the Department.</p><p>  The approval of the committee is sought for this technical supplement to reclassify current budget into capital.  It is important to note that no additional budget is sought and the Vote will return a saving to the Exchequer at the end of the year.  For the information of the committee, we expect the saving to about &euro;4 million.    </p></speech>

On the Peoplepoint and payroll shared services projects, I am aware there were significant initial costs involved in the setting up of the projects in the first year.  I understand from what I have heard across the public service there are set-up costs for projects for the first two years and then they start to save money from year 3 onwards.  From where will the savings come?  In terms of the way I see the public service operating, people will migrate to this section, millions of euro has been spent on the section and then it will provide savings but there will only be savings if there are fewer staff in another part of the organisation.  If something similar was happening in the private sector, and I am not recommending this, there would be fewer staff in the organisation in the long term.  From where will the savings come in the line Departments in respect of which services are being shared through this central body, if the numbers continue to remain the same?</p></speech>

It is expanding quicker than we expected and 40 more are to transition between now and the end of next year.  At that point the forecasted savings are reckoned to be of the order of &euro;12.5 million per annum.  From where do those savings come is the Deputy's question.  It is due to a reduction of 149 full-time equivalent staff working in transactional human resource activities.  There is a range of efficiencies to be achieved in that instead of approximately 60 organisations doing their own human resource management, we will have one human resource management section -  Peoplepoint, a stand-alone section with everybody in it specifically trained in human resources.  We have that resource to deal with all those organisations and we will do that with 149 fewer people.</p></speech>

Perhaps I was not clear in putting my question.  Take any of the organisations whose function is transferred to Peoplepoint and, say, five people were involved in the payroll in that section-----</p></speech>

Let us say five people are dealing with human resources or payroll in an organisation and those functions are transferred to Peoplepoint or payroll shared services, those five people are no longer required to do that work in the organisation as it is now being done centrally.  Those five people will be subsumed somewhere else in the organisation to do other work, perhaps because a person has left some other section.  Where is the saving in that exercise?  It is not as if there are five fewer people in the public service.  As those five people are now doing some other work, where is the saving?</p></speech>

If there are people who do no move to the new Peoplepoint service, they are available for redeployment to cover retirements and the normal churn or turnover of staff.  They are within the employment control frameworks that we have and we are fixing to save this quantum of staff through Peoplepoint alone.  There will be more through the payroll shared centre as I have explained.  Peoplepoint is one single centre in Clonskeagh.  I do not know if the Deputy has had a chance to go out and have a look at it but it would be worth his while to do that.  We have made a decision on the payroll shared service.  We are going to have three in that respect because that was the most efficient way of doing it.</p> <p>We had three in operation because that was the most efficient way of doing it.  We have more than three now and we will migrate the work into them.  They will make savings when they are fully operational.  They are behind Peoplepoint, which was the first.</p></speech>

Does that happen?  Is the employment control framework reduced by the number of staff that used to be in the section?  If so, there are fewer staff members.</p></speech>

Will the counting of the clock be made retrospective?  The most fundamental thing we learned is that legislation cannot be made retrospective.

It provides the legal framework for risk equalisation in 2013.  My policy objectives are to have a risk equalisation scheme that will continue to be as effective as possible in providing the necessary support in terms of community rating, while remaining robust and transparent, promoting fair and open competition in the market and ensuring there is no over-compensation from the scheme for any insurer, as required by the European Union in its approval of risk equalisation in the period 2013 to 2015.</p> <p> The main purpose of this Bill is to specify the amount of the hospital bed utilisation credit and the amount of risk equalisation credits, in respect of age, gender and level of cover, payable to insurers from the risk equalisation fund from 1 March 2014 and to make consequential amendments to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to revise the stamp duty levy required to fund the risk equalisation credits for 2014.

The hospital bed utilisation charge, which was &euro;75 but has now been reduced to &euro;60, will be paid back by the risk equalisation fund to the insurers for patients who are in a bed.  This is about helping us know the health status of insured people.  In other words, the insurers know who has been in hospital and in a hospital bed, but we have no way of knowing.  By paying this small discount back to the insurers, we have an understanding of which of the insurers' clients are high or low users.  This gives us some indication of their health status.  To make it simple, if insurers have 40,000 clients and we see that only 3,000 of these have availed of a bed and we have paid the hospital bed utilisation charge, we know the rest of the 40,000 clients never ended up in a hospital bed.  The charge gives us more information on the health status of people insured privately.  That is information that is not available to us otherwise.  This system is not ideal, but it is one way of gaining knowledge of people's health usage and status.  This is not a cost to insurers, but is a return to them.</p></speech>

I disagree with the use of this as an indication of health status.  The hospital bed utilisation credit is the wrong way to go in regard to defining health status.  When the legislation was introduced 12 months ago and this new definition, the hospital bed utilisation credit, was introduced into the health insurance system, we had this debate.  The Minister has explained the basis for the credit and I understand that.  The difficulty is that now, 12 months down the road, we are still using the same tool to measure health status.  This encourages health insurers to send clients through the hospital system, which is contrary to the direction we should be taking.  We should be encouraging insurers to ensure people are treated outside of the hospital system.</p><p>  The Minister will argue that this is a relatively small payment that is only indicative of the utilisation of health services in general, but the ethos and thrust behind the development of our health service and everything the Minister has espoused is to try to encourage insurers to ensure people are treated as close as possible to home and in the primary care setting where possible.  This is part of our objective of universal health insurance.  This bed utilisation credit system builds in an incentive for people to be treated within the hospital setting.</p><p>  I know the Minister will make the financial argument that the cost of a hospital bed is &euro;600 or &euro;700 a day and that the insurer is only getting a return of &euro;60.  However, the problem is the ethos created in regard to this.  The Minister's accounting mechanism in regard to insurance acknowledges someone's occupation of a hospital bed as a calculation in regard to health status.  We should be doing the opposite.  We should be rewarding insurers that keep people out of hospital and that, through proactive schemes, ensure they do not go into hospital.  We should have a far more effective mechanism of measuring health status than hospital bed utilisation.  I cannot see how, 12 months after the introduction of this measure, we have not developed this.  All we are doing is tweaking and tinkering with hospital bed utilisation rather than coming up with a more accurate assessment.  As the Minister said, the legislation we are dealing with now is putting risk equalisation on a permanent basis.  As a result, it is also putting the measure of hospital bed utilisation on a permanent basis, instead of coming up with a more effective way of measuring health status.</p></speech>

However, I accept that the risk equalisation approach is necessary in the context of where we are at this point in time and have no problem accepting that this is a requirement.  I have some concerns and am disappointed my amendments have not been allowed.</p><p>  In regard to hospital bed utilisation, I understand from the experience of others that in day cases where there is so-called bed utilisation - it is questionable as to whether these cases constitute bed usage because they are dealt with in a day ward where there are a number of trolley facilities - significant charges apply.  These charges do not only apply to overnight stays.  Will the Minister throw some light on this situation?  Do these charges apply universally for privately insured day case patients presenting at hospitals?  Are they charged significant sums for the utilisation of a bed over a period of hours during the day, when there is no overnight stay?  What is the situation in regard to patients who are referred to the private attention of doctors and consultants?</p></speech>

The Deputy stated I will say this is a small amount of money by comparison to the true cost and of course I will because it is true.  Anybody who has any business acumen would know it would not be a very clever business proposition to spend &euro;800 or &euro;850 on a bed to get &euro;60 back.  I reject the contention it is a problem from an ethos point of view.

This comes back to the point I made on health status.  We should, through legislation, encourage insurers in so far as it is possible to improve the health status of patients and not use this measurement with regard to hospital bed utilisation.  The difficulty I have with the response given by the Minister is this time last year I proposed a sunset clause on the hospital bed utilisation credit and the Minister assured me at the time that during 2013 he would come up with a far more effective tool with regard to health status.  Here we are at the end of 2013 and he is now telling me this will happen in 2014.  Health insurance premia are rising on a daily basis.  Will hospital bed utilisation be taken off the statute this time next year or will we be back here at square one in 12 months time?</p></speech>

I am not happy it gives us the full measure but it gives us some measure.  We have discussed this issue with the insurers and we continue to examine further measures we can agree between us.</p><p>  I wish to share some good news with the committee.  As all private patients will pay for their services from 1 January, it has been possible to reduce the level of charges for private patients for day case surgery.  The day case charge has been reduced by 50% from &euro;828 to &euro;407.</p><p>  I accept we need greater measurements of health status and a raft of measures need to be taken in health.  We are taking it one step at a time.  We are committed to universal health insurance and we will get there.  We are building the building blocks.  I could take up another 20 minutes going through what has been done already but I will be directed by the Chairman to stick to the Bill----- </p></speech>

Are there any plans to allow the insurers negotiate with the public hospitals, even the hospital groups?

In the longer term this is what will pertain.  Insurers and the health care commissioning agency will negotiate with providers to get the best deal they can.  There are reports of certain hospitals which have additional capacity that could be used.  We must be careful how it is used because we have had incidents in the past were hospitals have been very productive, which is great to see and the money follows the patient, but they have been active in a way we did not request.  In other words, we have set targets that nobody should wait longer than eight months for an inpatient treatment, but we find some hospitals focus on those waiting three to five months instead of those waiting for longer than eight months, burning up their budget on the money follows the patient side and coming back with their hands out stating they cannot make their list because they got it wrong.  We will not tolerate this.  People will be given very clear instructions on how to approach the waiting list.  Once the urgent cases and cancer cases are looked after the longest waiter should be seen first.  Nobody will disagree with this.  Failure to adhere to this cannot be rewarded.  At the same time we do not want to dampen down what has clearly proven to be a very good incentive for hospitals to become much more productive.</p></speech>

The rationale behind it is quite simple.  Under the provision in the Bill, VHI can make up to 12% profit on its equity before it is deemed to be over-compensated by the fund.  Any analysis of the equity and return on investments of insurance companies suggests 10% is a fair and reasonable figure.  VHI is already heavily subsidised in the context of risk equalisation as a result of the age profile of its customers.  It is over-compensated and over-subsidised.  Is this a method by which the calf is being fattened before it is put up for sale?  A key issue which must be addressed relates to the fact that VHI is over-compensated by other health insurers as a result of the age profile of its customers and the provisions relating to the risk equalisation fund.  Allowing it to make a further 12% on equity is a step too far.  A reduction to 10% would oblige it to become more streamlined and efficient.  It would also, as the Minister has stated on many occasions, encourage it to drive down its costs.  In addition, he has requested that the company bring in various organisations and firms to assist it in this regard.  If I was obtaining a 12% return on my money, I would be an extremely happy camper.</p><p>  Effectively, this over-compensation and over-subsidisation of VHI by other insurers is a hindrance to competition in the market.  The hallmark of the Minister's policy is that he wants vigorous competition in the market in order to drive down costs because this would make health insurance more affordable.  Again, I return to the simple principle underlying the Minister's policy, namely, that everything that is done runs contrary to what he is saying in the context of escalating private health insurance costs.  He must examine this matter, particularly as money is being transferred from other insurers to VHI.  As stated, VHI will be allowed to make up to 12% on its equity before it is deemed to be over-compensated by the fund.  If the figure was reduced to 10%, the company would obviously not receive as much in compensation.</p></speech>

It has European Union approval.  In this decision, the European Commission has concluded that the risk equalisation scheme satisfies the conditions laid down in the 2012 EU framework for state aid in the form of public service compensation.  It is, therefore, a scheme which is compatible with the internal market under Article 106(2) TFEU.  On the basis of external and internal benchmark calculations, the Commission accepts the Irish authorities' proposal to consider VHI as over-compensated if its return is above 12%.  The Deputy's proposal would, therefore, run contrary to what was approved by the Commission earlier this year.  Furthermore, independent advice, including that of the Health Insurance Authority, indicates that this is a reasonable percentage.</p><p>  The Deputy has referred to the fact that I want to drive down costs.  That is certainly the case.  It is a matter of great concern to me that premia continue to rise year on year and that a medical inflation rate of 9% was accepted for many years, including by the Government of which the Deputy was a member.  Since 2009 every other area has been hit by deflation, but the cost of health insurance continues to rise.  As stated, there has not been sufficient auditing of the system.  Astonishingly, a clinical audit has not been carried out.  This means that no one is challenging doctors on why they have certain tests performed on patients.  That matter must be addressed.  There has been no benchmarking process in respect of what is being paid for.  As a result, procedures which now only take 20 minutes to complete are still being paid for at the rate which applied when they took two hours to carry out.  Ten or 12 procedures can now be carried out on one day and this would result in individual consultants receiving incomes of &euro;450,000 per year on the basis of working a one-day week.  We cannot afford or sustain this and nothing was previously done to address this problem.  However, we are now taking steps to tackle it.</p><p>  The reason we have not been able to deal with it is the relevant contracts will not become renewable until the beginning of next year.  We are going to tackle it and we are also going to introduce a clinical audit whereby cardiologists will challenge other cardiologists and surgeons will challenge other surgeons.  We are also going to introduce benchmarking and thereby evaluate why we pay what we are paying as opposed to allowing the current position to continue to obtain.  What happens when a new procedure is introduced is similar to what occurs when new technology comes into being; it is very expensive at the beginning but as increasing numbers of people buy it and volume increases, costs go way down.  Mobile phones used to be the size of bricks and cost a fortune.  The most up-to-date models allow a person to do a hell of a lot more than previously and, relatively speaking, they probably cost less.  The situation is the same with regard to the matter under discussion.  Nothing was done about it in the past, but we are taking steps to tackle it.</p><p>  I would like the Deputy to consider something.  If the risk equalisation scheme were over-compensating in an attractive way, why would new insurers not have the same share of older customers as VHI?  He has stated money is being transferred to VHI which has more customers than the other insurers.  Let us consider the example of Aviva Health Insurance which has 17% of the market.  If it had a reasonable share across all age groups, one would expect that it would also have 17% of those aged 70 to 79 years.  That is not unreasonable, is it?  However, it only has 9% of those in that category.  One would also expect that it would have 17% of those over 80 years of age, but it actually only has 6%.  Why is that?  GloHealth only has 1% of the market and it has no customers in these age groups.  As a result, it is not relevant to this discussion.  Laya Healthcare has 22% of the market.  As a result, one would expect it to have 22% of those in the 70 to 79 age bracket.  However, it only has 12% of these customers.  One would also expect it to have 22% of those over 80 years of age, whereas it has only 6%.  If risk the equalisation scheme were so attractive, these insurers would surely be advertising in order to try to attract older clients, but we all know that they do not do this.  The reason they offer over 256 different policies is to confuse people and facilitate their segmenting of the market.  In the next year we are going to put in place legislation that will allow the Health Insurance Authority to beef up its approach, control the market in a much greater way and reduce the number of packages on offer as they are confusing people.</p> <p>I am very happy to say that the HIA has a website where people can get very good advice on the policies best suited to their individual needs.  I advise anybody who is listening or viewing the proceedings to avail of that service.  In my view, the myriad of policies is a deliberate cause of confusion.  People should take advice also on whether their children require the same level of cover.</p></speech>

If the Minister carries out his audit and enacts legislation on competing policies, will the customer see a reduction in the cost of his premium?  The Minister is correct; the graph is going one way and the cost is not coming down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.1375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013120300006#E00300"><p>There is no rationale for this.  Is it feasible that medical inflation is running at 9% when the rest of the country was in deflation and only in recent times has returned to very low single-digit inflation?  There is no logical explanation.  As a doctor working in the system, I see no logical explanation for it.  What we have seen is a drop in the number of people insured and at the same time an increase in the number of claims and an increase in the number of payouts.  Clearly, the controls on the private health insurance system are not what they should be.  We will rectify that.  If we do not rectify it, we will have an unaffordable health service when there is universal health insurance.  That is not what we intend doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.1376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013120300006#E00400"><p>Central to the principle of intergenerational solidarity is community rating and risk equalisation.  It is obvious from the statistics that insurers are cherry-picking the newer entrants to the markets.  One of the reasons for the choice of 260 policies arises from a Bill on advanced and non-advanced health care products.  We were told at one stage that a substantial number of existing policies would qualify as non-advanced, so they would attract a lower duty and risk equalisation levy.  That did not happen.  They all turned out to be in the advanced category.  The difficulty I have with the section, and the reason for my amendments Nos. 3 and 4, is that the VHI will be allowed to make a 12% return on its equity before it is deemed to be over-compensated.  When the return on equity goes over 12% it will receive a lower amount from the fund.  The point is that a return of 12% on equity investment is deemed to be good.  The Minister stated that the HIA had done the assessment and deemed that a 12% return was reasonable; however, the Minister has not always agreed with its recommendations.  I cannot believe he can cherry-pick and dismiss other proposals and recommendations by the HIA.  For those reasons, I believe this is critical to ensuring we have a stable, viable, vibrant health insurance market.</p><p>  The Minister referred to the rise in the cost of claims and payouts on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, but the reason is that 240,000 healthy young people have left the market, so the burden is falling on fewer people the whole time.  We have a smaller cohort of younger healthy people cross-subsidising older people who need more supports and will be in hospital more often and drawing from the health insurance companies.  That is an actuarial fact that cannot be disputed.  The private health insurance companies and the Health Insurance Authority appeared before the committee and what they said concurs with the report published by Colm McCarthy.  The only dissenting voice is that of the Minister.  This proposal will cause difficulties in the sense that it will not allow companies to attract and cherry-pick customers.  It is better that people have some health insurance rather than no insurance, because there will be at least some transfer in risk from healthier younger people to older people.  If they are not in the market, it will cause major problems.  I believe the Minister is presiding over an insurance market that is in crisis. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.1380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12013120300006#E00800"><p>In the context of his earlier contribution, has the Minister re-examined the issue of lifetime community rating?  We discussed this issue during a debate on a Bill this time last year which is now on the Statute Book and at that time the Minister undertook to investigate it.  Will he comment on it?</p><p>  There is merit in Deputy Kelleher's amendments.  By reducing the threshold from 12% to 10%, it would reduce the demand on the risk equalisation fund and as a result reduce the upward pressure on the health insurance levy.  It would mean that across the board everyone paying health insurance would pay a reduced levy.  That would be a positive development.  I accept that the European Commission has said 12% is adequate, but the health insurance system is in crisis and this would alleviate the pressure.  The Minister has given very stark figures on the percentages of people over the ages of 70 and 80 years who change provider in the health insurance market.  He told people to shop around and said the HIA has a very good website, but as a person who has used the HIA website, I found it very confusing.  I am half the age of an 80 year old and I would not like to be that person trying to negotiate his or her way over the web.  The HIA has a fund of &euro;8 million in cash; would it not make far more sense for it to tap into some of that money, engage with active age organisations around the country and Age Action Ireland and actively sit down with older people and show them where they can get the same level of cover at a cheaper price from another insurer?  The HIA has appeared before this committee and has given evidence that some of the other insurance companies are providing the exact same cover, but older people are risk averse and afraid to shift from one insurance company to another.  This is part of the problem.  My point is that the HIA itself needs to actively engage with this issue.  It is a damning indictment of the HIA that there is such a stark contrast between the overall level of cover and that of the different age cohorts.  If the Aviva and Laya health insurance companies had a higher number in the older age cohort, it would reduce the overall pressure on the risk equalisation fund and as a consequence reduce the cost of health insurance for everyone.</p></speech>

Has the Minister or his officials extrapolated exactly the comparative impacts on the customer base of the difference between the 12% and 10% levy?  As the Chairman said, it is about the customer at the end of the day.</p> <p>I hope there is a wish across the board that the negative impact, in terms of cost for policy holders across the various competing entities, will be kept to a minimum.  There should be no increase.  Amendment No. 8 in my name sought to ensure this would be a consequence of the legislation, but it was ruled out of order.  Has the Minister carried out an assessment of the likely impact of the figures now being discussed in the context of amendments Nos. 3 and 4?  Can he provide us with a summary of the comparative projected impacts in order that we will be better informed when we consider his argument in favour of the figure of 12% and Deputy Billy Kelleher's argument in favour of a figure of 10%?</p></speech>

The HIA's website is somewhat confusing, even for those of us who are some way nimble on the computer.  The HIA, to be fair, has engaged in a significant amount of promotion, but it would be a great idea for it to engage with elderly people who tend to be risk-averse, as the Minister said.  A good marketing campaign might encourage them to shop around.  We know what Mary Harney meant when she famously said people should shop around.  It is important that we make it easy for people to do so.  The insurers have their own vantage point, as is their entitlement, but we have a duty to look after the consumer also.</p></speech>

Older people much prefer to engage over the telephone.

It is not a runner; it really is not going to happen.  The HIA has a telephone number and its staff are very happy to talk to people.  I know and accept totally that older people are much more familiar with this mode of communication than they are with the Internet.  I think the HIA has done some sterling work in that regard and is continuing to do so.</p></speech>

I am just posing the question.  My only concern or motivation is to drive down the cost for the consumer because it has become prohibitive.  There is a duty on all of us to make sure we get that message across.  Health insurers only care about themselves.  The rest of us have a different vantage point.</p></speech>

The spread is not better because the market is segmented.  The HIA would have to be given much stronger powers if it were to be in a position to prevent this.  That matter is under consideration.</p><p>  The HIA&rsquo;s role in the health insurance market has changed considerably in recent years.  Its workload has increased substantially since its establishment owing to the changing nature of the private health insurance market.  We are considering its role as part of the implementation of a universal health insurance system.  I intend to have a review carried out in the coming months to assess the current role and functions of the HIA, with a view to determining how they can be strengthened and enhanced to fulfil any requirement that may arise when the universal health system is in operation.</p><p>  The &euro;8 million fund that the Chairman mentioned cannot be frittered away.  The HIA has a significant amount of work to do.  It will need to take on more personnel to do the work involved in monitoring and correcting what is happening in the insurance business.  As a universal health insurance system is introduced, we want to make sure we have proper controls at regulator level with regard to matters such as the pricing of packages, etc.  There is a need for clarity.</p><p>  In fairness to Deputy Denis Naughten, the idea of engaging with Age Action Ireland and other bodies on how to communicate better with older people is a good one.  I will ask the HIA to take it on board and consider running information campaigns to encourage older people to shop around.  As Deputies have said, older people are reluctant to change.  There is no question about this.</p><p>  I would like to respond to the contention discussed with regard to non-advanced and advanced policies.  At the end of March this year, when we brought forward the new Act, there were 20 non-advanced policies.  The number of such policies is now 34.  It is open to the market to offer more of these products.  As we all know and as I said previously, these companies make their profits from younger people who do not get sick.  Perhaps they are not using these profits to attract more young people.</p><p>  We do not know what Laya&rsquo;s gross capital investment is, but we know from last night&rsquo;s programme that it has made a profit of &euro;5 million.  There is a great deal of money in the health insurance market and I do not believe for one minute that VHI is being over-compensated.</p><p>  it seems Deputy Billy Kelleher wants to second-guess the HIA and the European Commission.  By the way, the Commission&rsquo;s report has been published, although the HIA&rsquo;s report has not.</p></speech>

I am not prepared to accept it.  I do not accept the claim that the HIA is not doing the job it is empowered to do, or that certain figures represent a "damning indictment" of it.</p><p>  Deputies raised the issue of community lifetime rating which I am examining actively because I agree with the principle that somebody who has been insured for all of his or her life should not be charged the same as somebody who decided to become insured for the first time at the age of 55 years.  I do not think that is fair.  We can look at other ways of encouraging more young people to enter the market.  The insurers could be doing certain things that are not prohibited by law, but they are choosing not to do them.  I am not prepared to accept amendments Nos. 3 and 4.</p></speech>

It does not include a reference to whether the relevant figure should be 8%, 9% or 10%.  According to the Minister, the figure is determined by the HIA on the basis of its assessment of what would be a reasonable profit rate return on equity.  If we allow VHI to make a profit of 12% on its equity before it is deemed to be over-compensated by the fund, the effect will be that the company will receive more in compensation than it would if the figure was 10%.  That is a statistical and mathematical fact.  It is not a logarithm or an algorithm; it is a mathematical equation.</p><p>  It would be better if there were more young people in the insurance market than is the case, regardless of whether they are cherry-picked.  The HIA&rsquo;s report makes it clear that young people are dropping out of the health insurance market in their droves.  The method of transfer in the risk equalisation fund from other insurers to VHI, on the basis of the company&rsquo;s demographics and age cohort, means that insurance will cost more.  That is a simple fact.  Therefore, young people will not be encouraged to enter the health insurance market in the first place.  That will mean that there will be fewer people supporting the risk equalisation fund and thereby supporting older people.</p><p>  I would like to take up the Minister on what he said about the fact that insurance companies were making money out of young people.  Of course, they are making money out of young people.  It is better that there be more young people insured in order that they will transfer to the risk equalisation fund.  That is what the fund is for.</p> <p>It is better that there would be more young people insured so they would transfer to the risk equalisation fund.  That is the purpose of the fund.  The Minister should be doing everything in his power to assist and encourage aggressive marketing by the insurers of good quality cover that would be attractive to young people and the opposite is the case.  This is one more case in point.  The 12% will mean that there will be a larger transfer from younger healthier people to VHI's cohort, which means higher insurance for younger people.  I do not understand how the Minister does not see that as the corollary of what will happen.  </p></speech>

Considering the intrinsic variability present in such calculations the Commission accepts the proposal of the Irish authorities to consider that VHI is over compensated if its return on equity is above 12%.  </blockquote>That is a direct quote.  Is Deputy Kelleher suggesting for a half a minute that VHI is making unreasonable profits?  That is what he seems to be saying.</p></speech>

It would be great if it was making a profit.  The difficulty we have is that it would put more fat into the system if VHI was obligated to have a 10% return on equity.  This would put further pressure on VHI to be lean, efficient and effective - everything the Minister says day in and day out that he wants it to do.</p></speech>

How about that?  At the moment, what we are talking about here is putting in place a clause that will not allow it to exceed 12%.  I look forward to the day when it reaches 10%, let alone exceeds it.  The risk equalisation has increased from 73% to 78% the effectiveness of the compensation for people over the age of 70 and under the age of 80 and increased the effectiveness for people over 80 years from 83% to 86%, so they are not fully compensated by any means by these measures.  In fact, they are continually complaining to me about that and they are independently assessed figures.  Rather than continue around the Houses I reject the amendments and suggest we put it to a vote.</p></speech>

Therefore, a person's insurance was the net amount for which they were billed, because the tax relief was deducted at source.  What is happening now is that there is a cap on tax relief, &euro;1,000 for an adult, &euro;500 for a child, which means that the average two plus two policy with VHI will increase substantially.  This is about giving people more information because it is now a determining factor in the cost of private health insurance.</p></speech>

It is a move we would make in any event.  Up until now many people did not know precisely what their insurance was costing, they just knew what they had to pay.  They did not realise the true cost of what the taxpayer was subsidising.  For the information of the Deputy, two years ago it cost the taxpayer &euro;400 million in tax subsidy, last year it cost &euro;450 million and this year it will cost &euro;500 million.  That is an unsustainable increase in tax subsidies by any stretch of the imagination.  In any event, that is a taxation matter for the Minister for Finance.  My duty of care here is to people to ensure that they know what their policies are costing them, both net and gross.</p></speech>

What is happening now is that there will be an additional cost on the average health insurance policy of any family in the State whereas we were told initially that it would only be the gold plated policies.  We are talking about more than 0.5 million policies whose health insurance costs will increase due to the cap on tax relief.  The reason this information is being made available is that it will have a financial impact on their premia because there is a cap on it.  It is not that the Minister wanted to show in great light openness and transparency, it is because the Minister for Finance decided to put a cap on tax relief which drives a coach and four through the Minister's policy of universal health insurance.  We should rename universal health insurance, UHI, as unaffordable health insurance.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Minister is in an argumentative mood.  I am only trying to put forward viewpoints.  That is my duty and obligation as an Opposition Deputy as well as to at least tease out issues.  In fairness, the Minister should recognise that is the purpose of the committee.  The purpose of the committee is for the Minister to come before it, for me to put down amendments, for the Minister to answer them and for me to argue the case.  There is nothing unusual in that.  It has been happening in this House since 1922 and it should continue.  Obviously, we can have robust debate from time to time, but when I table an amendment I do so in good faith and if the Minister can counter the argument, that is fine.

Section 11 of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 in respect of the revised rates of stamp duty that will apply to health insurance contracts entered into or renewed after 1 March 2014.  The current legislation provides for the payment of the stamp duty levy by authorised insurers on a quarterly basis in respect of each health insurance contract entered into or renewed in each quarter.  The change from an annual to a quarterly payment was made to improve the overall funding of the risk equalisation scheme from a timing viewpoint, but with the overall objective that health insurers would continue to pay only one levy per insured person every 12 months.  I regret I must reject the amendment.</p></speech>

The amendment is to ensure that is not the case and that no one incurs anything more than one levy in any 12 month period.  I believe it is a perfectly fair amendment.</p><p>  In view of what the Minister said about shopping around he should be encouraging people to shop around.  This amendment is right up the Minister's street in terms of ensuring that people are encouraged to shop around.  If they do shop around and find cheaper insurance cover or more efficient cover, then they are not penalised on the double by paying two levies.</p></speech>

I understand that amendment No. 7, in the name of Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, has been ruled out of order as it proposes that the commencement of the Act would be contingent on the publication and laying of a paper before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the financing of universal health insurance.  This is in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a Second Time and, therefore, must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 131(1).</p><p>  I understand amendment No. 8, in the name of Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, provides that nothing in the Act shall authorise or permit an increase in premiums for customers consequent on the provisions of the Act.  The rate charged for premiums are decided by the health insurers and are not within the powers of the Minister.  The amendment is, therefore, outside the scope of the Bill and must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 131(1).</p><p>  I was of the impression, Deputy, that this was furnished to you.  I was told it was e-mailed to you today.  That was the point I was making at the beginning.  I was not trying to be in any way discourteous to you.  In fact, I was trying to be courteous to you.</p></speech>

I make the distinction between the two.  I have not had sight of it.</p><p>  I very well understand the point in respect of commencement.  It is an opportunity to reflect again to the Minister the importance of the White Paper on the financing of universal health insurance.  We are talking in a limbo situation in respect of the system that needs to be urgently addressed.</p><p>  I wonder about the Minister's expectation on the passage of the legislation in respect of premiums and the customer base of the various competing health insurance providers.  I would have hoped that the Minister might also have been of the view that he did not want to see a consequent further increase in already expensive premia on whole sections of our communities.</p></speech>

I certainly do not want to see that.  Next year will be very focused on renegotiating contracts with private hospitals and consultants in respect of the payments they receive, how they bill, the procedures they charge for and how they are paid.  We shall have an opportunity to reduce greatly the cost of private health care in this country, which should result in a reduction in premia for health insurance.  That is my desire and goal.  I do not suggest that it will not be fraught with difficulty and that we will have many a protestation.</p></speech>

We also want to hear his views on the challenges that face the company.</p><p>   Members will be aware of the Government's decision in May 2011 which put new arrangements in place for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  The committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairperson designate in public session to hear his views.  We trust that the debate will provide greater transparency to the process of appointments to State boards and bodies.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. John O'Connor.  </p><p>  I draw witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also wish to advise that any submission or opening statements the witness has submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I call on Mr. O'Connor to make his opening remarks. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.1485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Connor" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120300002#A00500"><p>I shall commence by apologising for having a head cold.  I hope that it does not get in the way of our communications.</p><p>  I thank the committee for affording me an opportunity to meet and outline, at an early stage, my thinking and approach that I will take if my appointment as chairperson of EirGrid is formalised.  I am honoured to have been invited by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, to chair the board of EirGrid following the expiry of the previous chairperson&rsquo;s term of office.</p><p>  In terms of State companies, EirGrid is of the first rank of importance to the social and economic well-being of the whole island of Ireland.  As the operator of the electricity grid transmission system and the single electricity market, its activities touch the lives of every person and business on the island by providing a safe and reliable supply of electricity to homes and businesses at the cheapest possible rate.  It is vital to the competitiveness of both economies and to environmental sustainability.</p><p>  At this point, I shall outline my own background.  I was born and reared on a farm in north west County Cork near the source of the River Blackwater and now live in east Cork on the Blackwater estuary.  I have spent 35 years in the Department of the environment during which I held positions as finance officer, principal in housing policy and finance and assistant secretary in charge of the planning and water division.  In these capacities, I was involved in many innovative measures, including shared ownership, the first policy and legislation to counteract social segregation in housing, reform of building society legislation, the modernisation and consolidation of planning legislation, the national spatial strategy and the modernisation of water legislation.  During the period I served on the boards of three commercial state bodies, namely, the Housing Finance Agency, Temple Bar Properties and the Dublin Docklands Authority.</p><p>  In 2000, I was appointed chairperson of An Bord Plean&aacute;la following the statutory selection process and in 2007 I was re-appointed for a further four-year term to bring me up to retirement age.  In that position it was my duty to chair the full-time board of up to 12 members and to act as the executive head of the organisation that had up to 160 staff.  During much of my time as chairperson, An Bord Plean&aacute;la operated under intense pressure arising out of a large increase in its workload. </p> <p>There was a considerable increase in productivity in the organisation without affecting the quality of its work.</p><p> The Planning and Development Act 2000 transferred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la the functions of the planning consent authority and compulsory purchase order confirmation for the national roads programme.  Subsequently, the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 similarly assigned to An Bord Plean&aacute;la the same functions in regard to other major national infrastructure, including energy, transport and environmental projects.  This arose out of widespread concerns about the delays and uncertainties around planning consent for critical infrastructure projects which were inherent in the local planning application and appeal procedures.  At the time, there were demands for the setting up of a new strategic infrastructure consent body but I was able to persuade the Government that it would be better to assign the function to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I considered it essential that the same standard and rigour of planning and environmental assessments as apply to planning applications generally would apply and be seen to apply to strategic infrastructure projects under the new regime.</p><p> During my long period of service in the Department and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I have developed a deep appreciation of our environment and heritage.  I regard them as unique assets in which every citizen has a legitimate interest and which we hold in trust for future generations.  They go to the heart of our identity and culture and must weigh very heavily in proposing, or deciding on, any development that might affect them.  I am happy that my actions in the Department and in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as reflected in the decisions of that body during my period in the chair, bear out my beliefs.  Members will be aware that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused permission for some strategic infrastructure projects and required major changes to others.</p><p> About a year ago, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, asked me to chair the pyrite resolution board.  This board was set up initially on an informal basis to deal with the damage caused by pyritic heave to dwellings and the hardship inflicted on home owners.  The Minister will introduce legislation shortly to establish the pyrite resolution board on a statutory basis.  Developing solutions to this problem has taken considerable effort and I have been devoting a lot of time to it.  However, I expect that when the arrangements for the remediation programme are finalised following the enactment of the legislation, the time commitment required of me will be reduced and I am happy that it will not, in any way, interfere with my chairmanship of EirGrid.</p><p> In taking over the chairmanship of EirGrid, I believe I am going into a well-run company that has delivered on its mandate and coped very well with the fundamental changes in the electricity market on the island of Ireland over the past decade. The east-west interconnector has been a major success for EirGrid.  Hence, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the outgoing chairperson, Ms. Bernie Gray, and to the other members of the board.  The 450 staff in Dublin and Belfast are also to be commended on their commitment and performance.</p><p> Taking the chair of such an important company is quite a daunting prospect.  However, I hope that by virtue of my experience and the skills I have developed, I will guide the board and company to further success in meeting the challenges that lie ahead in an ever-changing world.  My experience has taught me that there are certain basic competencies which any chairperson of a company such as EirGrid should have.  Leadership involves creating a vision for the organisation and unambiguously committing personally to that vision.  It also means having the self-confidence to give effective team leadership and handle difficult board situations that may arise.  The chair also needs to be able to challenge received wisdom, ask questions and analyse the answers, and to think strategically in terms of time, scope and context.  Decisiveness and the ability to bring matters to a conclusion is another quality I have learned to be essential.  An awareness of communications is also essential in the modern world.  This involves listening and the ability to convey views and decisions clearly and concisely.  I will strive to bring whatever attributes I have in these areas to the benefit of the EirGrid board and executive as it continues on its mission &ldquo;to provide quality, efficient, independent transmission and market services for the benefit of everyone across the island of Ireland&rdquo;.</p><p> EirGrid has a number of key priority objectives for the period ahead.  The first of these is to operate a safe, reliable and economic electricity system across the island based on a competitive and sustainable wholesale market.  Energy prices are one of the most critical elements of competitiveness, which is so important if we are to attract investment and make the kind of economic progress which is vital to the welfare of all Irish people.  The second is the effectiveness and timely delivery of the grid infrastructure in a manner that protects the environment to the greatest extent possible and that encourages a more diversified and lower carbon electricity generation profile and, in the process, takes on board the views of local communities.  No region of the island should be disadvantaged in competing for investment because of inadequate electricity infrastructure.  A third objective would be to utilise and develop cutting edge technology to facilitate better integration of renewable, including small scale renewable, generation.  All of these objectives must be pursued in a way that will enable us to achieve the mandatory 40% renewable target by 2020.</p><p> These objectives will require considerable resourcefulness and effort by the EirGrid board and staff over the next few years.  None of them can be taken for granted.  However, the second objective, namely, the delivery of grid infrastructure, is probably the most challenging at the moment, having regard to the level of public controversy currently surrounding it.  At the opening of the east-west interconnector, the EU Energy Commissioner said that the need for energy infrastructure development is one of the biggest energy challenges facing the EU.  Grid25 is EirGrid&rsquo;s programme for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s transmission system and I note that this document was endorsed specifically in the Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure published in 2012.  This document underlines the need and urgency for new energy infrastructure and the need for the public to have confidence that it adheres to the highest international standards of safety, health and environmental and visual impact.  It further states that the Government has confidence that the national, regional and local planning framework and the Strategic Infrastructure Act provide the framework for ensuring that all necessary standards are met and that extensive public consultation with communities are key to creating public confidence.  On the basis of my current knowledge, I have no reason to believe that EirGrid is pursuing the implementation of the Grid25 programme other than in accordance with these policies.</p><p> On taking up office as chairperson, I will work with the board to ensure the company plans these projects in an effective manner that minimises the effects on the visual environment and the natural and built heritage, and that gives the fullest assurance to people that there is no risk to their health or safety.  I strongly subscribe to the idea that meaningful public consultation with local residents, property owners and communities is an indispensable element of this.  I can assure the committee and, indeed, the public that all feedback received during each phase of the consultation will be given due consideration in the development of the projects.  Furthermore, each project is reviewed at key milestones, taking into account the most up-to-date information available, in conjunction with the feedback from the consultations.  Every issue raised during the consultation phases will be dealt with in a fully transparent manner.  I also believe that the idea of community gain, as a means of compensating communities for unavoidable impacts, can be further developed to the benefit of local communities.</p><p> To be clear, I will not, of course, involve myself in individual planning applications, attend oral hearings or anything of that nature.  It should also be noted that it is not EirGrid that will make the final decision on these projects.  When EirGrid, after its extensive deliberations, has decided on the most appropriate solution in each case, it will make an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Strategic Infrastructure Act.  During the preparatory stages, it would also have held pre-planning consultations with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In accordance with established practice, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will then hold an oral hearing into the application, at which all objectors will be heard, before making its decision to approve, reject or require an amendment of the proposal.  The board is the totally independent arbiter of these applications and it would be an offence in law for anybody to seek to influence its decision improperly.</p><p> I would like to take this opportunity to refute emphatically the reported suggestions that I would have a conflict of interest in taking up the position.  A conflict of interest is defined as a situation where personal and professional interests might conflict with those of the organisation and its stakeholders.  My chairpersonship of An Bord Plean&aacute;la ended in June 2011 and, since that date, I have had no involvement with the board, nor could I have.  My standing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the same as any other citizen.  There is no conflict between my personal interests and those of EirGrid arising out of my previous chairmanship of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  My motivation for agreeing to take on this position is one of public service.  I believe that public service is a privilege.  If the Government and the Minister consider that I can make a contribution, however small, to the welfare of the people of this island by taking this role, then I am pleased and honoured to do so.</p> <p>I will carry into this the convictions that I have held throughout my career, serving the public in an honest and transparent manner, protecting our environment and heritage and using our resources carefully.  I hope that I will be able to repay the trust that has been placed in me.  Once again I thank the committee for hearing me.  In my previous roles I have always striven for a good constructive working relationship with the relevant committees.  I want it to be the same on this occasion.  I would be keen to keep the committee informed of EirGrid&rsquo;s progress and to hear its views from time to time on our performance.</p><p> I will be glad to take any questions or listen to any comments from the Chairman or the committee members.  I am sure members will appreciate that at this stage my capacity for detail is limited.  It is only a short time since I was asked to take up this position and I have not yet had a chance to attend a board meeting or to go into detail about the various issues affecting the company.</p></speech>

I note how he has referred to the controversy raging at the moment.  That is important.</p><p>  Before I hand over to members I would like to ask a couple of questions on that.  Mr. O&rsquo;Connor states that he strongly subscribes to the idea that meaningful public consultation with local residents, property owners and communities is an indispensable element of this.  Over the past few weeks the committee has met representatives from many of those communities.  They allege that real consultation has not happened, questions are unanswered and so on.  I would like to hear Mr. O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s views on those comments.</p><p>  Does Mr. O&rsquo;Connor hold a particular view of how EirGrid should proceed with the Grid25 project, particularly in respect of placing the cables underground?  Would he agree that in the view of many at this stage it is important that there be some independent cost-benefit evaluation for putting the cables underground?  In his previous role as chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la he was very aware of the need to preserve the scenery of this country and to increase tourist numbers.  Tourism is a very important aspect of this decision.  I am sure there will be many questions about other areas but I would appreciate if Mr. O&rsquo;Connor could answer those ones first.</p></speech>

The environment belongs to everybody and everybody should be entitled to express their view.  I read the Official Report of the committee&rsquo;s meetings with delegates from various places on this topic.  I was somewhat disappointed.  There was a range of views.  Some people felt there had been reasonable consultation, others not.  I would be disappointed to think that people felt that they did not get a hearing.  Eirgird has an extensive consultation procedure.  People should not jump to conclusions.  All of those points have been made and issues raised during the consultations, including the contributions made at this committee.</p><p>  Those contributions will all feed into the public consultation process.  It will then be up to EirGrid to consider each issue and we will have to deal with each one in a fully transparent and honest manner and respond to them.  I would not like to prejudice the response at this stage but Eirgird will have to deal with each issue raised.  People should not rush to judgment about the consultation process until they at least read the report on it and what emerges from that.  I ask people to wait and see what comes out in the reports of these various consultations and EirGrid&rsquo;s response to them.  They will then be in a better position to judge whether EirGrid has listened to them. </p><p>  The issue of putting the cables underground in the Grid25 project was put strongly in the consultations and is being dealt with as we go along in the various stages of the reports and consultations.  That is the way to deal with it.  There has been much detailed study of underground cables for the North-South interconnector.  I will not pass judgment on that because I am only coming into the job now.  A lot has already happened.  This issue has been put very forcibly and EirGrid will have to respond to it in whatever way is considered necessary to convince people that we are coming up with the best solution.</p></speech>

There is little doubt that he is a highly qualified professional.  He has a considerable track record in public service.  As he worked in the planning division of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, he was an obvious choice to be appointed to the independent role in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am not so sure, however, how he makes the jump from An Bord Plean&aacute;la to EirGrid, particularly at a time when EirGrid is involved under the strategic infrastructure legislation in its interaction with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Connor said that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government approached him in respect of appointment to the pyrite board.

There is nothing untoward in what the Minister said to me.  I can outline it for the Deputy.

How does he intend to remove himself?  He said in his presentation that he would not attend public hearings.

I left An Bord Plean&aacute;la two and a half years ago and I have no further involvement, as I said.</p></speech>

I am not questioning either Mr. O'Connor's integrity or the integrity of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am concerned about the unique knowledge Mr. O'Connor gained as chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the ability for that to be used in the context of the preparation of planning applications that will ultimately be submitted by EirGrid.  There is a perception among community groups that they are working against not just the planning department of EirGrid in an effort to get balance and fairness, but also against a professional who has gained a unique insight into how decisions are taken.  In my view, and in the view of most people, that puts EirGrid in a stronger and more dominant position than one might want it to have.  How can we overcome this together?  How can Mr. O'Connor assure us that he will absent himself, in all respects, from the preparation of all materials associated with the roll out of the grid, which is the most important issue on the platform at present?</p></speech>

That would not be right either.  I do not think there is a conflict.  I do not believe I have any particularly unique knowledge.

However, a final point must be made.  Mr. O'Connor said he has unique regard for the protection of our heritage and the environment.  The fact is that, as chairman of EirGrid, under company law Mr. O'Connor's fiduciary duty is to the company.  When it comes to the profit and loss of that entity, company law dictates in absolute terms Mr. O'Connor's requirement to protect the financial interests of the company.  While on a personal basis Mr. O'Connor might have a view that the erection of a series of pylons impacts too negatively on the environment and he might not like that on an altruistic level, his fiduciary duty under company law requires him to look at what is in the best financial interests of EirGrid.  I find it difficult that he used that as a ruse to satisfy us.  I return again to the first question.  It appears rather strange to me, many of my colleagues and many community groups that Mr. O'Connor's appointment is made at a time when EirGrid faces dealing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in a very protracted and detailed way.  Mr. O'Connor has not said anything today that will mollify the concerns and fears of community groups throughout the country, who see themselves fighting a battle against a large aggressor.</p></speech>

However, the legislation governing EirGrid requires it to balance three things - the safe and secure supply of electricity, a competitive price for electricity and the environment.  The three, including environmental protection, are mentioned in the statutory remit of EirGrid, so it is not quite as simple as the Deputy said.</p><p>  Again, I can only give an assurance.  I have too much respect for the process here.  I have spent a large part of my career dealing with the environment and trying to defend it.  That was often not very popular in certain quarters.  If anybody thinks I am going to EirGrid to do something that would damage my lifetime's work, I would have grave difficulty with that.  I am sorry that people would believe that is in any way an issue for me.  All I can do is give an assurance that my behaviour in this will be absolutely above board.  There will be no back door telephone calls.  There could not be anyway.  It is a statutory offence to try to influence An Bord Plean&aacute;la in any way.  I hope members of the committee will take advantage of the situation to explain that I do not have any conflicts in this and try to assure people throughout the country, who might have been led to believe that there are some conflicts, that there will not be any underhand arrangement or anything of that nature.  I would not take the job for a second if that was part of the agenda.</p></speech>

However, given the fact that he has unique insight into and knowledge of the operation of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, if Mr. O'Connor, in pursuing his duties, involves himself in any way in the planning process of EirGrid - not just the preparation of a planning application or appearing at a public hearing but in any way - I do not know how that perception can be overturned in people's minds.  I do not believe my party will be in a position to support his appointment as chairperson of EirGrid unless he can give a satisfactory answer and say he will dissociate himself in every respect from the planning process within EirGrid.</p></speech>

The planning application derives from the consideration of the project and decisions relating to the project.  That takes into account costs, environment and everything else.  EirGrid must make the best proposal it can, balancing all of these factors, and then send it forward.  Once the proposal is decided, I will have no further involvement in the planning application in terms of making it, drafting it, the oral hearing, making observations, responding to observations and so forth.  I will not be involved in that, as I tried to say in my presentation.  However, I cannot say, as chairperson of the company, that I will have nothing to do with making decisions about the main issues around the proposals and the policies of the company which impact on those.</p></speech>

In my view there is a mismatch with the skills set of Mr. O'Connor.  Undeniably, he is highly qualified and professional, and I am not casting any aspersion on him as an individual, but there is a mismatch between his suitability and the role in EirGrid.  For that reason, we will not be in a position, unfortunately, to support his appointment.  I do not say that lightly and it is not personal to Mr. O'Connor.  I consider him highly qualified and there is no question about his integrity, but I believe his skills and experience are a mismatch for the role he must now undertake.  However, I wish him well, whatever the outcome.</p></speech>

There was a great deal of criticism of delays and uncertainty about critical infrastructure projects getting done and it was seen to be putting the country at a disadvantage competitively and so forth.  There was a lot of debate for a few years about how this would be resolved.  The position for all major infrastructure projects was that an application was made locally and invariably it was appealed.  It ended with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and this involved a major lapse in time and many investors were unhappy about that.  The decision was to have a one stage procedure and there was a view at the time, which was prominent in some quarters, that a new body should be set up to give consent quickly for these projects but I engaged with the Minister and I was able to persuade him that it would be better to expand the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and to assign that function to the board, which would give reasonably quick decisions on these projects.  That has happened by and large.</p></speech>

That is an interesting link since its inception in 2006.  He stated: "I am happy that my actions in the Department and in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, reflected in the decisions of that body during my period in the chair, bears out my beliefs".  That relates to his special interest and deep appreciation of the environment and heritage.  As chairman of EirGrid, I am sure he will agree, as with all corporate governance requirements, he will have to display exceptional competencies, expertise and leadership and he has outlined that.</p><p>  He should also demonstrate competence with regard to good judgment.  He stated there is no conflict of interest.  Does he not recognise that there is wide public concern given his links to the formulation of the critical infrastructure legislation, his position of chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and now his position as chairman designate of EirGrid?  There is a lack of confidence among the public that there could be a fair and independent planning process given his links and involvement through the years.  Essentially, the public might say Mr. O'Connor is turning from gamekeeper to poacher.  It looks to the public like he was the protector of the environment and heritage but people might argue that he is becoming the poacher as chairman of EirGrid, which is submitting critical infrastructure applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

I would be disappointed if that idea took hold.  I am not turning from a gamekeeper to a poacher.  I see part of my role in EirGrid as making sure the company does these projects in a way that is environmentally sustainable and respects heritage and so forth and to make sure the company proceeds on that basis and gives due weighting to these important considerations.</p></speech>

I would like to elaborate on judgment because it is important.  As chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, he dealt with a case of interest to me and to the previous environment committee relating to the County Kildare landfill in Usk.  The High Court ruled in 2006 that it found the process within An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be "unfair and displayed objective bias".  Mr. O'Connor was chairman at the time.  Did that statement cause a problem for him?</p></speech>

It was considered by the High Court judgment that there was an element of prejudgement involved in that the board had made a decision before coming back to make a second decision on it.  It was objective bias, not pure bias.</p></speech>

As chairperson of a board, decisiveness is one of the qualities one must bring to the position.  One must bring matters to a conclusion at some stage but one must also make sure that all factors are weighed up and due consideration is given to all relevant issues.  It does not mean that one should rush to judgment or into decisions.  It means one has to listen to views and to take them all on board before proceeding to make a decision.  One is, therefore, balancing the need to take all issues into account and the need to move on to make decisions.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connor's position was to more or less ignore the High Court ruling but the case was back before the court in 2009 and it was overturned a second time.  It stated:<blockquote><br />In upholding the challenge by Usk and District Resident Association to the 2008 permission, Mr. Justice McMenamin was strongly critical of the board's failure to adhere to those recommendations, describing as unfathomable the reasoning for its decision.  It was remarkable that the board, a statutory body entrusted with decision-making of national importance, when taking upon itself to ignore the spirit if not the letter of a High Court order appeared not to have taken special care to ensure what it did was fair.</blockquote>I challenged Mr. O'Connor about this at an Oireachtas committee hearing and he stated it was a wrong assumption by the court at that time.  That is a serious charge for any individual to make about a High Court ruling.  This is important information that the committee needs to consider.</p><p>  Subsequently, the Courts Service took Mr. O'Connor up on his statement and said:<blockquote>It was suggested that the trial judge made a wrong assumption as to whether the board had received legal advice prior to making the decision found to be unlawful because it was objectively biased.  The remarks attributed to the chairman might be interpreted as meaning the judgement had been based on incorrect facts or inferences from the evidence.  This is not so.  In the case referred to, the judge concluded that a decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant planning permission for an engineered landfill would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that there had not been an impartial decision-making process.  The board's decision was irrational and in excess of its jurisdiction and should be quashed.</blockquote>Mr. O'Connor stated to a committee that a High Court ruling had made a wrong assumption and he is back before us in a leadership role related to critical infrastructure.  I question his judgment in the past and I question it now.  What are his comments on that?</p></speech>

The case went before the court again and it cost those citizens and the State a significant amount.  That smacks of poor judgment.</p> <p>Mr. O'Connor is going into a very important role.

When people like Mr. O'Connor get a great deal of flak, it is sometimes because the Government has not been doing what it should be doing.  Is he aware of any jurisdiction that has a land and landscape planning and management policy which guides the development of infrastructure like pylons, wind turbines, pipelines for bringing ashore offshore gas and hydraulic fracturing facilities, etc.?  Is he aware of any jurisdiction that uses landscape planning and management systems to make an input as infrastructural developments are taking place?</p></speech>

Our local development plans include various designations, etc,. which have to be taken into account.  In preparing to make a planning application for a project of this nature, EirGrid will certainly have to take account of various designations relating to landscapes, natural heritage areas and European directives, etc.  All of those things have to be taken into account when a proposal for a planning application is being prepared.  There is no landscape plan for the country.  Such a plan has been mentioned for a number of years, but it has not yet appeared.  I am not aware of any country that has a comprehensive landscape policy to the extent that it would answer all of these questions.</p></speech>

Many people feel that the most critical question to be considered during the public consultation process is whether to locate these cables underground or overground.  Rightly or wrongly, they feel that a decision in this regard was made in advance of the beginning of the consultation process.  I think they are right because it has been said in several statements that these pylons will go overground.  If that critical decision has been made in advance of the public consultation process, what is the point of that process?</p></speech>

If the issue is raised, it will have to be dealt with by the company before it makes its planning application.  I do not know whether that will happen, as I have not been in the company for very long, but I would like to think it will happen.  The manner in which the company will deal with the matter will depend on the manner in which it is raised and the issues behind it, etc.  This issue must be considered in the context of the process of responding to the consultations.</p></speech>

We need information on the technical feasibility, the levels of technical difficulty and the comparative costs.  Some serious economists are questioning the economic aspects of wind energy generation.  They have pointed out that a public subsidy will continue to be required here and elsewhere into the future.

I am aware that this country is committed, under EU directives, to ensure 40% of electricity is generated from renewable sources by 2020.  The achievement of that target by this country is mandatory.  The strengthening of the grid system will be required if it is to be achieved.</p></speech>

I am aware of a number of projects that offered fairly exciting prospects for renewable energy, but were killed by the cost of connecting to the national grid.  Those costs meant it was out of the question for the projects to be pursued.  Those who try to develop small generation projects feel they are not taken seriously.  It seems that the State does not fully appreciate the potential benefit of small-scale generation to the wider national picture.</p></speech>

The ESB distribution system also comes into play here.  It is rather complicated.  I have heard that EirGrid is rather anxious to accommodate smaller generation, etc.  I think that will be a bigger factor in the future.  It is already a bigger factor in some other countries.  EirGrid is trying to develop the technology as best it can.  Apparently, technology in this area is advancing quite rapidly.  EirGrid is doing everything it can to keep abreast of and develop this technology.  It has various relationships with technology people to that end.  I think I would be on the same wavelength as the Deputy when it comes to doing whatever we can to improve the grid and the distribution system to ensure small generation can be accommodated.</p></speech>

People get really annoyed when self-evident truths are dismissed by spokespersons for energy companies.  A spokesperson said on television there is no evidence that a pylon beside a house reduces the market value of the house, but that is evidently nonsense.  I would like Mr. O'Connor to develop the point he made about recognising some means of dealing with property devaluations.  If it is decided to pursue the overground option, it is inevitable that there will be pylons beside people's houses.</p></speech>

As public representatives we find it very difficult to deal with that argument.</p><p>  There is no confidence whatsoever in the public consultation process carried out by EirGrid.  I refer to some of the comments from people whom I met and e-mailed.  When they want to speak about the underground issue, they are being told, "You wouldn't really understand it".  I do not regard this as an answer but this has been reported to me by people who are engineers and who are equally qualified in their field.</p><p>  Is Mr. O'Connor in a position to give us a commitment that EirGrid will seriously consider an independent study of the cost-benefit analysis of overground versus underground?  The question of whether the consultation process was good, bad or indifferent has completely moved on.  The question now is overground versus underground.</p><p>  We are hearing that EirGrid must upgrade the system and that this will mean jobs in major towns along the route.  Now I hear that if we were to re-establish the sugar industry in Carlow, we will be unable to have a supply from this 400 kv line to supply a factory there.  Why would the local people buy into the argument about job creation if we cannot get a connection?  I do not understand that.  </p><p>  I reiterate the point made by Deputy Colreavy.  Last weekend a leading economist questioned how this policy can make economic sense.  We need to be given a position on that.</p></speech>

If EirGrid personnel responded to questions from people by saying, "You wouldn't understand that", I would have great difficulty with such a response and I do not regard it as an appropriate response to a serious observation or consultation.  If I take up the position I will certainly try to ensure that it is not repeated and that we have a more understanding and sympathetic approach to people who go to the trouble of making submissions and communicating in the consultation process.</p><p>  I certainly would not rule out having an independent study of undergrounding.  This issue has been raised quite forcibly in the context of the consultation period and EirGrid must respond to that.  It is quite possible that one of the responses will be something along the lines Deputy Phelan mentioned.</p></speech>

I welcome our guest and I thank him for his efforts to answer the questions from members.  However, his answers to some of the questions leave more questions unanswered.  I note he has a very interesting career roadmap charted through his career in various Departments and in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in particular.  To quote himself, he says he was able to persuade the Government that it would be better to assign the functions of setting up a new strategic infrastructural consent body.  This was then tucked in nicely under the wing of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and he was happy to be there for 11 or 12 years.  I do not question his professional qualifications but I question his role in advising at a very senior level in the Department.  He has been honest and bold enough to say here that he was able to persuade the Government.  He is obviously a very influential person in that he was able to persuade the then Government to assign this function.  Us lesser mortals have to apply to the county council and if we fail there, we must apply to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>  I have been aghast on several occasions to see a report from an official of An Bord Plean&aacute;la who examined a file and inspected a building but whose report was overturned by An Bord Plean&aacute;la - turned upside down.  Yet, Mr. O'Connor says he has the utmost confidence in the board but I do not have the utmost confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It pays planners to examine objectively planning proposals and the situation on the ground and then their reports are rubbished much of the time because the board decides to act in a certain way.  Mr. O'Connor was in charge of the board so I level those charges at his good self in his previous role up to 2011.</p><p>  Looking at the new situation, how can the people have faith in this process when we do not have that strategic infrastructure board separate from An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  It is now under An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Mr. O'Connor knows every nook and cranny in An Bord Plean&aacute;la - God bless him for that - and what better person for EirGrid to have.  He states he has distanced himself from the appointment process.  The taxpayer will be paying the money for whatever role Mr. O'Connor has.  He said that An Bord Plean&aacute;la took into account the local development plans and EU plans on strategic infrastructure.  When I was a member of the local authority in south Tipperary, we designated parts of south Tipperary as being unsuitable for wind energy.  Certain wind energy firms appealed the decision to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and drove a coach and four through the decision - under the stewardship of Mr. O'Connor.  The planning permission was granted, despite our county development plan.  It allowed for wind developments in Dualla, in view of the Rock of Cashel and a sub-station, against the express wishes of the south Tipperary county development plan and many local residents.  Therefore, I have no faith in his replies to previous questions.</p> <p> Mr. O'Connor faces a large problem when taking up this job, as he does not know what the pay is and he has not asked about it.  I am glad that he can be in such a comfortable position at his stage in life.  I am not being ageist, but I would have preferred a younger man with an independent perspective of this sensitive issue.  Mr. O'Connor has had a good career in the public service and it is time that he was thinking about the green grass rather than going on to new fields.</p><p> What is Mr. O'Connor's opinion of EirGrid's spokesperson perpetuating a lie on RTE's &quot;Prime Time&quot;?  Mr. Fintan Slye stated that EirGrid had advertised in the <i>Dungarvan Leader</i>, which it clearly had not.  He admitted later in the studio that it had not.  That lie was put out over the airwaves to a large number of people.  There is no faith in EirGrid's sham, token consultation.  This day last week was the closing date, but it was extended for five weeks to 7 January.  When I welcomed that extension, the Taoiseach told me in the D&aacute;il Chamber that the Minister had instructed EirGrid.  The previous week, the Minister stated that he had nothing to do with EirGrid and could not interfere in any form.  It suits them when they want to lie on one side of the bed or the other.</p><p> There is no faith in the process because of untruths and spin.  Deputy Ann Phelan mentioned connectivity in our town of Clonmel as regards strategic infrastructure.  We were told that our line would not benefit whatsoever and could not be used, but the project will go straight across our Golden Vale into Wexford and John Bull's country to meet commitments under the Kyoto Agreement on fossil fuel emissions, etc.  It is a naked rape of our countryside for big business.  We have had enough of that.  Mr. O'Connor saw enough of it.  He was in enough bodies to have shouted &quot;Stop&quot;.  I do not know whether he did over the years at the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, and other places.</p><p> We have had enough of career civil servants and others plundering our country.  Mr. O'Connor is not fit for the job.  I am opposing his nomination.  It is not personal, but this is a poacher becoming a game keeper.  His career has been a merry-go-round as far as I am concerned.  He is from the south of the country like myself, but it is time that he retired back there and stood with the people instead of milking the system.</p></speech>

There is no point in saying that he was not aware of what happened during the consultation.  He was asked to do this responsible job.  He did not ask for it and he did not ask about remuneration.

Does he recall the number of instances in which inspectors recommended a particular action to the board in respect of a planning application and the number of times that he, as chairperson of the board, asked that the decision be overturned?</p></speech>

The board makes a collective decision to overturn something.  During my period, an inspector's report was overturned in approximately 12% of cases, sometimes to grant permission where a refusal had been recommended or <i>vice versa</i>.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.1614" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120300009#H03400"><p>This matter probably has a bearing on the consultation undertaken by the company to which Mr. O'Connor may be assigned as chairperson.  If an inspector examines a planning application on the ground, reviews the local authority's file, considers the local community's input and makes an assessment and recommendation to the board, which is not on the ground and does not put the same amount of time into the application as the inspector, surely be to God it is a slap in the face to the inspector for the board to overrule his or her decision in 12% of cases.</p></speech>

That is the law.  The decision is made by the board.</p> <p>I do not know whether we should be discussing this sort of detail about An Bord Plean&aacute;la but I will try to answer the question anyway.  The law gives the board power to make the decision and the inspector has an input into that decision.  If legislation was changed to give power to inspectors to make these decisions that may be what the Deputy is calling for, but there is a board to make decisions.</p></speech>

First, a key priority of EirGrid is to operate a safe, reliable and economic electric system.  Health and safety issues have arisen in recent months and more so in recent weeks.  As Eirgrid's chairman designate, will Mr. O'Connor investigate these matters further since they have upset many people?  Such issues need to be addressed further.  EirGrid says it has investigated these matters, but I do not think it has.</p><p>  EirGrid has done a lot of work on pyrite.  I have been dealing with this matter and I am glad to hear that it will not interfere with EirGrid's work.  Should delays occur with the pyrite legislation, are any provisions being made to ensure that there is no overlap?</p><p>  EirGrid has consistently denied that upgrading the system is connected to wind energy.  What is Mr. O'Connor's opinion on that?</p><p>  The need for public consultation has been mentioned by many people.  As regards the North-South interconnector, we have already dealt with such matters involving Cavan, Monaghan and Meath.  We have clearly seen that it does not work because after five years of public consultation, including oral hearings, nothing had changed.  The North-South interconnector is now at the final stage so what is Mr. O'Connor's input and how can he help in that regard?  We do not need a review to see that it does not work, so we need to have action now.</p></speech>

It is a strongly debated issue and, as far as I understand it, the area has been well researched.  There are clear EU and other international guidelines to which EirGrid is adhering by some margin.  The matter has been raised and will be raised again in the planning application for the North-South interconnector.  It will have to be answered to the satisfaction of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the planning application.  It is a matter of how EirGrid can give the necessary assurance to people that there are no health implications.  EirGrid is a public company and could not possibly put itself in a position where it was affecting public health if there was any risk of that nature.  This will certainly have to be dealt with to ease people's fears.</p></speech>

Is this something that could possibly be looked at by EirGrid?  In his capacity as chairman designate, could Mr. O'Connor raise this and bring it to EirGrid's attention?</p></speech>

It is in a state of flux.  EirGrid would certainly like to see that matter resolved so that accountability and responsibility clearly rests with somebody who can give definitive rulings on the health issue and non-ionising radiation.</p><p>  Deputy McEntee mentioned pyrite and, as she knows, I have been putting quite a lot of effort into this question this year.  Regretfully, it has been a bit slower in coming to fruition than I would have liked.  The legislation is being actively worked on at the moment, however.  I understand that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is pretty close to bringing it forward.  That will give us a framework to start accepting applications from people whose homes have been affected by pyrite with a view to getting remedial work done next year.</p></speech>

Deputy McEntee asked about wind energy.  Some of the Grid 25 projects are closely related to wind energy and there is a mandatory requirement to meet the 40% target by 2020.  To be clear, the wind energy export project has nothing to do with the Grid 25 proposals which are for the all-island situation.</p></speech>

We are the only two Cork men in the room that I know of.  It is unusual that there are not more of us.  Can Mr. O'Connor expand on his previous experience in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, particularly in planning?  Effective and meaningful consultation is a significant part of planning, including local authority or regional development plans and the spatial strategy.  In previous generations, it may not have been such a key issue.  I note from Mr. O'Connor's statement that during his tenure in the Department's planning section he put forward many innovative measures on policy and consultation.  Can he expand on how that might be improved, given what he has heard about the EirGrid situation and what seem to be less than meaningful consultations with stakeholders and the communities involved?</p><p>  When a community or individual consults with the process it is not just a question of listening and noting, but there should also be a written response.  In his opening statement, Mr. O'Connor also said he played a part in introducing innovative policies to counteract social segregation in housing, reform building society legislation, the modernisation and consolidation of planning, spatial strategy and water legislation.  Would that also include technological innovations?  Technology in 2013 might have changed by the time a project comes to fruition in 2016 or 2017.  Will Mr. O'Connor ensure that such innovation will enable EirGrid to use the most up-to-date technological advances?  We have listened to some of the resistance to underground cables, for example.</p><p>  Mr. O'Connor said he was asked to become the chairperson of the EirGrid board.  He may now feel that he has accepted a hospital pass from the Department on this one.  I have a concern which I hope Mr. O'Connor can allay.  The current secretary general of the Department previously held the position that Mr. O'Connor also held in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government - that is, assistant secretary for water services.  Can Mr. O'Connor deal with my concern about his tenure versus that individual's tenure in the Department?  Did Mr. O'Connor know him or work with him professionally within the Department?  What was the relationship and did he report to Mr. O'Connor's section?  I would like to eliminate that concern of mine.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. O'Connor to the meeting.  I hope he is aware that my opposition to his appointment is not any personal matter.  I have no doubts about his personal and professional integrity and his credentials.  I am totally uncomfortable, however, because I believe that there is a conflict of interests.  I do not mean a personal one whereby he would take personal advantage for personal gain.  That is where we are losing sight of the point.  The dictionary definition that he read out at the start is probably in keeping with the Minister&rsquo;s definition of no conflict of interest.  The Minister categorised my concerns in that regard as woolly-headed nonsense.  I am not too woolly-headed, as Mr. O&rsquo;Connor can see, and I will try not to be too nonsensical.</p><p>  As Mr. O&rsquo;Connor is aware from his work in the planning sector, we have to take into account the cumulative effect of what is proposed in planning terms.  He comes on board as someone who knows the workings and machinations of Eirgrid inside out and has great expertise and knowledge gained over a long period.  He is not the only person in play in this fundamental and strategic planning process that now exercises virtually the entire country.  There are also former senior executives at the highest level.  Out of respect for the Chairman of the committee I will not name people who are not here to defend themselves but I could easily do so because it is a statement of fact and I would gladly do so outside, but out of respect for due process I will not.  Senior executives who have recently retired from Eirgrid have moved onto the boards of private wind farm development companies.  The Chairman of another State agency, Sustainable Energy Ireland, which advises Government on energy policy is on the board of another private wind farm development company.</p><p>  The public is losing confidence in a process where it feels that the deck is already stacked against it with what it sees as the convergence of an old boys&rsquo; network, an inner circle and circle of friends which individually may not amount to a personal conflict of interest but whose cumulative effect is that there are people who have worked hand-in-hand and hand-in-glove with each other over a long period.  I recently attended a Bord Plean&aacute;la Eirgrid hearing in Portlaoise which went on for six days where the ordinary residents of Ratheniska and Timahoe - housewives, farmers and rural residents - were ranged against 21 members of a legal team and technical experts all with the resources of the State at their backs.  Now the former Chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la is joining that team against housewives and farmers who already have good grounds to doubt the integrity of the consultation process.</p><p>  I began engaging with Eirgrid approximately three years ago.  I was defending the development of the local infrastructure and the fact that we had to invest in order to create jobs and sustain economic growth but I cannot believe the manner in which I was deceived.  The consultation process amounts to a grand deception without any integrity.  I was personally misled on several significant points to the extent that the goodwill and reputation that the ESB had built up with the rural communities over decades is now squandered.  I would not believe the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer from an Eirgrid senior management official.  That is not hearsay.  I am speaking from my own direct personal experience.  I was misled in a grand way.  I asked specific questions about why we needed to build what Eirgrid called the Ratheniska sub-station at Culnabacky, which is on the site where the National Ploughing Championships took place this year.  It told me that it was to strengthen the grid to the south east and that this was required for jobs.  It tried to suggest that Glanbia would run out of power if it was not done but it did not tell me that Glanbia is not even on the grid.  Glanbia supplies electricity to the grid and does not take any power from it.  It also suggested that Waterford, Kilkenny and Carlow would not experience economic growth and job investment if the line from Laois to Kilkenny, the so-called Laois-Kilkenny reinforcement line, is not built.  It did not tell me about the new line that it is bringing up through the middle of Carlow-Kilkenny.  It drip feeds piecemeal information which wrong-foots those concerned about what is happening.</p><p>  No one has explained adequately to me why the Ratheniska super-hub has the capacity for 17 lines while the station into which it runs in Ballyragget has the capacity for only one.  Eirgrid insists that this has nothing to do with wind energy or the development of wind farms in the midlands.  There is a conflict of interest, not necessarily in respect of Mr. O&rsquo;Connor but with all these senior executives swapping chairs and positions on related bodies that ultimately have the decision-making capacity to drive this forward, and with access to the Minister and the Department to do so.</p></speech>

The period from 2000 to 2011 saw some of the worst planning excesses that ever blighted our towns and cities.  If the Financial Regulator was asleep at the wheel so too was An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the planning regulator.  I cannot believe that we built a motorway the length of the country, all the way from Dublin to Cork and did not even put a toilet or a filling station on it, and that is regarded as exemplary practice and planning.  Now we have to go back and undo that harm.</p><p>  Does Mr. O&rsquo;Connor have an open mind?  I do not know why Eirgrid wants to double the capacity of the grid.  What are the grounds for that?  Does it expect an economic boom that no-one else knows about?  We need to upgrade and strengthen the grid but not to double its capacity for a country of 4 million.  This is not Germany.  I believe this is a Trojan horse for private wind farm developers.</p><p>  I was glad that Mr. O'Connor said that he would not like to live beside a pylon or I presume a turbine.  Will he commit, if he takes up the post, despite the reservations expressed by many sitting on this committee, to subjecting Eirgrid to an objective and independent review, feasibility study, audit and cost-benefit analysis, taking into account that he accepts, which Eirgrid has not done to date, that were he in proximity to any of these monstrosities it would devalue his home?  That must be taken into account and not just brushed aside.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. O&rsquo;Connor.  I have read his statement since coming in here.  Many of my colleagues have spoken about consultation or lack of consultation and I endorse the view that Eirgrid&rsquo;s consultation process is less than adequate.  All communities, no matter in what part of the country, whether Meath, Monaghan, Cork, Wexford or Carlow, cannot be wrong in their assessment of the consultation process.  Information was not forthcoming and to date is not forthcoming.</p><p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Connor has been chosen for this job no doubt because of his previous experience in the public service and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am sure he has encountered many environmental issues in his career, in scenic areas such as my area of the Ravenshill Valley where the M1 went north of Dundalk to Belfast and divided not only communities but families.</p> <p> Mr. O'Connor mentioned pyrite issues and the part he has played.  I have no doubt he is aware of many communities that are concerned in regard to the proposals for the infrastructure.  I have to admit I believe the infrastructure is required for future generations, for jobs and for industry.  If I could be personal and ask Mr. O'Connor, from his experience in An Bord Plean&aacute;la - perhaps he was asked this question but I would like to ask it again - does he have any preference at this stage for overhead versus underground?  I am not challenging him on technological grounds; I am talking about the aesthetics and community concerns.  Perhaps it is not a fair question for Mr. O'Connor, as chair, at this stage but can he give this committee any idea what EirGrid's preference is in regard to overhead versus underground in any part of the infrastructure proposals?</p></speech>

In a way, he answered the question himself and I agree with his answer.  Consultation must be meaningful.  It involves listening to people, showing that one is listening to people, responding to people and dealing with the points they raise.  That is what I understand consultation to be and what I think it should be.  I am disappointed to hear comments here that this does not seem to be the perception.  If I take up this position, it is something I will certainly be following up on.  There is no doubt there are lessons to be learned.  Obviously, there is fair consensus on this issue here today, and some of it certainly cannot be ignored.</p><p>  The Deputy raised the issue of technology.  As far as I can gather, this is very much on the agenda of EirGrid.  It is fair to say it is very technologically advanced and it is fully up to speed with cutting-edge technology and so forth, and how technology can impact on the projects it develops.  Part of its commitment is that, at each stage of these projects, there will be a review on the basis of the current up-to-date information.  That information could relate to technology, to need or to other issues that are evolving.  As far as I am concerned, the projects are there and were put into Grid25, but at each stage, as we go along, they have to be reviewed and decisions have to be continued on the basis of the most up-to-date information, including in regard to technology.</p><p>  The Deputy raised issues in regard to relationships I might have with a senior official in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Did I pick him up right on that?</p></speech>

In answer to the question, that is all I can say about it.</p><p>  I will move on to Senator Whelan's points.  I am disappointed Senator Whelan feels that the consultation was not what it should be, and he had very strong criticisms of it.  This is something I will certainly take away with me and which I will consider.  I would say to the Senator that, at the end of the day, it is An Bord Plean&aacute;la that decides these matters.  Whether people go on boards or off boards, or anything like that, there are certain rules in regard to all of these things, including what people do after they finish in the public service and so forth.  I have not got any private sector boards or anything like that.</p><p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is the ultimate deciding authority.  Its process is open and transparent, and fully participative.  No matter what the EirGrid consultation may or may not do, everybody has a right to submit an observation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la when the application goes in to it.  There are procedures for doing that.  Furthermore, they have an opportunity to go to the hearing and make their case.  Again, we have to bear in mind at all times that there is an independent, quasi-judicial process to deal with these issues which has existed for many years.  Overall, while people criticise its decisions from time to time, I believe it has stood the test of time.  Going back to my own time there, when people from other jurisdictions come here and look at An Bord Plean&aacute;la, they see it as a kind of model for dealing with some of these issues.</p><p>  The Senator said he was misled but that is all to do with perceptions around the consultation process and the information that was given and so forth.</p></speech>

If anyone has any qualms or feels An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not doing the job in the way it is meant to do it, there are judicial review proceedings available to them.  There are safeguards in the system.  This is the system that has been set up by these Houses and, unless it is changed, it is the system we have to rely on.  We have to have faith that it will deliver decent decisions for the benefit of the public.</p><p>  The Senator mentioned the issue of An Bord Plean&aacute;la being asleep at the wheel in terms of the planning that happened in recent years.  First, only about 7% of local planning decisions are appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but there are the criticisms the Senator mentions, and planning certainly has to look at itself and see how it performed during the boom.  I have no problem with that.  However, the Senator might recall that, throughout that period, as chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I raised in the annual report some of these issues that subsequently proved to be very problematic.  I raised them because I could see what was happening at local level from what was coming before the board.  I raised issues such as the way small towns and villages were being swamped with huge estates, the standard of apartments and so forth.  I raised all of those issues going back over the years of my time there.</p><p>  I have already dealt with the question of the valuation of property.  It is something raised repeatedly in the consultations and it is something that will have to be addressed by EirGrid when it is making its application.</p><p>  Senator Brennan has the same problem with regard to consultation.  I take his points about the concerns of communities and the need to respect communities.  I agree with him this is something we have to bear in mind.</p></speech>

He is obviously a career civil servant with vast experience in many areas.  With the greatest respect and without being ageist, he is coming to the twilight of his career now.  Does he think it is appropriate that somebody who has received a golden handshake of &euro;346,617 and a gold-plated pension of &euro;121,539 should consider themselves up to the job at this stage?  Is it appropriate that he take up this job, considering that he has no experience in this area and he was asked to do the job?  Does he think he should have thought more about it before this matter arose?  There was always going to be potential for a perceived conflict of interest in the matter.  In view of the 11 years he served with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, there was going to be a perceived conflict of interest because this issue was bound to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning permission.  Mr. O'Connor said that the Minister asked him to come on board as chairman because of his experience in planning.  I am almost certain those are the words he used.  Mr. O'Connor can correct me if I am wrong.</p></speech>

To borrow a phrase used at the weekend, we went from boom to Bert.  What legacy issues does Mr. O'Connor see and what regrets does he have in that regard?</p><p>  I also wish to raise the concern about lack of information.  When there is a lack of information, a vacuum is created.  That has happened on this matter.  There is no meaningful consultation.  The reason for that is that the vast majority of people only became aware of this matter in the last number of weeks, even though EirGrid would argue that it opened offices 18 months ago and held a number of meetings.  However, until lines appeared on a map, nobody was aware of the issue.  That is where we have a problem at present.</p><p>  I have a final point and Mr. O'Connor can correct me if I am wrong.  During his tenure in An Bord Plean&aacute;la there was one good thing from the Celtic tiger economy, the motorway structure.  This might not have been in his remit but there is a great deal of talk at present to the effect that consideration should have been given to putting the lines under the motorway or beside it at the time.  It would have been appropriate.  Was there any formal thinking at the time about taking that option?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.1657" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120300013#M01000"><p>I thank Mr. O'Connor for appearing before the committee.  To refer to a point made earlier when wind energy was being discussed, it was said that while Grid25 was closely connected to wind energy, there was no connection to the export of wind energy.  Page 7 of "Grid25: A Strategy for the Development of Ireland's Electricity Grid for a Sustainable and Competitive Future" refers to increasing Ireland's connectivity to the European grid, allowing both bulk exports of electricity and imports of electricity when appropriate.  Grid25 is involved in the export of energy.  It is important to clarify that point for the record.</p><p>  As a native of south Kildare, I wish to raise the issue of the Greenstar Recycling Holdings Ltd. application for a landfill at Usk in the middle of the last decade.  Greenstar Recycling Holdings Ltd. received planning permission for a landfill development at Usk from An Bord Plean&aacute;la in July 2006, after being refused permission by Kildare County Council.  The board's inspector had recommended against granting permission at that time.  I live very close to the area and I know the local residents very well.  I know what they went through in this ten year battle.  It was very much a David and Goliath battle.  It was a small, tight-knit community of approximately 150 households against the might of the State.  When they opposed this decision in the courts, the board admitted that it had not maintained satisfactory records leading to the decision and that it had not properly monitored the public planning file.  Contrary to law, the file was not available for inspection at various times.</p><p>  Mr. Justice Kelly quashed the decision in a High Court judgment in March 2007 and he remitted the case back to the board for further consideration.  He recommended in that judgment that it would be prudent that the consideration of the case would be undertaken by members of the board who had not been involved in the granting of permission.  The recommendation was made to avoid any possible suggestion of bias or objective bias.  On 30 July 2008, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, under Mr. O'Connor's chairmanship, again granted Greenstar Recycling Holdings Ltd. planning permission for a 200,000 tonne waste facility at Usk.  The board had again disagreed with its inspector's decision.  In light of Mr. O'Connor's comments earlier that only 12% of permissions from the board went against inspectors' recommendations, the residents of Usk must feel very hard done by that in these two cases it went against the inspector's decision and against the decision of the local authority to refuse planning permission for this.</p><p>  In spite of Mr. Justice Kelly's recommendations of 2007, four members of the board who were involved in the 2006 decision were also involved in the 2008 decision.  Mr. O'Connor wrote a memorandum on 17 June 2008 in respect of this in which he said that the project in question is a major and significant infrastructural development which would, in accordance with established practice within the board, be decided at a board meeting involving the chairperson and deputy chairperson, and that it was agreed that the most appropriate course would be to convene a meeting of all available board members, that is, those who participated previously and those who did not, to decide the appeal.  This was emphasised in the memorandum.  It was a complete contradiction of what Mr. Justice Kelly had recommended.  Commenting on this, the judge said that the logic of the board's reasoning here was unfathomable.  The reason the judge handed this case back to the board, and there was an argument for him not doing so in the first place, was to avoid a situation of objective bias, but in 2008 the judge quashed the board's second decision on the grounds of objective bias on the part of the four board members.  It could not have been made clearer.  The board was given a second shot at it but, under Mr. O'Connor's chairmanship, it decided to ignore that judgment.</p><p>  I do not know if Mr. O'Connor knows how much that decision and the case in general cost the State, but I know from living close to Usk that it cost the residents.  I remind the committee that this is a small, close-knit community of approximately 150 households.  The ten year battle cost the residents approximately &euro;400,000, so it probably cost the State significantly more.  I guess it would have been approximately &euro;1 million.</p><p>  The reason I raise this is that we are here to talk about Mr. O'Connor's curriculum vitae, where he was in the past and his potential new role if he is appointed chairman of EirGrid.  The local group in Usk made a number of attempts, both in between appeals and outside the court setting, to meet and engage with Mr. O'Connor to discuss this with him and try to explain the group's viewpoint.  This was not a case of "not in my back yard".  The site was wholly inappropriate, for various reasons, for a very large commercial landfill.</p> <p>For whatever reason, the board seemed intent on steam-rolling through a decision to grant Greenstar this planning permission.</p></speech>

When people in important senior positions make grave and serious mistakes, which cost the taxpayer an awful lot of money, we are not great at removing them from their jobs and seeking accountability.  Invariably, what happens is people move on from their roles and sometimes very significant golden handshakes and pensions arise.  In the past, some people moved on to new positions and new roles, which was not right.  </p><p>  What was demonstrated in the case of Usk was a total lack of community engagement and an attempt by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, under Mr. O'Connor's chairmanship, to steam-roll a decision through.  That does not fill me with any confidence.  If Mr. O'Connor is to be chairman of EirGrid, he can multiply the Usk case by 1,000 if he is to take all the small close-knit communities which are genuinely concerned about the potential of pylons and high powered voltage lines going through their communities.  I do not have any confidence that under Mr. O'Connor's chairmanship of EirGrid, the consultation process - we have heard plenty of concerns here about it - will be any way improved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-12-03a.1661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013120300014#N00400"><p>Would Mr. O'Connor not think that before a decision is made on a route, EirGrid would decide whether to put it overground or underground given that if it is going to put it overground, it might be looking for a different type of ground than if it was going underground?  When people ask how much it would cost to put it overground on a chosen route, the answer would be different if EirGrid had made that decision before deciding the route.  Obviously, if it is going to put it underground, it does not want to put it through limestone, which it might have to cut through, etc., and it might like to put it on ground that was easy to cut through.</p><p>  I do not for one second believe there is any seriousness when it comes to consultation processes in this country.  It is the standard decide, act and defend and EirGrid is in defend mode.  On deciding whether to go overground or underground, does EirGrid not need to make that decision first?</p><p>  Mr. O'Connor was asked whether people should be compensated if there are impacts.  They should be compensated if there are impacts.  Mr. O'Connor has already established that there are impacts because when asked if he would like to live beside a pylon, he said quite clearly that he would not.  There are impacts because if I wanted to sell my house to Mr. O'Connor in the morning and there was a pylon beside it, he would not want to buy it, so already there is an impact.  This is a public forum so everyone listening to him knows he believes there are obviously some sort of impacts.</p><p>  What impacts does Mr. O'Connor think there are?  Why would he not like to live beside a pylon?  Will he explain in detail exactly why he would not like to live beside a pylon?  Given that it will possibly be his job to convince us about something we do not want to be convinced about, I would like to know Mr. O'Connor's reasons for not wanting to live beside one of these pylons.  </p><p>  People in Ireland are sick of consultation that involves firing the arrow first and then drawing the target around it.  We are sick of it and are not going to put up with it anymore.  The sad thing is that there is now a big political circus around this.  Apparently, an MEP, Mr. Jim Higgins, will solve it in Europe and Deputies will solve it here when, in fact, all it takes is a Government decision telling EirGrid to do what it should do, listen to the people and look for a route which is suitable and put this underground.  In the meantime, can Mr. O'Connor tell me why he would not live beside a pylon because people will be very interested to hear the reason?</p></speech>

I would like to ask Mr. O'Connor a couple of questions.  I was a bit aghast with a response he gave to a question from, I think, Deputy McGrath about remuneration and maybe he could clarify it.  If, in my part of the world, a man or a woman was asked to train a junior B football team, he or she would know about the remuneration available in terms of expenses.  It beggars belief to suggest that three weeks after being offered this position, Mr. O'Connor is unaware of what potential remuneration or otherwise might be available.</p><p>  I would like to ask Mr. O'Connor about his time in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  How does he view it?  He said 7% of planning applications came before the board.  Currently, there are at least two different Government-supported programmes for the destruction of houses in different parts of the country which were constructed during that 11 year period, at least some of which were granted permission by the board.  Surely it is an indictment of the planning process.  There were all the other aspects of what happened in that 11 year period in terms of banking and personal responsibility, but An Bord Plean&aacute;la must also have a role in some of the shocking planning decisions made throughout the country.  </p><p>  The notion that what is proposed in Grid25 is a more than doubling in capacity of our national grid beggars belief.  No explanation at all has been given as to why this is justified.  The days of a State agency of any sort telling the public this is the way it is going to be and to suck it up will not wash anymore.  </p><p>  I fully agree with what Senator Whelan suggested earlier in terms of the need for a full cost-benefit analysis.  I respectfully suggest it should not happen at the end of the consultation period.  All of the options are still being considered for routes, in particular the Grid Link project in my neck of the woods in the south and east of the country.  It is one of the largest infrastructural developments in the history of the State.  Deputy Deering raised the question of the motorway development and the possibility of siting it beside that.  The cost-benefit analysis should be carried out before the final route is chosen.  </p><p>  I have nothing against Mr. O'Connor who seems like a perfectly pleasant man.  I have never met him before and do not know him from Adam but in light of the fact that not a single member of this committee or any other guest has had anything positive to say about him taking up the position of chairperson, does he not think he should reconsider taking it?</p></speech>

It certainly did not come into my mind immediately when I was asked.  It is not true to say the Minister asked me because of my experience in planning.  I think I tried to explain that earlier.  In fact, it was way down the list in terms of the discussion I had with the Minister.  I think his main point was that I had a lot of experience in terms of serving on State boards, in managing State bodies and so forth and that this was a very important company which needed direction, leadership, experience and so forth that he felt I could offer.  Planning was certainly not a primary issue.</p> <p>Planning was certainly not a primary issue in the discussions on the role with the Minister, but obviously planning was mentioned in terms of Grid25, but it was not the reason he gave for asking me to take the job.  Some Deputies mentioned the legacy issues in planning.  As I said earlier, mistakes were made and bad planning decisions were made, but they were certainly not all made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Towards the end of my term, I undertook a public review of the ABP decisions, which were only a minority of all planning decisions, and accepted responsibility on the part of An Bord Plean&aacute;la for some of the decisions that were made.  Most of the planning decisions that we are discussing were made by the local authorities and were never appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p> Members made the point about the lack of information in the consultation process.  I have heard what has been said and it is a repetition of what others have said.  I will take those points on board.</p><p> The question of whether solid ducting should have been laid along the motorway during the construction period was raised.  In an ideal world, all the issues could be brought together.  The question has been raised as to whether the N25 and M9 motorways re suitable as routes for the grid.  That has been raised in the consultation process and will have to be looked at and answered as well.</p><p> In response to Deputy Heydon, I reiterate that Grid25 energy is not being generated for export.  I was referring to the projects that are around for the export of wind energy to Britain.  I realise that in the longer term, there are prospects of connections to France and so on and that the south east would be the pivotal point at which it would have to come in.  There has been some misunderstanding.  I did not say that it had nothing to do with export, but long-term it may be tied up with the connection to France, but it has nothing to do with the current controversial proposals on the power generated by major wind farms in the midlands being exported to Britain.  That is a separate project altogether.</p><p> I think the issue of Greenstar has been dealt with.  The decisions were made in good faith on the basis of the need for waste facilities at the time.  I have no figurers about cost as I did not bring that information.</p></speech>

There was an oral hearing into it and the people would have had free rein at the hearing to make their case and engage with the appeals process.  I cannot see how the Deputy can assert there was a lack of engagement by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An oral hearing is the way to give people access to make their case.</p><p>  I have heard the point made on the consultation process, and my response would be the same.  This must be examined.</p><p>  Deputy Flanagan asked me for the reasons I would not like to live beside a pylon.  I want to qualify that further.  It depends on what one means by the word "beside".
