    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017061400002#B00100"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. S&eacute;amus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness at the committee.</p><p>Because of the votes in the D&aacute;il today, the meeting will run as follows.  The D&aacute;il is meeting at noon and we will suspend the sitting at approximately 11.50 a.m. to enable members to attend the chamber for the nomination of the Taoiseach.  Following the voting, the sitting of the D&aacute;il will be suspended for the afternoon and the committee meeting will resume as close to 3 p.m. as possible.  If the voting is completed in the D&aacute;il much earlier than expected, the meeting will resume half an hour afterwards, but we expect it to be completed by 2.30 p.m. or 3 p.m.I understand there will be a suspension of the D&aacute;il sitting of at least three hours in the afternoon.  That is the approximate timescale.  The D&aacute;il will reassemble to discuss the election of a Government by which time we will have concluded.  The committee meeting will certainly not resume after that because that debate will take a few hours to complete.  In other words, we will have a morning session until about 11.50 a.m. and an afternoon session, depending on the number of questions to be asked.  Speakers have indicated in the following sequence: Deputies David Cullinane, Catherine Murphy, Alan Kelly and Catherine Connolly.</p><p>We are continuing to look at the 2015 appropriation accounts, Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, specifically the interim internal audit report on financial procedures at the Garda College.  We discussed the matter on 4 and 31 May and will today engage with Garda senior management and the former chief administrative officer.  The Commissioner will appear before the committee next Tuesday, 20 June, to answer further questions.  Next Tuesday evening in a separate meeting the committee will meet representatives of the Policing Authority and the Department of Justice and Equality.  The focus today is on what has happened since 2015, the interim internal audit report and its implementation.  As at our last meeting, I again ask members co-operate fully.  We are joined from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by the deputy commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in; the assistant commissioner, Ms Anne Marie McMahon; chief superintendent Margaret Nugent; superintendent Pat McCabe; Mr. Barry McGee, author of the 2008 report; Mr. Joe Nugent, chief administrative officer; and Mr. Cyril Dunne, the former chief administrative officer who left the position in October 2015 and who has indicated his availability until lunchtime.  </p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off fully or left in airplane mode.  It is not adequate to leave them in silent mode because they will still interfere with the recording system.  </p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the objectives of such policies.  They are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>As we did not ask for a formal opening statement, we will commence with the first speaker, Deputy David Cullinane, who will have 20 minutes.  The second will have 15 minutes, while everyone else will have ten.  We need to keep to the timetable because of the tightness of time.  Members will have an opportunity to come back in a second time, but we are keeping to the timescale outlined.</p></speech>

In terms of the process involved, if the internal auditor sought from the finance directorate a copy of a report carried out by Mr. McGee and Mr. Kelly says he never got it, I want to know who was responsible for giving it to him.  When Mr. Culhane came before the committee, he said the CAO at the time would have had to make that call.  We are trying to establish what happened, but a call was made.  Mr. Kelly said he was frustrated in his work.  He was trying to get a copy of Mr. McGee's report but never got it and he wrote to Mr. Culhane several times.  He wrote to the CAO but never got a response.  Who in the organisation would have had responsibility to give the internal auditor the 2008 report?</p></speech>

I have been informed very clearly that there are two extracts relevant to me.

When Mr. Barrett was before the committee, he was also quite critical because his view is that Mr. Dunne should have informed the audit committee in July.  Mr. Dunne briefed the committee at the September meeting under any other business.</p></speech>

When Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in appeared before the committee previously, I asked him about that and he said that it was his understanding that the comprehensive briefing was given at the September internal audit committee meeting.  That was his view of the minutes.  He was not at the meeting but that was his view.  Mr. Howard, who was subsequently before the committee said:</p><blockquote>There was a very busy agenda that day and at the end of the meeting, this was raised verbally as an AOB item.  There was no briefing given to us.  I have reflected on how I will phrase this.  Neither I nor any of the other outside members of the committee took from that briefing any sense of importance of this issue as it subsequently emerged.  Ultimately, this issue was so serious that the Accounting Officer had to amend a statement of internal financial control.  I do not believe that has happened before on the Garda Vote so, objectively speaking, this was a very serious issue.  It was raised, we discussed it a bit and we were asked if we would include it in the 2016 programme of work, which was done.  That was Mr. Kelly's report at this time but no indication was given to us that this was different.</blockquote> <p>He went to say that he got no understanding of the seriousness of the issues.</p><p>That does not chime with Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in's reading of the minutes, or does it?  I refer to Mr. Howard's statement to the committee.</p></speech>

That is my interpretation of what he said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017061400002#E01800"><p>Before I get to Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in about the matter, I have one last question for Mr. Dunne because it mirrors very much what happened at the internal audit committee meeting.  Further down the note that can be viewed on the screen there is an account of what he said.  It reads: "The CAO wished to make it very clear that there is no basis to suggest any misappropriation or mishandling, fraud or otherwise or any suggestion of inappropriate activity."  Mr. Dunne said at the steering group that he could not see if the notes had been corrected, but he has said he could not see "any suggestion of inappropriate activity," yet when she was here the Garda Commissioner accepted the findings made in the report and that there had been financial irregularities.  At the second meeting of the steering group the CAO stated, if the note is correct, that he saw  "no basis to suggest any misappropriation or mishandling, fraud or otherwise," even though Mr. Kelly has said he could not give those assurances and had to keep an open mind.  The note further stated, "or any suggestion of inappropriate activity," which I find staggering.  Will Mr. Dunne explain to the committee how he felt at the time, given what he knew that he could not see "any inappropriate activity"?</p></speech>

Some previous actions identified haven&rsquo;t yet been completed.  All sections will be involved; Strategy and Change Management; Finance etc.  A representative from the Department of Justice and Equality has been invited to ensure visibility.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has been consulted in relation to possible legal issues.<br /><br />Issues could potentially go back as far as the 1960&rsquo;s to the foundation of the college.  It is important to ensure that any accounting issues get regularised in this financial year.  This will also put a demand on the resources of GIAS [the group internal audit] and needs to be factored into the 2016 Audit Plan.<br /><br />There was a general discussion among the committee members and the following matters were raised:. Is the Garda College a legal entity? <br /><br />. What is the legal status of the college restaurant? <br /><br />. Is the Garda College a limited company?<br /><br />. The Commissioner&rsquo;s right to own propertyThe CAO stressed the importance that any legal issues need to be clarified before GIAS can conduct an audit or review.  The following areas need to be examined:. Accounts<br /><br />. Land owned by OPW<br /><br />. Title of the land<br /><br />. Leases<br /><br />. Employee contracts &ndash; legal advice needed<br /><br />. The Sportsfield Company &ndash; does it come under the direction / control of the Garda College?It was agreed that this is a very complex matter and there are sensitivities surrounding this issue; reputation is important and timeframes, security of employment are very sensitive areas.<br /><br />The Committee noted the demands that are likely to be placed on Internal Audit during 2016 and asked to be kept informed of developments in this matter.</blockquote></speech>

I am not even sure how the report came to be a reference because straight off I was a member of staff in the finance directorate.  I was an assistant accountant at HEO level.  Obviously, I was tasked to do this work by the executive director, Mr. Michael Culhane.  The start of the report came from the CAO.  It was the CAO who had requested the review to be undertaken based on his observations.  Essentially, in my mind, this was a report for the CAO and that was the purpose.</p></speech>

I was part of a team also and there was also supervision.  Obviously, I finalised the report.</p></speech>

I presume it is the deputy commissioner of strategy and change management, SCM, and the chief administrative officer.  The second document is from Mr. Dunne.  It is a file note on the one-to-one meeting with John Barrett re the finances at Templemore.  Very serious matters were identified in the report of 2008, restated in 2010 and are now the subject of the internal audit report we have received, which is what we are discussing.  I refer to the two particular documents.  Mr. Barrett was the subject of both the minute and the letter.</p> <p>  Some of the references in the note are quite shocking and show a mindset of containment.  It reads: "I had got feedback that he had told Barry that he was not happy with the way I was approaching the issue."  That refers to Cyril Dunne and John Barrett.  The note continueds: "Barry had told him he was feeling under pressure over the report he had produced in 2008".  That refers to Mr. McGee.</p><p>Is there a reference number on the document?</p></speech>

If I am, the witness might help us.  It seems to me to be about having a real problem with Mr. Barrett in relation to his approach to the report.  Can Mr. Dunne expand on that first?</p></speech>

This was a letter written from Mr. Culhane to the Commissioner, each of the acting deputy commissioners and myself.  He was making what seemed to be a complaint about Mr. Barrett.  I think that letter is available to the committee.</p></speech>

I might do that now.  That is PAC 32R575.  Within that report, it asks whether in collecting all of this confidential material and posting it to his own home address "JB" is guilty of a criminal offence under the Official Secrets Act and suggests the Commissioner might wish to initiate a formal investigation of "JB's" activities under the Act as his intent may appear to be to cause damage to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na either through unauthorised disclosures or leaks to the press.  This was written by Mr. Culhane to the Commissioner, the deputy commissioner in charge of operations, the deputy commissioner in charge of change management and the chief administrative officer.  Mr. Dunne is responding to that.  It seems to imply that the real problem was not what was happening in Templemore but was rather Mr. Barrett.  That is how I read that.  I will leave Mr. Dunne to come back to me on that.  That context makes it very serious.</p></speech>

In that letter to me, it was clear that he had issues with Mr. Barrett.  The relationship between Mr. Culhane and Mr. Barrett - and it was probably evident even at this committee - has not been strong.  That letter was sent to me, the Commissioner and the deputy commissioners, separately.  When I got it, my first reaction was actually to talk to John Barrett, which I did.  That is the note to which Deputy Murphy is referring.  I did not tell him I got a letter because I felt that would pour fuel on the fire of a relationship that was not good but I told him, as is basically set out in the note, that I had got what I called "feedback".  I referred to what Mr. Culhane had said about meeting with Mr. McGee.  I say it here, which is what happened.  I reminded John that we, John and I, had always been open with each other that we had different approaches to trying to solve this problem.  We were quite open about that between us.</p></speech>

He said they had different approaches to solving this problem.  Mr. Barrett's approach and that of others was that it should be referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General, that it should be a section 41 matter and that it should not be maintained in house.  What was Mr. Dunne's view?</p></speech>

Mr. Barrett's view was that with the level of information we had we should go straight to the audit committee on 15 July.  My view was that it was obvious to me that there was a whole load of information that we did not have.  We had two reports at that stage.  There was the report generated through Mr. McGee's work and then a subsequent review of that.  There were two pieces of documentation that we had.  It was clear to me that there were reams of documentation that must be there.  I wanted to find yet more information before we elevated it up.</p></speech>

The issues got aired, the information has been established, we have had an internal audit and we are having a review by the PAC.  That is exactly as I laid it out in the minute to the audit committee in September.  The only difference is whether we went on 15 July, which was John's view and with which I did not agree, or whether we initiated engagement with the audit committee in September.</p></speech>

What was clear to me was that it was far from complete.  My view, which I still believe to be the correct view, was that we needed to get a lot more information before we would be able to report in particular to the Department.  That is what we did.  We immediately set out to do two things.  One was what I describe as the "No regret" move, which would be implementing the recommendations that had been made back in 2008.  It was to start to do those because there was no reason we would not.</p></speech>

In my view, a matter of this nature and this seriousness should be raised immediately with the audit committee in the first instance and the audit committee should have been involved in the decision making and in advising the Commissioner on an approach and the provision of information to my office.  I would have expected to know quite soon, but the first step, given the seriousness of the matters which I think was evident around July, was that the audit committee should definitely have been involved at that stage.</p></speech>

I might have to write to some witnesses through the Chair at a later stage because there is no way I will get through all of the contradictions.  I remind witnesses that this is the Committee of Public Accounts.  They should bear this in mind when giving their answers.  A report will be produced as a consequence of this process and it is highly likely that this issue will be dealt with in another forum afterwards.  I ask the witnesses to bear that in mind.

He has had a very interesting career.  I have looked it all up and, frankly, find it unbelievable that he has not looked through the audit report.  I will ask a few questions to kick off.  I have a lot of questions for everyone but particularly Mr. Dunne.</p> <p>  I will begin with a standard question that I asked at our last meeting.  The witnesses probably know it is coming.  As Mr. Nugent has already answered it, he can avoid doing so again.  It does not apply to the officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Mr. Dunne can escape it too, but I will put it to him in a different context.  Given the evidence we have heard, do all of those currently in the organisation have 100% full confidence in every member of the management team across the board at the highest level of the organisation?  If anyone has a conditional answer, I ask him or her to set it out now.  It is a very important question for each and every witness.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about the role of senior Garda management.  The witnesses will be aware that we all have to adhere diligently to the standards in public office procedures.  Have they all met their requirements under the Standards in Public Office Act since its introduction?  If any of them has not done so, or if any of them has issues, I ask him or her to mention it now.</p></speech>

To be fair though, it is slightly irrelevant.  I accept that Ms McMahon had no material interest in the company but there are lots of people who are directors of companies who have no material interest in them but they still have to abide by what is legal.  Obviously, in Ms McMahon's situation, she does not have a material interest but she did not adhere to the requirements of the law because she got informal legal advice.  I am not legally qualified but I do know about the standards in public office legislation.  For me, it does not stand up that a director of a company at the level of Ms McMahon would not meet those legal requirements.  I know that Ms McMahon is in a bind and I appreciate the situation in which she finds herself.  I appreciate that there must be a director and I understand Mr. Nugent wrote to her in that capacity because somebody has to be a director, or at least the organisation believes that somebody has to be a director.  However, there are requirements that must be met under law and they have not been met.</p></speech>

The purpose of setting up the company was to develop sports facilities for student garda&iacute; in particular, following the recommendations of the Walsh report.  I cannot second guess the rationale of those people who set up the company.  The first directors were a deputy commissioner, an assistant commissioner and a representative of all of the ranks in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The rationale for setting up the company was to develop sports facilities.  When the 2005 Act came into being, there were some questions around the Commissioner owning land and so forth.  The organisation's legal advisor at the time, Ms Marie-Claire Maney, gave advice to the effect that the Sportsfield company was in existence prior to the enactment of the 2005 Act and that the legislation did not retrospectively apply.  That was the position and the company remained in being.</p> <p>  As I have already outlined, I went to the Garda college in 2011.  During my initial period of time at the college I was focused on a wind-down or de-scaling of the operation and there were several iterations of that as the country went deeper into recession.  In or around the middle of 2013, I began examining the Sportsfield company and related matters.  I was concerned, very much in line with the Deputy's question, as to the role members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were playing in terms of being directors of the company and so forth.  I initiated a process, the aim of which was to wind up the Sportsfield company and to bring the lands into the ownership of the OPW and I called a meeting in relation to that.  I believe the committee has documentation relating to various meetings-----</p></speech>

I am just putting that on the record.  I invite Mr. Nugent to say publicly that he is not in a position to confirm compliance, as per that letter.  I ask Mr. Nugent to clarify the contents of that letter because it might not be on the public record yet.</p></speech>

At the outset we included the main Garda tax number, not because of any concerns in relation to compliance but to ensure that in our dealings with the Revenue Commissioners they could see that we were taking responsibility for the other four tax entities.  I just want to say that up front.  The discussions we are having with the Revenue Commissioners relate to the other four tax entities and whether tax liability applies in each of those circumstances.  We have engaged a tax expert to work with us on that and are in discussions with the Revenue Commissioners at present.  I am not trying to be evasive with the committee.  We will clearly reach a conclusion and a determination with the Revenue Commissioners which will be brought to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General forthwith.  We are literally in the process of discussions.  I am conscious of saying something that might prejudice or jeopardise those discussions but no more than that.  I am more than happy to provide details to the committee at the appropriate point.</p></speech>

A committee was set up at which two witnesses, the  head of finance and the head of human resource, HR, were in attendance on 2 July and Mr. Dunne is now saying that committee was not the one that was set up to look into the issues in Templemore.</p></speech>

In the last week of June, from memory, the issue was raised with me by Mr. John Barrett.  The issue being the report that had been produced back in 2008.    He had had various discussions with people in the college and had identified that the actions had not been completed at that stage, and he reported that to me.</p></speech>

One of the things I did was I said that I needed to understand this and I said let us get down to the college, which we did, and we brought Mr. Michael Culhane down as well.

I wish to ask Mr. Dunne one question regarding these minutes and Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in might want to reflect on these.  Mr. Howard and Mr. Kelly, who were both at the meeting, said in evidence that with respect to the minutes of 30 September - we must remember that the internal auditor still know did about this, he was told about it six month later in March 2016 - that there was a very brief discussion about Templemore, and we went through it in detail here.  However, from the minutes of meeting under the heading "any other business" it goes into quite a level of detail.  How could that have been a brief discussion?  Second, the font changes in the documentation.  The font is changed.  I want to know when these minutes were written and were they subsequently changed?</p><p>I ask Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in to find out that for this committee and subsequently come back to us.  It is a complete contradiction.  Mr. Howard and Mr. Kelly, the head of external audit and the internal auditor, who were both at the meeting, said there was a very brief discussion - we are talking about a couple of minutes - yet there are quite detailed notes in these minutes about what went on.  That does not add up at all.</p></speech>

We are here as a public accounts committee.  I just want to go back to the kernel.  There is an internal audit carried out and no assurance that the financial controls of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are compliant with the public financial procedures.  Second, there is no assurance that the financial controls at the Garda college are compliant with the Garda finance code.  Third, there is limited assurance that the financial controls at the Garda college are compliant.  The fourth point concerns reasonable assurance regarding the staff cost.  That is why we are here in relation to this.  It is not possible to go into all the minutiae.  This is not a court of law; it is a public accounts committee.  I am looking at that and at various things.  When did Mr. Dunne come into the organisation?</p></speech>

At the point in time in question, in 2015, they were current issues and there were issues or recommendations that seem to have been accepted and which had not been implemented.  They were current, therefore.</p></speech>

I have read where it was debated whether the Assistant Commissioner should be a director or not.  I understand he is caught but what I am trying to get at is that there are ongoing issues.  When the Commissioner talked about legacy issues, she jumped the gun.  That is for the Commissioner to answer the next day when she is before us.  We are here dealing with issues.  A committee was set up, and then a steering group to implement the recommendations, so we should have been able to relax.  Is that not right?  On the basis of problems being identified, we should have been able to relax.  Instead of that, Mr. Barrett told us on the last occasion he was before us that, only for him, there would be no investigation.  I put a specific question to him.  Would Mr. Dunne accept that, only for Mr. Barrett's persistence and note taking, this would not have come out in the manner it did?</p></speech>

That was not my experience.  If one looks at what was going on after Mr. Barrett's raising of the issue - I give him credit for it - one sees that we, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, engaged with the Department to make sure that there was visibility there.</p></speech>

What he knew was that he had an expectation it was going to be briefed in July.  He knew that that did not happen.  What seems clear to me now is that he did not realise - I am not putting this on Mr. Barrett; he had not been told - that the audit committee had been briefed in September and that there was visibility.  I think he lost trust in me, actually, at that point in time.  That is my sense of it.</p></speech>

This has already been out in the open.  The letter was written by Mr. Culhane to say that Mr. Barrett should be examined or that the Commissioner should consider an examination.  That is the background.  Mr. Dunne goes to Mr. Barrett but does not tell him about any of that.  He relays some feedback from an unknown source to Mr. Barrett.  Mr. Dunne then talks to Mr. Culhane on 3 November and reports that.  This is a completely different version concerning Mr. McGee.  The account was that he told him that Mr. McGee had come to him with concerns about what had transpired from the meeting with Mr. Barrett.  They were all sitting down having something to eat when Mr. Barrett came along and asked Mr. McGee to go to a meeting.  What Mr. Dunne records here is Mr. Culhane's version of that, which is that Mr. McGee was under pressure with regard to his meeting with Mr. Barrett.  According to the account, Mr. Culhane was asked whether he wanted to raise a grievance against Mr. Barrett but he said "No".  The account states that Mr. Culhane said he was mistrustful of Mr. Barrett, would not meet him on his own in the future and would be cautious regarding how he interacted with him.  Here we are in 2015.  There is a serious crisis in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - an historical crisis, as the Commissioner puts it.  We have people together and there are two entirely different versions.  I have not even reached the other reports such as the 2010 report or the 2006 report which remained on someone's desk.  We are talking about what, unfortunately, has been called Mr. McGee's report.  Does Mr. Dunne understand the point I am making?</p></speech>

I think I said earlier in the meeting that the relationship between Mr. Culhane and Mr. Barrett is not good.  They both reported to me.  The challenge I had was to get them to work together in order that we could make things happen and implement things.  That was the challenge I had.  The view I had was that it would not be at all helpful to start trying to figure one versus the other.</p></speech>

I must put it to Mr. Dunne that he failed utterly to grasp the significance of what was happening.  We have a director of finance writing a letter to the Commissioner asking for the Official Secrets Act to be invoked about a man who is raising issues.  Is that not right?  Mr. Dunne is talking about a difference of personality between the two of them as opposed to realising that Mr. Barrett is raising a serious issue.</p></speech>

However, it was not being dealt with.  It was mentioned under any other business.  Subsequently, we see from the record of the minute that it is longer.  Certainly, I agree with the point made by Deputy Kelly.  It is in a different font.  Certain questions must be asked.  If that is the meeting, I accept it, but at the moment, there is a question around that meeting.  When we go forward to December, it recorded that the audit committee would look at it at some future date.  That is what the minutes of the December meeting of the audit committee said, so number one, there is no sense of seriousness or urgency here.  Mr. Barrett, without whom all the witnesses accept this would not have come to light, is totally unhappy and someone writes that he should be investigated under the Official Secrets Act.  We have Mr. McGee inadvertently coming into this with two men giving two different versions.  I will return to Mr. McGee.  He produced a report in 2008.  Did he have any difficulty with Mr. Barrett?</p></speech>

The second thread was that having done that, we needed to make sure a full audit of everything that had happened was done.

The witnesses can tell me if I am wrong but this is what happened in 2009.  On 18 September 2009, Deputy Commissioner Ignatius Rice wrote regarding the Garda Training College and financial regulation.  He clearly said that it was important to point out that all the named companies and committees were formed at a time when there was no money made available by the State to develop and improve welfare, sporting facilities and so on.  He wrote that the only means at the time to develop and improve these facilities was the formation of the said companies.  He went on to write that when the public money came and was channelled through the restaurants and a profit was made, it was okay to use that money because the Government was not funding the facilities properly and he saw absolutely nothing wrong with the use of that money.</p><p>That, in my opinion, is the problem.  Do the witnesses disagree with that?  I am particularly talking to the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></speech>

They are talking about lack of candour the whole way up, right up to this year.  Mr. Howard has it on record.  In fairness, he does not attribute it to the witnesses or to the Commissioner, but he talks about the difficulty of giving out about the messenger and about the lack of candour right the way up.  That is our difficulty at this committee.  Would this witnesses like to comment on that?</p></speech>

The Garda training college was set up in 1964 when training moved from Garda Headquarters to Templemore.  A financial architecture was put in place with the full knowledge of the Department of Justice at the time.  That evolved over the years until the Walsh report was implemented.  Even going back as far as 1986-----</p></speech>

All of that has repeatedly been said by the Commissioner and others and that has all been accepted.  It has not been accepted, however, by the people who carried out the various reports including the McGee report, the Nolan report and the internal audit, which said that all this was off the balance sheet, irregular and outside of financial control.  Giving me the historical aspect again is not helpful.  What we are looking at was completely outside of acceptable standards, not looking back now, but in 2006, 2008 and 2010.  That is the difficulty that we have.  It does not inspire confidence when the witnesses keep going back to that narrative.  It would be more inspiring for us to hear the witnesses say that they are dealing with the lack of candour.  Where does the lack of candour come from?  Mr. Howard, as chairman of the audit committee, says that there is still a lack of candour.  That is the question for the witnesses to answer, not the historical legacy justifying something that cannot be justified because various experts have said that it is outside.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has said this.  These are the questions.</p></speech>

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na absolutely has to comply with public sector controls, regulations and governance.  The historical perspective is important because this was the situation in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na found itself.  There is evidence on file going back as far as 1986 - in fact, Mr. Niall Kelly came across it when he was doing his audit - that there was an investment of &pound;200,000 directly from the Department of Justice into the Garda college.  It is not as if An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were dreaming up these things on its own.  We had oversight from our parent organisation and there is plenty of evidence of that.  Mr. Gay Harris is the person in that particular one that I am referencing.  I am not saying that it is right or that was the funding model that should have been put in place.  It is clear now that it should not have been.  That, however, is the backdrop to this.  We are trying to regularise this in every way that we can.</p> <p>  I will respond to Mr. Barrett's question as to whether or not anything would have happened had he not brought this issue to light.  As I mentioned earlier, I have been endeavouring to unravel this since 2013, together with the executive director of finance and, to a lesser extent, Mr. Ruane who, as the Commissioner's legal representative, could not really be involved in the sports field company business.  In addition to that, and again in conjunction with the executive director of finance, any surpluses were wound down and used for the day-to-day running of the college so that when the new students came into Templemore in September 2014 there was no drawdown on the Garda Vote.  It was on a net profit basis so that in the future, that situation would never again arise.  There was a lot of work going on to bring the situation into 2017 governance standards and financial controls.</p> <p>  The elephant in the room was the issue of the Garda college restaurant staff and whether or not they were public employees.  They clearly were not.  At one point in the 2000s they set about going on strike and threatening to jeopardise the implementation of the new training programme, because the restaurant is an integral part of the Garda college.  The Department rejected that suggestion at the time so the process continued.  While efforts were being made to regularise the situation then, as long as the restaurant staff remained outside the public sector pay roll money was always going to have to be found to pay them.  Whether that was right, wrong or otherwise, that was the factual position of the situation in which the Garda college found itself.</p></speech>

Those facts that existed in 2015 had an impact on what had been happening with the internal financial control reporting for 2014.  Given that it was considered necessary in September 2016 to make an amendment on the statement of internal financial control by the Commissioner for the year 2015, should that same correction not have been made for 2014?  The witnesses had so much information that they were able to brief the internal audit committee and they have, to a major extent, all told us about this here today and in the minutes.  It was well known to the witnesses at that stage.  Before signing off the appropriation accounts for 2014, which they would have done at some point during 2015, they would have had to know of this major difficulty in internal financial control.  Should the witnesses not have brought that to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General a year earlier?  What was the difference between signing off the 2014 and the 2015 accounts when the same difficulties pertained?  Why did the witnesses not bring this to the Comptroller and Auditor General's attention 12 months earlier when they had the information for 2014 by the middle of 2015?</p></speech>

So Mr. McGee knew about this report.  It must have been odd for him to have compiled this report and to have submitted it.  If I had compiled such a report, I would have wondered what happened on foot of it.  I would have wondered what were the consequences of my work.

Let me remind Mr. Dunne when he is answering that he is, as my colleagues have stated, criticised very sharply in the internal audit in terms of decisions that he made, what he did and what he did not do, and with all due respect to him, he really needs to read that report.  One of the criticisms, the core of it is that Mr. Dunne kept information from internal audit.  That is the sum of it.  Mr. Dunne stated earlier on that he did not accept that and yet he states that he took the view that he was in need of further information, in other words, that he should have some investigative role.

For example, it was clear from the information we had that there were numerous bank accounts which had been recommended to be closed and it was important, in my view, that we close those accounts.  So that was one.  Then the second thread is a full review by internal audit of everything that had gone on.  Okay, so those two threads.</p> <p>  It is most important that you do not have contagion between those two because as soon as you involve internal audit in management actions, they are potentially conflicted.

He did not know at that stage.  As a matter of fact, we still do not firmly know whether there was misappropriation, mishandling, fraud or otherwise.  I am not suggesting there was; I am simply saying that we do not know and the jury is out on that.  Certainly, going back to August 2015, he was not in a position to make that statement.  The statement, I believe, was more driven by this strategy I referred to earlier of minimisation, dealing with things internally and protecting people.</p></speech>

We know it would have moved from the Commissioner down to the assistant commissioners, the assistant commissioner for change management, the finance directorate, the head of human resources, the CAO's office, internal audit, or GIAS, and the audit committee.  All would have had a role and there would have been a very specific role for internal audit which was quite different to all the others.  Externally, there would be the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, the Attorney General's office, Revenue and lots of other external organisations, yet none of those external organisations was informed of any of these issues until 2016, I understand.</p> <p>  An account was given by the Commissioner when she was before us that she first became aware of these issues in, I think, July 2015.  Subsequently, Mr. Ruane said it was June 2015 but that could have been a mistake.  Whenever it was, she became aware in mid-2015.  My understanding is that, following this, a steering group was established and Mr. Dunne played a central role in that steering group.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

One of the central charges being made by some people within the organisation is that all of this was kept in-house.  Mr. Dunne might be aware that Mr. Kelly referred to a circling of the wagons and keeping it internal.  Mr. Barrett made similar accusations as well.  Let us bear in mind that we have gone from 2006 to 2015 and a steering group was set up with the support of the Commissioner.  Yet, a decision was made not to inform the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.</p></speech>

Mr. Dunne was due to brief the audit committee but that did not happen.  This goes back to my criticism of Mr. Dunne not reading the report.  Mr. Dunne has gone through this with An Teachta McDonald.  Mr. Dunne said that he believed he should gather more information, which is the reason he did not bring this to the attention of the July meetings.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

The document I have before me states that the report was compiled so that the chief administrative officer would brief the audit committee in June.  This did not happen.  Page 15 of the interim audit report states that in progressing the issues internal audit concluded that GIAS should have been informed immediately and that the report should have been on the agenda of the audit committee meeting in July 2015.  The report went on to state that GIAS, with the backing of the audit committee, was better placed to do the investigative work and the information gathering.  What I take from that is similar to what the internal audit people took from it, that is to say, Mr. Dunne assumed the role of internal audit for that period.</p></speech>

The steering committee at the time was doing two things.  It was trying to find out the scope of the issue.  Second, it was trying to implement what I would describe as the no-regret decisions that needed to be implemented.  It was always my view that internal audit-----</p></speech>

I accept all of that.  What I am saying is that there is a strong criticism in the internal audit report which suggests that internal audit was the body best placed to do that investigative work.  This goes back to what I said earlier.  There was a sense that those involved would deal with it in-house and would not allow internal audit, the audit committee or the Comptroller and Auditor General to deal with it.  Internal audit said that.  If internal audit says that in a report, does that not concern Mr. Dunne?</p></speech>

Let me explain my mindset at the time, because Deputy Cullinane is challenging the mindset I had.  The fact is that the approaches by internal audit prior to 2015 had not been successful for whatever reason.  We have heard that those involved did not get access to information.  We have heard a series of reasons why they were not able to progress it to the point that they would have liked to progress it.</p> <p>  I was in a position where I could ensure that internal audit eventually would be able to get traction in this matter.  I needed to get the information that was available within the organisation from, for example, the Commissioner's office, the office of the deputy commissioners and from the college.  That was the mindset that I had at that point in time.  This was to put internal audit in a position where it could conduct an audit and be successful.</p></speech>

I will come back to that later.</p> <p>  I have one final question for Mr. McCabe.  Deputy McDonald put this to Mr. McCabe earlier.  I have before me a note with an account of Mr. McCabe's contribution in which he says this could have been career-ending for him because of the irregularities.  When the Commissioner was before the committee she accepted that there were financial irregularities.  When the Commissioner was before the committee she said that the findings of the interim audit report were absolutely and totally unacceptable.  Does that not raise serious issues for people who held managerial positions in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the time period these irregularities were happening?  Does Mr. McCabe believe that there is culpability on his part and on the part of others who had responsibility in respect of those irregularities?  Was that at the foremost of his mind when he said that this could have been career-ending for him?</p></speech>

That was established in 1989 or 1990.  Prior to that, people were attested when they joined the Garda and a deduction was made from their pay.  An allowance paid in respect of each individual member was given to the restaurant to provide garda&iacute; with food.  If the numbers were sufficiently high for a surplus to be generated, it was disbursed across.  It can be seen in the documentation that all of this happened around 1989 when the original investment of &euro;200,000 by the Department came to fruition.  It can also be seen that the refurbishment of the college and the activities associated with the provision of the facilities commenced at that point.</p></speech>

I think we have a responsibility in the area where the Commissioner is the Accounting Officer.  There are other laws that can be broken, including corporate and civil laws.  When we are asking questions about breaches of the law, we mean the law in the full sense, not just in the criminal sense.  I am concerned that the questions we are asking are being taken as different questions.  Members have to give notification to the Standards in Public Office Commission and I do not separate my personal self from my professional self.  The idea of recording notifications is to show where conflicts of interest might arise.  That is why particular tiers of the public service, the Civil Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are required to make such notifications.  I do not understand why there has been such a lax approach to these issues.  Was there any risk management in relation to reputational damage?  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is required to have the trust of the public.  The range of things that have come out undermines that trust.  Was there a risk analysis of any of this at any point within anyone's remit?  I am reminded that the original letter suggested that if something was going to get out, the Official Secrets Act could be used to try to keep it inhouse and resolve it.</p></speech>

A formal risk management system was introduced in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na around 2010 or 2011.  It was the responsibility of every manager down to district officer level - a superintendent for a district - to prepare a risk register for his or her respective area.  When all of the sub-registers of risk were combined at the end of that process, information would have been gleaned on what the corporate risk register would look like, but it was not a very successful process.  It was hit and miss and not fit for purpose as an approach.  In March 2017 we introduced a brand new framework which called out the reputational, financial and other risks, starting at a corporate level.  We have asked all assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents, with the assistance of a team of people well trained in this area, to ensure all of the risks will surface, be identified early and end up at corporate level where they need to be dealt with.</p></speech>

To move onto another aspect, we got a document marked PAC32-R-584 for the meeting of 15 June 2017.  It was an interim audit report and it is about bank accounts.  It said that those accounts have been now closed or are private club accounts.  Were private club accounts counted as any of the 40-odd accounts?  They were counted as some of those.  How many of those that still remain are private accounts and what are they for?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the only accounts in existence that we are aware of are the five we provided information on there; in other words, the imprest, restaurant, shop, CEPOL and central Garda fund accounts.  To the best of my knowledge, all other accounts were closed and there are no interests left in that.  The reason for the delay in providing the material to the committee to confirm that is that I had asked Mr. Niall Kelly if he would confirm that he is satisfied that is the case.  He is at the moment.  In relation to the private accounts, they were listed in the original audit report.  That is the list of 50 accounts, or whatever the number was, that are there.  All of those accounts have been reduced to the numbers that the committee is seeing at this point.</p></speech>

However, what I did was I essentially put it down - currently we are operating outside the Government's financial procedures because of the complexity of trying to unwind the different entities that are there and the practices that existed traditionally - as a risk.  In other words, the recommendations need to be actioned to ensure that we move forward in a proactive manner.  I have it there so that it is constantly there to make sure that whatever needs to happen happens.  It is still a risk because there has been a number of years trying to unwind these various entities and we do not know how long that will continue for.  It is a risk for the organisation given that we are still operating outside the Government's financial procedures.  That is why it is there.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in said that it did not work very well but that new systems have been put in place since earlier this year.  Has he identified why it did not work and why this would not have made its way, given the significant risk that it posed to the reputation of the college and given that the college is supposed to be the centre of excellence for training guards?</p></speech>

It takes some time for people to get used to a way of thinking and of doing business and of identifying risks, recording them and grading them at a proper level.  There is a lot of learning in that process.  On that basis, the first iteration did embed the thought process that we needed a risk register but it was not surfacing the risks quickly enough.  That is our assessment of it.  The new system is not just a top-down approach; it is also a bottom-up approach.  We would get people at the front line who see some risk emerging and who would be raising it at district level.  It would appear at a district level.  It may be confined to that district and may not go outside it.  If it is sufficiently widespread, it would eventually make it to the corporate risks register.</p> <p>  The first iteration of our current new framework for sure has "Financial" as one of the headings.  A sub-heading would be the way the Garda College funds currently operate.  That will remain on our risk register until such time, as the chief superintendent has explained, as all the recommendations are in place to unwind the current systems that are in place and are fully implemented.</p></speech>

They are mainly around the criminal code.  One area in which people probably feel there is a real risk to the public is that of white-collar crime.  I have to say that the way this has been handled in Templemore is not an exemplar from that point of view.  We were told that people did not have the skill sets, were not experienced and all that kind of stuff.  That was put in as a reason so many of these practices were in place.  It does not appear to me that there is the same seriousness around issues that would be in the civil or corporate area.  We were told that the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, will come in and do some training courses and things like that.  However, in terms of the culture around what has happened here, it is very much in that white-collar area.  In addition to the IPA doing training courses, is there anything else in terms of training in the college that is embedded in how that particular side of offence, if one likes, is captured?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.890" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017061400002#PP00100"><p>White collar crime is also criminal, Deputy.  Much of our training in the area for detectives and senior investigating officers certainly has modules on the investigation of white collar crime.</p> <p>  The approach taken to financial management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is essentially confined to an imprest account at district level.  That caters for most of how the Vote is managed in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There was a need in the college to address an issue which did not replicate itself in any other area of the organisation.  This was a unique set-up at the Garda college.  There was of course an imprest account to run the normal day-to-day expenses of garda&iacute; who were working there and so forth  It is the add-on piece that has caused the problems.  When one applies what the auditor referred to as "the blue book", or the bible of public management procedures, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na financial code, which is what all of us as officers were trained in coming up through the ranks, was and remains very adequate for managing the normal imprest account.  When it comes to something that was uncovered during the process over the last ten years in the college, however, there is obviously a broader matter here which goes to the broader public financial management systems.  This raises the question as to whether or not our Garda finance code is sufficiently fit for purpose in that context.  My colleagues might prove more instructive in this regard and give the committee more detail, but when it comes to the training received by our officers all of the promotion courses include modules on the management of finance and imprest accounts.  These are the same in every district in the country.  They are run in the same way with the same processes, procedures and checks and balances built in around them.  What happened in the college was unique and outside the normal way of doing business.  </p></speech>

What was voted money?  I want to be clear on that.  The money was voted and went to the college for the purpose of maintaining the recruits.  The restaurant was one part of that.  There would have been some income in the restaurant over and above that, I imagine quite a small amount.  My reading of the report is that not all of the money put into the restaurant account for the recruits was used due to larger numbers, economies of scale and so forth.  Some of that money was then moved from that account, where it was not required, into the sports field account.  Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

The challenge was that part of the basis on which the college was set up was that there would be development of these facilities on behalf of the students, such as playing pitches, running tracks, etc.  All of this has happened in the college environs, to some extent.  My colleagues here who were in the college can give more detail as to how that stipend was meant to be spent.</p></speech>

This was a Government publication - I see that Assistant Commissioner McMahon has it with her - and it was designed to enhance training.  It included a number of requirements and one was that facilities be improved, that pitches be bought, and that the land adjacent to the college be bought and enhanced so that students could interact with the community and the community could be involved in the Garda college clubs.   That was the catalyst for changing the culture in Templemore and bringing us to the forefront in police training at the time.  It is a renowned report.</p> <p>  The funding structure at the time appears to have been one that was agreed through the Department of Justice.  I do not have the full details on it but that appears to be the case.  The money that we were given was to pay, not just for the food, but also for the restaurant staff and other ancillary facilities.  That appears to be the historic position, as we understand it.  The sports field company and so forth was set up as a result of that, all with the purpose of enhancing Garda training.  It is accepted that the structures that worked years ago are no longer appropriate today and that is what today's meeting is about.  </p> <p>  Furthermore, the people in the restaurant procured the food locally.  They did not comply and were not State employees.  Approximately &euro;20,000 a week currently goes towards purchasing food from the local community, such as meat, vegetables and whatever is needed.  We accept that this does not comply with the standards of today but this is a practice that has existed since 1964.  I think it is important that this be highlighted.</p></speech>

The Walsh report recommended that a network of sporting, social, cultural, educational and recreational facilities be provided and actively encouraged in order to enable trainees to come together during off-duty hours, thereby developing them in the source of community spirit which would be helpful to them in the course of their duty.  It was on the basis of this principle that the stipend was enabled, to the best of my understanding.</p> <p>  I would like to make two further points.  The Garda college is not established by statute as other third level institutes are.  There is no stream of funding other than the stipend for the students.  The starting or stopping of the recruitment of students is a Government decision, usually coinciding with a downturn or an upturn in the economy.  Neither Garda college nor the Garda organisation decide when that happens, or indeed what the numbers are.  My understanding is that the stipend and the investments made the Department of Justice were to cater for peaks and valleys in the recruitment process and in the funding of the college.</p></speech>

I do not want to put Mr. Nugent on the spot.  I know Mr. McCarthy is here.

If the bill was &euro;100,000 or whatever, the receipt or the bills go up and the cheque comes down.  It is not possible to generate a surplus.  Does that sound like an easier system?

There was income in the restaurant and the shop.  In any modern-day look at that, one would have to say that is public money.  If the original seed money was public money, then anything that came from it would be public money.  I think that is the point the auditor made in his report.  We are trying to resolve that and ensure that we get to a space where that will be the case.  If money is required - and it will be because we still have to provide all these facilities which are part of any modern training facility - we have to find ways of doing that which are completely captured within the public financial framework and that are voted and accountable.</p></speech>

We have evidence given from two witnesses, Mr. John Barrett and Mr. Michael Culhane, that the committee was set up on 2 July.  That has been countered here.  There was evidence of a note on 30 June.  There was a letter which was sent to Mr. Cyril Dunne from Mr. John Barrett on 8 July and received on 9 July.  There was also a note on 6 July which shows multiple contradictions across the team and also with the Commissioner as to who knew what and when.</p> <p>  I want to go back to the meeting on 27 July.

Mr. John Barrett said it was over two hours.</p> <p>  I am glad we did not clear that one up.  It is bloody well incredible that there is such a range of views coming from the same meeting.  What a pivotal meeting that was.  It is a meeting that will go down in history, yet we have such a range of views as to the length of time it took.  I thank the witnesses for confirming the topics discussed.</p> <p>  I was not going to ask Mr. Cyril Dunne the following question but I will now because of the way he spoke.  There is a concern he left the Garda at the time because, obviously, the cat was out of the bag as to what was going on in the Garda college.  This is just surmising and not my opinion.  There is a view he left because these issues were going to be so huge.  In reply to a question from Deputy McDonald, he said he was approached regarding another job and ended up in CIE.  Who approached him?  Was it members of the board or the chairperson of CIE?</p></speech>

Mr. Cyril Dunne met Mr. John Barrett in September.  In the middle of all of this the Fennelly report happened.

I thank my colleague, Deputy Cullinane.  Mr. Howard, in his contribution relating to 30 September, said the following: "There was a very busy agenda that day and at the end of this meeting this was raised verbally as an AOB item.  There was no briefing given to us."  This is the external auditor saying there was no briefing given.  He is directly contradicting the witness.  "I have reflected on how I will phrase this: neither I nor any of the other outside members of the committee took from that briefing any sense of the importance of this issue as it subsequently emerged.  Ultimately, this issue was so serious that the accounting officer had to amend the statement of internal financial control.  I do not believe that this happened before on a Garda Vote so, objectively speaking, this was a very serious issue.  It was raised, we discussed it a bit and we were asked if we would include it in the 2006 work programme which was done."  That is totally contrary to the evidence the witness is giving here.</p></speech>

When the chair of the audit committee talks about what was subsequently discovered he is talking about it being after the audit that was conducted.

The criticism from internal audit was that in the first instance a copy of the report, which should have been given in July but then was given verbally in September, was not circulated prior to that and was raised under "any other business".  That, coupled with what the internal auditor is saying, leads us to believe that it was not given sufficient weight.  Any other business is certainly not the place to deal with issues of that calibre.  Mr. Dunne is telling us that he gave the members all the information they needed at that meeting and that they had a full picture of what was happening.  That does not chime with how it was raised and what was their understanding.  They were in the room.</p></speech>

In particular, out of the meeting on 27 July and the setting up of the steering group, the Commissioner wanted to ensure the Department was engaged in that steering group.  To bring that about, we needed to formally brief the Department.  By "we", I mean the steering group.  We looked to collate all the information and documentation we had internally within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That was from the chief administrative officer's office, the Commissioner's office, the offices of the two deputy commissioners and the college itself, so that we could fully brief the Department on everything we knew about the situation and ask the Department.

When it came to the situation that was raised through Mr. Ruane's famous letter on 24 July that we supposedly will not see because of legal privilege, although I suspect this will have to change, was Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in not concerned as head of risk that a section 41 was not going to be delivered and that the Minister was not going to be notified?  In fairness, risk is about percentages.  It is about corporate identity, corporate knowledge, brand and people's view of an organisation in which we must have not 95% confidence but 100% confidence.  Consequently, was Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in not concerned about that?</p></speech>

What I am really asking Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in is what advice, and this is not privilege, as the head of risk did he give the Commissioner with regard to providing or not providing a section 41?  For all I know and in fairness to Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, he could have been in favour of it.  What advice did he give the Commissioner because it is only the document that is privileged?  Supposedly, the advice is privileged, not Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in's opinion on what he gave her, so I ask him to be very clear.</p></speech>

I will let the internal audit complete its business.  At this point I am just trying to clarify.  I wish we were looking at the implementation of the recommendations and that we could deal with this and get it out of the way, but the more we try to do that, the more items of conflict come up.  The two obvious ones are the divergent views of Mr. Barrett and Mr. Culhane.  Mr. Dunne is somewhere in the middle of this and we also have Mr. McGee's report not being acted on, to which I will come back.  It is hard to move to implementation when there is such a conflict between witnesses before the committee.</p></speech>

It is very important that we get to the implementation.  While we are on conflicts and versions of events, I would like to place on the record that on 22 January 2015, I submitted a report to Mr. John Barrett.  The title of the report was a briefing document for the Garda Commissioner.</p></speech>

That document gave an overview of the work I was doing and proposing to do in terms of winding up the Garda College Sportsfield Company.  It also alluded to the highly unusual situation that existed in terms of the Sportsfield company and associated matters.  That document was forwarded to Mr. Barrett for his information and that of the Garda Commissioner.  That was six months before-----</p></speech>

I am putting this on the record because I am aware of other matters that are in the media and in this committee which suggest otherwise.</p></speech>

There comes a point where he loses trust in the process.  That is the difficulty as we see it.  That is just his viewpoint from what we see coming across.</p> <p>  If we go back again, I am concerned that the message was this was historical.  Mr. Dunne said in one of the two notes he wrote that he had no concerns about the past, that it was to get it right now, and that different governance rules were applicable before, but it was now different and he had no doubt that we could not look backwards and apply 2015 standards.  The point, which I have put repeatedly, is that in 2008, when the report was done, the way the Garda College was performing or functioning was against the rules.</p></speech>

I got this from minutes, or a note, which have already been referred to, from 6 August, "Meeting Office of the Chief Administrative Officer" at 11.15 a.m..  On the second page, the CEO outlined that his only concern relating to the college was the obligation that at the end of a financial year, if a public body had a surplus, which Mr. Dunne has said there was, there was a duty to reimburse.  He stated he had no major issues with what went before.</p></speech>

This was the working group.  The working group was not charged with doing an audit of what had gone before.  What the working group was charged with was getting recommendations implemented.  That was what I was trying to do there, keeping the working group focused on implementing, making decisions and taking action.  That is what it was charged to do.</p></speech>

The focus of that working group was to make decisions and implement actions.  I spoke about no regret decisions earlier on, such as closing bank accounts.  I was always of the view that we needed to have a look back, which was an audit, which should not be conducted by that group.</p></speech>

Before my time is up, Mr. McGee, I wish to go back to these two men.  There are very serious letters on file about a meeting with Mr. McGee and things that were said, and I have asked him this morning whether he has trust in Mr. Barrett.  "Absolutely," he said.  He has no issues at all with Mr. Barrett.

There are a number of notes here, and I referred to this aspect this morning and I want to ask about it again.  Mr. Michael Howard refers to emails from Mr. Culhane, which I do not need to go into here.  He takes serious issue with Mr. Culhane regarding what he said in various letters.  He goes on to say: "The audit report must fully reflect the fact that there has been a major failure in the financial control environment and that the failure continued for years although senior management was aware of the problem and of its unfulfilled duty to disclose it to the Audit Committee."</p><p>That was in March 2017.  It took Mr. Culhane to task for the way he wrote and so on, something I will not address at this point, but he refers to a lack of candour.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in explain the lack of candour to me?  Did he inquire into it?  On 3 November 2016 there was a reference to the emphasising of concern about the lack of candour and the need to take action immediately and to stop shooting the messenger.  Therefore, the chairperson of the audit committee was seriously concerned about the ongoing lack of candour.  What did the witnesses understand this to mean?  Who were the people who were not being upfront in giving answers and what inquiries did they make?</p></speech>

One of them, critically, is Mr Culhane because he was finance executive director.  The other is the executive director of the Garda College.  Clearly, as shown at the last meeting, there was a clash between the two and a lack of trust between them.  That posed a challenge for Garda management in making sure the urgency that needed to be attached to all of these matters was being attached to it and that we were getting into the space where we would have resolutions rather than having people with perhaps differing views.</p></speech>

Mr. Howard has indicated that it was a short briefing, but the minutes indicate to me that there was quite an extensive discussion.</p></speech>

The minutes do not stack up.  If the briefing was very brief, the garda who is the secretary did tremendous work in the set of minutes produced.  They are so precise that great notes must have been taken or the person must have been given a document.  Was any document presented?  From what did the garda prepare the minutes?  Would they have had contemporaneous notes?  They were very extensive and I would love to know if there is more behind them.  It would help to clarify for us how extensive or narrow the actual briefing was as there are conflicting views.</p></speech>

Mr. Dunne has said it was quite extensive and that is what the minutes show.  We cannot know which view is right or where it falls in between.  We know that at the subsequent meeting, on which Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in said we needed to follow up, there was a brief discussion as there is a short paragraph on the December meeting.  When we receive the information, we might have to double check it with Mr. Howard.</p> <p>  I have a couple of very quick questions.  Can somebody give us an indication of how many audit reports would be produced in each of the years?  I am sure the audit committee has produced other reports.  From the sequence, I understand this issue arose in the second half of 2015.  I am sure there was an audit programme or work on an ongoing report to be completed that year.  In early 2016 the audit committee would have set out that it wanted one, two, three, four or five reports and that is probably why.  I want to understand why it was the spring before that request had worked its way into the audit work programme for 2016.  Are there many audit reports?  Could the request gazump everything already included in the work programme of the audit committee?</p></speech>

At that point, the advice was that the legal advice had to be sought and obtained before Mr. Kelly could commence his work, all the bank accounts had to be closed, and all the moneys and investments had to be brought into one account.  All that work was ongoing.  However, in the first quarter of that year in discussions I had with our legal adviser, Mr. Ken Ruane, it became clear to me that that advice was not going to be forthcoming any time soon.  I then put it in writing to Mr. Kelly that he should start the audit because I felt that until such time as he had completed his audit, the sum of the solutions to the issues would not be clear to me or the Commissioner.  We needed his professional view on what the issues were and what we needed to do fix them going forward.  By March, I had asked Mr. Kelly to do that.</p></speech>

Mr. Kelly had two teams that he could send out.  It is now proposed to increase that to three teams.  They have an approach and a template that they use to produce a report on each of the divisions.  If issues are identified about which we would have had a concern, we would ask Mr. Kelly to put them on his work programme as well.  That request can come from any of the executive.</p></speech>

The main chart, which is contained on page 8 of the internal report, is the only financial summary in the report.  The final sentence on page 7 of the internal audit report states that the total expenditure in the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 March 2016 from the Garda Vote relating to the Garda College was &euro;112 million.  As the Committee of Public Accounts, we need to have a better understanding of the flow of the income.  It is stated on page 8 that expenditure varied considerably from &euro;24 million in 2009 down to &euro;11 million in 2013.  There seems to have been a base line of approximately &euro;11 million available.  Was that processed through the restaurant account or the college?  Given there were not recruits at the college for a few years, why was there a base line of &euro;11 million every year?</p></speech>

There is a breakdown of those costs on the next page.  As I said, it is important the committee has the information it needs.  It is clear now that &euro;112 million was the voted expenditure through the college over that period.  Nowhere do I see in this report information on the non-voted income.  I am sure the witnesses understand the point I am making.  We are only shown the voted expenditure in this report and so I have no knowledge of how much other income went through that account in each of the years in question.  We do not have the full picture.</p></speech>

This was calculated in the late 1980s and it has been indexed linked since then.  The capitation grant per student in the period audited was &euro;77.92 per student per week.  This did not change from 2009 onward.  These payments came from the subhead, living allowance, within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote, totalling &euro;2.8 million in the period audited in table 1.</p> <p>  The only breakdown we have of the voted expenditure of &euro;112 million is that &euro;2.8 million related to this living allowance and the capitation grant about which we have been speaking.

We are dealing with an internal audit report which was presented to us.  In fact, it came from a leak.  We may have got it anyway over the course of time, but we are dealing with an internal audit report which was not done by us.  It was done by internal audit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have responsibility to ask questions about that internal audit report.  That is why we are here and why the witnesses are here.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier today - and the Cathaoirleach was looking for clarification - that the Garda Commissioner had accepted that there were financial irregularities.  The irregularities are set out in the interim audit report.  It talks about non-compliance with public financial procedures, non-compliance with the Garda finance code, irregular presentation of accounts, irregular transfer of cash from accounts, irregular opening of accounts, irregular opening or setting up of companies, and so on.  Those are the irregularities which the Garda Commissioner accepts.  I think everybody accepts that there were unacceptable practices and irregularities, or at least most people who have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts have.  That is what we are dealing with.</p> <p>  What we are also seeing - and this is most troubling for us - is that we can see what was done or maybe not done internally, and we can also see what was not done externally.  So from 2006 to 2016, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was either shut out or not informed.  Right through 2006, we had the incomplete report.  There was the McGee report in 2008.  In 2010, there was the Nolan report.  In 2011, we had a report sent from the internal audit to the Commissioner, which had the paragraph that was removed, which the internal auditor says he removed.  In 2015, we had information and correspondence as well.  From 2006, right up to the establishment of the steering group, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was still not informed.  The Committee of Public Accounts was not informed.  That is the reality and what we are dealing with.</p> <p>  We had the heads of departments, who are mainly civilian heads, in a number of weeks ago.  Mr. Barrett and Mr. Kelly were of the view that the internal audit was frustrated in this work and that all of this was about dealing with these issues internally, keeping issues from the purview of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, and internal audit being frustrated in seeking documentation and being able to do its work.  That is what they said, and it chimes with the fact that these bodies were not informed.  That is where we are and that is the reality.  We are now at the stage where we have middle management in the Garda training college, and people who had roles there, and also others who still cannot help us.  They still cannot help me, and I do not know about the Cathaoirleach, but they still cannot help us to establish why the information was not given to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Not one person in the room today has been able to say to me, "This is why there was a blockage and why it never happened".  We know information went up as far as the Commissioner in 2008 and in 2010, twice, where a Commissioner said information should be given to the Comptroller and Auditor General, and it was not done.</p> <p>  Can Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in understand my frustration with all of that?  Can he understand that is where we are, and would he accept that is where we are as a starting point?</p></speech>

I would go back to the point that I made a few minutes ago.  All of those are missed opportunities.  It should have happened.  That is my firm belief.</p></speech>

We know they were missed opportunities.  This is not just about moving on.  We have to understand why it did not happen, because one of the things that the Garda Commissioner was clear about when she was in was that there has to be accountability and transparency.  When there were breakdowns in communication, if people did not do their jobs, it had to be noted, accepted and acknowledged.  My point is that not one single person, from any of the heads of departments who were in to anybody sitting across from me today, has acknowledged a failure on their part.  I stand corrected if anybody in the room is prepared to accept any failure, but so far, nobody has.  We will have the Commissioner in next week.  We may have to bring former Commissioners in at some point, but nobody has accepted, up to this point, that any of the mistakes that were made were on their watch or under the auspices of the offices they held.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in accept that, and does he understand how that is difficult for me?</p></speech>

That was his view.  Mr. Dunne received a note from the head of human resources stating that, from his perspective, he believed, potentially or otherwise, that accounts were compromised.  Surely Mr. Dunne would have had a responsibility then to bring that information to the internal audit committee.

It is a view of Mr. Barrett, but every single time that somebody flags that something should be done, that there are either compromised accounts, or that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be informed, or that the Department of Justice and Equality should be informed, and it is not done, people point to somebody else.  I am putting it to Mr. Dunne that Mr. Barrett presented him with a report, and Mr. Dunne is the chief administration officer, and he is well-paid to do his job - as we heard this morning - and he has responsibilities in his role.  He was made aware by the head of human resources that, in his view, accounts were potentially compromised.  Is Mr. Dunne aware of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005?

It states:</p><blockquote>(1) The audit committee shall-(a) advise the Garda Commissioner on financial matters relating to his or her functions...(2) The audit committee&rsquo;s duties under subsection (1)(a) include advising on the following matters:(a) the proper implementation of Government guidelines on financial issues;<br /><br />(b) compliance with section 22 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 , section 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993... <br /><br />(c) the appropriateness, efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s procedures relating to...<blockquote>(ii) seeking sanction for expenditure and complying with that sanction,<br /><br />(iii) acquiring, keeping custody of and disposing of assets,<br /><br />(iv) risk management,<br /><br />(v) financial reporting, and</blockquote></blockquote> <p>That makes it very clear that internal audit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a very specific duty.  The section goes on to say there should be a report to the Commissioner.  For internal audit to be able to report to the Commissioner, it needs to get information.  That makes it all the more troubling, with respect to Mr. Dunne, that internal audit would not have got information when it should have got information.  It is also troubling because internal audit would then have had a responsibility to pass on information to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, which we also know did not happen until 2016.</p></speech>

In order that the witnesses will know, I have asked that the Comptroller and Auditor General's office would furnish this committee with a report on what exactly were the obligations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in regard to compliance with its Act and also with reporting to its office.  I am also asking Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in could he, on behalf of the organisation, furnish this committee with a report on what were the roles and responsibilities of individuals within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to report to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office or up to the Commissioner, and then of the Commissioner in regard to reporting to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  That does not seem to be clear.  I can see clear breakdowns either in communication or with people deliberately not doing what they were meant to do, and we will deal with all of that.

We have Mr. Ruane signalling that, from his point of view as head of legal, the Attorney General's office should be advised, and we have Mr. Culhane saying he finds that astonishing.  Again, here is another external organisation, this time the Attorney General's office, and the view again seems to be, "Let us not give it the information, let us not raise this with it as there is no need".

I have been regularly on the record internally in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as saying that if I have two people around the table who have the same view, I only need to have one of them present.

Mr. Gay Harris has also been referenced today.  We have mentioned him previously.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has supplied us with a document from 1989, which suggests that Mr. Harris, who was the professional accountant in the Department at the time, advised the Garda on investments around surplus funds arising from what was the mess committee at the time, which subsequently morphed into the restaurant.

Mr. Barrett told the committee he regards Mr. McGee as a good accountant and that he did his work well.  The report he did is a good report and we all accept that.  Nine years have passed since.  Did Mr. McGee not feel obliged in the interim, before this came to the internal auditor in March 2016, that under a Civil Service code of ethics, for want of a better phrase, to inform the internal auditor, the external auditor, the C&amp;AG or somebody?  Mr. McGee did his job.  I am not blaming him because he did his job.  This is not personal but nothing happened.  We had Mr. Culhane here a couple of weeks ago and he said he did his job, he reported up the line and nothing happened.  I am asking Mr. McGee whether he felt obliged to do something.  The last time he appeared before the committee, Mr. Ruane informed us that the law succeeds everything else as the right thing to do.  As a public servant, that is also how I feel.  Did Mr. McGee not feel obliged under the law and ethics legislation to inform somebody because, as somebody from an accountancy background who was aware of the blue book, he had done this work but nothing had happened?  He was in his position for eight years.  Did he not feel obliged to report it to the C&amp;AG, where he used to work, or to the internal auditor or external audit committee?</p></speech>

Mr. McGee is well aware of all the issues because there is huge similarity between his report and what Mr. Kelly outlined to this committee all these years later.

If Mr. McGee had his time again, does he feel he would have acted differently?  Six, seven and eight years passed and nothing happened.  Mr. McGee knew what was going on here.  He knew the structures that were in place.  He wrote the report.  He was working in an organisation where the structures around accountancy procedures and management of funds simply did not meet the requirements of the time.  Did Mr. McGee not feel obliged to get it out there to the powers that be, either internally or externally, that should know about it?

I take it everybody accepts the findings.</p><p>We had the head of internal audit in here with us two weeks ago and he surprised us with his opening statement's strength and candour.</p><p>He stated:</p><blockquote>I started work in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as head of internal audit ten years ago in June 2007.  At that time and for the next two years approximately, I reported to Deputy Commissioner Fitzgerald, who is mentioned in the report in the context of the Garda Boat Club issue.  From 2009 until his retirement in 2014, I reported to Deputy Commissioner Rice.  It was Deputy Commissioner Rice who stated in a note to the Commissioner on 18 September 2009, &quot;I strongly believe that any surplus money does not belong to the State but rather is owned by the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from whom they were collected and I equally hold that any money cannot be used except for the welfare and development of the facilities for members [of the Garda College]&quot;.</blockquote> <p>He went on to state:</p><blockquote>Deputy Commissioner Rice did not seek my advice in regarding this issue prior to sending his note to the Commissioner in 2009.  Had he done so, I would have pointed out that this was contrary to section C5.19 of the Public Financial Procedures [DPER] &ndash; the blue book - which, under the heading &quot;Exchequer Extra Receipts&quot;, states, &quot;These are receipts that the Department of Finance directs must be credited directly to the Exchequer and cannot be retained by Departments for their own use&quot;.</blockquote> <p>That is completely at odds with what the witnesses have said in respect of their understanding of what those moneys were for.  They state now that they accept the report and its findings and it is completely the opposite of their viewpoint.  That viewpoint is important in terms of whether they see those moneys as being appropriately used and moved from the restaurant account into the Sportsfield account.  Do the witnesses understand the point I am making?</p></speech>

If I can just clarify, the recommendations in the interim audit report are absolutely accepted.  This was a situation that, certainly, I inherited in 2011, and that was the belief.  I am not saying that was right, but it was the belief.  The reality of this situation is that it is extremely unfortunate that these anomalies have arisen in terms of how the money was managed but I suppose the belief was that it was for the entirety of the Garda College experience, if I can put it that way, as opposed to just meals in the restaurant.</p></speech>

Would Ms McMahon accept that there was funding provided by vote of the D&aacute;il to the Garda College for a particular purpose and it was not used for that purpose, irrespective of whether nobody personally gained?</p></speech>

I suppose, to expand on that point a little bit, it would be far better in hindsight if there was another model of funding available to the Garda College.  At this point in time, and certainly in 2017, it is absolutely accepted that better financial controls and better governance should be in place and we are absolutely committed to that.</p></speech>

We know that there have been some changes.  Would Mr. Dunne accept that the accounts are compromised for any of the years that he was CEO?</p></speech>

I certainly accept that there were moneys flowing through An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, particularly in the college, which were not contained in accounts as signed off.  If that amounts to compromise, I accept that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.1530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017061400002#DDD00200"><p>We were told earlier that the accounts cannot be amended, that the accounts are the accounts.  If those accounts are found not to have been correct, then they are compromised.</p><p>In the report he co-authored, Mr. McGee referred to the Garda Sportsfield account.  Mr. Culhane came before the committee last week and it relates to this.  I accept the point Mr. McGee makes that he picked it up at a particular time.  In his report he states, &quot;The method of setting up a company to develop such facilities means that the ability to apply Governmental financial practice is negated.&quot;  Last week, when I asked Mr. Culhane something relating about this matter he said that it was the Sportsfield account, it was a company, and that he did not have control over it.  That is exactly the point.  In his report, Mr. McGee said, &quot;There is no evidence of sanction obtained to set up the company and there are potential negative issues to members from the administration section of the Garda College becoming directors and the regulations and legal obligations that is inferred on directors under the relevant companies' acts&quot;.  There is a significant issue in respect of the Companies Act.  The report goes on to say:</p><blockquote>The decision to transfer such monies would have been sanctioned by management who are acting as administrators for the College Restaurant and also are acting as directors of the Garda Sportsfield Company Ltd.  This is definitely a breach in the financial control ...</blockquote> <p>This was known in 2008.  There were recommendations that would have happened following this report.  Am I correct that Deputy Commissioner McMahon would have been in the college as the former chief superintendent there?</p></speech>

As I told the committee earlier, I had a dual role.  I was stationed in Harcourt Square and I was working in the college as well.</p></speech>

It then went to the CAO.  Arising out of that, the Commissioner was informed and accepted that certain things had to happen.  On that basis it went back down to the college.  The chief superintendent in the college was Mr. Jack Nolan, now retired.  He did his own report.  That is the second report.  He would definitely have been aware of that because it went around.  It went up to the Commissioner and back down again.</p></speech>

One would want to know what one was taking over.  Was any work done prior to the changeover from the Department to the Garda Commissioner - this would probably have been done in the Department - whereby these issues would have been examined in any detail?  We have just heard that the Garda could not even find documentation.  It is probably on a floppy disc somewhere and inaccessible without the relevant machine available to open it.  Was any work done?  If one is being asked to take over responsibility, one would imagine that some hand over of those responsibilities would have gone through some of these issues.</p></speech>

I think that group had an external chair.  I am not aware of any particular details around the hand-over of the Accounting Officer role.  We can see if we can identify any records in relation to that.  We have not identified any so far.</p></speech>

The most senior would have been the CAO, that arose out of that Act, as did the director of finance and the internal audit section.  All of those were put in to support the then Commissioner in the role and function as Accounting Officer.  I am not aware of the steering group part but, legislatively, a support structure was put in place.  From my reading of the whole file, it was Mr. Leamy, in his role as chief administrative officer, the first that we had, who was the first to point to the issues and that was probably as part of the transition that those things were picked up.</p></speech>

That email suggests to me that he had had a conversation with Mr. Barrett and because he is clearly a person of some critical skills he had figured out that the game here was to deal with this quietly.  For the purposes of the record, this email was written in 2015.  Mr. McGee had produced his report in 2008.  He had joined the dots because he is smart.  He had figured that the game here was to keep this quiet - no reputational damage, no Comptroller and Auditor General, no Committee of Public Accounts, no hassle, no aggro, keep quiet.  That is what this says to me.</p></speech>

He is clearly giving a view in terms of disclosure of information that he came across in the discharge of his duties in the compilation of a report and in the manner in which that report is processed or not processed over a period of seven years.  I do not accept his interpretation, but fair enough if the witness wants to put it on the record.  In the email to Mr. Barrett, he went on to say that the report was quite sensitive.  There is a typo there, by the way.  It reads "quiet sensitive".  I am terrible for typos.  The witness wrote in the email that Mr. Culhane had said "that if you [Mr. Barrett] wish to meet to discuss this etc might be useful".

Mr. Culhane wrote to the Garda Commissioner, the deputy commissioners and the CAO.  This is the letter in which the Official Secrets Act was quoted.  In it, he recounted the events of 21 October when the witness, Mr. Michael Dodd and Mr. PJ Leonard were having lunch in the restaurant and were joined by Mr. John Barrett and Mr. Alan Mulligan.  During lunch, Mr. Barrett pointedly stated that he wanted a private meeting with Mr. McGee,, which was held in his office for about 15 minutes.  I have no doubt that all of that happened.  What is also clear is that Mr. McGee went back to Mr. Culhane and faithfully rehearsed everything that Mr. Barrett had raised with him.  How do I know this?  I know this because Mr. Culhane very helpfully itemises it Nos. 1 to 6 in this correspondence.  It seems very clear that the witness said that he had a particular kind of conversation.  According to the letter, he told Mr. Culhane at this point that Mr. Barrett had told him that his job was safe and that Mr. Barrett regarded him almost as a whistleblower etc.  It is in the correspondence.</p></speech>

We have covered sufficient ground today.  During the course of the meeting I received an email from someone who has been watching the proceedings closely.  It touched on a question I asked earlier but on which I am still not clear.  It asked what the stipend was for and why the trainees were charged an additional amount for canteen and laundry services from their weekly allowance.  I asked if some of the money had come from students, but I was told "No".  However, there seems to be a view which I picked up in the media somewhere that they were paying some contribution out of their salary or wages for laundry services.  Is that true or false?  I am referring to the students.</p></speech>

They are present for a review of corporation tax receipts for 2015 and an examination of the stability of the corporation tax base.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind witnesses and members to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the recording and broadcasting of the meeting.  I bring to the attention of witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence that they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected to the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on or criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. John McCarthy of the Department of Finance to make his opening submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.1767" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017061400002#F00300"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to present the Department's views on the sustainability of corporate tax receipts.  I am accompanied by John Palmer, the principal officer leading the fiscal team in the Department, and R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession, from the business tax team.  By way of background, in 2015 corporate tax receipts rose by nearly &euro;2.3 billion, a 50% increase.  Figures from the national accounts - GDP, GNP and so forth - show an increase in the corporate tax base, that is, corporate profitability, of a similar magnitude that year.  Even after allowing for depreciation, so-called net operating surplus rose by over 30% that year.  On this basis, it would appear the increase in corporate tax receipts was a one-off level change or a step change in the level of receipts.  In 2016, receipts rose by a more modest 7%.</p> <p>  As a result of these developments, corporate tax receipts in 2016 accounted for just under 16% of total receipts while the long run average is around 14%, which can be seen in figure 2.  Figure 2 also shows that between 2007 and 2014 corporate tax receipts as a share of total tax revenue fell, in part as a result of SMEs carrying forward previously accumulated losses.  In addition, parts of the domestic financial sector which had previously been large payers of corporation tax recorded significant losses during this period.  One factor behind the large increase in receipts would appear to be the increased liability arising from the fact that losses accumulated during the crisis are now being exhausted.  In 2015, for instance, there were nearly 8,000 companies paying corporate tax that had no corporate tax liability the previous year.  Mr. Keith Walsh will go into more detail on this shortly.  These firms accounted for around &euro;200 million in additional revenue that year.</p> <p>  On the concentration ratio, which can be seen in figure 3, the concentration of corporate tax receipts in a relatively small number of sectors and firms is, as always, a concern.  The dominance of the multinational sector in our national accounts has been well documented but figures produced by the Revenue Commissioners show the dominance of large firms in corporate tax receipts also.  Last year, the top ten payers accounted for 30% of total corporate tax receipts.  The Department has consistently highlighted this concentration as a risk in recent years.</p><p> In terms of the policy response, as the committee knows a key policy failure during the bubble period was to increase expenditure and reduce direct taxation on the basis of revenues that ultimately proved transitory.  While it is probable that these corporation tax receipts are not transitory, it is prudent to adopt a cautious approach.  In this regard, the role of the co-called expenditure benchmark, which is used in the fiscal rules, is crucial in that it reduces the probability that windfall tax receipts are used to finance expenditure.  It is based on trend revenue growth over a ten year timeframe.  Second, it is crucial that the medium-term objective of a balanced budget in structural terms is achieved next year.  Finally, it is important to build up fiscal safety buffers.  Targeting a debt to GDP ratio of 45% from the mid-part of the next decade, growth permitting, is an important part of this, as is the so-called rainy day fund which is to be established from 2019 on, that is, once the budget is balanced in structural terms.  These policy issues are currently under review and updates will likely be provided in the forthcoming summer economic statement.</p><p> Finally, it is important from a policy perspective to have a greater understanding regarding the sustainability of corporate tax receipts.  In this regard, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has asked Mr. Seamus Coffey, chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, to undertake a review of the sustainability of such receipts.  The report is due to be submitted to the Minister at the end of this month.</p></speech>

I understand from that letter that the committee wishes to engage specifically on a review of corporation tax receipts for 2015 and an examination of the stability of the corporation tax base.</p> <p>  The committee will appreciate the role of the Revenue Commissioners in these matters.  As the tax administration in the State, the Revenue Commissioners collect taxes and duties, including corporation tax.  The Revenue Commissioners, therefore, have access to, and are able to provide, statistical information and analysis of corporation tax returns and receipts.  Corporation tax receipts have been in focus over the past couple of years, particularly as a result of the 49% spike in net corporation tax receipts in 2015.  In a bid to facilitate a better understanding of the increase, the Revenue Commissioners published a paper last year analysing receipts in 2014-15.  That analysis was based on a review of available tax return and payment data.</p> <p>  Members will recall that when I appeared before the committee previously, members asked us to revert to it in respect of 2015 specifically.  This year, at the time of the recent publication of its 2016 annual report, the Revenue Commissioners published a research paper containing an analysis of 2015 corporation tax returns and corporation tax payments made in 2016.  The analysis for 2015 is based on a review of corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in the calendar year 2015, the majority of which were filed towards the end of 2016.  It provides some insights into the significant increase in corporation tax receipts in 2015.  While returns for 2016 are not yet available, the paper contains an initial analysis of the trends in corporation tax payments for 2016.  I understand that members of the committee may have seen a copy of this research paper.  My colleague, Mr. Keith Walsh, who is a principal officer in the Revenue Commissioners economics and statistics branch, is here today and will shortly give members a presentation on the main findings from that research and analysis.</p> <p>  By way of brief introduction to the presentation, the Revenue Commissioners' review of corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2015 revealed that a number of factors contributed to the significant increase in corporation tax receipts in 2015.  The principal factor is an increase in trading profits across nearly all sectors.  The paper also reveals that, although to a lesser extent than in 2015, a substantial portion of corporation tax receipts were concentrated in a relatively small number of large corporate taxpayers in 2016.</p><p>Some 37% of total corporation tax receipts were paid by the ten largest companies in 2016 as compared to 41% in 2015.  More than 80% of total corporation tax receipts in 2016 came from large companies dealt with by Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division.</p><p> In addition to Keith Walsh, I am also joined by Ms Jeanette Doonan and Ms &Aacute;ine Hollingsworth, who are both principal officers dealing with business taxes policy and legislation within Revenue.  Mr. Walsh will now make a presentation to the committee.  We will be happy to address any questions the committee might have in regard to the presentation.  While we will gladly provide whatever assistance we can to the committee in regard to its deliberations on this matter, members will appreciate that Revenue is constrained by law, specifically by section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, from discussing the tax affairs of any taxpayer on confidentiality grounds.  This includes providing any information that might lead to the identification of any taxpayer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.1772" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Keith Walsh" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017061400002#H00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee .  As Mr. Howard indicated, in the past two years, we published two papers on corporation tax receipts.  My presentation will summarise these papers focusing on information from tax returns in 2015 and I will also highlight key trends from receipts in 2016.</p> <p>  Before proceeding, I will briefly outline the timing of tax returns and receipts to explain why we are focusing on 2015 in this presentation.  The timing of a company's corporation tax payments depends on when its accounting period ends, and whether it is considered a large or a small company.  A large company is one which had a corporation tax liability of &euro;200,000 or more in the previous accounting period for these purposes.  As shown in the chart, a large company with a 12-month accounting period ending on 31 December 2015 made its first preliminary tax payment in June 2015, that is, six months into its accounting period.  The company made a second preliminary tax payment in November 2015, some 11 months into the accounting period.  The CT1, which is the tax return for the accounting period, was then due to be filed in the ninth month after the end of the accounting period - September 2016 in this example.  Along with this return, the company must also make a final corporation tax payment.  This means that returns for 2015 were due to be filed by September 2016.  With late returns and the time required for processing of data, comprehensive information from these returns is only available for our analysis from early 2017 onwards.  We used this data in our report on 2015 returns in April 2017 and we are continuing to update and publish our statistics for 2015 across a range of other topics.</p> <p>  As indicated by both Mr. Palmer and Mr. Howard, net corporation tax receipts in 2015 were &euro;6.87 billion, more than &euro;2.2 billion higher than 2014.  Net corporation tax receipts in the 2016 were &euro;7.4 billion, an increase of &euro;500 million.  Net receipts are after refunds or repayments.  As shown in the chart, our analysis finds an increase in trading profits to be the largest factor underpinning the growth in corporation tax receipts in 2015.  This increase is attributed to a combination of improved trading conditions and increases of productive capital stock in Ireland.  The growth in trading profits between 2014 and 2015 returns is more than &euro;46 billion or a 49% increase.  Almost all economic sectors exhibit higher trading profits indicating a broad base for the increase.  More than 90% of the trading profits, that is, &euro;129 billion, are attributed to the largest five sectors as shown in the chart; the remaining 16 sectors account for the other 10%.  The manufacturing sector is the largest sector accounting for two-fifths of the trading profits.  The largest subsectors within manufacturing are pharmaceutical and medical device products.  The &euro;46 billion increase in profits in returns for 2015 is the primary factor behind the increase of &euro;2.2 billion in corporation tax in 2015.  It important to be aware, though, that a company may reduce its profits by claiming capital allowances in respect of certain expenditure.  These allowances are the tax equivalent of the accounting depreciation of an asset.</p><p> The value of plant and machinery capital allowances claimed increased by &euro;27 billion to almost &euro;50 billion in 2015.  Again, that is shown on the chart.  Subject to certain conditions, capital allowances may be claimed on intangible assets.  The most common examples of such assets that might qualify for allowances are patents, trademarks and copyrights.  The increase in the value of intangible asset capital allowances was over &euro;26 billion in 2015.  This accounted for almost all of the increase of &euro;27 billion.  These intangible capital allowances are restricted so that they may only be offset against trading income generated from the use of those intangible assets.</p><p> Aside from increases in trade profits, other factors helped to bring about the increase in corporation tax receipts in 2015 and 2016.  One of those factors was non-trading profits.  As Deputies are probably aware, a higher corporation tax rate of 25% applies to non-trading profits.  As shown in the chart, the value of non-trading profits reported in the 2015 returns was approximately 19% lower than the previous year.  This equated to a decrease of &euro;462 million.  With the return to growth, the number of companies paying tax has increased.  This is making a significant contribution to higher tax receipts.  The number of companies paying corporation tax increased from 35,700 in 2014 to 39,900 in 2015 and 44,100 in 2016, representing increases of 12% and 11%, respectively, in those years.  The corporation tax receipts from cases not previously paying tax were &euro;470 million in 2015 and &euro;345 million in 2016.  Companies newly paying tax are generally new businesses, start-up businesses or businesses returning to a profit-making position.</p><p> The losses incurred by companies can be used to offset their corporation tax liabilities.  During the recession, many companies accumulated large trading losses.  If full effect cannot be given to given to the amount of a trading loss in a particular period, whether to the company itself or to other companies in the group through group relief provisions, it can be carried forward indefinitely.  Approximately 26,900 companies did not pay, or reduced their tax due, for 2015 because of trading losses.  The value of trading losses carried forward claimed on 2015 returns indicates that certain companies are returning to profitability, utilising legacy losses and paying corporation tax on their trading income once their losses have been exhausted.  Furthermore, the aggregate value of losses has not increased as much as in previous years.  As Mr. McCarthy noted, improved trading conditions have led to companies exhausting their losses forward.  This can be seen in the 8,000 companies that carried losses into 2014 but indicated no losses carried into their 2015 returns.  This indicates that companies which returned to profitability contributed approximately &euro;203 million in corporation tax in 2015.</p><p> The total value of losses still being carried forward in 2015 was &euro;209 billion.  An examination of the companies carrying forward losses shows that approximately &euro;40 billion of the losses carried forward into 2015 involved claims made by companies that were in liquidation or were otherwise unlikely to be in a position ever to use these losses.  Most of these companies are in the financial services sector.</p><p> While capital gains is not a significant factor when explaining the increase in corporation tax receipts, it should be noted that capital gains on the disposal of assets increased receipts by approximately &euro;110 million in 2015.  Companies, like individuals, pay capital gains tax where a capital gain is realised on the disposal of an asset.  In most instances, companies pay their capital gains liabilities as part of their corporation tax liabilities and this is classified as corporation tax in net receipts figures.  The number of companies reporting capital gains increased by approximately 19% to 1,080 in 2015.  The value of the gains reported by those companies increased by 57%.</p><p> Companies that engage in certain qualifying research and development activities are entitled to claim a tax credit on the expense incurred.  The Exchequer cost of the research and development tax credit in 2015 was &euro;708 million, which represented an increase of &euro;155 million on the previous year.  While the value of the claims increased, the number of companies claiming the credit decreased by approximately 2.5% from 1,570 in 2014 to 1,532 in 2015.  This is indicated on the graph on the screen.</p><p> Revenue's large cases division is responsible for managing the tax affairs of the largest taxpayers in the State, including multinational companies.  While net receipts from companies dealt with by the large cases division have grown, they have remained relatively stable as a percentage of total corporation tax receipts.  The proportion of corporation tax receipts coming from such companies increased from 80% in 2014 to 80.5% in 2015 and 82.1% in 2016.</p><p>It is notable that in 2015 the &euro;2.2 billion increase in corporation tax receipts is, as noted previously, roughly split 80:20 in favour of large-case division versus non-large-case division companies.  As non-LCD companies contribute approximately 20% of corporation tax receipts, this is another indicator of the broad-based nature of the increase in receipts.  However, it should be noted that in 2015 the increase in receipts is primarily from LCD companies.</p><p> Another measure that Revenue tracks and analyses - this was mentioned by my colleagues in their statements already - is the contribution of the top ten payers annually as an indicator of the concentration of corporation tax receipts.  In the past decade, the top ten payers in any given year have paid somewhere between 16%, as was the case in 2007, and 41%, as in 2015, of total corporation tax.  Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Howard have noted how the proportion of tax paid by the top ten companies in 2016 declined slightly by four percentage points to 37%.</p><p> Corporate entities also contribute to the Exchequer by collecting and remitting payroll taxation on behalf of their employees.  Companies in a positive gross corporation tax position, that is to say, companies paying corporation tax, accounted for 1.2 million employments in the State in 2015.  Over &euro;11 billion is paid on behalf of those employees in respect of PAYE, USC and PRSI based on incomes earned over &euro;31 billion.  Let us consider foreign-owned companies separately.  Foreign owned companies account for 28% of employments by companies, 39% of incomes earned by their employees and 45% of tax paid.</p><p> It is useful to look at corporation tax in an international context, as shown in the chart on the screen.  Ireland's headline rate of 12.5% is still among the lowest of OECD countries.  Notwithstanding this fact, the proportion of corporation tax receipts relative to GDP in Ireland was equal to the average of OECD countries at 2.7% in 2015.  Although Ireland's corporation tax receipts increased in 2015 and 2016, the increase was not out of line with economic growth in the year.  Indeed, the two are closely linked.  As in the OECD comparison in the chart on the screen, the figures are within the range one might expect.</p><p> Revenue continues to work with the Department of Finance on forecasts of tax receipts for 2017 and future years.  The June 2017 collection will be key to getting an indication of whether corporation tax receipts are likely to meet the target this year.  Based on current information on performance to date in 2017 and indications picked up from the contacts of our large cases division with large companies, we expect corporation tax receipts to be broadly on target this year.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte mh&oacute;r roimh chuile dhuine a th&aacute;inig anseo inniu.</p> <p>  I will begin with a question for Mr. McCarthy.  Given the concentration of corporation tax receipts and the level of corporation tax receipts and the measures we have in place, does Mr. McCarthy believe that we are adopting a prudent position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.1777" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017061400002#K00400"><p>I think the concentration of tax receipts is a wider issue.  We have a massive concentration of economic activity in Ireland.  Let me put some figures on that.  A total of 50 firms account for something like four fifths of industrial turnover in Ireland.  The top five firms account for something like 36% or 37% of total exports.  What we have in Ireland is a small economy but a huge dominance by the multinational sector in terms of overall economic activity, exports and so on.  The point I made in the presentation was that is now reflected in the concentration of corporation tax receipts.  It is an exposure.  That is not to say having these large firms is a bad thing.  Obviously, they are big employers and so forth.  Nonetheless, it is an exposure.</p> <p>  I believe we have to be prudent.  This is why I drew the attention of the committee to the need to do the following: achieve a balanced budget by 2018, as is Government policy; establish a rainy day fund, which is the current policy; and go with a debt ratio that is below the requirement of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Those measures will help to mitigate any adverse outcome that we might see from the concentration.</p><p>To answer the Deputy's question directly, we are being sufficiently prudent.</p></speech>

I refer to the rainy day fund, which I understand is gone, and a reduction in the debt to GDP ratio to 55%.</p></speech>

We will see what his or her position will be on these matters.  I have my own position on the rainy day fund.  I thought it was never going to fly.  The debt to GDP ratio is a debate that, in my view, is more about headlines.  I do not think we will reach the 60% figure that is part of the EU rules until 2022 at the earliest.  It is unlikely that any Taoiseach or Minister for Finance would be in a position during that time to decide whether the figure should be 55%, 45% or whatever.  If two of the three policy positions were to go, would we still follow a prudent fiscal approach given the level of concentration of corporation tax receipts?</p></speech>

If he has not, I encourage him to read it.  It is called the Annual Report on Public Debt in Ireland.  It is a Department publication rather than a political publication, written by me and my colleagues.  In it, we argue that 45% is an appropriate target, given the distortions in GDP.  The Fiscal Advisory Council has said that 45% is not low enough and I am aware that some others have said it is too low.  The Department is caught in the middle.  We think green is the new black and so forth.  We think a target of 45% is the equivalent of 60% for other countries, given the distortions in respect of GDP.</p> <p>  We referred to one figure in the report, which refers to a metric of which the Deputy will be aware, namely GNI*, which the CSO will publish in July in the national accounts.  On our best estimates, debt to GNI* will probably exceed 100% when the figure is published. </p> <p>  I do not buy into the idea that just because the debt to GDP ratio is now down to 75% the debt issue has been resolved.  Public debt should remain a priority.  If we are looking at it on a GDP basis, which we are required to do under our legal obligations, the Department has said in the publication that 45% is the prudent target.</p></speech>

As explosive as the figure is that 37% of our tax receipts, which is nearly &euro;3 billion, is dependent on the decisions of ten chief executive officers, CEOs, the reality is that it could be five CEOs, for  example, if two of these companies in the top ten were part of the same group, whether it be Mitsubishi, AIB, Bank of Ireland or Apple, it does not matter which they are.</p></speech>

It flows from the national reform programme of the EU, which called for measures to be carried out, notably in 2017, to reach the goal.  That was regarding the fact that the Commission is of the view that we are in breach, I presume, of the expenditure benchmark given the retrospective application of a policy position on which the Department is now in discussions with the Commission with a view to trying to resolve this matter.  Can Mr. McCarthy confirm to me that discussions on that took place with the Commission before it published the report?  The report calls for action to be taken in 2017, and I want Mr. McCarthy to explain to the committee what that means.  Does that mean a mini-budget or an adjustment?  I ask him to explain to us what is going on as clear as possible and how the Commission has viewed that we are now in a significant breach of the expenditure benchmark that would require us to carry out that type of adjustment this year.</p></speech>

We have been discussing some of the issues with the Commission for some time.  The discussions mainly revolve around the treatment of one-offs within the expenditure benchmark.  There has been a change in the way those are treated, with one-offs now essentially excluded.  There is a strong economic logic for that in the same way that they are excluded from the structural balance.  However, we have consistently argued, and I believe the law is on our side, that the rules cannot be changed retrospectively.  There have been a number of one-offs, for instance, that have allowed us to calculate fiscal space and maybe increase it a little, the best example being the treatment of-----</p></speech>

We dispute that with the Commission.  The Commission has not said action is needed.  All it has said is that there is a risk of a significant deviation and that we should take action to make sure that this risk does not materialise, so to speak.</p><p>Once one allows for one-offs, we believe we will win the argument considering that, on a multilateral basis with all member states, there is support for the Irish view on the treatment of one-offs.  At the European semester discussions which took place last week and the week before, it was agreed that we would discuss the matter further with the Commission on a bilateral basis.  As I believe there is support for us, I strongly suspect that we will win the argument.</p></speech>

That view can be parked because it is disputed by the Department and the Government.  The point Mr. McCarthy has made here, however, is that the Commission did not call for an adjustment.  It has called for one.  Let us consider the outcome if the Department loses the argument, into which it entered before the Commission published the report.  Obviously, the Commission believed it was on strong enough ground to make its statement, which is quite significant.  It stated we were in breach of the fiscal rules but that the deviation was not significant enough.  However, it is now sufficiently significant to demand that measures be taken in 2017.  It is important, therefore, that the committee understand the magnitude of what could potentially be playing out.  The transaction in 2015 benefited the Government in complying with the expenditure benchmark.  If in late December it had not come in, we would have breached the rules that year, but it is now coming back to bite us quite hard.  If the Department is unable to convince the Commission on how it is dealing with the one-offs and dealing with them retrospectively, what will it mean for the budgetary position in 2017 and the baseline against which we will measure budget 2018?</p></speech>

It did not state there had been one.  Based on our figures, we believe we are fine, even leaving aside the one-offs.  There are other one-offs such as the EU budget contribution and so forth.  We have a perennial discussion with the Commission about discretionary tax measures, essentially the non-indexation of tax bands and credits.  Once we achieve the MTO next year, we will have done what is required.  Even if there is a deviation, it underlines the importance of getting there.  On the basis of the Commission's numbers, we will achieve a structural deficit of minus 0.3% next year.  Our own calculations indicate that it will be minus 0.5%.  Therefore, there is significant headroom built into our numbers.  In this context, it is important that we achieve the MTO next year.</p> <p>  To go into the actual legal text and so forth, if a member state is found to have deviated from the adjustment path towards the MTO, there are a number of legal steps that will take place.  It will be required to produce a corrective action plan, for instance.  That was launched for the first time last month - May - for Romania.  Essentially, it involves taking additional measures to ensure it will get back on the adjustment path.  If, however, we are at the MTO, we will not need to be on an adjustment path.  That underlines the importance of getting there.</p></speech>

I am not a big fan of the rules, but I just want to understand the position.  For us, the expenditure benchmark, when it kicked in, became a baseline from which we worked in each budget afterwards.  It became a building block.</p><p>Based on the ten-year growth, it allowed us to spend extra.  I say that because there is no guarantee that the MTO will be reached, although hopefully it will.  Is the Government's position that it is forgetting about the expenditure benchmark, just going for the MTO and taking the view that it does not matter if we breach the rules?  If we do not convince the Commission before budget 2018, the baseline for our expenditure benchmark will be recalculated back to a lower position which will impact on the fiscal space that is available in budget 2018.  Is that correct?  Perhaps that is an opportunity for the Department to clarify to the committee the net fiscal space that is there, especially after the latest pay deal which is going to absorb approximately &euro;180 million of the &euro;500 million to &euro;550 million of available fiscal space.</p></speech>

However, I point out that once one has the MTO, one can never be required to overachieve one's MTO.  In other words, if one gets to 0.5% next year, one cannot be told to take an additional 0.2% because one had not done it the year before, which would bring one to 0.3%.  It is crystal clear that one can never be required to do that.  Mr. Palmer has a couple of points he wants to make in reply to the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Deputy is talking about budget 2018 but the regulation is very clear that one can only get a warning of a significant deviation if it is an observed significant deviation.  That is why the warning issued to Romania in May relates to last year.  If we were to be found to have significantly deviated in respect of 2017, they could only do it next May when they have had the EDP returns at the end of March from the CSO and when they have had the stability programme update from ourselves at the end of April.  In terms of timing, this would not be an issue for budget 2018 no matter what.  If they then find we have a significantly observed deviation, we are into the process Mr. McCarthy outlined.  We get a warning, a recommendation of the steps to take to correct it and then separately under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the Minister for Finance and the Government is required to prepare a corrective action plan and present it to the D&aacute;il within two months of the warning.  That plan has to take on board any recommendation from the Council.  If we are on course to hit the MTO in 2018, they cannot give us recommendations to overachieve it.  It is slightly messy in terms of timing and so forth, but we have to proceed the way we do.</p></speech>

We see it as still &euro;1.8 billion in gross terms of which &euro;600 million is already allocated for demographic factors, leaving a net &euro;1.2 billion in fiscal space.  There are then carryover effects and the ballpark is about &euro;500 million on the expenditure side and just under &euro;200 million on the Revenue side.  There is a net &euro;500 million.  Deputy Doherty asked why we said it was &euro;200 million at the presentation to the pay talks.  That was on the current side.  The &euro;180 million that is then absorbed by the new pay deal will eat into that.  We will produce new estimates of fiscal space in the summer economic statement either next week or the week after.</p></speech>

A key concern we have is the sustainability of corporation tax receipts in being able to frame upcoming budgets.  I will focus on three points, namely, the 2015 figures, the issue of trading losses and the cost of research and development tax credits.  On 2015 and Mr. Walsh's presentation, the huge jump in capital allowances claimed in 2015 relates to levels of profits as IP was moved back into our State.</p><p>Is that the actual relationship?  Is that what happened?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.1851" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Howard" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017061400002#Q00200"><p>We might explain how IP works in general.  Again, we are careful about what we say about these things.  If we take a typical company that manufactures a high-end product in Ireland that uses IP - this is nothing uncommon because it goes on all over the world - we can see that the company can get its IP by either purchasing it, creating it or renting it through a royalty from somebody else.  In 2015, if a company was renting it and paying a royalty for it, obviously, its profits would be smaller because it would have been coming out of its trading profit but if the company was claiming it as a capital allowance, its trading profits will be there and the company will be getting it from those trading profits.  That is probably what the Deputy is seeing reflected in the 2015 accounts.  In general, there are two ways a company can do it.  It can either rent and pay a royalty for the IP from abroad or outside the company or it can purchase it and claim a capital allowance.</p></speech>

Will we have the net data in early 2018 so that Mr. Walsh could do a similar analysis?  Must we wait until then to know what is happening in respect of the overall picture regarding capital allowances and so on?</p></speech>

When I was here before the committee, I explained that there was a delay between when the taxes are paid, when the accounts for the company are prepared and when it submits its corporation tax computations to Revenue so we will start to get the details in the first three months of 2018.  We would expect that the same trend would continue and that there will be capital allowances for IP going on into the future.</p></speech>

As Mr. Walsh has said, the receipts for this year are rolling on ahead so it would appear that this would be the position.  This type of relationship with IP is a common regime throughout the world so there are many other jurisdictions such as France and the US where people either pay royalties or get capital allowances.</p></speech>

What is the general trend here?  It is an enormous figure relative to the actual take in corporation tax.</p></speech>

If a company makes a loss in a year, it is entitled to set it sideways against its own profits - it might have deposit interest relating to trading loss - and claim group relief so that if there were other companies in the group that were profitable, it could set it off against those companies' profits in the particular year, or carry it forward and set it off against future profits.  What we are seeing there in general are losses that are available for carrying forward.  As my colleague said, we estimate that about &euro;160 billion will be utilised over some period of time.</p></speech>

One is talking about the research and development tax credit, relief for losses and then a relatively minor relief in terms of three-year start-up relief, which, I understand, is approximately &euro;40 million.</p> <p>  The research and development tax credit has been increasing.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has given a further, more recent figure, which is &euro;708 million for 2015.  At budget time, we published our review which looked at the increase in cost, trying to get an understanding of what was the profile of companies involved.  It also looked at the bang for buck, that is, what extra research and development one is getting for this and to what extent is it additional or not.  The results were that the so-called additionality is 60%.  In other words, of the extra research and development, 60% would not have happened without the research and development tax credit and the bang for buck was 2.4, that is, every time one spent &euro;1 on the research and development tax credit one gets &euro;2.40 in extra research and development.</p> <p>  The figures show that the number of claimants have plateaued at approximately 1,500 for the past number of years.  Bear in mind, the cost of the credit reflects the amount of research and development being done out there, one gets a 25% credit, and the amount of research and development in the system is, therefore, four times what the credit costs.  The tax credit has real substance.  It is defined by reference to international standards in research and development, but we do watch it closely.  We do not have that many reliefs.  We have quite a small number of reliefs on the corporation tax side.</p> <p>  At budget time we published quite a detailed report which shows the profile.  Some of the older, larger foreign companies still avail of it.  That is not all that surprising when we look at the profile of companies engaged in research and development and the broader figures on the business expenditure on research and development, BERD.</p> <p>  It has increased and we do watch it closely.  We published a review in 2013 and last year's review was our second quite deep dive into that area.  We have an approach to tax expenditures in the Department where everything is on a cycle of three years and we will look at issues sooner if we feel there is a policy reason to do so.  One of the lessons from the 2000s was not to leave tax expenditures in the system without being fundamentally looked at on a periodic basis and we do that on a three-year cycle.  We had a look at it last year, 2013 was the previous one and we will continue to watch it.</p></speech>

Maybe they could give me the average.  They give the increase in trading profits by sector in 2015, all of which, interestingly, are up significantly.  There was an incredible increase in profits, of 5% in health and social work, 10% in transportation, and right up to 110% in manufacturing, if I read that correctly.</p><p>An extraordinary leap in profits is taking place, far in excess of, for example, what workers are getting in wage increases or increases in public spending.  It is critically important that we know how much all of that is.</p></speech>

We are only receiving returns for 2016 during the course of 2017.  Those returns will not be available to us for analysis purposes in a complete and comprehensive form until early 2018.  That is why, at the moment, the most recent year we have is 2015 data.  We would like more recent information ourselves for analysis, but the tax returns simply are not due to be filed on a timing basis that would allow that.</p> <p>  On the information included in the paper versus what is not in the paper, it is important to bear in mind that we tried to bring this paper out as quickly as we could.  We tried to do the analysis, in some cases on provisional data, and we published the paper in April.  What we always do at this time of year is publish a series of more detailed data tables that provide much more information and more breakdowns of corporation tax, the breakdown of companies by the income earned, the reliefs, and the breakdown of different reliefs by income earned.  We have much more information that is publicly available.  It is on our website.  We have no problem with providing the committee with links to where that can be found if there is a difficulty in accessing it.</p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's particular comment on trading profits, he is correct in his interpretation.  As he knows, table 2 in the paper shows the trading profits by sector in 2015 and 2014.  The year 2015 is the most recent we have.  It shows the percentage and absolute increases in trading profits between those two years.  I am not sure if it is in the paper, but I think the Deputy mentioned non-trading profits as well.  Non-trading profits in 2014 were &euro;2.45 billion - &euro;2.5 billion, basically.</p></speech>

The compensation of employees is the wage bill.</p><p>Employment rose by 10% or 12% which will also feed into the wage bill.  The number of employees is up as well as wages.  The Deputy is absolutely right in his net point about 2015 but not so much about 2016 because trading or total profits were up by 7%.  Compensation of employees was also reasonably strong last year.  Employment growth was about 2.9% and wages about 2%, so 2015 was an anomaly.  There was a big increase in the profit share relative to wages.  In 2016, that gap was not as large.</p></speech>

I do not have an aggregate figure.  I could probably say the hiring wage has fallen a little bit.

I said in my opening statement that profits were up by 7%.  Employment rose by 2.9%.  We do not have figures for earnings <i>per capita</i>yet.  They will be published in the national accounts in July and will probably run at somewhere between 2% and 2.5%.  Off the top of my head, the wage bill probably rose by between 5% and 5.5% and profits by 7%.  There have been slightly stronger growth rates for profitability.  The point the Deputy is making is correct.  In 2015, profits rose much more.</p></speech>

That is somewhat debatable.  It is certainly the case that the amount of taxable income that can be written off by the allowances that do exist is pretty extraordinary.  Mr. Howard seems to be saying, if I understand it correctly, that many of the companies that account for much of the profits and allowances have moved from writing down their taxable income via paying patent royalties to themselves or other subsidiaries of their group, that is, to themselves, to getting allowances on the basis they have intangible assets which benefit from the machinery and capital allowances.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There are still businesses that continue to pay royalties.  There will also be some businesses that claim capital allowances.  It depends on what decisions are made about whether to claim the costs of the intellectual property they use as a capital investment if they decide they will purchase it and use it as a capital asset or to will continue to pay royalties.  There will still be businesses that are paying that.</p></speech>

The graph provided shows there was an absolutely extraordinary jump from 2014 to 2015; the intangible assets benefiting from the plant and machinery capital allowances jumped from &euro;2.6 billion to &euro;28 billion in one year.

Much of the research and development work is not done in Ireland.  Much of it is done in other countries such as America and France.  If a company wants to use it in its manufacturing process, it pays a royalty to the person who has developed the intellectual property.  There will be real costs in terms of researching and developing a new product and in creating the intellectual property.  Those real costs have to be paid for and they are a cost to the business.  They are no different from any other cost of a business.  The business can either pay the royalty or purchase the rights to that intellectual property outright and then claim a capital allowance against it.</p></speech>

What they actually did is an accountancy exercise where instead of paying themselves royalties they relocated the intellectual property here and instead of avoiding tax by getting the allowance on royalties, they now do not pay tax by getting the allowance on machinery and capital allowances on intangible assets.  That is what they have done.  Let us be absolutely honest.  It is part of the aggressive tax avoidance of these companies.  That is really what it is.</p></speech>

When I was talking about reliefs I was not talking about capital allowances.</p><p>The capital allowances we are talking about are the tax version of depreciation.  Any asset one has will be depreciated in one's accounts according to accounting standards.  The way tax calculations are done means that, rather than recognising this as a depreciation, it is provided as a capital allowance.  Therefore, if one did not have capital allowances, one would effectively be treating the asset at an inflated value above and beyond what is in the accounts.  To explain that point-----</p></speech>

This was part of a sequence of events that caused tremendous reputational damage to the country in terms of leprechaun economics, and the witnesses have only really accounted for &euro;200 million of the surge in the context of companies that were able to use losses previously, yet there was a &euro;2.3 billion surge.  Given the reputational damage done and the fact that the Department scrambled to give an explanation at the time, is there a better sense that the Department will be able to predict future surges?</p><p>We have had this discussion before.  Surely lessons should have been learned from the middle part of the last decade when the Department was not able to predict surges then.  Here we are in a growing economy, in terms of taxation receipts, and we have a very weak explanation for the surge and for the Department's inability to predict it was coming.</p></speech>

My colleagues and I mentioned it in our opening statements.  After we leave aside capital allowances, profitability is up by approximately &euro;20 billion.  If we take a 12.5% effective rate, it works out at &euro;2.5 billion.  If we take a 9.8% effective rate, it is close to &euro;2 billion.  It went up by &euro;2.3 billion.  I have been absolutely clear it is increased profitability.  The increase in the corporate tax base, that is, corporate profitability, drove the increase in corporate tax in 2015.</p> <p>  I also stated it appeared to be a one-off level shift in profitability due to various factors.  I cannot rule out that we could get a one-off or a repeat of that.  This is due to a very small number of companies.  The macroeconomic models which we use, and which are good models, work in normal times, but no one can predict when we might have a small number of companies onshoring intellectual property.  This is company-specific information.  We did not even have it from the Central Statistics Office, through no fault of its own, in its provisional set of accounts.  It is only when it went through the more granular detail, which it does once a year in June and July, that this became available.  We can never predict this will not happen again.  We can never predict it will not be offshored.  The 26 could be -26 if the small number of firms were to bring this IP elsewhere.  I have outlined the reasons for corporation tax.</p></speech>

We are looking at what would be the implications of the Trump proposals, such as they are.  We did not get lot of detail in the announcement.  It was four very brief bullet points on corporation tax reform, including indicating a move to 15%, and sentiment in the US is this would be hard to achieve; a move to a territorial system, and the devil will be in the detail there; and a once-off repatriation, which would not affect our base.  The most significant thing about the Trump tax reform proposals was they did not mention a border adjustment tax.  If this were introduced, it would be a significant re-engineering of the US tax system with implications for everyone.  It was in the original House Republican proposal.  There was speculation it would be included.  Public comments by President Trump, such as they are, have been quite ambivalent about it.  It was interpreted as quite a significant omission from the announcement.</p> <p>  We continue to do our own analysis.  We have met various staffers and other players in the US.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, was there and met the outgoing Secretary of the Treasury, Jack Lew, and members of his team.</p><p>We will continue to do our analysis.  There is a limit to how far we can go with that without seeing the detailed proposals.  In broad terms, it seems unlikely that they would go to 15%.  We think a tax rate cut is a possibility, and probably somewhere in the low 20s is more achievable.  From an Irish point of view, we are not necessarily worried about a tax cut of that order.  With regard to the once-off repatriation, these are US profits and do not affect our base.  If anything, it would clear the air about there being massive profits sitting offshore on the part of American companies and which are awaiting repatriation to the US.</p><p> We have seen some interesting analysis from some of the academics.  Professor Ron Davies at the ESRI, for example, has done some work to show that once-off repatriation or even a rate cut could boost FDI figures.  There was a once-off repatriation in 2004 where the money was brought back at quite low rates, approximately 5.5% compared with the 8.7% or 10% that are talked about now.  The FDI figures for Ireland increased afterwards.  This is not that surprising if one thinks about it from a common sense point of view.  All of a sudden these companies have all this money available to them, so they invest it more or less in the pattern in which they have invested it up to now, which would include an FDI component.  We are alert and watchful then, and we are doing what analysis we can.  When the announcement came out, everyone felt a little bit starved of detail, other than the addition of a border adjustment tax.  We will watch what comes out.  The legislation will be important.</p></speech>

The company is co-operating and we are also getting good co-operation from the commission.  That is ongoing.

I would like to make a comment about the layout and display of the information.  I do not know if it is because this committee is new that the witnesses have invented this presentation especially for it.  I would like to make a suggestion, however, and I also say this to the Acting Chairman and to the secretariat.  It is very unusual to get financial information, certainly even in the public sector, without getting the preceding year's figures for at least one but very often between three and five years beforehand in order that one can see the trends with the current year's outcomes clearly highlighted.  Given that this is the public service, there are also profiles done of the expectations for the current year.  I appreciate Dr. Walsh's point that those figures will not be available until 2018-19.</p><p>It would be very helpful to have last year's figures and a summary of three to five years before that.  With current year figures, we could have the percentage increase or decrease that is represented.  Perhaps a section would need to be in a different colour so as to differentiate the profiles of the various sections.  That would allow us to be a little more grounded, particularly somebody like me.  I find it difficult to follow some of the figures.  The document looks like a Mondrian painting and I congratulate the Revenue Commissioners and whoever drew it up on its attractiveness.  It is very nice.</p></speech>

This is very advanced compared with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the Survey on Income and Living Conditions, SILC, which are pretty much in the dark ages.  It is a survey of 6,000 people one and a half to two and a-half years in arrears.  It means all the data on poverty in Ireland are a minimum of two to three years old at a time when we are coming out of recession.  The witnesses are much better than the CSO, to be honest.  It is a problem for everybody as we are trying to ground where we are.  Perhaps the witnesses might help us in that regard.</p></speech>

For today's presentation, we were asked to focus on 2015, as was pointed out, and the paper we published in April of this year had the main purpose of focusing on increases in 2016 compared with 2015, so there is a bit more information there.  The paper the previous year was also a year-on-year comparison.  We also publish a significant amount of information on our website.  Over the past number of years we have done much work and the Deputy may know we used to produce what was called the Revenue's statistical report.  As the name suggests, this was a paper report that became a PDF report.  It was kind of a once-off document that we published once per year when we had all the data together.  It was a static document.</p> <p>  In the past few years we have moved the report online, where all the data are interactive and more dynamic and we update it more regularly.  What we have online includes much of what the Deputy is seeking, including spreadsheets and PDF documents with trading results, credits information and the cost of various measures to the Exchequer.  It is there over multiple years and for most of our information it is there over a period of five years or so.  Data from earlier years are available.</p> <p>  We have put much effort into trying to put our data out there and making it more open and accessible, as we are encouraged to by the Government's Open Data initiative.  In the past few months we have set up a mailing list so if someone is having difficulty finding our sources, we can subscribe that person to a mailing list and at the end of every month or quarter we send a email indicating we have just published or updated information, with a link to particular tables etc.  We would be happy to add anyone to that.</p></speech>

I know the Revenue Commissioners are pressed for time.  I am just detailing what would be helpful and perhaps we could have it two or three days beforehand.  We are not resourced on this committee and it is brand new.  The amount of information we can get is less than what has been my experience in other committees.  As the committee is in a start-up stage, I am trying to be helpful.</p> <p>  Mr. Howard spoke about the effective rate being close to 10%, if I understood him correctly.  I appreciate this is probably all available.</p><p>The data on page 7 of 8 are about the contributions to employment and employment taxes.  While I have stated to Mr. Howard previously that these data are important and useful, could we have that in comparative tabular form?  Corporation tax is a critical area, and I will comment on that, but the employment content, the investment content and the PAYE, universal social charge, USC, and PRSI contributions, which are &euro;11 billion, are very significant and some comparatives would give us a sense of volume growth or decrease.  However, that is very helpful in understanding the figures.</p><p> When Mr. Howard was before the committee previously, we had a discussion about losses being carried forward.  In various elements of the report there are indications of very significant losses being carried forward.  If I read the report correctly, approximately &euro;2.16 billion of corporation tax was forgone in the year in question as a consequence of the utilisation of losses carried froward.  Mr. Howard told me last year, and I do see an update, that in terms of the value of the losses as opposed to the gross losses, there were accumulated losses of &euro;15 billion, over &euro;9 billion of which was in the financial services sector and approximately &euro;400 million in the construction industry.  I do not have the same comparative figures for today but I would like to see them.</p><p> To deal with the &euro;9 billion in the financial services area, which I believe is under the heading Financial and Insurance Activities - the pink area on the chart on page 3 of 8, I find it odd that the actual contribution in terms of the financial services sector is relatively small.  These are just the trading profits.  I would like to see comparative figures.  I do not know whether the manufacturing is down to construction and so on taking such a great leap forward.  I find it hard to read that particular chart.</p><p> To revert to Mr. McCarthy's earlier comment, we now have a huge number of banking companies coming into enormous profitability.  From those statistics, the two so-called pillar banks, which I believe are each earning profits of over &euro;1 billion a year, have carried forward many losses, therefore, they can choose when they will make any contribution to corporation tax.  In terms of Mr. McCarthy's comments about stability, would it not make much more sense to do a copy of the minimum effective income tax in respect of higher income earners regarding corporations whose profits go above, say, &euro;100 million?  Once they go above that, they would have to pay a minimum effective tax rate, notwithstanding the fact that in Irish law and the law of most other countries it is possible and understandable that people can carry losses forward for various reasons such as to start out again.  </p><p> Mr. McCarthy spoke about stability and the debt ratio, that is another way of approaching stability.  I argued for the introduction of the minimum effective income tax rate for higher earners, and that has been quite successful.  It is one of the reasons that for higher earners other than higher earners who are non-resident for tax purposes in Ireland, their contribution is no longer 0%, 1% or 3% and has started to normalise.  Has any modelling been done on implementing such a minimum rate?  I understand the reason stability, correctly, is an objective.</p><p>Given that the banks are moving into significant profitability, a huge amount of tax will be forgone and postponed over a long period.</p></speech>

With a significant amount of losses, we do not have a provision for a minimum payment.  In terms of the treatment of losses and their being carried forward, we are in line with international practice.</p> <p>  In terms of the financial sector, the Deputy will be aware of the changes made for the pillar banks a number of years ago whereby they were limited in their use of losses.

It is a stream of income which is identified legally in a particular way.  In that sense, it is a different type of stream of income, just as a farmer or a landlord has a stream of income.  The principle underlying it in taxation terms is that it is a stream of income and, as such, it is possible to address potential changes.  From the point of view of this committee, we are looking at the budget going forward.  Mr. McCarthy made a trenchant statement about the debt ratios the Department prefers.  Politically, I am extraordinarily conscious of the fact that this country does not have a proper public transport system.  We have not finished the roads infrastructure.  We need to invest in capital expenditure.  I understand what Mr. Hession is saying about stability and avoiding the risk of another crash.  However, this committee has to give information and opinion on the budgetary process and getting the information cuts to the heart of it so we can then make an observation on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.1979" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017061400002#AA00700"><p>To some extent, the Deputy is drawing me into a policy question so I will be delicate about how I handle it.  My point about it being a profit tax is that it reflects the business cycle.  If we tax the profits, we do not tax the losses.  The losses are offset.  From a stability point of view, it is something companies would expect in the context of their long-term planning.  If they make losses in a given year, they would need certainty that these would be offset against future profits.  Otherwise, we are just taking a point-in-time view of the tax as opposed to recognising that there will be a business cycle.  From the point of view of certainty, that is what companies in Ireland or internationally expect to see.</p> <p>  When there are very large losses in the system, particularly recovering from a financial crisis, it is completely legitimate to have a policy debate about how that should be handled.  It is a policy choice whether the right thing for the country is to let those losses be claimed over a longer period and collect some tax in the meantime or to give companies the ability to use those, as Mr. Howard said, within a group or whatever.  That is a legitimate policy debate.</p> <p>  From my point of view, the use of losses in this way is typical in our comparative jurisdictions.  It reflects the business cycle.  In terms of the international reforms, whether we see them at OECD or EU level, there is no strong preference coming from countries at that table to handle losses differently or to try to push that as an issue.  That is not to say it cannot be discussed in Ireland or that it may not be the right issue for Ireland.  If I were asked about it by the new Minister, my sense would be that there is an orthodoxy to the way we approach it currently which provides certainty to business.  That is a very valuable message in terms of ensuring they know where they stand across the business cycle.  I am not sure if my Revenue colleagues have anything to add.</p></speech>

I am referring to banks and financial institutions, once they start to become reasonably profitable again, producing some taxes in terms of corporation profits tax.</p><p>Mr. Howard might tell us the scale of the build-up of losses and the value of the build-up.

We have figures for this year also and I will go through them.  As at 2015, With regard to financial and insurance activities, in 2015 there were losses of &euro;119 billion.  As my colleague, Mr. Walsh said, we estimate that approximately &euro;40 million will never actually be utilised.  The other figures are: administrative and supportive service activities, approximately &euro;36 billion; information and communication, approximately &euro;10 billion in forward losses; construction, about &euro;9 billion; manufacturing, about &euro;8 billion; transport, about &euro;8 billion; wholesale and retail trade, including the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, &euro;7 billion; and all others, about &euro;10.5 billion.  This gives a total of &euro;280 billion in forward losses as at 31 December 2015.  Of this, we were estimating that at least &euro;40 billion was unlikely to be used.</p></speech>

It would be helpful to us if we could examine the policy options for the budget, bearing in mind Mr. McCarthy's remarks about stability which are very important.  The implication of his remarks is that we will actually be starved of capital investment, unless there is significant development of PPPs off balance sheet, about which EUROSTAT seems to be becoming very doubtful.  It is considering it all again with a Germanic eye.</p></speech>

My concern, however, is about what would arise if we were to try to address them through deficit-financed expenditure which would have been satisfactory when the debt ratio was 25% of GDP, as it was in 2007.  When the debt ratio on a GNI* basis is probably in excess of 100% of GDP, it is appropriate and cautious not to finance capital expenditure through deficit-financed expenditure.  This begs the question as to how it might be addressed.  There is some scope, more within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to shift between current and capital expenditure or to pay up-front through higher taxation, which would be a policy choice.  It would be a bad idea, however, given the existing level of public indebtedness, to try to address it through deficit-financed expenditure.  There are other mechanisms, including through the EIB, as mentioned by the Deputy.  That is certainly a possibility, but I refer to keeping the expenditure off balance sheet.</p></speech>

We will not finish too many roads to Sligo and other places around the country.  Perhaps the delegates might describe what the implications will be in the run-up to the budget.  The fact of the matter which is part of a wider argument in the European Union is that countries can borrow, effectively, at a rate of 1%.  PPP rates, although they have come down, are a lot higher.</p><p>We have a growing population and multinationals have an appetite to invest in Ireland but we have really serious capital constraints.

When the story broke about Apple, the point was that its effective tax rate, irrespective of how it was calculated, was pretty low by anybody's calculation.  What is the position on the large cases division companies, which account for a lot of the activity?  Presumably they are likely to have more tax strategies than many other companies.  Could we have a breakdown of the effective tax rates of companies of different sizes covered by the large cases division?</p></speech>

The Department of Finance prepared a paper on the corporation tax rate.  It is a very good paper which explained that there are at least four different ways of calculating the effective rate.  That paper showed that one can get, for the very same year on the basis of the same figures, a variation in the effective tax rate.  The rate can be around 6% if it is the implicit rate calculated in the way that the European Commission does such calculations.  The rate can be around 11.9%, if the Department of Finance does its calculations.  There was even an amazing calculation which had the rate higher than the nominal rate of 12.5%, which was a pretty extraordinary feat but nonetheless, somebody managed that one.  What I would like, for all of the relevant years and particularly for 2015, is the different calculations so that we have the range of calculations of the effective rate.  Is that possible?</p></speech>

It was prepared by Kate Levey and Seamus Coffey.  We have calculated our effective rate of 9.8% based on the method recommended by them after they reviewed all of the different methodologies.  We are not able to reproduce all of those different methodologies because they do not all use Revenue data.  Some use data from the CSO and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  From Revenue's perspective, we are only in a position to calculate effective tax rates based on our own data.</p></speech>

We have a paper produced by the Department of Finance that shows that there are at least four different ways of legitimately calculating the effective rate.  The figures produced vary very significantly.  One can have what is considered a legitimate method of calculating the effective corporation tax rate which puts it at 4% or 5% alongside another method which puts the rate at 11.9% or even higher than 12.5%.  That is a problem in terms of our ability to calculate what is actually going on.  Frankly, it is doing the public a disservice to not at least show that there are different ways of calculating these things.  That is my first point.</p> <p>  The graph that has been provided by the witnesses is very useful.  As I understand it, the graph shows the increase or decrease in trading profits by sector for 2015 over 2014.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I am Seamus Carroll from the civil law reform division of the Department of Justice and Equality, and I am accompanied today by my colleagues, Ms Noreen Walsh and Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Riordan, from that division.</p>  <p>  Before entering into detail, I should perhaps outline briefly the background to the draft Bill.  Following four years of intensive negotiations, the Justice and Home Affairs, JHA, Council and the European Parliament reached agreement on updated EU data protection standards in December 2015.  The texts of two new EU data protection instruments were published in May 2016.  The first was a regulation containing general data protection rules while the second was a directive containing rules applicable to competent bodies involved in the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties.  The regulation enters into force on 25 May 2018.  The directive must also be transposed into national law by May 2018.  While the introduction of a single EU instrument containing all data protection rules would have been simpler and possibly more efficient, the European Commission decided to propose both a regulation and a directive and it was, despite some misgivings, accepted by the JHA Council and the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  The introduction of new, higher EU data protection standards at this time can be justified for the following reasons.  First, there is the introduction of a new legal basis for data protection standards in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, together with the introduction of the right to data protection in Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Second, there is the fact that existing data protection standards, which derive from the EU&rsquo;s 1995 data protection directive and predate technological advances - such as hand-held Internet access and access to services, social networking and big data, as well as new business models such as cloud computing - are inadequate and ineffective to meet the challenges of the digital economy.  Third, there is the rapidly developing case law of the Court of Justice in relation to the protection of personal data.  Finally, there is the need for more consistent interpretation and application of general data protection rules across the EU pointed towards the need for a more detailed, directly applicable regulation rather than a directive.</p>  <p>  From the outset, Ireland supported the broad thrust of the European Commission&rsquo;s reform proposals, which sought to ensure that data protection rights and safeguards kept pace with developing technologies and new business models.  Otherwise, there would be insufficient citizen and consumer trust in the digital economy and its innovation, growth and jobs potential would not be realised.  Broadly speaking, both the regulation and the directive seek to strengthen individuals&rsquo; data protection rights - referred to as data subjects - and to specify in more detail than at present the obligations placed on entities in the public and private sectors that process personal data, known as data controllers and data processors.</p>  <p>  More concretely, both instruments place increased emphasis on the following.  First is transparency.  The regulation states that personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner.  Information must be provided to data subjects in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.  The current access request fee of &euro;6.35 will be abolished.  Second, there is also an emphasis on accountability.  Both the regulation and directive make it clear that data controllers shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, data protection standards.  Data controllers must have written arrangements with any data processors acting on their behalf.  Third, there is an emphasis on security.  Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security standards, that is to say, technical and organisational measures must be put in place to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks involved.  In future, all data breaches must be reported to the Data Protection Commission.</p>  <p>  I will turn now to the general scheme of the Data Protection Bill 2017.  As already mentioned, we are faced with a generally applicable data protection regulation which sets out data subject rights and controller obligations with limited flexibility for the member states, and a directive that focuses specifically on the law enforcement and criminal justice area.  The broad objectives of the Bill, therefore, are as follows.  First, it aims to give further effect in national law to the regulation where permitted by the regulation.  Second, it aims to transpose the directive into national law.  Third, it aims to establish a Data Protection Commission to replace the Data Protection Commissioner and to equip that commission with the mechanisms required to perform its tasks and exercise its powers in an effective manner.</p>  <p>  Part 1 contains a number of standard provisions.  With regard to repeal of existing data protection law as set out in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, the matter is still under consideration.  While the regulation and directive will largely supersede these Acts, a potential difficulty arises from the fact that Article 2.2 of the regulation specifies that its provisions do not apply to the processing of personal data in the course of an activity that falls outside the scope of EU law.  Recital 16 makes it clear that such activities include national security.</p>  <p>  On Part 2, the entry into force of the regulation and this Bill, when drafted and enacted, in May 2018, will have significant implications for the workload of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The workload is likely to increase, and investigations will become more complex, especially those with cross-border aspects.  Both the regulation and the directive confer a broader range of tasks and powers, including investigative powers, corrective powers, authorisation and advisory powers, on the commissioner.  In preparation for the coming into force of the regulation and directive in 2018, the resources of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner have been increased to &euro;7.526 million for 2017, up from &euro;1.9 million in 2014.  The additional funding has facilitated the recruitment of additional staff, including legal, technical and investigative experts.  It is expected that the office will have almost 100 staff by the end of this year.  The issue of any further resource requirements for 2018 will be considered in the context of the Estimates for 2018.</p>  <p>  Part 2 contains proposals that will establish a Data Protection Commission to replace the Data Protection Commissioner.  Head 9 provides that the commission will consist of at least one member and not more than three members. This means that the appointment of additional commissioners in response to an increased future workload will be possible without the need for amending legislation.  To be clear, this does not represent an immediate change but will permit further appointments if needed in the future as a result of increasing workloads.  Commissioners are required to have the qualifications, experience and skills needed to perform the duties and exercise the powers of the commission.  The opportunity is also being taken to update the funding and financial control mechanisms applicable to the commission in order to underpin the complete independence that the commissioner already enjoys under current law.</p>  <p>  The regulation contains what has become known as a one-stop-shop mechanism that is intended to streamline the handling of alleged infringements of data protection standards across the EU.  It is based on the concept of a lead supervisory authority, that is the data protection authority of the member state in which an entity&rsquo;s main establishment, or indeed only establishment, within the EU is located.  It means that where a data controller&rsquo;s main, or only, EU establishment is located in this jurisdiction, all complaints relating to that controller&rsquo;s data processing activities that are not exclusively local in nature must be investigated by the Data Protection Commission irrespective of the member state of origin of the complaint.  The commission may request mutual assistance from the supervisory authorities of other member states for investigation purposes.  However, the decision as to whether or not an infringement has occurred, or is occurring, will, in the first instance at least, be that of the commission.  Committee members will immediately appreciate the significance of this in light of the large number of international ICT companies with their EU headquarters located in this jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  Before arriving at any final decision in such cross-border cases, the commission will be required to submit a draft decision to the so-called &ldquo;consistency mechanism&rdquo;.  In practice, this means that any proposed action arising from an investigation or inquiry must be circulated to other relevant supervisory authorities for their views.  The commission will then be required to have regard to any objections received from them and if there are any remaining objections to the proposed course of action, the commission will be required to trigger referral of the case to the European Data Protection Board for further consideration. The board, which will comprise representatives of all supervisory authorities across the EU, will consider outstanding issues and may then take a binding decision by majority vote.  Any binding decisions of the board may be appealed to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.</p>  <p>  The data protection regulation is somewhat unusual in so far as it provides a certain margin of flexibility for member states, especially in respect of data processing activities undertaken by their public sectors.  That gives rise to the need for implementing national law.</p> <p>Part 3 seeks, therefore, to give further effect in national law to various articles of the regulation that allow a margin of flexibility.  Head 16, which is blank for the present while awaiting a specific Government decision on the matter, will provide for the digital age of consent.  Article 8 of the regulation requires the holder of parental authority to consent to the provision of information society services to a child under 17.  However, member states may provide by law for a lower age as long as it is no lower than 13 years.  Following completion of a consultation process, it is expected that the Government will take a decision in respect of the age threshold that will apply in this jurisdiction in the coming weeks.</p> <p> Head 17 makes provision for the making of regulations permitting the processing of sensitive personal data for reasons of substantial public interest.  A similar provision is found in section 2B(1)(xi) of the 1988 Act, as amended.  Head 19 makes provision for the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences for specified purpose.  Such processing must be subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the individuals concerned.  Head 20 provides for the making of regulations to restrict the exercise of data subject rights in order to safeguard important objectives of general public interest as permitted under Article 23 of the regulation.  This would, for example, be used to protect investigations of alleged professional misconduct or incompetence from access requests for the duration of the investigation.  Any such restrictions must, however, respect the essence of the individual&rsquo;s fundamental rights and be a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society.</p> <p> Head 23 makes provision, exceptionally, for the possible imposition of administrative fines on public authorities and bodies when acting as undertakings.  This will help to ensure fairness in cases in which both public and private bodies are providing similar goods and services.  Head 24 seeks to give effect to Article 85 of the regulation, which recognises that it is a matter for member state law to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information, both of which are rights included in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  In recognition of potential conflicts between these rights in specific cases, subhead 3 will permit the Data Protection Commissioner to refer any question of law to the High Court for determination.</p> <p> Before moving on, I should also say that the regulation requires that all public authorities and bodies must designate a data protection officer, DPO.  The DPO, who will act as a contact point for data subjects and the Data Protection Commission, must be designated on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practice.  He or she must be given the resources required to act in an effective and independent manner, free from conflicts of interest and will report directly to the highest management level of the public authority or body concerned. </p> <p> Part 4 seeks to give effect to the data protection directive.  As outlined in head 27, it applies to the processing of personal data by a competent authority for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.  Competent body is defined in head 26 as a public authority competent for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, or any other entity authorised by national law to exercise public authority and public powers for the same purposes.</p> <p> It should be noted that certain public authorities and bodies will be subject to both the regulation and the directive depending on the processing concerned.  In the case of a local authority, for example, routine data processing activities such as payroll, human resources and so forth will be subject to the rules of the regulation, while data processing in the context of the prosecution of offences under the Fire Services Act will be subject to the directive&rsquo;s rules.  Similarly, prosecution activities of other bodies such as the Health and Safety Authority will fall under the directive&rsquo;s rules. </p> <p> Many of the data subject rights and data controller obligations in the directive are broadly similar to those in the regulation.  However, as regards the former, the grounds for non-compliance with a data subject request for access to personal data or for rectification, erasure or restriction of processing, which are set out in head 37 are, as might be expected, more extensive.  These provisions give effect to Articles 13.3, 15 and 16.4 of the directive.  However, where head 37 applies, an individual may instead seek verification or review of the lawfulness of any processing by the commission.  The commission will, in due course, inform the individual that verification or review has taken place and inform the individual concerned of his or her right to a judicial remedy.  </p> <p> In Chapter 3, head 40 imposes a risk-based approach on competent authorities.  This means that each such authority must adopt and implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in order to ensure and be able to demonstrate compliance with the directive&rsquo;s data protection standards.  Obligations to carry out data protection impact assessments, report data breaches, engage in consultation with the Data Protection Commission and designate a DPO are also contained in this chapter. </p> <p> Chapter 4 contain provisions governing the transfer of personal data to third countries, while Chapter 5 makes provision for remedies, liability and penalties.  In accordance with Article 56 of the directive, head 58 clarifies that a person who suffers material or non-material damage because of data processing that infringes data protection law may seek compensation for the damage or distress suffered.  This extension of liability to non-material damage under the directive is significant and is broadly similar to that in Article 80 of the regulation.  Chapter 6 contains provisions that specify the tasks and powers of the Data Protection Commission.  In particular, head 61 proposes to confer a range of corrective powers on the commission.  </p> <p> Part 5 contains provisions governing the exercise by the Data Protection Commission of its supervision and enforcement powers.  Some powers are carried over from the current Acts, for example, the information and enforcement notices, while others are new, for example, the power to seek a High Court order to suspend or restrict data processing or data transfers to a third country or the power to require submission of a report.  Both the regulation and the directive require that the exercise by supervisory authorities of their powers be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards, including judicial review and due process.  A number of safeguards, therefore, have been included in this part.  First, the investigative functions under heads 74 to 76 and the adjudicative functions under heads 77 and 78 of the commission will be structured and managed separately.  This is in line with Article 6 case law of the European Court of Human Rights.  Second, provision is being made not only for appeals against administrative fines, under head 79, but for confirmation of fines by the Circuit Court in the event that they have not been appealed, as per head 80.  In the latter case, the role of the court will be to confirm that due process has been observed.</p> <p> Moving on to Part 6, without prejudice to the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, both the regulation and the directive require that data subjects have the right to an effective judicial remedy.  Provision for this is made in head 91.  Recourse to the courts is necessary in any event in those cases in which a data subject claims compensation for material or non-material damage suffered as a result of a breach of data protection law.  Head 90 makes provision for the appointment of a supervisory authority to supervise the processing activities of courts when acting in their judicial capacity.  Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights provides that compliance with its rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority. </p> <p> Before concluding, I should say that there have been extensive consultations with Departments, public authorities, representative bodies and the Data Protection Commissioner during preparation of the general scheme of the Bill.  However, a number of policy issues are still under review and consultations with the European Commission, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Data Protection Commissioner are continuing.  These relate to matters such as compensation claims, processing of conviction-related data and other sensitive data, and direct marketing activity by those seeking election to political office.  Nevertheless, in view of the very tight timeframe in which we are working, it has been necessary to proceed with the general scheme in advance of final resolution of these issues.  The intention is to publish the Bill in the autumn, which will allow sufficient time for detailed consideration of its contents prior to enactment. </p> <p> Implementation of updated EU data protection standards involves a complex interplay between the data protection regulation which has direct effect but which allows, at the same time, a margin of flexibility for member states, and a directive which must be transposed into national law.  The future decision-making role of the European Data Protection Board and the evolving case law of the European Court of Justice will help to ensure that data protection will remain an active and challenging area of law in the years ahead.  I hope that I have provided the committee with some clarity on the content of the Bill and the background to it.  We are happy to respond to any questions that members may have and I thank them for their attention.</p></speech>

I now invite members of the committee to contribute.  Deputy Daly is first.</p></speech>

This is the first day of what will be a sizeable body of work for the committee.  It is incredibly technical work in some ways, and a bit of snoozefest in some ways as a result, although I am not talking about the presentations, of course.  Separate to that, however, the issues of privacy and transparency are obviously critical and the question of how we balance that, bring it out and engage with stakeholders will be important.</p>  <p>  While I am not hugely prepared on the issue, I will work on the basis of a Ladybird version, given the points made by Mr. Carroll about the backdrop to this being higher EU data protection standards and also the rapidly developing case law from the EU Court of Justice.  We have had the implications of the Barrett judgment in regard to information in the context of the recent actions on the public services card and the individual health identifier.  In that scenario, we have one arm of Government, if one likes, engaged in a course of action of sharing data which seems to be blatantly against what the Barrett judgment states about Departments not being allowed to share information without prior consent.  Given that is happening now, how will this Bill impact going forward?  Mr. Carroll said this will be brought forward in the autumn.  Will this project have to be abandoned in the autumn as a result or do we have any indication of the implications at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.2039" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Carroll" time="09:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017061400005#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  The Barrett judgment is, of course, very interesting.  It dates from October 2015 and highlights two requirements.  First, there must be an adequate legal basis for the sharing of personal data between bodies.  Second, and this is a crucial point in the judgment, it is not sufficient that there be a legal basis; there must also be full transparency where public bodies are sharing data with each other.  For example, that could involve providing adequate information on the websites of the bodies concerned as to the sharing arrangements which are in place.</p>  <p>  Consent is not always a requirement when it comes to dealing with public bodies.  For example, when it comes to taxation matters, consent has little role to play and what the Revenue Commissioners do is underpinned by legislation, not by consent.  Whereas consent may provide a valid legal basis for the processing in many cases, when it comes to the activities of public authorities and bodies, a statutory basis is necessary - a basis in law rather than a basis in consent or in contract.</p>  <p>  I do not particularly want to be drawn into the detail of the health legislation, which is being considered separately.  However, going back to the point the Deputy raised for the future, there must be a lawful basis for the processing and there must also be greatly increased transparency.  As I said earlier, whether it is a public or a private body, and we often see terms and conditions on websites that would require considerable effort to understand, for the future this must be much more transparent and must be written in clear and plain language that can be readily understood.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.2040" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017061400005#D00300"><p>I am not sure I am very clear as a result of that reply.  People would obviously understand the issue of consent in regard to Revenue matters because the public understands there is an overriding public interest as to why people should pay their taxes.  The sharing of information in that regard is broadly understood.  However, the health database does not have a legislative base.  Mr. Carroll mentioned health legislation being developed separately.  The database is actually under construction and the sharing of information is already under way, but most people not only do not understand why there is a public interest, but do not even know that their information is being shared in this way.  Basically, every single aspect of a person's identity from a health point of view is being put together in one database, where their identity is being signed off.  I am not sure that would meet the bar on transparency that is required in this instance.  In that sense, I wonder, given that we are on the cusp of such an important project, why a body of work which could contradict that is going on simultaneously.  Maybe it is outside the scope of the Department of Justice and Equality because other Departments are running it.</p>  <p>  Mr. Carroll said that head 40 states that the competent authorities must adopt and implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure they demonstrate compliance with the standards.  It has obviously been a matter of considerable public debate, given the issues about garda&iacute; accessing PULSE records to check up on ex-girlfriends, the cases of giving information to the Department of Social Protection and all the rest, and even my own case with the Garda.  In light of such issues, head 23 makes provision for administrative fines in a limited way but it does not really deal with those situations because the bodies will only be subject to them if they are providing goods and services in the same market as private companies.  Do we need to beef that up?  There does not seem to be any real sanction in the Bill other than a limited one of administrative fines for public bodies, which is not much of a deterrent in terms of breaches.</p></speech>

In certain cases, in the preparation of legislation in particular, public bodies and authorities must consult with the Data Protection Commissioner.  In regard to the health matters mentioned by the Deputy, I understand, and perhaps the commissioner can confirm this, that consultations have already taken place with the health committee on this matter.</p>  <p>  The corrective powers of the commission with regard to the private sector are set out in the regulation but very important corrective powers in regard to public authorities and bodies are also set out in head 61, including those bodies mentioned by the Deputy.  The corrective powers are set out in paragraph (2) and include the issuing of warnings to a competent authority to issue reprimands, ordering a competent authority to comply with a data subject request, ordering a competent authority to bring processing into compliance with this part of the Act, ordering a competent authority to communicate a breach to the data subjects, imposing a restriction on processing, and ordering the suspension of data transfers to a recipient in a third country.  There is quite a broad range of corrective powers which the commission will have in respect of public authorities and bodies within this Act.  That is quite separate from the corrective powers which are conferred directly on the commissioner under the regulation.</p></speech>

The EU seems to be doing its best to make the regulation of data protection as impenetrable as possible, as we see from the regulations and directives.  To make a general point, we have laws in this country dealing with data protection and when this Bill is enacted, the laws will be extended.  Will it be the case that there will be a group of people who will then be covered by data protection law who at present are not covered, or is it that individuals will remain the same and that there will be a greater emphasis on certain areas?</p></speech>

The rights are conferred on data subjects and the obligations are imposed on data controllers and data processors.  I accept the Deputy's point about it being impenetrable because we are even using a different language of "data subject" instead of "individual" and "data controller" instead of "public body", so it has a vocabulary of its own which does not make it any easier to understand.</p> <p>What the regulation does and what this legislation will do in transposing the directive is raise the standards of data protection to increase the rights of individuals and extend the obligations on those who process personal data.  The regulation and the directive provide for a more detailed application of rules with a view to achieving greater harmonisation across the European Union.  The current data protection directive dating from 1995 has 30 articles.  The GDPR has 90, while the new directive has 60.  That is a rough indication of the increased complexity.</p> <p> When it comes to scope, individuals will be exempt to the extent that the so-called household exemption will apply.  Where individuals are processing data for personal or household purposes, data protection law does not apply.  Other than that, the scope will be similar to that of the current-----</p></speech>

When the draft regulation left the JHA Council, the age threshold was under 13 years in order that in the case of children up to the age of 12, parental consent would be required or at least the person offering the information society services would have to make the best effort to obtain parental consent for them.  When it went to the European Parliament, the age threshold was increased to 17 years.  That means that under the law those aged up to 16 years require parental consent, but there is a provision for member states to reduce it to 13.</p></speech>

Let us assume a child is aged 12 years as he or she will be covered, no matter which age threshold is applied.  Can the child's parents make a complaint to the Data Protection Commissioner if it appears to be the case that the child has been offered something on social media for which consent has not been provided?</p></speech>

The obligation under Article 8 of the regulation is that the controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility taking into consideration the available technology.  The threshold is that the offerer of the information society services must make reasonable efforts.  There is similar legislation in place in the United States - the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 1998.  The European provision draws inspiration from the American legislation, but it is a threshold of "reasonable efforts" because, clearly, at such a distance, it is difficult for the offerer of the information society services to be certain about the age of the child.</p></speech>

Currently, it has a staff of 100.  Does Mr. Carroll agree that the new commission will become a large statutory body which will need to be significantly funded, particularly in the light of the fact that there will be complaints from other countries?</p></speech>

The office is being geared up for an increased workload because the staff number is approaching 100.  As to what future demand will be, I am sure the commissioner will be able to give some idea of current thinking but, at least for the moment, the office is being geared up to address the expected increase with the necessary expertise.  That is also the reason the possibility of increasing the number of commissioners is being provided for.  There will undoubtedly be an increase in workload and the complexity of the cases being dealt with by the commission.</p></speech>

The Data Protection Commissioner is not in a position to award compensation.  That will be a matter for a court and it is covered in Part 6.  It is important, however, that the liability of those handling personal data be extended to non-material damage.  This is significant because current case law in this jurisdiction means that compensation is only payable for material loss, but the new rules will also extend this to non-material damage such as distress or humiliation.</p></speech>

There is an enhanced right in Article 17 of the regulation to seek erasure of personal data.  In the part which gives effect to the directive it is made clear that data controllers or, in other words, competent authorities must also ensure they have retention periods for personal data or that they have policies governing the retention periods.  As the Deputy said, there is increased emphasis on the right to seek erasure of personal data.  There is also an enhanced accountability principle, whereby data controllers and processors, be they in the private or the public sector, must demonstrate compliance with these instruments and the Data Protection Commission will have a clear power to carry out audits.  It will, therefore, not necessarily wait for complaints to arrive to carry out its enforcement activity.  It may take a more active role with this audit facility.</p></speech>

It will be a matter for individuals to exercise their right against the data controller.  In the event that the right to seek erasure is refused, a complaint will be brought to the Data Protection Commission which will will investigate.  One of its powers will be to order the controller to comply with a request from a data subject.  In the event of that not happening, various corrective powers are provided, including, for example, the imposition of an administration fine.</p></speech>

Would it not be better to provide stronger legislation that would provide for a positive right to compensation so that we better achieve this balance?</p></speech>

As we mentioned earlier, there are enhanced data subject rights and the strengthened obligations on controllers, and if the data controllers are not in a position to demonstrate compliance, there is a twofold risk.  The first is the risk of compensation claims.  As I have mentioned already, the liability is being extended to non-material damage.  For instance, if a public body simply ignores requests it receives, this may result in distress for an individual which might then form the basis of a compensation claim.  Second, there is the added possibility of administrative fines, particularly in the case of private sector bodies, so it is very much in the interest of data controllers and processors to ensure they comply with the law so as not to incur the risk of compensation claims and administrative fines.  There is undoubtedly the risk that there will be an increase in compensation claims.  This will depend on the extent to which controllers and processors comply with the new data protection standards.  If they do not comply, there is every risk that claims will be brought within the courts.  Case law will develop over time, but the Deputy is right to draw attention to this as one of the serious implications of this legislation.</p></speech>

Regarding the derogation in head 24, how will this balance be achieved in the context of, for example, social media organisations allowing freedom of expression on the one hand and data control on the other?  Could head 24 allow corporations or other data controllers potentially to derogate their responsibilities under the Act?  How does Mr. Carroll see this working out in practice?</p></speech>

Another fundamental right is the right to freedom of expression and information.  Here there is the potential for a conflict arising between the right to data protection on the one hand and the right to freedom of expression on the other.  It is likely in the future that this will be a source of litigation.  The balancing of these rights is typically the kind of conflict that is resolved in the courts.  It is for this reason that we have provided in subhead 3 that the Data Protection Commission may, upon its own initiative, refer any question of law arising in a case to the High Court for determination.  The Data Protection Commission is not required to do this; this is a discretionary power it will have.  We are therefore creating a case stated option here for the Data Protection Commission so that the matter of reconciling such fundamental rights, which is typically a matter for the courts, can also in this case be undertaken by the courts.</p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for their work on this issue.  One thing I fear from our interaction and from the beefed-up cost - &euro;5 million in the past two years - is a potential for massive levels of case law and litigation.  We must be wary of this and make this legislation work so that it does not become an enormously bureaucratic and costly process.  We must protect the fundamental rights of individuals, but we must also be very careful not to create a monster that would make it very difficult for individuals to have their rights upheld.  I fear we could be doing this even with the beefed-up cost of the Data Protection Commission and the potential for massive litigation as incorporated in the Bill.  We just need to be aware of this.  Perhaps there is legislation we can amend to ensure that this does not happen or perhaps we can provide compensation before the courts intervene.  We must be watchful.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Data Protection Commissioner will comment on this afterwards.  It is very important for data controllers to gear up now.  I am sure that litigation cannot be entirely avoided in the future because this is inevitably the result of creating higher standards and new rights.  However, the more an awareness is created and adjustments are made in advance of this legislation, the smaller the risk of costly and lengthy litigation.</p></speech>

I promise I will not talk for too long.  I do not understand this matter as much as I would like to yet, but we will get there eventually.  It is very complex and I can see problems on both sides.  It will be very hard to get the legislation perfect in any form.</p>  <p>  In April of this year, the Germans approved a bill giving effect to the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, which includes a specific provision on Article 82 of the GDPR.  With regard to the general scheme of the Irish Bill, while there is a reference in the explanatory notes of head 24 to the fact that Article 82 of the GDPR provides that a person suffering material or non-material damage as a result of the infringement of the GDPR has a right to receive compensation, the general scheme of the Bill does not include an explicit right in this regard.  The question here is whether the wording of Article 82 of the GDPR is clear enough to be horizontally effective or whether the right to compensation needs implementing legislation in Ireland which would give direct effect to Article 82 of the GDPR.  If this matter is not cleared up in legislation, we could be leading ourselves open to compensation cases from Europe and elsewhere.  Has the Department obtained legal advice as to whether Article 82 of the GDPR, concerning the right to receive compensation, needs national implementing legislation?</p></speech>

We are aware of the provision in German law.  One of the difficulties we face here is whether, when an article of the GDPR does not make specific reference to the possibility of national law, national law is nonetheless possible.  As I mentioned towards the end of my presentation, this question - namely, whether further effect or some kind of flanking measure to Article 82 may be included in our Bill - is one of the questions about which we are in consultation with the Attorney General at present.  The question is, therefore, under active consideration.</p></speech>

It is said it will not be compulsory.  However, one will not be able to get a passport or driving licence without it, so the reality is that it will be compulsory.  With the potential of cyberattacks and God knows what else now, and given that so much data seems to get leaked and invaded in one form or another, is it not worrying that information will be going on an identity card and that this may get into the hands of others?  For example, if the identity card is introduced full-scale, will we be entitled to know what is put on it?  I would also ask the same about passports.  I saw my passport being put into a machine at a passport point recently, and the person operating the machine seemed to find what he was reading incredibly interesting.  I would love to know myself what is on it.  Are we entitled to know what is put on these things or not?</p></speech>

However, I can say that national identity cards are commonplace on mainland Europe and, in fact, the majority of member states of the European Union have identification systems.  There is the provision in Article 87 of the GDPR for the processing of the national identification number.</p> <p>The provision states that member states may further determine the specific conditions for the processing of the national identification number or any other identifier of general application.</p> <p> There is the possibility, which is foreseen and recognised in the General Data Protection Regulation, of having a national identification number.  When it comes to legislation to give effect to any of this, as I mentioned earlier, there will be an obligation in future to consult with the Data Protection Commissioner.  The Data Protection Commissioner would be in a position to give advice to public authorities, whether Departments or local authorities, when it comes to either legislative measures or measures to give effect to legislative measures concerning data processing.</p></speech>

God knows, there could be many of them since the provisions are expanding beyond material damage.  Does anyone in Europe deal with this through a data protection commission rather than automatically going through the courts?  Does everyone in Europe have to do it through the courts?</p></speech>

Some supervisory authorities may already have the power to impose penalties, including administrative fines.  However, when it comes to compensation, I am not aware that supervisory authorities have such power.  This is typically the kind of work carried out by courts.</p>  <p>  Obviously, there may be bodies such as the Injuries Board, which has a role.  The Injuries Board has an adjacent role to the courts when it comes to awarding compensation.  I do not have sufficient information on the position in other member states to say more.</p></speech>

I am going to ask a hypothetical question, with the caveat that it is still outworking in my head.  We have a unique situation here with Brexit and the North.  Obviously, there is movement of people regularly across both sides of the Border, whether for hospital appointments or involving people using credit cards, downloading apps or signing up to tourism websites and so on.  At present, they are all subject to European guidelines.  We are heading into a situation where that may remain the case or it may not.  My hypothetical question is around any exploratory work or research into scenarios involving someone in the North if the North is no longer subject to these guidelines.  Such a person would remain an EU citizen and continue to attend hospital appointments, use credit cards and download apps.  Are such people, as EU citizens, protected by this legislation?  This might not only apply in the case of the North, but it might apply to another jurisdiction.  Is there a danger that their information could then be shared, used or abused in a way that is not compliant with the legislation as laid out here?</p></speech>

That is a really interesting and pertinent question.  The position is that the UK will already have given effect to the General Data Protection Regulation and the directive prior to Brexit.  At the point of Brexit, the United Kingdom will be compliant with EU data protection law.  Then, on leaving the EU, the United Kingdom will no longer be a member state.  In that case there is a mechanism that is called an adequacy finding.  This is based on a European Commission decision.  We have heard about this in the past with regard to the safe harbour decision and, more recently, the privacy shield.  Adequacy decisions already exist for Canada, New Zealand, Israel and numerous other third countries.  Basically, it means that where the data protection arrangements of those third countries equate with those applicable within the member states, then transfers of personal data across borders can continue without hindrance.</p>  <p>  A difficulty would arise if the UK were to adjust data protection standards post-Brexit.  That would certainly raise the question of whether the applicable data protection standards within the UK were still at the same level as the EU standards.  On the understanding and the assumption that UK data protection standards would remain equivalent to those in the European Union, one could expect an adequacy decision of the European Commission - which is provided for in the regulation - that would permit continued unhindered transfers of personal data into and out of the United Kingdom to the EU.</p></speech>

Mr. Carroll, in the absence of any other hands showing I would like to ask some questions.  Head 13 relates to attendance of the commissioner before an Oireachtas committee.  We are going to have that opportunity shortly.  Head 13 states: "The Commissioner or, in the event of more than one Commissioner, the Chairperson shall, at the request in writing of a committee of the Oireachtas, attend before it to give account for the general administration of the Commission and report on the performance of its functions."  I take it this provision is referring to any committee of the Oireachtas.  However, the explanatory note is quite specific in respect of accountability to an Oireachtas committee rather than to the Minister and Department and how it will serve to underpin the functional independence.  In that instance - this is only for the point of clarity, and no better place to ask for it - would the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality be the designated committee in respect of the primary accountability of the commissioner or commission, as the case might be?  Would she, he or they be open to requests from any committee of these Houses?</p></speech>

The intention is that the commissioner or chairperson of the commission could appear before any Oireachtas committee.  This would include if or when the commission had a separate Vote and it would appear before the Committee of Public Accounts as well.  I can confirm that this provision is not intended to refer to a single committee.  Perhaps when the Bill is drafted, it will make that clearer.</p></speech>

I take it that the Minister and the Department is not the broad church in that case.  Is it particular to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality as the primary reference point?</p></speech>

Therefore, the commission or commissioner, as is the case at present, is not accountable to the Minister or the Department.</p></speech>

The relationship to the committee system is what I am trying to establish definitively.  Perhaps the situation is not as I understood it to be.  It may be wider and run across the full gamut of the committee structure.</p></speech>

Head 12 relates to financial control.  Of course it is a blank.  I have before me the explanatory note.  It is all in the context of financial control.  The explanatory note relating to head 13 sets it out in a very different way, although it also relates to financial control.</p> <p>I wonder is there a need to streamline one or other of these.  There seems to be a crossover in terms of the explanatory position.</p></speech>

That is the underpinning motivation for having a separate Vote with the chairperson as the Accounting Officer.</p>  <p>  Perhaps that thinking has been carried over here into head 13, but that is in the context of accountability to or appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts.  It does not preclude attendance before other committees, such as the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  That will be made clear in the final drafted text.</p></speech>

I welcome the Data Protection Commissioner, Ms Helen Dixon, who is joined by Mr. John O'Dwyer and Ms Anna Morgan.  In the Gallery, I already acknowledged Ms Emily Burke.  On behalf of the committee, I thank them all for their attendance here this morning.  The format of the meeting with which they will be familiar is that the Data Protection Commissioner will be invited to make a brief opening statement and this will be followed by a question-and-answer session.</p>  <p>  Before we begin, I must draw the attention of the witnesses to the situation in relation to privilege.  Please note that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>  <p>  I invite Ms Dixon to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

As indicated by the Chair, I am joined this morning by two deputy commissioners from the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  These are John O&rsquo;Dwyer, who heads up the investigations function, and Anna Morgan, who heads our legal advisory function.  I do not intend to read out the full written opening statement that I submitted to the committee but rather to briefly highlight for the committee the key issues that were presented in that statement.  I trust that is in order for the committee.<br/><br/>This committee will be aware that data protection law is now being subject to a once in a generation overhaul and modernisation.  In a recent opinion of the Advocate General, Mr. Bobek, at the Court of Justice of the European Union, he pointed out that there is no doubt that the protection of personal data is of primordial importance in the digital age and he went on to reflect the main concern of personal data protection, for which it has been originally introduced and must be vigorously protected: large-scale processing of personal data by mechanical, digital means, in all its varieties, such as the compiling, administration, and the use of large datasets, passing on of datasets for purposes other than legitimate ones, assembling and harvesting of metadata, and so on.<br/><br/>Since the existing data protection directive was implemented in the EU in 1995, every organisation has now essentially become a technology organisation and a digital data organisation, not to mention the growth of the true born-on-the-Internet companies.  Every Department typically has a website and a range of databases.  Almost any corner shop operates a till and processes credit card payments electronically, for example.  The laws, therefore, required updating to allow for the scale of technology developments and to cover the important case law that has issued in recent years from the CJEU interpreting the fundamental right in Article 8 of the EU charter to have one's personal data protected.<br/><br/>In rendering the law fit for today's purposes and in seeking to ensure innovation is not stifled but happens in a way that respects fundamental rights, the EU is also overhauling the role of data protection authorities under the law, in particular, applying a much harder enforcement and sanctioning edge to our role.  Europe's law makers have taken the view that infringements of data protection law are a serious matter and are demanding more accountability and transparency from every organisation that processes personal data, backed up by strong <i>ex post</i>enforcement by data protection regulators.</p> <p> As the Department of Justice and Equality outlined this morning, the structure of the new laws that will apply in Ireland from May 2018 will be in the following form.  The committee has received copies of the direct effect General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, text from us yesterday.  This forms the substance of the new data protection law in Ireland from May 2018 and it is intended to be implemented as one harmonised law across the European Union, EU.  In addition to the direct effect GDPR text, there will be an Irish data protection Act, and that is the subject of our discussions today.  It will implement a limited number of measures to give further effect to some of the provisions in the GDPR and transposes, as we heard, the law enforcement directive that will come into effect in May 2018.  In due course, we will also have a new e-privacy regulation that will apply with direct effect and it will govern confidentiality of communications and e-marketing.</p> <p> In general terms, the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, welcomes the new legal regime for data protection law and the important additions to our tool kit as an enforcer.  It is undoubtedly the case there will be investigations where a punitive fine is warranted in order to deter organisations from failing to invest in compliance and to deter them from creating risks for consumers and individuals.  As a supervisory authority, we occupy a unique position in Europe in that our supervision remit covers the largest global Internet companies that have their European bases here in Ireland.  As a result of the platform types they represent and the volume of users they service at a scale of hundreds of millions, a comprehensive tool kit as an enforcer is a necessity.  The DPC is extremely pleased that Ireland is now one of the first countries in Europe to publish heads of a Bill to underpin the GDPR.  It facilitates greater planning by organisations preparing for the GDPR to have some insight into how the new Irish Act underpinning the GDPR may be structured.  However, there are three key areas to which we want to bring the committee's particular attention.</p> <p> The first is the matter raised earlier by the Department of Justice and Equality relating to the retention of portions of the existing data protection legislation.  As was noted earlier, it is intended that when the GDPR comes into direct effect in May 2018, the existing EU 1995 directive will be repealed in its entirety, reflecting the fact that the GDPR is intended to represent a clean slate, establishing a single legal instrument in which data protection rules and principles will be set out.  However, as we heard from the Department of Justice and Equality, there is no guarantee presented in the heads of Bill that were published that the existing Irish Data Protection Acts from 1988 and 2003 will be repealed.  We consider that their retention runs the risk of creating legal uncertainty in terms of precisely which provisions of the law will apply and in what circumstances post-May 2018, let alone considering how inaccessible for those seeking to comply with the law such an arrangement would be.  In addition, a patchwork presentation of the new Irish law in the form of a 2018 amendment Act rather than a completely new stand-alone Act does not create the impression of a new, modernised regime.</p> <p> Further, given the Irish DPC's obligations under the GDPR to co-operate in law with other European data protection authorities, a patchwork presentation would undermine confidence in Ireland's ability to regulate the multinationals located here.  The Irish DPC is of the view that if the pieces of the 1988 and 2003 Acts to be retained are capable of identification, it must be possible to fully repeal those Acts and rewrite the small number of provisions that require retention into a new stand-alone Bill.</p> <p> The second matter we wanted to raise relates to administrative fines for public authorities and bodies.  It is a serious matter of concern for the DPC under the general scheme, which relates to head 23, that it is proposed that administrative fines would not be imposed on public bodies and authorities.  The purpose of the punitive fines provided for in the new law is to act as a deterrent to all types of organisations, and we see no basis upon which public authorities would be excluded, particularly given that arguably higher standards in the protection of fundamental rights are demanded of those entities.  Additionally, the workload proposed for the DPC in making assessments of whether public bodies are engaged in activities that would compete with equivalent private sector bodies takes us away from our substantive role in data protection terms.</p> <p> The final issue we wanted to bring to the attention of the committee relates to the handling of complaints from individuals under the GDPR, which introduces changes in the manner in which the DPC must deal with complaints from individuals concerning alleged infringements of their data protection rights.  Under the Data Protection Acts from 1988 and 2003, an individual has the statutory right to seek a decision or determination from the Data Protection Commission in all complaints or cases where a complaint has been made to the DPC about a data controller or processor where the complaint could be amicably resolved.  The GDPR takes a broader approach, envisaging outcomes to complaints other than formal decisions.  For example, it envisages the provision of guidance or information to the complainant to self-resolve a complaint.  Reflecting this approach, the GDPR provides that an individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority under Article 77 to have the complaint handled and be informed within three months on the progress or outcome of the complaint.  It is also important to note in this context that the supervisory authority is required to investigate a complaint to the extent appropriate.  Our aim in these circumstances will be to ensure our resources are deployed in a way that maximises them and pursues investigations in the areas of the most grave and enduring infringements on an objective and priority basis.</p> <p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their attention and we look forward to answering any questions the committee might have.</p></speech>

The witness mentioned it might be worthwhile if a process could be done whereby somebody could go back through the legislation to identify the parts of the 1988 and 2003 Acts that need to be retained.  Does Ms Dixon see her office having a role in identifying what needs to be retained?</p></speech>

Our understanding is the reason for doubt about repealing the 1988 and 2003 Acts in total is the 1988 Act in particular transposed our Convention 108 obligations under the Council of Europe.  They stray outside the areas of competence of the EU.  For example, supervision in the area of national security will be required under Convention 108.  In order to retain pieces of the 1988 and 2003 Acts, the Department must identify those pieces.  In the course of doing that it seems it would be open to fully repeal and rewrite those small pieces, <i>de novo</i>, into a new Act.</p></speech>

The type of sanctions we can impose are warnings and we can issue enforcement notices requiring rectification and so on.  Under Article 83 of the GDPR, there is a presumption that where there is a sanction in contemplation and we have identified an infringement such that a sanction is in scope, Article 83 provides for the presumption that it will include an administrative fine.  With regard to such administrative fines, in the case of the most serious infringements they can be up to &euro;20 million or 4% of the global turnover of undertakings.  There is some discretion in terms of the administrative fines we can impose.  With regard to Article 83 of the GDPR, it sets out that initially we would look at whether a sanction is in scope in terms of the infringement that we are looking at; we would assess that based on the gravity and duration of the infringement.</p> <p>Then it provides for a range of criteria that we would take into account as mitigation factors in terms of the quantum of the fine we would impose, so there is some prescription in the GDPR for how we would go about that process.</p></speech>

It appears from what the Department says that the only way one can get compensation is by going to court.  Are there difficulties in permitting a parallel process such as that?  Does the witness think that people who have a complaint should, in the first instance, be forced to make a complaint to her office?</p></speech>

Mr. Carroll alluded to this.  We are currently, and will not be in the future under the GDPR, full blown ombudsmen.  Currently, in investigating complaints we do not have the powers to order redress or to deliver compensation.  That position is retained under the GDPR.  Currently, section 7 of the Data Protection Act provides that individuals can go to court to seek compensation if they consider that they have suffered damage but, as per FBD <i>v.</i>Collins, it must be material damage.  It is expanded under Article 82 of GDPR, whereby individuals can go to court to seek compensation for material or non-material damage.  Our reading of the GDPR is that it is prescriptive that court proceedings are required to achieve that compensation.  I do not believe it is envisaged that there could be a parallel process.</p></speech>

To what extent does she think the office's resources will have to be enhanced on foot of the enactment of the legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.2110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017061400011#K00500"><p>We certainly envisage an increase in workload.  We believe this will arise in a number of ways.  As Mr. Carroll outlined earlier, we have a broader range of powers and functions under the GDPR.  We believe the increased workload will stem primarily, we hope, from greater awareness of individuals and data subjects of their rights under EU legislation.  Once obligations fall under the GDPR on all sorts of organisations to be more transparent and accountable with data subjects, awareness of and concern about their rights will increase.  We believe we will start to see more complaints.  In addition, data subjects are acquiring new rights under the GDPR.  They are acquiring rights of data portability in certain cases, so we will see new types of complaints starting to arise requiring new technical expertise on our part.  In addition, our supervisory role relating to all of the organisations we supervise will increase.  As there are new accountability and transparency requirements on organisations we will be required to supervise that they are implementing those and in far more prescriptive terms than we are required to do currently.</p>  <p>  Another area where we envisage our workload increasing relates to the cross-border processing cases with which we will have to deal.  As a supervisory authority, we will act as the lead supervisory authority in Europe for all of the Internet multinationals located here.  When we investigate a matter relating to one of those companies, we are obliged under the GDPR to consult with our fellow data protection authorities in Europe, take utmost account of the views they express on the matter and, ultimately, if we cannot incorporate their views into the findings we make we will be obliged to refer the matter to the new European data protection board which will make a decision as to whether an objection from another data protection authority is relevant and reasoned.  Where it finds that the objection is relevant and reasoned, the European data protection board will then take a decision in the case.  There is an entirely new set of mechanisms, complexity and layers.  We are not exercising exclusive competence under Irish data protection Acts any longer, but will be implementing this harmonised regulation.</p>  <p>  We anticipate an increased workload across a range of areas.  There is also the requirement for data controllers to notify breaches to us on a mandatory basis, which will massively increase the number of breaches notified to the authority and which will require subsequent investigation.  It is also required of data controllers who are obliged to appoint a data protection officer to notify those details to us.  There is a range of areas where we have new functions, in addition to the prior consultation function with the data protection authority where new legislation is to be implemented.  Where any type of data controller has been obliged to conduct a data protection impact assessment and has been unable to mitigate all of the risks they are obliged to consult with the data protection authority.  The Deputy is correct that we will need many more resources to implement the GDPR.</p></speech>

Article 51 of the GDPR requires member states to establish an independent authority to monitor and enforce the GDPR.  Under the new Bill, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will be reconfigured as a data protection commission which, depending on the workload, may be assigned more than one commissioner.  In 2016, Digital Rights Ireland commenced legal proceedings against the Irish State challenging the independence of the commissioner and alleging that the commissioner did not effectively monitor databases containing personal data that had been created by public bodies.  Also, the fact that the commissioner is integrated into the Department of Justice and Equality and that many of the employees of the office are civil servants might raise serious questions about the independence of the office.  Under Article 52.6 of the GDPR, the supervisory authority, the data protection commission, must be subject to financial control which does not affect its independence and must have separate public budgets.  However, head 12 of the general scheme of the Bill, entitled "Financial control", is blank.  Is there any clarity as to how the Government plans to ensure the independence of the body and that it will have a separate public budget?  I will put my second question presently.</p></speech>

Our understanding from Mr. Carroll's presentation earlier and from discussions with him is that this matter is still under consideration.  He outlined that one proposal is to make the chair of the Data Protection Commission or the Data Protection Commissioner an Accounting Officer who would account directly to the Committee of Public Accounts.  There is debate as to whether that is necessary to achieve the level of independence required.  For example, at present we have a ring-fenced budget and we have full discretion to decide how we spend and deploy it.  That is where the area of remaining debate lies.  With regard to our view, we are open to advice that either will suffice to serve to underline our independence.  There probably is a benefit in being our own, stand alone, Accounting Officer in terms of perception.</p></speech>

For example, in the case of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, which we would argue was designed to fail, it made sure it failed by giving it as little money as possible.  How effective will the commission be if the Government pulls its strings too closely?</p>  <p>  On a separate issue, I heard the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, defending some of the big brother type policies around the collection of data as an issue of State security and using the threat of terrorism as a good reason for these policies.  There will always be a conflict between the individual and how much data the State wishes to store on the individual, and the State will use State security as a reason.  I raised the issue of telephone tapping when Vodafone tapped into the fibre optic cable off the coast of Wales a couple of years ago, which gave it access to almost every telephone in Ireland at the time.</p> <p>It was impossible to get answers from the Government about it.  We do not know why.  It was also impossible to get information back from it as to what it knew about the situation.  Was it legal?  Would the decision come from Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ?  The Government seems to hide behind this State security thing in order to do what it likes in this area.  Only a couple of weeks ago, or last week, we heard the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, make the argument that human rights could almost be undermined in the interest of security, to fight terrorism.</p> <p> Is there going to be a battle of that nature here, around how our data is being stored and how much information authorities are going to be allowed to put together on us?  I asked Mr. Seamus Carroll last time and he did not really want to give me an answer on it.  Are we entitled to know what authorities put down about us on this identity card or our passports?</p></speech>

The case law from the European Court of Justice has been very instructive in this area.  The Deputy will be familiar with the fact that it struck down Europe's data retention laws in 2014 and it outlined, in striking down the data retention laws in Europe, a test for necessity and proportionality.  In particular, it pointed out that there cannot be mass and bulk scale collection.  It requires to be targeted and there needs to be evidence as to the necessity and proportionality.  That gives us clues as to how the Court of Justice interprets data protection laws <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>this issue.  First, evidence, necessity, and proportionality need to be demonstrated.  There needs to be protection of rights of individuals to be notified when they are the subject of surveillance or interception.<br/><br/>We are aware that the Department of Justice and Equality is looking at modernising the surveillance and interception laws in Ireland.  We are strongly of the view that it needs to look at strengthening the oversight mechanisms that are in place.  As the Deputy knows, under current interception legislation, the Minister for Justice and Equality can sign off on an interception request.  There is currently no judicial oversight of that process.  There is a definite need to look at modernising those laws with regard to reacting to the threats that countries are now exposed to, but there is also a need at the same time to look at what the oversight in that area is.  When Mr. Edward Snowden made his disclosures in 2013, he kicked off a very important debate on this whole area with regard to how certain intelligence agencies in the US were operating.  It is an extremely important area in which we have to actively participate, and we are doing so.<br/><br/>On the question the Deputy asked about whether each of us is entitled to know what data is encoded on any identity card to which we are subject, we are entirely entitled to know.  We have a clear right under current data protection legislation and under future data protection legislation to know precisely what fields of data about each of us are recorded on that card.  It should not need to be something that one would need to submit a specific access request to obtain.  What is encoded on that card should be readily known to a person at this point.  That really points to an issue with transparency with regard to implementation of what is being rolled out.</p></speech>

Is there a means of obtaining the same results without interfering with privacy rights in that drastic way, etc.?  We would have to look at any specific case and examine whether the full analysis has been conducted in order to legitimise it under data protection law.</p></speech>

What other challenges does she think there are with this legislation going forward?</p></speech>

It is full of challenges.  Significant challenges with the new data protection regime relate to this issue that I mentioned of so-called cross-border processing of data, for example, processing of data by Internet multinationals located in Ireland, where the data of all Europeans is processed.  In those cases, we will not be exercising our own exclusive competence.  We are required to co-operate with other European data protection authorities and to keep them informed of investigations as we conduct them, and of the outcome, and to allow them to express views which we are required to take account of.  It is a significant complication when one is trying to co-ordinate across such a range of data protection authorities with very different cultural backdrops to how they view data protection in general terms, but also how they view, for example, American corporations that target services at European users.  We anticipate this is going to create a layer of complexity as we become involved in bringing decisions before the European Data Protection Board.</p> <p> I did not mention earlier, because it is probably a level of complexity too far, that once the European Data Protection Board makes a decision there will be a further layer of complexity in how those decisions can be appealed, such as through annulment actions before the European Court of Justice.  This is a very particular challenge.  An ongoing challenge in data protection legislation is that it is high level and principles based, as will be future laws to large extent.  This is appropriate because the laws need to offer a level of flexibility to all of the various organisations to which they apply.  We find there is a challenge, in particular for public sector bodies, in implementing principles-based legislation because it means they need to step back and conduct detailed analysis in every scenario that presents, in terms of processing personal data, looking at whether there is a statutory basis to collect and process it in the first place, whether it is meeting the legitimising conditions and whether it is meeting the transparency requirements to users, and then deciding whether all of this amounts to a lawful purpose.  It is the challenge of encouraging organisations to conduct this analysis themselves rather than expecting a simple binary answer on whether they can do something or not.</p></speech>

I want to reiterate the question I put to Mr. Carroll this morning and expand on it slightly.  I appreciate this is hypothetical, and nobody likes dealing in hypotheticals, but we are where we are in this regard.  It is on what the impact of Brexit might be, given our unique circumstances.  The British Government is committing to the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, and retaining existing EU legislation, directives and regulations.  If it was to divert from this at a later stage, or amend or distort it down the line, is exploratory work being done on how this would impact the retention and sharing of data of EU citizens in a jurisdiction which is no longer in the EU?  A large number of people in the North are EU citizens, and will remain so regardless of the outworking of Brexit.</p>  <p>  Another issue came to me as we have been sitting here, because people are following the meeting on social media and I have received a few tweets.  Small and medium businesses retain data as part of their work, and there is a huge degree of uncertainty on both sides of the Border about insurance and how the change in legislation will impact on them in this regard.  I caveat all of this with the appreciation that it is a hypothetical situation, but I want to pick Ms Dixon's brain and get her initial views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-06-14a.2130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Dixon" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017061400013#M00300"><p>The question is very clear.  As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile is aware, data protection law starts out with a prohibition on the transfer of personal data of EU persons outside of the EU, as will future law under the GDPR.  The obvious consequence of Brexit when it happens is that the UK will become a third country for the purpose of the transfer of data, which is what the Senator has referenced.  As Mr. Carroll outlined, in circumstances where the UK is no longer implementing the GDPR and is no longer party to it, it remains to be seen whether it will retain an equivalent set of standards, something that effectively mirrors the GDPR.  In these circumstances, we anticipate the UK would apply for an adequacy finding of the EU Commission.  As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile knows, once the EU Commission makes an adequacy finding in respect of a third country it effectively covers transfers, subject to ongoing review by the EU Commission that it is retaining the standards.  The ultimate solution is that the UK would retain laws equivalent to the standard under the GDPR and the EU Commission would make an adequacy finding.</p>  <p>  If it is the case the Commission does not make an adequacy finding there will be costs for business in terms of legitimising the transfers of personal data between Ireland and the UK, because one of the legal mechanisms provided for under the law would have to be implemented to effect the transfers.  The types of legal mechanisms provided for are binding corporate rules or standard contractual clauses.  These are means by which an entity can adduce adequate safeguards, as it is described in the law.  There is a legal cost to implementing these types of mechanisms.  It is the case that transfers will be capable of being affected post-Brexit, but it remains to be seen as to whether this will have to be achieved with a cost to business in terms of how it will implement the transfers.</p></speech>

My question is on the psychologists, psychiatrists and counsellors.  The best example I can give is filicide, as in murder-suicide where someone's spouse takes their children and kills them as well as himself or herself.  Is there any way of adjusting, through impact assessment studies or another solution, whereby if an individual, male or female, is attending a counsellor, psychiatrist or psychologist and there is a flag that the person may be a threat to family members the information could be disclosed to the person's partner, male or female?  I have been approached on a number of occasions by spouses who have survived but have lost family members to suicide.  They are extremely frustrated.  They feel that if some of the information had been disclosed they could have had an opportunity to protect their children.</p></speech>

As we frequently point out as a data protection authority, data protection law does not prohibit policy choices by the Government.  It does not necessarily prohibit any activity.  What data protection law does is prohibit the processing of personal data unless it can be justified and legitimised under the data protection laws.  Data protection law should never be used to obfuscate what is correct to do in all of the circumstances.  Under data protection law, of course disclosures of any individual's personal data, particularly his or her sensitive health-related personal data and personal data relating to mental health, is prohibited unless there are specific circumstances that would justify it.  Personal data can be disclosed where it is necessary to save a life or prevent serious harm to an individual.  Each individual case would have to be looked at to see whether a basis exists to make such a disclosure.  It is also likely to be the case that in circumstances such as those outlined by the Deputy, data protection law may not be all that is in scope, and he knows this better than I do.  There may be medical ethical issues at play.  In general terms, data protection law does not prevent what needs to be done to save the life of any individual.</p></speech>

I also have a background in banking and issues have been raised by a number of people, even within the employ of our banking institutions, but more particularly those who have been most seriously affected by the significant downturn in the economy and have not been able to maintain their repayment schedule in regard to house mortgages or whatever.</p> <p>My point relates primarily to the house mortgage area, but nevertheless we are also talking about serviced accounts.  They are not completely abandoned.  People present to a banking institution and proffer significant personal data and information in order to secure a loan facility.  What we have seen over recent years is what is described as a significant sell-off of a body of negotiated mortgages loans to third party banking institutions, and not always within this jurisdiction.  Sometimes they are domiciled outside the jurisdiction, but some have a representative office and nothing more.</p> <p> It is not just the loan that goes or the fact that there is a balance outstanding that has to continue to be serviced.  It is all of the respective data in regard to the borrower.  Instances have been brought to my attention where significant upset has been caused in terms of information on the individual, the family, those in a position to make an input into helping to address an outstanding balance and other members of a family who have come on board to help.  These cases have presented where that data regarding not even the principal borrower but other members of their family who have come on board to assist have been given out to new anchor lenders in regard to the borrowing facility.  Is there any prohibition or is anything envisaged in terms of the pending legislation that would prohibit this activity, which has been happening wholesale over the past number of years and has caused grave upset for many people?</p></speech>

In terms of the transfer of data, that would have to be based on a necessity of the transfer of data and underpinned in the terms of the mortgage.  Before commenting on that, therefore, we would need to look at any specific case regarding the terms of any given mortgage and the personal data that transferred in regard to any transfer of the loan.</p></speech>

The entire situation has changed enormously.  They end up dealing with a body, an institution or a financial house that they never heard tell of before and that have no public persona whatsoever.  They never get to meet an individual yet these people are in possession of all their relevant data that was proffered to the initial lender in good faith for the purpose of securing the loan, and they can go off and market it subsequently.  In broad brush stroke terms, is there anything that can be done to address that?</p></speech>

Data protection law is looking at whether there is a legal basis for the transfer of the personal data and whether clear and accurate notice is given to any individual who took out a loan that the loan could be called in at some point or sold onwards to a third party and that at the time of the selling on of the loan book, clear notice is given to the individual of the data that is transferring and to which new data controller.  We would have to look in the round at whether in a specific case we would outline that clear notice was given to an individual taking out a loan and that this was an eventuality.</p></speech>

I refer to the consequences of the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, coming into play in regard to the respective roles of Members of both the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Any number of questions have been posed by Members as to whether they need to appoint a data protection officer.  What is our respective position regarding the outworking of the new legislation?  A raft of different questions have been posed.  As representatives of the people who are meeting with members of the public on an almost daily basis and taking detailed personal information to assist them as a chosen representative in whatever particular case they want assistance, from the questions posed, even in terms of the current position, never mind the changes envisaged, it would be very helpful if some briefing could be prepared for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, many of whom are new Members since last year.  The questions posed are reasonable.  The proposal would be either to have Ms Dixon's office issue a briefing to the Members of both Houses or at some point in time, whether it is post or prior to the passage of the legislation - it is a call of its own choosing - to come here and brief Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad on the impact of the consequential outworking of the new legislation with regard to their roles and responsibilities.  How would Ms Dixon respond to that?</p></speech>

We would be very pleased to come in at any point and make a presentation.  We are extremely pleased to hear that there has been some consideration by Members of the Oireachtas of the way the new law applied to them.  It would be useful to receive some of the questions they are hearing in advance.  We have a dedicated email address, <i>oireachtasatdataprotection.ie</i>.  Questions could be submitted to that email address, which would help us in drawing up guidance but also in preparing a presentation that addresses the kinds of issues about which Members of the Oireachtas are concerned.  The Chairman is correct.  They are considerable processors of personal data and sensitive personal data.  We would be pleased to assist in giving guidance as to which provisions in particular apply and how they apply.</p></speech>

The Chairman has already introduced my colleague, Ms Jennifer O'Farrell, and we are both in the equality division of the Department of Justice and Equality, with responsibility for various equality issues, including family leave legislation.  The Commission's proposals are directed at the area of family leave.  We will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have but our capacity to do so is limited on the basis that we are still at a very preliminary stage of examining this proposal and we do not have a Government position.  Some considerable policy issues must be addressed before we arrive at a Government position.  We do not yet have firm information on costs and other impacts and that is work in progress.  We do not have Government guidance on the various policy issues but we will seek that Government guidance and a negotiating mandate once we finish our preliminary analysis in conjunction with colleagues in all other relevant Departments.</p>  <p>  We have supplied two scrutiny notes that we prepared for the committee on the related initiatives.  One is a package of non-legislative and legislative measures to promote gender equality in the workplace and work-life balance.  The second, within that, is the legislative proposal itself.  The Commission's communication sets out details of an initiative that is being developed by the Commission to address the following challenges.  These are the under-representation of women in the labour market across the European Union due to family responsibilities, such as responsibilities as a parent or carer of family members; the persisting pay gap between men and women, as well as an increasing pension gap that often leads to social exclusion and increased risk of poverty for women; and the failure of existing policies to bring equal opportunities for fathers and mothers with regard to labour market opportunities and treatment at work.  That is the rationale expressed by the Commission for this package of measures.</p>  <p>  Specifically, the Commission's objectives are to increase female participation in the labour market and reduce the gender pay gap, including elements of pay and pensions.</p> <p>It also intends to give workers more opportunity and choice in balancing their professional and care responsibilities by updating and modernising the current legal and policy framework, with particular attention to the role of men.  The proposal is to support member states' modern family policies, including by addressing demographic and societal challenges and shortcomings in care service facilities and to eliminate economic disincentives to work for second earners who have family care responsibilities.  The non-legislative actions proposed by the Commission are summarised in the scrutiny note and I do not propose to set them out.  They pose no difficulties for us and we can, in fact, welcome and support this package of non-legislative actions.<br/><br/>As indicated in the scrutiny note, the legislative measures proposed follow on from the former maternity leave directive which was published by the Commission in 2008.  The Commission withdrew the proposal as it had become clear that an impasse had been reached between the Council and the Parliament which could not be broken.  There was also a case for a broader approach which was not focused solely on maternity leave to address work-life balance issues.  During the Irish Presidency the then Minister of State, former Deputy Kathleen Lynch, tried to negotiate an end to the impasse but the distance between the parties was too wide and we were unable to broker a way forward in the time available to us.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of the directive now proposed are to improve access to work-life balance arrangements and increase the take-up of family-related leave and flexible working arrangements by men so as to promote greater gender equality in the labour market, including in relation to the gender pay gap and lifetime pension entitlement accruals.  The following new elements are proposed.  First is the possibility of flexible uptake, piecemeal and part-time, of the four-month entitlement to parental leave which would be paid at sick pay level.  The four-month entitlement can be taken up until the child reaches the age of 12 years and cannot or would not be in the context of the Commission's proposals transferred between parents.  Currently, we have a provision which is rooted in an EU directive for unpaid parental leave.  The substantial change is that the leave would be paid.  The proposal includes an entitlement to ten working days of paternity leave when a child is born, paid at sick pay level.  As the directive sets out minimum standards, it is always possible for member states to go beyond them.  The proposal also includes an entitlement to five days of carer's leave, paid at sick pay level, per year per worker to take care of seriously ill or dependent relatives and a right to request flexible working arrangements to take care of children up to 12 years old and for workers with caring responsibilities.<br/><br/>The Commission's proposals are being examined in detail.  Some elements of the proposed directive pose very little difficulty for Ireland.  We introduced two weeks' paternity leave last year; that is something we have and to which the Commission's proposal would make no difference.  Our own policy direction domestically of moving to significantly expand paid leave to parents to cover the first year - a programme for Government commitment - is a very important context for us in ddressing or examining the Commission's proposals.  The scrutiny note we have provided comments on each of the elements.  For now, rather than to repeat all of it, I draw attention to the proposal to change the current unpaid leave to paid leave.  This would be the major new element for Ireland and needs very careful consideration from cost and impact on employment perspectives.<br/><br/>In coming to our assessment of the implications of the proposed directive, the first point to make is that we are conscious that previous EU gender equality initiatives have had a transformative impact on the position of women in Irish society.  On that basis, we welcome in principle the Commission's initiative in presenting this package of proposals.  This is subject to the normal detailed scrutiny, especially of those elements that are different from our current family leave regime and that could have significant cost implications.  From an Exchequer perspective - this is a point that will, no doubt, be emphasised by our colleages in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Departments - any additional cost would need to be met from a strictly limited fund available for each annual budget, the so-called &quot;fiscal space&quot;.  We also need to consult and negotiate on the detail with our European partners in due course, as well as with domestic stakeholders, including employer and employee representatives, in order that we fully understand the cost and other implications, particularly in the employment sphere.<br/><br/>What will happen next?  We have an <i>ad hoc</i>interdepartmental advisory committee which has been set up to help us to analyse and cost the Commission's proposals.  As it happens, the committee is due to meet tomorrow afternoon for the first time.  We expect that its work will be completed quickly and that we will be able to seek a Government decision on our negotiating mandate before the summer break.  We understand the Estonian Presidency is planning to organise a preliminary discussion on the file at ministerial level in July and that negotiations will commence in earnest in September.  To reiterate, we are still at a very preliminary stage of our analysis and none of the key policy decisions on our negotiating position have yet been taken.  There is a bit of work to be done before we make a submission to the Government.  It will include consultation with employer and employee representatives which the committee may also be contemplating.  Clearly, we will also reflect on the feedback from the committee.  We will also consult colleagues in other Departments who have operational responsibilities in the social welfare system or as major employers within the public sector.  Notwithstanding that rather serious limitation on what I can offer the committee by way of evidence, we will endeavour to address questions members have.</p></speech>

This is obviously an important and significant proposal.  Looking at the objectives of the proposed directive, they appear to be ones most Members of the Oireachtas would support.  The obvious concern, however, is the total cost involved.  While that is obviously a matter for another day, it is welcome that it is one that is on our radar at this early stage.  It is something of which we will keep ourselves apprised as time passes.</p></speech>
