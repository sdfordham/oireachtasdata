She is replacing Deputy Shortall and we look forward to working with her on the committee.  We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness at the committee meetings and he is accompanied by Mr. John Riordan, deputy director, Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  The first item on our agenda today is the minutes of our meeting of 29 September 2016.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016100600002#T00300"><p>I do not want to delay this meeting unduly but we need to discuss how we structure these meetings.  We need an examination that is evidence based and we need a mechanism to check clear conflicts in testimony or new material that is introduced.  Our job is to examine this report.  People will analyse it, give their views or position on matters but it hinges on the documentation and facts presented to the committee.  Although our last meeting was enlightening I do not think we adequately allowed, or at least not to my satisfaction, for some of the matters raised by NAMA to be tested in the second part of the meeting, for instance, by comment from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There were other issues that got through the net which I wonder if they were factually accurate.  It is my strong view that there are several witnesses we need to hear from arising from the NAMA evidence, who are not on the witness list.  I am talking about PIMCO and Lazard.  It is not a massive list but we could not reasonably say that we made a full examination of this report without hearing from them.  I am anxious that they would be called.  I am happy to return to the issue but I want to signal that strongly.</p></speech>

We made no decision.  We said we would hear in further detail from the Deputy because she made the request.  We agreed to send quite a comprehensive list of requests of information to NAMA arising from the last meeting.</p><p>Some members had submitted questions in advance and I added quite a bit to the list to try to get more information from NAMA.  To be very clear, we had to finish the last day at 7.15 p.m.  That is all we could do-----</p></speech>

The last meeting was very lengthy.  The issue is how we go about this in a structured way so that we can, at some stage, get to some sense of resolution or common agreement because our objective is to produce an agreed report, I presume.</p></speech>

The first item is a letter from the Minister for Finance accepting the invitation today and we will note that.  The second item, 85B, is a copy of an e-mail forwarded by Deputy Noel Rock, dated 13 February 2014, from Mr. Michael R. George, managing director of Fortress Capital, to Mr. Andrew McDowell in the Department of An Taoiseach asking how he might get involved in the sales process of NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio.  That is noted.  I thank Deputy Rock for submitting this, which was referred to during our last meeting.  It is now part of the correspondence for consideration by the committee and we will add it to the list of relevant documentation in our file.  </p> <p>  The next item is 86B, a letter from Ms Teresa Griffin, chief executive of the National Council for Special Education, in response to the committee's query as to why no review of the council's internal financial control system was carried out in 2015.  The letter points out that a review was carried out.  However, the organisation was waiting for the Minister to appoint members to the council and the review could not be examined until that was done.  There were no significant issues found and it is good to clarify that.  That is noted. </p></speech>

I am afraid I was distracted.</p></speech>

He sent us copies of e-mails to and from the Taoiseach's office and we will put them on our Project Eagle file for further consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016100600002#U00800"><p>Thank you</p></speech>

I propose we forward this to the Charities Regulatory Authority.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Item 84C is a letter from an individual alleging a misappropriation of public money by Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board, ETB.  The letter refers to the use of public funds by the ETB for legal services, against the advice of the Department.  I propose that we write to the Department requesting a note on this case and on the action to be taken.  We will note that for now.</p> <p>  Item 87C is a letter from a business owner who is trying to sell his property and who claims that NAMA is delaying the release of information.  I propose that we write to NAMA asking for a note on the reason for the delay in the release of this information.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence 89C is a letter from Mr. Mark Ewbank of the UK Parliament inviting members of this committee to the Global Tax Transparency Summit in London on 8 and 9 December next, organised by the British Public Accounts Committee.  It is a very topical issue and if any member is interested in attending, please contact the clerk and we can prepare an estimate and consider the matter.  </p> <p>  The next items, 90C and 93C, are e-mails from Deputy David Cullinane concerning documentation and required answers to questions relating to the committee's examination of Project Eagle.  We have discussed that.  It is on our file and we dealt with it earlier this morning.  That is noted.</p> <p>  The next item is an e-mail from Deputy Mary Lou McDonald concerning possible invitees.  That is the matter to which the Deputy referred earlier.  We had a brief discussion already this morning and we will come back to that matter again as soon as possible.  </p> <p>  In our private session this morning we discussed a disclosure which centres on the interpretation and implementation of social protection legislation.  While our legal advice suggests that it is not within the remit of this committee, the committee acknowledges that the central point of the disclosure may merit further discussion in a different forum.  We will be writing to the individual to let him know our decision on this matter, following our detailed discussion this morning.  </p> <p>  The next items of correspondence are the statements of accounts received since our last meeting.  They are all clear audit opinions from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Ombudsman for Children, D&uacute;n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Carlow Institute of Technology and InterTrade Ireland.  If any members have any queries on these items, they will find copies of them in the Oireachtas Library.  No issues have been brought to our attention by the Comptroller and Auditor General in connection with any of the aforementioned statements of accounts.  </p> <p>  The next item is our work programme, which has been circulated to members and which we discussed already this morning.  The Revenue Commissioners will come before us next week and the Minister for Finance will be with us at 2.30 p.m. today.  Next Thursday we will meet Mr. Brian Rowntree, former member of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee, to discuss Project Eagle.  On Tuesday, 18 October we will meet three members of the NAMA board, Mr. Willie Soffe, Mr. Oliver Ellingham and Mr. Brian McEnery.  On Thursday, 20 October we will meet representatives of the Department of Social Protection for a normal, scheduled meeting to deal with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  On Tuesday, 25 October we will continue our examination of Project Eagle with officials and former officials from NAMA.  On Wednesday, 26 October the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, Mr. Martin McGuinness MLA will appear before the committee.  The next meeting is scheduled for quite some time later, Thursday, 17 November, when we will meet Ms &Eacute;ilish Finan, Mr. John Mulcahy and Mr. John Corrigan from the board of NAMA.  We have also scheduled a meeting with officials from the Department of Finance on 24 November but I propose that we bring that meeting forward.  </p> <p>  Since our last meeting, the Taoiseach and the party leaders have agreed to the establishment of a commission of investigation in respect of Project Eagle.  I expect the commission to be established shortly, a judge to be appointed, systems put in place and hearings to commence.  I do not know exactly when this will happen but it would be very prudent for this committee to have concluded its work before the commission begins so that we are not carrying out our examination while a commission of investigation is examining the same matter.  I would hope that we would finish our public hearings by mid-November, with a view to producing our report by early December.  Then our report and any documentation we have received would be available to the commission of investigation.  From that point of view, we will be very busy for a few weeks but it is important that we, as the committee of public accounts conclude our examination, do our job and produce a report.  It will then be up to others to follow the matter up further.  That is the general position at the moment.</p> <p>  As there is no other business, we will suspend the meeting for ten minutes until the Minister arrives.  He is scheduled to be here at 2.30 p.m.  We have just received his opening statement, copies of which have been circulated to members.</p></speech>

It is a briefing document, released under FOI, given to the Minister for Finance and officials from his Department.  It is a context document on Project Eagle from 2015.  As I will make reference to some of it during the meeting, I gave a copy of it to the clerk.  I ask that copies be made for members and that I be given back the original copy.</p></speech>

However, as Chairman, I am concerned that there was a relevant document in the Department of Finance that was not made available to us.  That is my observation on this.  If it was obtainable under FOI, I would have presumed it should have been made available to us.  Maybe there is nothing new in it.  I do not know but we will look at it.  I thank Deputy Cullinane for bringing it to us.  We will have to confirm with the Department of Finance that there are no other documents in the system that have not been sent to us.  That is a good opening question for the Department.</p> <p>  We will suspend now until 2.30 p.m.</p></speech>

Project Eagle was the code name given to the sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.</p> <p>  Last week, we had an engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General on his report and with NAMA on the conclusions in the report.  Today, I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and thank him for making himself available to the committee to discuss matters raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It is important to hear about the Minister's role and communications with NAMA and the Northern Ireland Executive on the sale of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio.</p> <p>  I remind members, witnesses and those in the public gallery to ensure that all mobile phones are switched off or on aeroplane mode.  Putting them on silent is not adequate as it interferes with the recording of proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call on the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

First, I would like to introduce the officials who are with me.  They are all officials of the Department of Finance.  On my left is Ms Ann Nolan, second secretary in the Department of Finance, and the two gentlemen accompanying me are Mr. Des Carville and Mr. Declan Reid.  They are both attached to the share management unit of the Department of Finance and both have extensive experience in the private sector on matters which are relevant to the discussions of the committee.</p> <p>  I thank the committee members for inviting me to discuss the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money report on NAMA's sale of its Northern Ireland portfolio.  I wish the committee well as it undertakes its important work.</p> <p>  I will begin by placing NAMA's activities in context.  We have all come a long way since the beginning of the crisis and we must not forget key challenges we have faced and overcome in getting to where we are today.  One of our main priorities in recovering from the crisis was to increase confidence in the Irish sovereign and the Irish market in order to reduce the cost of borrowing for the State, banks, businesses and consumers.  Creating NAMA was a bold step by my predecessor, the late Brian Lenihan.  It was taken to reduce instability and uncertainty in our banking system and, ultimately, to help normalise land and development markets.  Created at a time of scarce State resources, during a period of reliance on troika funding and emergency ECB liquidity, NAMA came with a very material contingent liability for the State in the form of &euro;30.2 billion, guaranteed by the State, of NAMA bonds.</p> <p>  At NAMA's inception, very few believed that it would eliminate this contingent liability, never mind deliver a surplus.  Most thought NAMA would fail in its remit.  This view persisted throughout the bailout programme so when we think about NAMA, we must remember how well it has performed versus our expectations and the support its overwhelming success has provided to Ireland's recovery.  NAMA has materially reduced the State's contingent liability and our banks' reliance on emergency ECB liquidity.  NAMA's steady successes have made a major contribution to the recovery of our economic freedom and have helped reduce our cost of debt below that of Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy, positively impacting the Exchequer, the banks, Irish businesses and consumers.  We should take a moment to imagine where our economy would be if NAMA had not been established as an independent commercial entity and had not been as successful as it has been in reducing the State's contingent liability.</p> <p>  Turning to the debate over the value achieved by NAMA on its sale of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio, the committee has heard the Comptroller and Auditor General's and NAMA's differing opinions and positions.  I have full confidence in both of these important State actors.  Their differences of opinion do not alter the continuing confidence I have in NAMA, or the standing of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am confident that by focusing on the salient issues, the Committee of Public Accounts can help navigate the technical issues under discussion.</p> <p>  The Government position remains that the Committee of Public Accounts is an appropriate forum for the consideration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and for the exercise of public accountability in these matters.  In addition, the Government has its own responsibilities to ensure all matters of public concern that require further investigation are addressed in a speedy and effective manner and so has agreed with party leaders that a statutory commission of investigation would be established without delay.</p> <p>  I will now focus briefly on my powers as Minister for Finance and my knowledge of the Project Eagle sale process.  Around this time last year, the Department of Finance provided to the Committee of Public Accounts over 40 documents regarding my and my Department's knowledge of the sale process.  These documents remain available on the Department of Finance's website and I am happy to discuss them today.</p> <p>  I and the Northern Ireland Executive shared an understanding of the importance of NAMA to the economy in Northern Ireland and the care needed in dealings in Northern Ireland regarding NAMA's management of its portfolio of assets in that jurisdiction and any potential sales process.  In light of these sensitivities, I had a number of discussions with members of the Northern Ireland Executive regarding NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio and a potential sales process.  These discussions are a matter of public record.</p> <p>  The fact that I, and my counterparts in the North, were cognisant of a potential sale and mindful of the potential impact on the Northern Ireland economy should not be surprising.  However, this should not be misconstrued as political pressure on NAMA.  As has been pointed out by the NAMA chairman, there was no political pressure on NAMA regarding this sale.  Nor was there any divergence of views expressed to me by any party within the Northern Ireland Executive regarding NAMA and a potential sale of its Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  From my perspective, as Minister for Finance since March 2011, I can categorically assure the committee that this is the case.</p> <p>  For my part, in each interaction with my Northern Ireland counterparts, I stressed that NAMA was independent in its functions, should be approached directly by interested parties, was obliged to run a competitive process, and must be satisfied that it had achieved the best price.</p><p>For my part, in each interaction with my Northern Ireland counterparts, I stressed that NAMA was independent in its functions, should be approached directly by interested parties, was obliged to run a competitive process and had to be satisfied that it had achieved the best price.  This is borne out by an examination of the records for each interaction between me or my Department and the Northern Ireland Executive.  These records were provided for the committee one year ago.<br/><br/>It has been suggested that I, as Minister for Finance, should have directed NAMA to halt the sale process when I became aware of the circumstances under which PIMCO had withdrawn from the process.  On 13 March 2014 the NAMA chairman called to inform me of developments in the sale process and the board's decisions in this regard.  The chairman recounted that on 10 March 2014 PIMCO's compliance department had informed NAMA of a proposed advisory fee arrangement with a former external member of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC.  The chairman advised me that, on learning that NAMA did not find this acceptable, PIMCO had withdrawn from the process.  The chairman informed me that, having carefully considered the impact of PIMCO&rsquo;s withdrawal on the sale process, the board was minded to continue the process with the remaining bidders, subject to receiving advice from their financial adviser, which I understand was received a number of days later.  It is important that I make this very clear.  The chairman was not, in any respect, requesting permission to proceed with the sale, nor was he required to.  He was notifying me of issues that had arisen and the board's considered decision to proceed.  I appreciated the courtesy of being informed by the chairman, as this was a potentially sensitive issue.<br/><br/>Suggestions that I, as the Minister for Finance, should have interfered with NAMA's commercial decision and called a halt to the board approved sale process fundamentally misunderstand NAMA's independent mandate and my role as Minister.  From the outset, during the formulation of the NAMA Act, the Oireachtas shared the view and strived to ensure NAMA would be independent in its decision-making.  As a result of this broad consensus, section 9 of the Act is unambiguous when it states, &quot;NAMA is independent in the performance of its functions&quot;, prohibiting political interference for good reason.  I am sure the committee will agree that there is no role for political influence in the commercial decisions of NAMA.<br/><br/>Section 12 bestows the NAMA board with the power to &quot;sell or dispose of the whole or any part of the property or investments of NAMA, either together or in portions, for such consideration and on such terms as the Board thinks fit&quot;.  It has been suggested I should have directed NAMA to halt the sale, or should have directed it to break up the portfolio into smaller lots for sale, or should have instructed it to work-out the portfolio over a long time horizon.  I want to be absolutely clear on this point - there was no legal basis for me on which to instruct NAMA to do any of these things.  Under section 14(1) of the NAMA Act, I &quot;may give a direction in writing to NAMA concerning the achievement of the purposes of the Act&quot;, as set out in section 2.  This effectively limits the Minister&rsquo;s ability to direct NAMA to undertake such actions that directly reflects the wishes of the Oireachtas as set out in the purposes of the NAMA Act.  Section 2 sets out these purposes which include &quot;to protect the interests of taxpayers&quot;.  This section has been cited as the clause which could have empowered me to direct NAMA to halt the sale process.<br/><br/>It is important to be specific in recounting what was being decided at the time.  The chairman of NAMA informed me that, having consulted its financial adviser, the board had made a considered commercial decision to continue with the sale process.  I should correct this.  The chairman of NAMA informed me that he was about to consult his financial adviser and that if the advice was favourable, they would proceed with the sale process to maximise value in achievement of the purposes of the Act.  There is nothing to suggest from this that NAMA was not operating in line with the purposes of Act in proceeding with the sale process.  That being the case, there was no legal basis on which I could have directed NAMA to discontinue the sale process.  Department of Finance legal advice has confirmed this position.  Any such direction would have been an interference with NAMA's commercial independence and conflicted with NAMA&rsquo;s purpose to deal &quot;expeditiously&quot; with its assets as set out in section 10 of the Act.  It is important for me to be clear when I say that, even if I had had the legal basis on which to interfere with the NAMA board&rsquo;s considered decision at the time, there was no evidence that such interference would have been in the interests of the taxpayer and I am still of that view.  In fact, neither the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit of NAMA's annual accounts for 2014 nor the recently published value for money report have asserted that the sale process should have been halted.<br/><br/>In summary, in crafting the NAMA Act in 2009 the idea that NAMA should have statutory independence from the political sphere was broadly shared across the Houses.The Oireachtas worked to ensure NAMA would be independent in its decision-making and insulated from political influence.  This is enshrined in the NAMA Act.  A number of Deputies contributed and I want to quote them.  As Deputy Joan Burton astutely put it on Committee Stage, &quot;One does not want Members of the Oireachtas being in a position to interfere in respect of the activities of NAMA.&quot;  Similarly, the Chairman of this committee contributed on many occasions during the formulation of the Act and was also firmly in the &quot;hands-off&quot; camp when he stated about NAMA's valuation process:</p><blockquote>It would be better to take this Minister and all future Ministers out of this role.  It would remove them from the process and would be a far more independent and transparent way of doing it.</blockquote><p>Deputy Michael McGrath also referred to NAMA during a motion on the accountability of Government agencies and companies stating, &quot;While oversight is important, it cannot be allowed to interfere with the operational decisions that have to be made by bodies.&quot;  Many more Deputies contributed and members can check the record.  I could not agree more with these statements and believe the Oireachtas did, ultimately, strike the appropriate balance between independence and accountability for NAMA.<br/><br/>As the committee will be aware, we are charged with the task of upholding not only the letter but also the spirit of the law.  I believe I have properly upheld both the letter and the spirit of NAMA Act.</p></speech>

With regard to dealing with NAMA, it has quoted the Department as saying that the standard of expertise and experience of staff at the Comptroller and Auditor General's office is questionable with regard to how they performed when looking at this sale.  How does the Minister feel about that and is it reflective of the Department's view?

Obviously, we would be sensitive to that.  Northern Ireland is not just any other country to us - it is something in which we take a major interest.  All of a sudden, though, there was a <i>volte-face</i>.  Due to an expressed interest, the loan book could be combined and the fire sale was not an issue.  In fact, it seems that there was a political necessity for this to be expedited as quickly as possible.  The Minister mentioned that he had a number of phone calls.  We are aware of one, which is documented in this report, with the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  Why the sudden change in tack regarding the sale of assets by NAMA?</p></speech>

Naturally, the Northern Executive was raising this issue.  NAMA, which was outside that jurisdiction, was managing the assets in Northern Ireland.  The First Minister and deputy First Minister were perfectly in order to be concerned about such an essential sector of their economy as building and development and trying to get it active.  There was no <i>volte-face</i>.  The Executive was interested in selling property at best value in Northern Ireland, but its primary interest was not what NAMA would get for the property, since that would accrue to NAMA and any profit would accrue to the Irish Exchequer.  Its concern in Northern Ireland was to reactivate the sector economically.  Speaking from memory, approximately &pound;100 million in assets were disposed of by NAMA before Project Eagle arose.  For one project that arose at the North-South meetings - it was a housing project in Dundonald - Executive members were appreciative of the way that NAMA worked with them.  I do not think that there was an ongoing concern that was expressed every time that I met a Northern Ireland Minister, be it on a bilateral basis or at North-South talks.</p></speech>

From being worried about a fire sale, it was suddenly the case - perhaps across the political spectrum, but certainly on behalf of a number of politicians, including the Minister of Finance, the First Minister, etc. - that the Executive was a big advocate of the process that eventually materialised.  It was a big change.</p></speech>

The Executive was nervous of a fire sale that might damage the Northern Ireland economy when there was no obvious way of selling the whole portfolio.  When a major international property company emerged and approached the Northern Ireland authorities with an interest in the whole portfolio, it seemed to changed the situation.  As I understand it, the company was interested in paying fair value price.  The Deputy can see from the subsequent correspondence that the Executive changed-----</p></speech>

There is a pathway from the meeting to which I referred to the sale of Project Eagle, over which there are many question marks.</p> <p>  Regarding section 10 of the NAMA Act, the sale of assets and the legal requirement that NAMA get best value, would it not be fair to say that the Northern Ireland portfolio was no normal group of properties?  For many reasons and sensitivities concerning Northern Ireland, NAMA had a different way of thinking.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referenced this regarding a number of these issues, but not all.  Would it not be fair to say that, due to a combination of political pressure - unlike us in the South, Northern politicians are not prohibited from applying political pressure - diplomacy stemming from the peace process and so on, the significant business risk in the sale of these assets and, as has been documented in many places, the declining debtor engagement, NAMA's judgment in achieving the greatest value under section 10 became cloudy?  I am not saying that this is necessarily what materialised but, given these four extraordinary and complicating factors, some would be forgiven for thinking that the belief was that this was a worthwhile way of getting out of Northern Ireland.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to a number of these factors.  Maybe the cost to us was &pound;190 million, but there were many different reasons compared with selling assets in Britain or elsewhere.</p></speech>

However, he never expressed to me that the views expressed by Mr. Robinson were not his views.  There is a record, and the committee has a minute of it, of a telephone call which I received from the First Minister's office.  The Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, was in the office.  He was there at the time of the telephone call and that is recorded.  He did not resile from the views expressed by Peter Robinson either.  On all occasions, I gave the information that it was appropriate to give, I outlined the process and I said there would be no one-to-one deal here, that it would have to be a fully competitive process and that if they had a proposal, they should take it to NAMA as I did not deal with the commercial end of this.</p></speech>

Did it not sound odd to the Minister at the time that PIMCO withdrew?  NAMA representatives have said that they got PIMCO to withdraw, but PIMCO is of a different view.  Granted this was a difficult and busy time in the Government as there were ongoing issues regarding charities and the Garda Commissioner but did it not appear odd to the Minister and his Department that within a short space of time once PIMCO withdrew, given the payment fees that were announced, although now there is a difference of views as to whether it withdrew or not, Tughans and Brown Rodnick had switched horses and suddenly another package was put together and the sale was in place?  Did it not seem odd to the Department how quickly this had been turned around?</p></speech>

However, it is fair to say, and the Minister probably would agree with me, that he is not passive in this either.  As Minister for Finance, he has an insight that the rest of us do not have.  He would have been briefed continually.  What his role was and what engagement he had with NAMA arose repeatedly in parliamentary questions.  The Minister said that he maintains a regular dialogue with NAMA and the chairman, that he received appropriate updates regarding NAMA's ongoing process and future plans and that he had also occasionally met the NAMA board, which provided him with an opportunity to share his views and to understand the board's views.

There is a background and it arises from what Deputy Alan Kelly said.  At the end of 2013, we exited the bailout.  We were trying to get back into the market to get the moneys which we had previously received from our colleagues in the Europe Union and the IMF.  NAMA was funded by NAMA bonds-----</p></speech>

The banks were given NAMA bonds in exchange for the loan books they transferred to NAMA.  The NAMA bonds were paying a very small coupon, although they improved the liquidity of the banks.  Frank Daly and the NAMA representatives constantly attended troika meetings.  The European Commission and the European Central Bank, under the NAMA Act, were constantly urging that NAMA comply with the expeditious disposal of assets.  They were doing so because they were providing a great deal of liquidity to the Irish banks at the time and also because the approximately &euro;30 billion was a contingent liability on the Irish balance sheet.  Therefore, there were considerations, not about Northern Ireland, but policy considerations about getting back into the market and getting out of the bailout.  That is why the Oireachtas, in passing the NAMA Act, included the word "expeditiously".  It was to work out the loan books quickly, so the banks could be restored to good health.  The ECB wanted to discontinue the provision of lots of cheap money-----</p></speech>

The Minister would have been aware, by virtue of the fact that he would have received a letter from the Minister of Finance in Northern Ireland, that there was an interest in selling the Project Eagle loan book, which was brought as a package and was obviously referred to NAMA.  The Minister would have been familiar with that from an early stage.  Were any questions asked or did it strike the Department to consider, at that stage or at any stage into the future, how that loan book was assembled?  Page 132 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states that the PIMCO analysis was conducted by way of reverse engineering NAMA's balance sheet and cross-referencing the publicly available information on NAMA's portfolio.  Not all of the loans associated with the properties were based in Northern Ireland.  It was approximately 50:50, with some in the UK and Germany.  They are not all based in Northern Ireland and all of it would not have compromised the Northern Ireland property market.  Given that was the case, did anybody in the Department carry out an analysis of how this came about or did the Minister have any discussions with NAMA on that?  It is strange that one could put something together, just in a paper exercise, which would put together things whose common denominator is people who are from Northern Ireland, rather than the loans being based on properties in Northern Ireland.  Did the Minister consider that at all?</p></speech>

There were a number of Ministers of Finance in Northern Ireland during the period, so the Minister the Deputy refers to is Mr. Sammy Wilson.  He wrote to me and the committee has a copy of his letter among its documents.  The committee also has an accompanying document which sets out in outline, if not in considerable detail, the proposal that PIMCO had made in the first instance to the Minister of Finance in Northern Ireland, not to me.  I advised him that there would not be a bilateral sale without a competitive tendering process.  I outlined to him the way NAMA was required to operate and I forwarded a copy of his letter to NAMA because it was a matter for NAMA.  The document that was generated by PIMCO which he advanced and which the committee has seen was a document on the proposed purchasers' side.</p><p>On the nature of the Project Eagle portfolio, it was entirely a matter for NAMA to assemble the portfolio.  I understood at the time - the Deputy can question NAMA about this when it comes back to the committee, as I understand it will - that the common factor was the debts of Northern Ireland developers or builders.  Even if these loan books arose from property in regional England or Germany, the common factor was that the lien was on Northern Ireland developers.

Did that concern the Minister?  This was a bespoke deal.  There appears to have been a debtors' charter where there was debt forgiveness.  There was a single rather than dual process in terms of the sales process, which would normally be opened up to a wide group before being narrowed down to a small number of bidders.  Did this deviation from the process concern the Minister in relation to the optimum outcome for the taxpayer?</p></speech>

It is a very good question but the Deputy should put it to NAMA, not to me because I cannot help her on that.  As I pointed out in my speech, section 12 of the Act bestows the NAMA board with the powers to "sell or dispose of the whole or any part of the property or investments of NAMA, either together or in portions, for such consideration and on such terms as the Board thinks fit."  That is what Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann put in place - rightly I believe - in the NAMA Act.  The primary concern was to keep politicians out of it and that commercial decisions would be made on their merits.</p></speech>

Second, it is a matter for NAMA to answer the questions.  However, section 12 says that the board is empowered to dispose of property for such consideration and on such terms as the board thinks fit.  That is such a broad-ranging mandate that there was not a process that would apply to every sale.  The process would vary depending on the circumstances of the sale.  These decisions were entirely within the commercial mandate of NAMA and I would not interfere in the commercial mandate of NAMA.  The Deputy would have a different set of questions if I had done so.</p></speech>

If one reverses the position and says that the Minister, if he has any doubts about a transaction, should intervene and stop it, if one had some kind of provision like that, it would mean I would have to sit beside the chief executive of NAMA every time there was a sale and second-guess him and say: "You can go ahead with that; it looks like good value." or "You have to stop that one; it does not look like good value."  That would be a ridiculous legal position.  One is either in or out and the Minister for Finance is out.  The former Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, was absolutely right in the way he couched this and the Oireachtas was absolutely right in the way it enacted it.</p></speech>

There was a big shopping centre worth about &pound;200 million and there were other loans around the &pound;50 million mark or below.  Some of them were very big assets or loans.  There was a deviation from the process.  The Minister wrote a letter on 25 July 2013, which is reproduced on page 22 of the report, in which he states - quite rightly - that NAMA is required to get the best financial return for the taxpayer.  If there was a deviation from a process that was likely to deliver less than an optimum return or involved a bespoke deal that was very big, would that not have caused the Minister concern?  Would he have got advice in his Department on it?  Would it have stood out?</p></speech>

Consequently, I would not know what its process was in disposing of one asset against another.  I also think that section 12, which I read out, gives the discretion to the NAMA board to change the process in any particular sale.  It is wrong to think that there was a standard process that was universally applied.</p> <p>  Under section 9 of the Act, NAMA is independent, as I have said before, but if one looks at sections 57 and 58, it is the Comptroller and Auditor General's responsibility to decide process, not the Minister's.  </p></speech>

I explained the reasons to the Deputy earlier.  We were after coming out of the bailout at the very end of 2013 - this was March 2014 - and a lot of advice I got from eminent people was that we needed a precautionary programme to ensure access to the market.  The rating agencies had told NAMA, together with others present at the meeting, that the contingent liability of NAMA was a drag on our ratings and we would not get investment grade.  The European Central Bank, ECB, was constantly urging NAMA to sell assets so that it could redeem the bonds to take pressure off the Irish banks.  Of course I had concerns about it but I did not know anything about anything to do with this.  I never met Mr. Cushnahan, who was recommended by the Minister, Sammy Wilson, to the late Brian Lenihan, and was appointed by the board of NAMA to its advisory committee.  The board of NAMA reappointed Mr. Cushnahan in my period of office.  Again, I was told that it was reappointing him but I did not know anything that would cause me to object.  As far as I was concerned, at the point of reappointment, he was a satisfactory member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee.</p></speech>

Even if one looks at the draft of the Act, it is mentioned twice that NAMA should dispose of the assets expeditiously.  There was no question of the ECB or the troika underlining a situation where loan books could be worked out to 2020.  The troika wanted expeditious disposal of the assets to take the contingent liability off the Irish balance sheet and to improve the Irish banks' position.  There is no secret about that.  That happened at the troika meetings on several occasions.</p> <p>  The rating agencies were involved.  In order that Ireland would be able to access the market, we needed to have the status of investment grade.  We have broker commentary by the end of the 2014 that all the major rating agencies had classified the Irish sovereign as investment grade and explicitly referenced NAMA's progress to date in their decision to do so.  I can quote from the rating agencies where they specifically referenced NAMA and the reduction in contingent liability as the reason for upgrading the Irish sovereign to investment grade.  One can see what the rating agencies, Standard &amp;amp; Poors, Moody's, DBRS and others said about Ireland.  Standard &amp;amp; Poors said, "Ireland's net general Government debt could reduce faster than we currently expect if NAMA monetises its loan assets more rapidly, resulting in either repayment of its obligation or further accumulation of cash."   NAMA would have been in constant contact with the rating agencies.  The head of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is on the board of NAMA.  There is no doubt that was a factor, but in my view we would be going down a cul de sac if we were to say there was political pressure from Northern Ireland or from the South.  The pressure was not political but from the troika for the reasons I have outlined and from the rating agencies.  It was very good advice from the rating agencies.</p> <p>  At the end of the previous session, I noted the Comptroller and Auditor General said that the option of working out the loan books to 2020 was an option.  It was not.  From attending troika meetings or listening to the ECB or the rating agencies, one would know that they wanted NAMA to fulfil its mandate and dispose of its assets expeditiously.  Nobody in Northern Ireland on any side of the political divide ever said anything to me that could have been assumed to put political pressure on me or on NAMA to do anything other than dispose of the assets in an orderly fashion and get best value for the Irish Exchequer and relieve the burden on the economy of Northern Ireland from having so many significant people involved in impaired loans and not able to play their previous role in the development of the Northern Ireland economy.</p></speech>

If I were to look at it from a policy point of view, I did not think that was an option given the difficulties there were in terms of the NAMA bonds, the ECB and the pressure we were under to reduce the debt.  Just as we came out of the programme in January to March 2014, I do not think it was an option for us to decide not to sell a really large portfolio purely on the grounds that we might or might not get more money.  We had to set a value and decide whether it was value for money.  That is what NAMA did.</p></speech>

I feel I established from the questions I put to NAMA that in terms of the process it followed in preparation for this sale, it put its agent in place, having designed the process, and prescribed how the process would proceed.  We also established last week the typical process that NAMA would follow when it was selling property.  I used an example of selling ten houses in Westmeath and outlined that the typical process would be to source three valuations and three sales proposals from three different sources and that would then inform the decision. This would take place at the point of sale or point of appointment of an agent.  Would it be a cause of concern to the Minister if he were to learn that following the presentations last week, the Committee of Public Accounts established that no current valuations were sought or provided to inform this decision by NAMA other than stock valuations that were on file from a date in the past?</p></speech>

I am only informing the Minister of what went on last week.  We established last week that if we were selling two or three bed semi-detached houses in Limerick for a small developer in the Minister's constituency for &euro;200,000, three valuations would have to be provided to go into NAMA.  NAMA would assess the valuations and pick the one it thought best and typically would add a sweetener.  That is how it would determine the sale price.  Would it be a cause of concern that this did not happen when it came to the largest property transaction in the history of the State?</p></speech>

I was eight years of age when Deputy Noonan was appointed Minister for Finance for the first time.

It is an indicator to the vendor of what price to accept, but the market decides the price.  I do not know why NAMA did not value properties individually.  There were many of them there.  I do not know the answer.  The Deputy should ask NAMA.  The absence of a valuation did not change what one would get on the market, it changed the assessment of whether the best price was achieved.  Is that not right, from the Deputy's experience?</p></speech>

No political pressure was put on him either by Sinn F&eacute;in or the DUP, which were the principal participants in government.  The answer to the question is that nothing that the Northern Ireland politicians did in my mind contributed to reducing the price.  There is a difference of opinion between NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office.  That difference of opinion on price has not been resolved.  We would be hoping that the committee&rsquo;s deliberations would help to resolve it.</p></speech>

Then there is a diametrically opposite view from NAMA.

When we wrote to the Comptroller and Auditor General on the issues of the process which he had taken, our question was whether the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office had spoken to the NAMA board itself.  I note the committee will interview the NAMA board.  To some extent, that meets my concerns in that area.</p> <p>  There was also a question of whether the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office had spoken to Lazard directly, rather than just looking at the paper issues.  Those were the two main issues that were outstanding at the end of the process.  </p> <p>  Earlier, we touched on the fact that Mr. Daly made reference to the robust exchanges between our Department and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office.  I have been involved in many value-for-money reports over quite a long number of years - more than I care to remember - with the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office and with both current and previous staff there.  There are frequently, at various points, robust exchanges between sponsoring Departments, agencies and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office.  By and large, most of those exchanges end up with an agreed report.  The bulk of this report stands on its own merits and has no issues on which I have discussions.</p></speech>

A report in the <i>Irish Independent</i>on 19 February 2014 stated:</p><blockquote>Mr. Noonan told reporters he had instructed senior NAMA officials to look at the various to look at the various options, but he said no decisions had yet been taken.<br /><br />&quot;But when I come around to making decisions, I want the decisions to be evidence-based,&quot; [the Minister said.] &hellip; &quot;I want them to explore the implications of bringing forward the sale, because the market would be able to carry a big sale at this point.&quot;</blockquote> <p>Would the Minister contradict that?</p></speech>

That is what the issue was and I was advised by a lot of people but I decided, on the balance of advantage, that it was better to get out of the precautionary programme.  I was conscious that the ECB in particular, the European Commission and the rating agencies who would decide whether we would have access to the markets, were constantly referencing the contingent liability of NAMA bonds on the State balance sheet, because we had guaranteed them.  As a result of that, from a policy point of view I was interested to see if the NAMA bonds could be redeemed at a faster rate.  The only thing that could redeem them was the sale of assets to provide the cash to NAMA to redeem the bonds.  That was my policy perspective but I did not direct them, I asked for their advice.  The advice I was seeking was whether the market would take it and whether we would still get best value for the taxpayer.  That was the area I was-----</p></speech>

Mr. Frank Daly was here last week and he said: "There was a concern that a fully open sales process, which would by its nature take longer to conduct, would freeze activity in the Northern Ireland market for a period of nine to 12 months".  He then went on to say that NAMA "did not believe that a fully open sales process would yield any additional benefit in terms of identifying other credible bidders".  He conceded, in the context of one of the criticisms of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding restrictions of marketing, that bidders had concerns that this was not a fully open and competitive process.  Mr. Daly, the Chairman of NAMA, said that the agency "did not believe that a fully open sales process would yield any additional benefit".  He added that NAMA was "very cognisant of the [political] damage that a fully open process could cause".  How does that square with the direction or view that the Minister gave or the conversation he had in that conference call, that this had to be a fully open and competitive process?</p></speech>

I do not see a contradiction.  Mr. Carville wishes to make a comment.</p></speech>

When NAMA did an analysis of bidders in the commercial real estate market in Europe from 2013 to 2015 that would have undertaken loan transactions in excess of &euro;1 billion, those nine bidders accounted for 88% in European terms and 92% in UK and Irish terms.

He said that this was not a fully open process and that NAMA was "very cognisant of the [political] damage that a fully open process could cause".</p></speech>

Notwithstanding what the Chairman has just said regarding the comments of Mr. Daly, the Chairman of NAMA, I have an observation to make about that line of questioning from Deputy Cullinane.  My understanding is that NAMA is obliged to run a competitive process under the NAMA Act and if that is the case, would that not in fact be contrary to its own requirements?  I appreciate that there were nine bidders, as Mr. Carville has pointed out.  He has given the percentages and it is clear that they were some of the better bidders out there but, taking on board what was said and the fact that there is an obligation on NAMA under the Act - I cannot recall the exact section, but I think it was Part 7 - to ensure the best result for the taxpayer, then that would include -----</p></speech>

There is a requirement that the agency gets best value for money but that is separate.  The Act does not say anything about a fully open process, a half open process or any other kind of process.  It says that the board sets down the process.</p><p>That is what the Act states on that point.  </p><p> In terms of getting value for money, one can get very pedantic on what constitutes a fully open process.  As the Chairman said, that is probably a question for Mr. Frank Daly.  From the point of view of the Department,  it is more important to have a competitive process with the maximum number of credible bidders than to have advertised it, etc.  In reality, it is entirely a matter for the board, as set out in the Act.</p></speech>

I would like to ask the Minister about something that has not been raised today.

What I am saying is I did not rule it out absolutely.

My opinion is that at some point in the process NAMA decided that it had its white horse in the form of an acceptable bid, regardless of the terms and conditions associated with it, and simply went through from there.  Does the Minister accept this?  I appreciate that NAMA has made a point about political concerns.  It is a bit strange for a financial institution like NAMA to do this, given that its purpose is to get the best value for money for the taxpayer.  Does the Minister accept that there were problems, or at least that there is a perception of a problem, in the way NAMA conducted its business in the latter days of the deal?</p></speech>

I am also conscious of the evidence given by the Chairman and the chief executive of NAMA.  As I have said on a number of occasions, contrary positions have been taken on a number of matters.  I think everybody is hoping the Committee of Public Accounts will help to resolve these disagreements, to put it at its mildest.  NAMA was entirely legally entitled to do anything in the sale process.  It was not a matter for the Minister to tell it what to do when it was acting in accordance with the Act.</p></speech>

As I said when I asked my second question, the position adopted by the Government is that a commission of investigation will look into Project Eagle.  Does the Minister have a view on the difference between Project Arrow and Project Eagle?  I refer to the fact that they do not appear to adhere to any of the same basic principles within the two projects.  What is the Minister's view?</p></speech>

The board of NAMA has full legal authority to dispose of assets as it sees fit.  It follows from that legal authorisation that it would treat different portfolios and sales differently and would have processes that vary to suit the circumstances of the disposal.  NAMA had extensive property in London, Dublin, Northern Ireland, regional areas of the United Kingdom, Germany and other places.  I do not think anyone would say it should have adopted the same process in all jurisdictions or for all portfolios.  One might have a different view on this - perhaps that of a layman; I would be a layman in this regard - if one was disposing of hotels or building land rather than residential property.  The processes would be different.</p></speech>

When the Minister was informed in March of the fact that fixers' fees, or success fees, were to be paid to Mr. Frank Cushnahan, a former member of the advisory committee, he heard of the difficulties that that caused for PIMCO and so on.  I put it to the Minister, at that point the reason for his intervention was not around the commercial mandate of NAMA but was around governance, proper practice and the fact it had become clear that the process had been corrupted.  It had nothing to do with him making a commercial call for NAMA but everything to do with him stating the blindingly apparent, that where a former member of that advisory committee was to receive a payment, clearly the process had been corrupted.</p></speech>

The Minister failed to do so.  He has never given an explanation as to why that was the case save today, where he said that the chairman of NAMA informed him that it was about to consult, that it had taken a decision to carry on and that it was going to get advice from its financial adviser.  Is Mr. Noonan aware that as it turns out, according to Mr. Daly, NAMA did not tell its financial adviser about the fixers' fees?</p></speech>

It is a matter of established fact that he was made aware of the fixers' fees.  It is a matter of established fact that he failed to intervene.  He has advanced, at least in part, a rationale for doing so.  I am challenging it because, quite frankly, it does not hold water.  In his opening statement he said that the board were to have a discussion and it was going to take advice from its financial adviser.  I am just informing the Minister, in case he did not know, that they did not even tell their financial adviser, they say, about these fixers' fees.</p> <p>  Let me ask the Minister as question.  He had a conversation with Mr. Frank Daly, he said to him "We're gonna talk to the board, we're gonna talk to the financial adviser."  It seems to me that the Minister took, on face value, that the financial adviser was informed and came back and said that everything is okay.  Given the seriousness of this conflict of interest, what did the Minister or his officials do to establish what care was taken by NAMA in respect of the process and to get under the skin of what has to have been very shocking news to the Minister, in respect of Frank Cushnahan?</p></speech>

It is as obvious as the nose on one's face that it is irrelevant to the Minister for Finance but what is highly relevant is what he did and what decisions he took when this conflict of interest emerged.  I will move on.</p> <p>  From NAMA's briefing document, we were told the Department of Finance, following a meeting with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in early June 2016, indicated its surprise at the Comptroller and Auditor General's lack of knowledge of the loan sales market and advised that it would benefit greatly from external advice.  As it happens, by June 2016 we are on draft three of the Comptroller and Auditor General report, so I am assuming the meeting happened in that context.  NAMA cites a specific meeting where this allegation was made that there was insufficient expertise in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  It is on paper.</p></speech>

That particular issue arose at that meeting.  It is just something that arose at a meeting.  It was not a fundamental questioning.  The fact is the people working in my Department now, who have much outside expertise, questioned the approach taken when they saw the report.</p></speech>

When we strip everything else away, that is what it comes down to.  It strikes me of worthy of examination that it seems the witness shared that view, at least in June 2016.</p></speech>

Earlier, an issue was mentioned that has been of some comment.  It relates to the appropriate discount rate applied to the portfolio.  It is the position of the Department of Finance in this regard that NAMA was right and the Comptroller and Auditor General was wrong.  We could get no evidence, bar retrospective commentary, to back up the choice of a lower discount rate.  I ask the Minister and perhaps his officials, more appropriately, on what basis does he come down on the side of the lower discount.  I say this because he has gone to some lengths to say he is not across the detail and the Department does not get into the minutiae.  How is it that the Department arrived at that conclusion?  Mr. Reid was attributed as arriving at that conclusion.</p></speech>

I suppose the concern I have with the very low discount rate is that it is far lower than the cost of funds of any purchaser of loans.  It goes to this whole policy question of whether it was an option to hold everything to 2020.</p></speech>

If one applies a discount rate lower than anybody who would buy the assets, there is no possibility of ever selling the assets.  That is if one consistently applies a discount rate lower than the potential purchasers.  One must get a discount rate that takes the best possible-----</p></speech>

It is a point of contention.  We asked NAMA to produce the information and not the Department of Finance.  It is fine in 2016 to construct the argument of 5% versus 10%.  The net question we will have to ask NAMA to demonstrate relates to its working paper and discussion at the board at the time of sale, when it used the higher discount rate.  It has not produced any evidence yet.  If it does, we will consider it.  If NAMA can only produce evidence on a discount rate two years after the process completed, it would be quite a different issue.  Do the witnesses understand the point we are making?</p></speech>

Following on from what Ms Nolan said, it is not an issue of being right or wrong, it is a difference of opinion.  The problem, of course, is that there is a difference of &euro;190 million, which is not small change in anybody's language, especially in the context of the various discussions in which all D&aacute;il Deputies will be involved next Tuesday.  The Minister has said the Committee on Public Accounts is the right and correct forum in which to resolve the technical issues under discussion, but he has not been holding back in offering his views on the deal and pointing it in a direction or moulding a result, nor have his officials.  He pointed towards the Comptroller and Auditor General and said he had listened to his evidence last week, in respect of when he had talked about a process working out to 2020 and said that, with respect, he disagreed, especially given that the ECB or the troika were breathing down his neck.  Ms Nolan was more forthright and said that, from a policy point of view, it was not an option.  As such, from the Minister's point of view, is this the done deal in terms of his summation of the issue and is it the case that the Comptroller and Auditor General is wrong?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.557" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016100600002#KK04000"><p>No.  There is, as we all know, a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General and there are hearings, including this one.  At the end of the day, I presume the committee will bring forward a report and it may even make recommendations in the normal way.  All I am saying is I saw the Comptroller and Auditor General in a replay of his evidence on RTE.  I have great respect for him and his office and the work done, but I am trying to give the committee the context.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General says, as he said that night when I saw the report from the time he gave evidence here, that working out the assets to 2020 would have been an option for NAMA, it would not in my view.  NAMA was required under law to work out its assets expeditiously.  There was then the fact that the NAMA bonds which it had paid for the loan assets to the banks were a contingent liability of &euro;30 billion on the State which was affecting Ireland's credit rating.  It was also affecting its access to money on the markets when we had got out of the bailout.  Project Eagle occurred three months after getting out of the bailout at the end of 2013.  I am stating an opinion and supporting it by giving the committee the context at the time.</p></speech>

NAMA was represented at the meetings with the troika; therefore, it would very much have been aware of the other context.  I am saying the committee should not assume that NAMA was responding to political pressure when it speeded up the sale of its assets.  There was stronger pressure from the circumstances in which we found ourselves at that stage.  That is all I am saying.</p></speech>

Let me just say in his opening-----</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts is the place where a discussion on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the divergences of opinion between the Comptroller and Auditor General and NAMA can be resolved.  There may be other issues arising and the Government has already announced that there are discussions with party leaders to further matters.</p></speech>

As a matter of fact, the Comptroller and Auditor General's office conducted an audit in 2014 and did not bring to my attention or that of anyone else that it had a problem with the sale of Project Eagle in terms of a loss to the taxpayer.  That was after the event.  Now that there is a more careful study, with access to greater information, the Comptroller and Auditor General has arrived at a different opinion as he is absolutely entitled to do.  That is in conflict with the opinion being expressed by NAMA and I cannot resolve it for the committee.  There is a difference of opinion, but it is a difference of opinion between two highly respected agencies and people.</p></speech>

I did not believe there was a probable loss until I saw the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I knew the issue was being raised, but in 2014 when this occurred, nobody said to me that there was a probable loss.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General's office conducted an audit on the 2014 accounts, it made no suggestion there was a problem.</p></speech>

In addition, it had a concern about the circumstances surrounding PIMCO's withdrawal from the sale competition.  The Minister is correct to say the report, as we have it, had not been produced, but for the purposes of accuracy, the loss was, in fact, noted, as was the compressed nature of the process.</p></speech>

That was the position as outlined to me.  I am not saying that is what Mr. Daly said, but that was the sense of what he said.  If the Deputy considers the timeline as well, he will see it was on 13 March, the same day I was heading for Toronto to represent the country in Canada for the St. Patrick's Day events.  I got the report and I established that in parallel or shortly afterwards the officials in my Department got exactly the same report, so when I came back, we began to deal with it.</p></speech>

Reflecting on the events here last week, it got quite aggressive at times.  It was nearly O.K. Corral stuff.  Frank Daly certainly came in here with the holsters loaded and guns firmly pointed at the Comptroller and Auditor General's head, in the metaphorical sense.  Maybe there is no smoking gun here, but on the issue of the substantial report that has now been given and the media reports of the probable losses of &pound;190 million, the Comptroller and Auditor General, as I am sure the Minister would agree, would not make that statement lightly, given the fact that it would get such media exposure.  Frank Daly said that if the words "probable loss" had never been used, there would be no media commentary and that in fact NAMA would have been thanked for having done a good job.  Is it really that simple?</p></speech>

There is an issue surrounding the probable loss but, in examining it, the difference of opinion is not about the probable loss, but rather about the causes of the probable loss.  As I understand, the Comptroller and Auditor General's view is that if a different process had been used against a different timeline and a different discount rate were applied, the probable loss would not have occurred-----</p></speech>

It evolves into a whole other scenario in that the Comptroller and Auditor General report details the record-keeping of NAMA and states that it was not adequate.  The Minister will therefore understand how, from the media's point of view, a significant probe is happening outside by third parties in here when such a respected authority says that there was not even proper record-keeping surrounding this whole deal.</p></speech>

The Minister said there was an open competitive process.  However, I will quote an interesting response Frank Daly gave last week to a question from Deputy Rock regarding the former's analysis from Northern Ireland:</p><blockquote>I cannot tell the Deputy how many times I was in Northern Ireland and was told not to go auctioning Northern Ireland or go putting a for sale sign on Northern Ireland.  On one occasion somebody said to me, &quot;You might not have got us in 1922.  Do not think that you are going to get us now through NAMA.&quot;</blockquote> <p>That is a fairly stark statement to make.  The Minister says that there was an open competitive process, but Mr. Daly talks in those kinds of terms.</p></speech>

Does the Minister think it is right and proper that that is the kind of commentary we have?  Does he think that there was an attitude here to get rid of this portfolio as quickly as possible?  The Comptroller and Auditor General has said that once the property was put up for sale in one portfolio, there would naturally be a depression in the price, and that it could have been held on to.  Does the Minister maintain his position that he disagrees fundamentally with that?</p></speech>

I assume that when it got the offer from PIMCO originally, which did not go direct to NAMA but went into the Northern Ireland authorities, it realised that there was a potential to sell all of Project Eagle to one willing purchaser at a good price, and the process ensued from that, in my view.  It is a matter for NAMA.  It is-----</p></speech>

I am giving the Deputy a new context which I do not think has been brought before the committee before as to why there was pressure on NAMA to expeditiously sell the portfolio, as it was instructed to under the Act.

That is all I am saying, that I believe it was not an option to work the assets out to 2020 and then sell everything in 2020.  I do not think that was possible under the circumstances and under the way the legislation is framed.  On the other side of it, I freely admit that there is a difference of opinion between the Comptroller and Auditor General's view on the process, the timeline and the discount rate and NAMA's view, and that results in a different estimation of value.

He has withstood rapid-fire successions of questions, and we appreciate his taking the time to respond.  I think it is four years since a Minister has appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Deputy Brendan Howlin, I believe, was the last Minister to do so.</p> <p>  It is evident from the Minister's clarifications today that NAMA is an independent commercial entity, and it is very important that the committee understand that.  The import of the NAMA Act is very clear in that regard, and I very much welcome the statutory commission of investigation, particularly as it relates to the differences between the Comptroller and Auditor General report and the NAMA report.  The commission will help us understand what happened.  When the Minister says "without delay", is the commission in the process of being set up?  Do we know who the chair will be or anything like that?  Section 9 is very clear that NAMA is independent in the performance in its functions.</p><p>I know there should be no interference in the sales process which is covered under section 10.  That is important.  I would like to understand the difference between the Department&rsquo;s oversight of NAMA and ministerial oversight.  </p></speech>

The Department assists the Minister but does most of the relationship work with NAMA and advises me on the issues which are within my remit.</p> <p>  On the commission of inquiry which the Government has decided to set up, this has resulted from discussions between the party leaders and the Taoiseach and the Government has decided in principle to have such an inquiry.  I have not been involved in the discussions for two reasons, I was not at the first Cabinet meeting where this was decided and I am going to be within the terms of reference of any foreseeable inquiry and as a consequence I assume that I will have to give evidence to the inquiry as I am giving evidence to the committee today.  It would be inappropriate for me to be an architect of the inquiry before which I might have to appear.  I do not have specific details. </p></speech>

How the agency operates sales is entirely a matter for NAMA.</p> <p>  Let us put this to bed and out of the way.  The Comptroller and Auditor General sets out and takes NAMA discounts and expected cash from debtors for two reasons.  He sets this out exactly.  He goes on to say that given the strategic decision to change policy and sell off all the assets in one go, he and the taxpayer would have expected to see outlined somewhere why there was a change of policy and why NAMA did not stick to the 5.5%.  He did not pick the figure.  That is what he is raising.</p> <p>  The Minister has read the whole report.  Let us look at conflicts of interest.

I will set out some of the findings.  Section 37 relates to Mr. Cushnahan.  The Northern Ireland Audit Office stated it was concerned about the involvement of a former non-executive member of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive audit committee who resigned from that committee.  The report goes on to state that he worked for the NIHE and then took up a position as chairman of the Red Sky group in April 2007.  I understand this group supplied contracts to a local authority in Northern Ireland.  This is the key point.  The report states his involvement was totally unethical and could and should have been avoided.  Was any member of the deputation aware of that in 2013, or was brought to their attention?  This subsequently surfaced on "Spotlight", as I understand it.</p></speech>

I do not know anything about Mr. Cushnahan.  His appointment arose from a recommendation by the Northern Ireland Minister of Finance, Sammy Wilson, to NAMA.  The board of NAMA appointed him as one of two advisers on Northern Ireland.  Normally, decisions in Northern Ireland are cross-party, because that is the way the Northern Ireland Executive worked.  However, no one from any party in Northern Ireland brought to my attention the fact that they had a problem with Mr. Cushnahan.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with it.  That is it.  I am simply asking whether the Minister was aware of it because this leads in to Mr. Cushnahan on the Northern Ireland advisory committee and the question of when the Minister became aware of the fact that he resigned.

Is that not right?  That was on 14 November.  The letter from Mr. Daly stated that he wished to advise the Minister of the resignation of Frank Cushnahan as and from 7 November.  He further stated that he planned to take the opportunity to discuss Mr. Cushnahan's resignation with the board and that he would discuss a replacement with the Minister and the Department in due course.

Did alarm bells ring in his head in relation to the alleged payment to a former member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee who had been on that committee from 2010 right up to November 2013?  In the period, all of 2013 - I have all the minutes here before me - there was a discussion in relation to PIMCO and in relation to selling off the assets in one portfolio.  The Minister or the officials would have been aware of that because there was constant liaison.  My question is, even retrospectively in March of 2014, did alarm bells not go off in the Minister's head with a former member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee allegedly getting a huge sum?</p></speech>

The Minister referred accurately to the note by the principal private secretary to the then First Minister, Mr. Jeremy Gardner, on 27 September 2013.  It states that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, explained that despite its commercial mandate NAMA had a range of social obligations, that, however, Deputy Noonan pointed out that NAMA could not impose conditions on a buyer following the sale, that Deputy Noonan indicated that while there could be no exclusivity clause, there was, in his view, only one potential buyer, and that Deputy Noonan undertook to discuss the situation with the CEO of NAMA and was confident that both administrations would work together with the potential buyer to overcome any difficulties.  Is the Minister saying that is incorrect?</p></speech>

Three more bidders were contacted and two showed an interest.  Those two came forward out of ten that were considered after there was a leak about the sale in February 2014.  Again, the Department had to do something about it.  Eventually there were nine bidders from a very reactive process.</p> <p>  If the witnesses have read the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, I really would like them to come back to me on the issues he raised about the process, the restriction in the data room, accessing local valuers and many other concerns which not one of the witnesses have addressed today regarding the report.  There are two aspects.  We have a Comptroller and Auditor General's report that stands, and really it is up to whoever is questioning it to show us where it does not stand, and nobody has told us anything about the conflict of interest or how it might have been handled differently.</p></speech>

I refer to the minute of the meeting taken on my side.  It states the Minister confirmed that NAMA would be a willing seller of its Northern Ireland assets at an appropriate price having undertaken an appropriate sales process.  The Minister explained that NAMA avoids bilateral sales processes as not being conducive to achieving best value, which is one of NAMA's primary objectives.  That minute corresponds with my full memory of the meeting in Stormont with then First Minister Robinson.</p></speech>

I thank him for coming before the committee and fair play to him for being here.  Given NAMA's autonomy, and it has its own business to do and no one can interfere and there can be no political interference, the only body that really can question it and have oversight of it is the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in its report, and that is what happened on this occasion.  At the end of the day, there was a difference of opinion on the report, but the only one that really can analyse what NAMA is doing and how it carries out its business, bar the Minister, is the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Am I right on this?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General produces an annual report, which goes to the Government and is published before the D&aacute;il.  It produces quarterly reports.  Some of the Comptroller and Auditor General staff are embedded in NAMA and can review matters on an ongoing basis.  Obviously the Comptroller and Auditor General holds NAMA accountable, as does the Committee of Public Accounts, but I am also subject to parliamentary questions on NAMA.  There are a lot of streams of accountability other than the oversight of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts, but that is the primary and ultimate forum for accountability in my view.</p></speech>

One of the purposes of the Act is to get best value for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

Was the Minister worried at any stage when he learned of the fee share arrangement, particular with regard to Mr. Cushnahan and his involvement on the Northern Ireland advisory committee, and other personnel, whom we will not mention, who had a fee share arrangement.  At any stage was the Minister worried personally about this?  Was it of concern to him that this was happening?  In other words, could there have been some involvement of insider dealing and personal gain because of what was revealed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.805" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016100600002#RR01400"><p>As I said I was concerned, as anyone would be.  I am sure if the Deputy were in similar circumstances he would be concerned as well, but it was PIMCO, the proposed purchaser, that had promised to pay some money to Mr. Cushnahan and others, after their dialogue with NAMA, but it withdrew from the sales process so it was off the pitch.  As a consequence, that alleviated my concern.  If NAMA had continued to sell to PIMCO in those circumstances then there would be a major issue, but once it had withdrawn I was still concerned it happened but I was not actively concerned that it was going to interfere with the sales process in any way.  I could see it was important as well that the sales process would not collapse.  It was a very crucial time in the restoration of the health of the Irish economy and Irish finances.  I took the advice of the NAMA board, which was communicated through the chairman, that there was sufficient competitive tension in the remaining bidders and they proceeded with the sale.</p></speech>

I know the Minister has no say, but was he worried at that stage about continuing on with Cerberus after PIMCO withdrew?  Did the Minister have any concerns?</p></speech>

What I was aware of, because I was advised by the chairman of NAMA, was that it had got a statement from the ultimate purchaser, Cerberus, to the effect that it was not in a position whereby it had contracted or promised to pay money to anybody outside normal payments.</p></speech>

While I get information at a primary colours level, I would not know the detail of a sale.  It had been brought to my attention by NAMA that the advisers moved to the next potential successful bidder.  I am not sure if Mr. Reid was there at that time, but he might repeat it.</p></speech>

A Northern Ireland committee was set up and has done a review.  We are here doing a review.  There are inquiries in the UK and the United States, and more than likely the Minister will set up an inquiry shortly.  What is the Minister's comment on this?  Why do we have all these inquiries and reviews if everything is above board and everything was done right?  Why does the Minister think all this is happening if there is nothing wrong, everything is above board, everything was done right and there is no inside trading or inside dealing and no gains?  Why is all this going on?  Why are we here today and why do we have a Northern Ireland committee and inquiries in the UK and the United States?</p></speech>

There is the National Crime Agency, NCA, investigation in the UK and there is also a report to the Garda.  That is where the wrongdoing is.  There is no suggestion in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that NAMA acted illegally or improperly or, indeed, irregularly, which was the report in the newspapers after the leak.  He certainly says what we know he says in the result, but he does not say that there was illegality on the part of NAMA.  That is not the allegation.  The purpose of what is going on here today, as I understand it, is to see if the conflicts which are apparent between NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General can be resolved.</p><p>If they can, they can and if they cannot, they cannot.  There is such contention now that, as Deputy Aylward rightly put it, there are so many people thinking that something improper happened that it is probably in the public interest to have a judicial inquiry and that is the position that has been taken by the Taoiseach and the other party leaders.</p></speech>

To finish up, there is much criticism of the Department of Finance in the review by the Northern Ireland Committee for Finance and Personnel.  I read some of the report and it is very critical of the Minister.  It stated that &quot;given the seriousness of the revelation by PIMCO, it is unclear why the Irish Government&rsquo;s Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, did not intervene at this point, by exercising his general powers of direction over NAMA to suspend the sales process until matters were investigated fully&quot;.  The committee also noted that:</p><blockquote>Minister Noonan did not inform the Northern Ireland Executive of this development.  In addition, the Committee regrets that Minister Noonan did not encourage NAMA to attend an oral hearing of the Committee.  The Committee recognises that the Irish Government may therefore wish to clarify these issues.</blockquote></speech>

I will give Deputy Burke a moment because he will be the next speaker but has just returned to the meeting.  There are a few questions for the departmental officials arising from the first round of today's meeting.  The Department contacted the Comptroller and Auditor General about his report and said it had a couple of issues.  Ms Nolan said earlier that the Comptroller and Auditor General would not meet the board of NAMA.  Why would she think the Comptroller and Auditor General should meet the board?  She introduced this as an issue today.</p></speech>

I felt that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was very critical of decisions by the board of NAMA and drew conclusions about what the board did or did not decide or why it decided.  It would have been a courtesy at least.  I knew the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General had been invited to speak to the board.  If it had done so, it might have come to the same conclusion.  I am not saying it would have come to a different conclusion.  I am merely saying that I felt it would have been proper for the Comptroller and Auditor General to do that.</p></speech>

Why would she think those two people did not adequately represent the board and that there was a need for the Comptroller and Auditor General to meet other board members?  I have to put it to Ms Nolan in that context because-----</p></speech>

This decision was made by the entire board, not just by the chairman and the chief executive, and the Comptroller and Auditor General was very critical of the decision.  The board invited the Comptroller and Auditor General to meet it and I just thought it would be more sensible for him to do that if he was going to publish a report that would clearly lead to a big row and I thought there was a possibility they might come to a better agreement and understanding.</p></speech>

At no stage in any of those reports, did the Comptroller and Auditor General meet the boards of those organisations.

My understanding is that there was difficulty in assessing how the NAMA board moved from the materials presented to it at the board meeting to its decision to set a reserve price for the portfolio.  We thought an understanding of how it moved from that position through deliberation to a decision of the board would have been aided by a discussion with the board members to understand those deliberations, which were fairly not captured in the materials available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

It was in the context of hoping to resolve some of the differences that I made that suggestion.  The question of whether or not the committee wants to meet Lazard is-----</p></speech>

The Minister properly explained what I would call the financial context of the country.  On exiting the troika arrangement, we did not have a safety net and had to get our ratings right.  It was said there was an undercurrent such that the cashflow projections of the Comptroller and Auditor General were on the basis of the agency running until 2020.  A witness or the Minister, or perhaps both, said today that, in view of the international pressure to lower our national debt and remove contingent liability of something going wrong in NAMA, the year 2020 was "not an option".  That was said here by the delegation today.  Do the witnesses accept that?</p></speech>

In summer 2013, the agency adopted the rate of 5.5%, with the possibility of some exceptions.  There was a very minor qualification but the Department is essentially saying at this stage that, in light of our leaving the troika arrangement and the bailout, the year 2020 was not an option.  If the Department believes this, it should have been conveyed to NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General should have been able to pick up on it in the knowledge that 2020 was not an option.  NAMA still seems to be working on that basis but the Department of Finance has a different view.  Does the Minister understand where I am coming from?</p></speech>

I will let Ms Nolan contribute in a minute.  NAMA was supposed to end its activities in 2020.  If all loans were worked out to 2020, there would be a firesale of potentially &euro;13 billion in assets in the last year of its operation.  That would not make sense.</p></speech>

I will ask the supplementary question first.  The NAMA consideration in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was based on the concept of workout.  There was a difference based on potential cash receipts in 2017.  NAMA, therefore, seems to have been accepting the 2020 workout at the time.  Now it does not seem to have been an option.</p></speech>

The question is how quickly one winds it down.  It is not just a matter of how quickly one winds down this portfolio.  I totally accept that if one just examines this one, one could wind it down more slowly but NAMA had a whole range of portfolios and was under huge pressure to sell quantities of them.  The issue from our point of view - it was a very serious concern, certainly in 2013 and probably into 2014 - was that on winding down, one would sell all the London stuff at the beginning only to find that the other assets could not be sold, thus leaving the agency with a whole lot at the end.  This was said by many commentators.  The opportunity to sell one big piece was a big positive for NAMA at the time.  Consider the option of saying in respect of all those types of opportunities - I am not saying anything about Project Eagle in itself - that we will keep all the assets to the end and wind everything down gradually.  Sales, by their nature, are bitty.  If one wants to get rid of everything by 2020, one actually has to sell big bits and small bits when the opportunities arise.</p></speech>

I will use a phrase the witnesses have used several times today.  There is a reference in the legislation to dealing with the loans "expeditiously".  One cannot reconcile saying "expeditiously" and saying everything will be kept until 2020.  It was never envisaged in the legislation to keep the whole lot until 2020.  As the witnesses have said here all day, the legislation referred to working "expeditiously", with an end date of 2020.  It was not a matter of holding everything until 2020.  The Comptroller and Auditor General followed what the legislation said in terms of a sales process over the period.  This is in the report.  Issues arose over how quickly some of the sales would actually happen.</p></speech>

That would not be justifiable if one thought one still did not have a competitive tension.  That is why, in the end, it is a decision by the NAMA board, and not a decision by the Department, Minister or anyone else.</p></speech>

Mr. Reid might not be able to comment on this, although he might because he seems to know quite a bit about these issues.  Those organisations had not got access to the data room on behalf of Cerberus.  Surely it would have been very unethical for them to bring to Cerberus any information they got when they were working for PIMCO.  Therefore, what were they bringing to Cerberus?  Is Mr. Reid saying they could have brought information I believe they should not be allowed to bring?  What were they bringing to Cerberus?  Mr. Reid must have been a little surprised at the end of the day when they showed up with the other bidder?  Does he understand the question I am asking?</p></speech>

I will be very brief and focus on one issue, the discount rate of 5.5%.  This committee will have to assess whether there was a loss to the State.  This is arguably the main issue that will decide that.  If one uses a rate of 5.5%, the implication is that there is a loss of over &euro;190 million.  If it is 10%, it reverses that completely.</p> <p>  When the NAMA representatives were before us, Mr. Brian McEnery was making it clear that one of the prime assets in the control of NAMA was Dundrum shopping centre, which was sold at a discount rate of approximately 3.6%.  He also cited the case of a HSE property with a lease of 30 years and said the lease had a Government stamp with a harp on it.  It was sold at a discount rate of 7.5%.</p><p>I know it is normal to have robust exchanges with the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of teasing out points and assessing the rates that are appropriate.  However, in terms of the Department's discussions, subsequent to the draft report, on the discount rate, how did it drill down and assess the quality of the properties in Project Eagle?  It is stated that much of it was in rural Northern Ireland and regional United Kingdom, UK, in other words, it was not as good quality as other property disposed of around that time.  One of our limitations, and I imagine the Comptroller and Auditor General is limited in the same way, is that with much of this we are working retrospectively, which makes it difficult to get a full take on the issue.  There will be disagreements, and this is a limitation the Committee of Public Accounts will always face.  There will always be an argument on what is the correct discount rate.  It is made up of business risk and the cost of finance, and there will be arguments about assessing business risk.  In terms of the Department, Ms Nolan said there were robust exchanges.  In terms of her experience and, importantly, what she was benchmarking it against, what drill down was done of the assets within the project?</p></speech>

We took the Comptroller and Auditor General report on that aspect as completely given.  We do not have any access to that sort of information from NAMA, so we are operating entirely on the draft report that was given to us by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

I did write to tell him that he should have spoken to the board of NAMA because I knew its members were agitated about it, and I felt they should have the right to have that discussion themselves.  In terms of looking at what would be the right first-time rate for this type of project, we were basing it entirely on the many years' experience, which I mentioned earlier, that Mr. Carville and Mr. Reid have in this type of deal, and also the experiences we had, say, through the IBRC wind-down and so on.  Mr. Reid might like to add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.915" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Reid" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016100600002#UU00500"><p>To bring some clarity to this conversation, we did not have a robust exchange with the Comptroller and Auditor General on the discount rate.  At the time of our engagement the discount rate was not the main focus of our discussion.  The main focus of our discussion was the process in terms of whether it created significant competitive tension to ensure best value, and those type of topics.  In terms of what the report says to me, it is whether the decision by NAMA to sell now versus to hold and work out was the appropriate decision.  In the papers the Deputy has seen, NAMA had attributed a 5.5% discount rate across its portfolio in its entirety to value the cashflows from a work-out strategy.  Comparing that with the applicability of a 5.5% discount rate on a portfolio of Northern Irish assets, which I believe the NAMA executives and board members last week indicated were of lesser average quality than the rest of the portfolio, is 5.5% appropriate even for that work-out strategy?  I think they argued last week that it would not have been.  The real question is not necessarily whether it is 10% or 5.5%, but whether it is a case of sell today or hold and work out until tomorrow.</p></speech>

It was less about the trade-off between work-out and sell.  It was more about whether best value was achieved, having decided to sell.</p></speech>

Am I wrong in saying that the Department's view, in terms of this report, is that the discount rate of 5.5% was too ambitious?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.921" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Reid" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016100600002#UU01100"><p>I would look at what the NAMA had in its board papers and understand how the representatives clarified some aspects of that in their testimony last week.  The 5.5% discount rate, as I understand it, was a discount rate applied to the entirety of the NAMA portfolios.  That includes very high quality London assets, higher quality Dublin assets, and lesser quality Northern Irish assets.  On average, they say the 5.5% rate is appropriate across the portfolio.  That does not necessarily mean it is appropriate for the lesser quality Northern Irish assets, so it would be more aggressive than I would have thought for that portfolio.</p></speech>

We know now that Mr. Cushnahan did have a relationship with six debtors, and possibly seven.  We know that Mr. Cushnahan had a relationship with Tughans in that he shared one of its offices.  We know that two Northern Ireland Advisory Committee, NIAC, meetings took place in Tughans' offices.  We also know that there was a three-legged stool that made up the PIMCO success fee, and that three-legged stool was Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan.</p><p>We also know that once that came into the public domain and PIMCO was made aware of the success fee and informed NAMA, it eventually withdrew from the process.  We know that two of the three legs of the PIMCO success stool transferred seamlessly from PIMCO to Cerberus and the briefing note Mr. Reid prepared states the disclosure of the proposed payment arrangement by PIMCO was shocking.  Mr. Reid accepts that it was shocking.  However, what is also shocking is that neither Mr. Reid, anybody in the Department nor the Minister acted on it.  The Minister says he does not have any power to act because he cannot interfere on the commercial side of NAMA, but it ceased being simply commercial when it possibly became a corrupted process.  He then had a responsibility to act.</p><p> I take exception to what Ms Nolan said when she was asked why the information had not been shared with the Northern Ireland Executive, that when the Department had received this information, it was sensitive information and that it had to be careful about what it did with it.  We are not talking about giving information to a guy or a lady in one's local bar, rather we are talking about the Office of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister.  The witnesses might smile and consider this funny, but it is not.  This was a very serious issue.  The Minister was made aware of a success fee which Mr. Reid says was shocking.  He was made aware of a shocking revelation about the success fee.  It is quite obvious that it was shocking and that it corrupted the process.</p></speech>

However, he has a legal function under the Act to direct NAMA in situations where he is protecting the taxpayer.  That can only be done in real time, not retrospectively.  </p> <p>  To return to the process, this was a bundled sale of a very large portfolio.  How can the Minister protect the taxpayer if he does not have some knowledge of what is being bundled?  In such a very large transaction how does he ensure this aspect of the NAMA Act relating to the Minister's function is something he can carry out in real time?  Otherwise, what is the point in having it in the NAMA legislation?</p></speech>

The purpose of the Minister's empowerment to issue directives is to fulfil the purposes of the Act.  I am excluded as Minister, as was my predecessor, from any involvement in commercial decisions made by NAMA.  That is the line of division.  There are circumstances where a Minister may direct to protect the taxpayer's interests and I did that in the last directive I signed when there were negative interest rates.  When interest rates went below zero, it was impossible for NAMA to continue with its practice and I empowered it to set a zero rate.  We can send the Deputy the technical papers, but it is simply an example of where the Minister, me in this case, acted in accordance with the law in issuing a directive under the NAMA Act to protect the taxpayer.  It was in that type of policy issue I was involved.</p> <p>  I can outline it another way.  The Deputy might put herself in my shoes in March 2014 when I could not act arbitrarily or on a whim.  I could not act because, for example, I did not like someone.  What evidence did I have that I would be protecting the taxpayer in stopping the sale when the advice from NAMA was that there was sufficient competitive tension to get the best price possible for Project Eagle in proceeding with the remaining people who were interested?</p></speech>

We will have a commission of inquiry because, in general, it is in the public interest to have one at this point because the issue is so confused and there are so many allegations flying around.  We have seen BBC programmes, Garda inquiries, inquiries by criminal bureaux in the United Kingdom, the inquiry by the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the SIPO inquiry.  There comes a point when one just cannot continue processing in the fora we have available.  If the matter must be clarified, there is provision under the law for the establishment of judicial inquiries.  Let it commence and let the chips fall where they will.</p></speech>

Obviously Brown Rudnick had a full six months in which to look at putting together and understand the portfolio on behalf of PIMCO.  Essentially, Brown Rudnick would have gone in, looked at the data and signed a non-disclosure agreement.  It would have had the advantage of having all of that time to understand what the values of the various loans were.</p><p>I accept the point the Minister made that the Department found out about it after the event but presumably NAMA would have to have known at the point when the sale was made because they would have been acting on behalf of Cerberus.  Was the Minister informed at any point?  I find it difficult to believe that somebody can go into a data room, look at the material, go away and forget what they saw.  There is an obvious advantage.  Even if they sign a non-disclosure agreement, there is a memory of what they have seen.  Did the fact they were permitted to act on behalf of Cerberus put other potential bidders at a commercial disadvantage?  Did the Minister have any kind of discussion about that with NAMA after the event?  Has he taken any action to make sure it will not be permitted to occur again?</p></speech>

I do not know whether what she is saying is accurate.  I assume it is.  It is a matter for Cerberus to tell the Deputy why they hired Tughans.  It is a matter for NAMA to tell the Deputy why it found that acceptable.  I cannot throw any light on it for the Deputy.  It would be entirely a matter of what happened up there.  I do not know.</p></speech>

We are here for the taxpayer.  There is no evidence here that alternatives were considered, which is one of the key issues of the report.  On the issue of getting rid of the portfolio, the Minister got a very detailed and long letter from NAMA, which he referred to.  Did the Minister reply to the letter dated 12 September?</p></speech>

It is a very long letter.  I forget how many pages there are in it.  There are five pages.  They zone in, quite incorrectly, on the 5.5% because the Comptroller and Auditor General report does not choose 5.5%.  This paper zones in on that and on the fact the Comptroller and Auditor General did not have expertise and so on.  The Minister did not reply to it.</p></speech>

The letter says the Comptroller and Auditor General adopted a completely uncommercial stance in looking at the 5.5%, which is not accurate.  NAMA goes on to say that if that was the case, it could not possibly sell the property at a reasonable price to comply with what was endorsed by the Minister, which was to manage the process of accelerating disposals with the target of redeeming 80% of senior debt by the end of 2016.  I will close my questioning by putting to the Minister that he was determined to sell off this project at all costs because he was under pressure, as he has clearly outlined, from the troika and the European Central Bank.  He was going to sell this off.  When it was brought to the Minister's attention that there were serious questions about a conflict of interest the appalling vista raised its head that, good Lord, could this be terrible or could it be rotten?  The Minister could not conceive of this appalling vista.  NAMA went ahead and said it had to be sold because it had had enough of Northern Ireland.  The 3% value was not worth the trouble it was giving because of all the meetings with the Northern Ireland advisory committee and what has emerged with regard to meetings in Tughans' office and so on.  The Minister oversaw that policy of getting out of Northern Ireland at all costs and of not questioning what came up because it would raise an appalling vista.  He did not want to go there.</p></speech>

To get back to her original point about the percentage of the nominal value of the asset represented by the assets being sold in Project Eagle, if one puts it in context there was over &euro;70 billion nominal value of assets acquired by NAMA on the payment of NAMA bonds.  The NAMA bonds are to the value of &euro;30.2 billion.  It is not the &euro;30.2 billion one must look at.  The price it received for Project Eagle was about &euro;1.6 billion.</p><p>The Deputy can do the sum.  However, as she says, and she is not incorrect, it is approximately 3% of the total loan portfolio.  To allege that I wanted to get rid of Project Eagle at all costs makes no sense because it represented such a small proportion of the overall portfolio.  My concerns were strategic in the interest of the State in order that we could access money on the markets, get a proper credit rating and reduce interest rates for ordinary consumers and commercial activity.  That was my strategic interest.  Whether it sold the Northern Ireland assets or not, it was 3% of the total portfolio.  Of course, any big sale was important but it did not matter in the context of the totality of things whether Project Eagle was sold at that point or not.  I was not going around saying, "Sell at all costs; you have to sell".  I put no pressure on anybody.  The Northern Ireland authorities, to my knowledge, put no pressure on anybody.  Mr. Frank Daly said he was under no political pressure and I have explained to the Deputy the circumstances of why NAMA thought it was important to divest itself "expeditiously", to use the word in the Act, of the assets.</p><p> I have also explained on a number of occasions today why, from a policy point of view, I wanted NAMA to achieve targets for disposal of assets.  The 80% target was set by me in consultation with NAMA and on the advice of my officials, to see was this achievable and taking on board NAMA's advice on what was possible in the commercial market in the different locations where they had assets at the time.  However, it is incorrect to say that I had a singular objective of disposing of the assets represented by Project Eagle.  I did not have and I had no interest to have.</p></speech>

This has been an issue.  NAMA, in its rebuttal of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, commissioned KPMG to give it a letter dated 11 May 2016 on two topics - the carrying value of loans and the market value of loans.  This will help people to understand where we are coming from on this issue.  It states: "The following definitions of market value fro the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors ("RCIS"), International Valuation Standards Council ("IVSC") and the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") all share a common theme around market value i.e. ultimately it requires willing participants and well designed sales process."  The RCIS defines it as: "The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller on a arm's length transaction and after proper marketing...".  The IVSC defines it as: "The estimated amount for which an asset or liability could exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller on arm's length transaction, after proper marketing...".  The IASB refers to market value as "...the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between participants at the measurement date".  The emphasis is on a well-designed sales process.  In other words, all those bodies say what something is worth is not what somebody is willing to sell it for and somebody is willing to pay but those two elements combined with a well-designed sales process.  That is an issue to which we will return.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance and for the material supplied.  The secretariat will contact the officials about sending other documentation to the committee.</p></speech>

We are delighted to welcome the Commissioner to the committee to discuss matters of mutual interest.  The European Union is the largest donor of humanitarian aid in the world.  Its role in co-ordinating and building close working relationships with key partners in its humanitarian work, including UN agencies, non-governmental organisations and civil society, has never been more important.  The format of the meeting is as follows.  We will hear an opening statement from the Commissioner before moving to a question-and-answer session with the members of the committee on subjects pertaining to his portfolio.</p><p>I ask members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference even on silent mode with the recording equipment in the committee room.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I call on the Commissioner, whose contribution I welcome, to make his opening statement.  I note for his information that opening statements made to the committee are published on the committee's website after each meeting.</p></speech>

As a former parliamentarian, it is always a pleasure to be among colleagues and especially to engage in discussions with national representatives.  I believe firmly that it is a strong component of our partnership.  My presence here is not only an institutional obligation, it is a democratic one.</p> <p>  Three weeks ago, President Juncker delivered his state of the Union address.  He took a hard but realistic look at the challenges facing Europe.  Unemployment, social inequality, the refugee crisis, insecurity, digital Europe and acting as a real global player are only some of the issues he underlined.  They are issues which require bold decisions and bold actions.  President Juncker has asked us to make crucial choices.  He proposed a positive agenda of concrete actions for the next 12 months.  These actions will be Europe's contribution to reuniting our Union.  They will show that we can be decisive on what really matters and will demonstrate to the world that Europe is still a force capable of joint action.  To succeed, the Union needs the support of the members of the joint committee who, as national representatives, are the closest politicians to ordinary people.</p><p>The role of each Member of any national parliament is important.  My strong opinion is that without the engagement of Members of Parliament in each member state or European country, it is completely impossible to link up European citizens.  That is why our engagement and discussions with national parliaments are not only an institutional obligation but also a part of our democratic processes.  At the same time, it is important to address the needs of citizens.  We must deliver a Europe of solidarity.  Solidarity is the foundation of the European Union.  Let us recall our common past and never forget that solidarity has built lasting peace in Europe.  I know that I am addressing representatives of a nation with a strong tradition of solidarity in many aspects.  It is a nation that has not forgotten its sacrifices over two centuries.  Ireland is truly a generous nation.</p><p> My portfolio has two main pillars.  The first is overseeing the European Union's humanitarian aid, with an annual budget of &euro;1.5 billion.  The second is overseeing the European Union's crisis centre and disaster response system.  I refer to the so-called EU Civil Protection Mechanism.  Some 250 million people are affected by humanitarian crises worldwide and an unprecedented 65 million have been forcibly displaced.  We are facing a global displacement crisis which requires a global response.  No one can deal with this crisis alone.  That is why I insist we need a global response and engagement not only by European countries but also others, particularly developing countries.  </p><p> We help people in need, no matter where they are and regardless of their background.  Since April this year, this includes countries within Europe because we have a new instrument that allows us to provide humanitarian aid within our own borders, particularly for the refugees in Greece.  We could certainly do much more.  Member states, national parliaments, EU institutions and civil society can all work together in partnership. </p><p> Based on the figures, situation is better now than it was a year ago due, to a large extent, to the EU-Turkey agreement which, despite the criticism, is working.  It remains a key part of our response to the refugee crisis.  I strongly believe it is the only way for Europe to deal with what is an unprecedented crisis.  That is the reality.  I am very pragmatic.  We have significantly strengthened our humanitarian assistance for refugees in Turkey.</p><p> A few days ago I launched the Emergency Social Safety Net, ESSN, the largest ever humanitarian aid project funded by the European Union.  It has a budget of &euro;348 million.  The programme is a model of cost-effectiveness.  Monthly cash transfers to electronic cards will be effected for 1 million refugees.  It is a model because there is no intermediate cost.  This is important in our humanitarian actions because a vast proportion of the money, over 85%, is reaching the beneficiaries.  At the same time, this allows refugees to cover their own needs, including rent, food and education.  The money will boost the local economy and give dignity to refugees.  This is important to the humanitarian community and me personally.  Ours is not just a philanthropic organisation.  We have to determine how to ensure the dignity of the refugees will remain a top priority.</p><p> As the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, whom I just met, pointed out in his address during the UN General Assembly meeting, the top drivers of mass movement such as conflict, persistent poverty, inequality and climate change require closer multilateral co-operation urgently.  Humanitarian crises are growing more complex, severe and protracted.  In this regard, one should think of Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Yemen and many other regions worldwide.  Let us face it: humanitarian aid is not a solution to conflict.  It cannot address the root causes.  That is why humanitarian problems require political solutions.  This is the realistic approach.  We need innovative solutions, a partnership with development actors and, as I stated, political solutions.  The New York declaration at the recent UN summit underlined these new approaches and I deeply thank Ireland for co-facilitating it.  It endorses the concept of global responsibility sharing.  It is important to be an advocate for this approach.  The tragic situation in Syria calls for such an approach.  I am appalled by the deteriorating humanitarian situation, particularly in Aleppo.</p><p>The unacceptable breaches of international humanitarian law show the extent of the catastrophe.  The EU has spoken out strongly to condemn these atrocities.  The immediate priority must be to restore a credible ceasefire.  In the face of the humanitarian tragedy, inaction is not an option.  Together with EU High Representative and Vice President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini, we took an urgent humanitarian initiative last weekend.  This initiative for east Aleppo, taken in co-operation with the United Nations, has two main elements: first, to facilitate urgent delivery of basic life-saving assistance to civilians, including medical, water and food needs; and, second, to ensure the medical evacuations of the wounded and sick, especially women, children and the elderly.  Unfortunately, until now the practical results on the ground have not been optimistic.  There are many reasons we are here.  We expect, but not until tomorrow, some positive developments in order to see how we can deliver assistance to east Aleppo.</p><p> I renew my call to all our partners and all parties to the conflict to unite on this humanitarian initiative.  We need support and political pressure to impose on our interlocutors to accept the principle that humanitarian access is not a matter of the cessation of hostilities.  Humanitarian access is a completely different issue from the cessation of hostilities.  We need only security measures in order to provide humanitarian assistance.  In this context, I deeply appreciate that Ireland is a strong partner in the effort.  In my discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, I saw his commitment to find solutions for engagement from the Irish side.</p><p> Iraq is also a priority.  The offensive on Mosul could result in the displacement of two million people or more.  My visit last July has convinced me that our engagement in Iraq should be strengthened.  The humanitarian needs are massive.  In my field trips in Erbil I had many meetings with the UN officials there to prepare ourselves for the humanitarian crisis after the Mosul operation.  It is important to find solutions to prepare ourselves on the ground through the Iraqi Government and others, and many local authorities and our humanitarian partners on the ground.  During the UN General Assembly, the EU pledged another &euro;30 million, bringing the total humanitarian aid for this year to &euro;134 million.</p><p> South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, Central African Republic and the increasing violence by Boko Haram in Nigeria remain high on our agenda.  Although refugees have reached European shores, the developing world continues to shoulder the largest part of the burden, and 89% of the world's refugees live in developing countries.  This is why it is important to see refugees as contributors to a society, not as a burden.  Education has a key role to play in this.  Education is paramount and is central to our efforts to prevent radicalisation and lost generations.  It is the foundation of everything else.  This is why I have made education my priority as Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management.  Last year, I increased by four the budget for education in emergency humanitarian aid.</p><p> The resilience agenda also has a key role to play in helping developing countries.  Ireland is strongly behind this, and I am grateful for it.  I am well aware of Ireland's commitment to the cause in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa and the Central African Republic to name a few.  Our action in support of global resilience extends to east and southern Africa in their struggle to cope with El Ni&ntilde;o.  Some 60 million people are affected by food insecurity.  Although the EU is responding with almost &euro;550 million, the funding gap remains enormous, unfortunately.</p><p> President Juncker called for more union in this Union.  In the field of crisis management, we have made concrete steps towards this goal.  Member states are co-operating successfully in the EU's civil protection mechanism and are making progress in strengthening it.  We now have a voluntary pool of well-defined response capacities.  Member states make these available.  It is already a success, as we have seen in Serbia and Greece, where thousands of items were delivered to refugees.  This is a real definition of European solidarity on the ground.  We are building on lessons learned from our experiences.</p><p> As the EU co-ordinator, I witnessed the operational gaps and the outstanding needs in dealing with Ebola in the field, in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.  There was an acute shortage of fully equipped medical teams.  That is why we set up the European Medical Corps as a concrete solution to problems of a global scale.  It is a new instrument to rapidly deploy medical teams worldwide.  Three weeks ago we deployed in Angola.  I am proud to see the tangible results of this new instrument.  Only seven months after its launch, the European Medical Corps has 15 specialised teams from ten member states.  We had two successful missions in the fight against yellow fever in Africa, thanks to the work of impressive medical doctors and scientists. </p><p> Moreover, in his address, President Juncker presented another initiative, the European Solidarity Corps.  This initiative reminds us that solidarity is the glue that keeps the European Union together.  For me, it is important to realise we need this instrument to recognise our obligations to keep it together.  Through this new instrument, young Europeans will be able to volunteer and offer their help where it is needed most, for example, in dealing with the refugee crisis.  They will also be able to develop their skills in dealing with the earthquake crisis in Italy and everywhere else in Europe.  We are keen to develop the corps in close collaboration with member states and civil society.  We would welcome the committee's views on this outstanding initiative.</p><p> Ireland is a country with a proud tradition of providing humanitarian aid.  For example, every child is given a Tr&oacute;caire box at Lent.  My dear colleague, Phil Hogan, insisted that I say something about it because it is quite important to the Irish people.  Irish children put their savings in it, to be sent to those less fortunate. </p><p> The only way to make the European Union stronger is to work together.  It is not just a slogan.  There is no other way, especially at this critical juncture.  Let us build on our achievements.  We have to be modest, but, at the same time, we must recognise that the European Union has had many achievements which have been the foundation for citizens' benefits.  At the same time, let us learn from our shortcomings.  That is why it is important to join forces to implement a positive agenda which is not for us alone.  It is also for our children in the next generation and, in particular, the future of this continent.  My experience on the ground reaffirms that the European Union is not only a soft global player, a soft key player, in dealing with worldwide issues; it is also a model for the majority of other nations in other regions.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman for giving me this opportunity and I members for their attention.</p></speech>

The Tr&oacute;caire representatives present will be pleased that he mentioned the organisation.  Tr&oacute;caire and many other Irish NGOs, with their sister organisations throughout the world, do excellent work in assisting the most underprivileged and disadvantaged communities.</p> <p>  The crises in many parts of the world are clearly demonstrated in the Commissioner's reference to the 250 million people affected by humanitarian crises and the unprecedented 65 million who have been forcibly displaced.  These statistics clearly demonstrate the sad reality of a totally inadequate global response to so many crises.</p> <p>  We will take a number of questions, starting with Deputy Darragh O'Brien who will be followed by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.1080" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016100600002#F00300"><p>I welcome the Commissioner and thank him for his presentation which gives us an opportunity to give our point of view on matters.  I do not doubt the commitment of the Commissioner or that of his team to tackling what is the biggest humanitarian crisis since the Second World War.  The theme of his presentation is solidarity which is sorely lacking in the global response.  I agree with him on the need for a global response.  However, there is also a need for a European response.</p> <p>  Prior to the meeting the Commissioner met the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am spokesperson on foreign affairs and trade for the largest Opposition party which has a deep concern about the EU-Turkey arrangement and the EU migrant partnership frameworks.  Our fundamental belief is that the arrangement undermines the rights of refugees and migrants.  While the Commissioner has mentioned it as the solution - there is a practical element to it - through the EU-Turkey arrangement we have abrogated our responsibility as member states and citizens of the European Union.  I will give an example.  I will also have a few questions to ask.  </p> <p>  There are 6.5 million people who are internally displaced in Syria, while 65 million people are displaced worldwide.  They are all individuals.  About 13 months ago a young child, Alan Kurdi, drowned and his body was washed up on the beach in Bodrum.  We are all familiar with the pictures.  At the time every EU member state, including Ireland, responded by promising to take in 3,000, 4,000, 10,000 or 15,000 people.  The public in Ireland is way ahead of the Government in its response.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade might have told the Commissioner that Ireland had taken in one unaccompanied child under the EU settlement and relocation programme.  That is not solidarity with the peoples of the Middle East, including Syria and Iraq.</p><p>My concern is that, at a European level, instead of relocation and resettlement to other EU states, the EU-Turkey and the EU migrant partnership framework arrangements are the new deal.  They may form part of it, but I would like the Commissioner's view on that, particularly in light of our concerns and especially in relation to talking about Turkey as a safe haven.  I do not believe Turkey is a safe haven or a safe country.</p><p> I note the EU was looking recently at a framework arrangement with Afghanistan to relocate 80,000 refugees to that country.  The Commissioner might be familiar with the leaked memo and I ask him to comment on that.  It appeared from the content of that leaked EU memo that there was a stick being held over Afghanistan in relation to aid.  The agreement was made in respect of so-called third country arrangements.  That is something about which I have a concern.</p><p> Will the Commissioner comment on how many other third country arrangements are being negotiated?  I believe it is upwards of 16.  I am not saying it is not part of the solution and I do not want to be completely negative.  I am aware that Europe, all the NGOs, other countries and thousands of people are responding and doing their level best, but I do not want the Commissioner to leave Ireland today with a view that there is agreement among the political representatives in Ireland that third country arrangements are the way forward.  Fianna F&aacute;il does not believe that.  I believe it has shifted the problem to other countries.</p><p> The Commissioner mentioned 89% of displaced people are seeking safe haven in developing countries.  We are a developed country and our response to the crisis has been to take fewer than 400 refugees between relocation and resettlement - less than 10% of what we said we would do.  I would ask the Commissioner where individual sovereign states' commitments on relocation and resettlement fit in with the migrant partnership framework towards which the EU is moving.  Will he say which member states have met or are likely to meet their targets?</p><p> Our real concern is we want a co-ordinated response that is right in moral terms.  It is right to respect refugees' rights and to give them a safe haven, and third country arrangements do not offer that.  It is a diminution of refugees' and migrants' rights.  As the Commissioner will be aware, we as a country understand it well from our own history.  Where does the Commissioner see this moving to?</p><p> On Syria and the situation in Aleppo, I was interested to hear about the moves there might be this week to try to get more aid into the city.  Obviously, we roundly condemn the attacks that were carried out on the Red Crescent and the UN aid convoys there.  What is the Commissioner's view on a sustainable ceasefire?  The situation in Aleppo is simply barbaric.  It was discussed in the D&aacute;il.  My party leader raised it on Tuesday.  It cannot be allowed to continue.</p><p> When I was younger and studying history, I looked at what countries in Europe and elsewhere did as they stood around and watched during the Second World War.  I was told that would never happen again.  During the crisis in Yugoslavia we went back to concentration camps right on our doorstep and which we could see on television, and the response was slow.  It does not appear to me that we have learnt lessons.  With the Irish Naval Service, whose personnel I commend on their humanitarian work in saving refugees from the Mediterranean, we see real solidarity and real impacts.  I am fully aware that the Commissioner does not have a magic wand, but the solution is not to throw money at this problem and push these refugees into states such as Turkey.</p></speech>

It has been a good opportunity to hear his views and to present ours and ask the questions we have.  No doubt it is a gigantic task that the Commissioner has at present and ahead of him.</p> <p>  I am struck that when we talk about disasters that require humanitarian aid, we can separate them into the so-called natural ones that come about because of climate, such as hurricanes that we see now in the Caribbean, and the others that are man-made.  When we see what is happening in Syria, and I am glad the Commissioner mentioned Yemen, and I would wonder about Libya as well, it is man who is at the root of all those.  As the Commissioner said, unless we get to the political solution of men - unfortunately, it seems to be all men, and maybe we need more women involved to have their input into resolutions and solutions - we will not see an end to what is going on.  What we see in the meantime is UN resolutions, international law and international humanitarian law being ignored completely.  People continue blithely ignoring all this.  What are Mr. Stylianides's views on this and his input on the political solutions?</p> <p>  The Commissioner mentioned dignity.  I visited the Turkish-Syrian border and saw good examples of humanitarian aid, but I also saw the opposite - the exploitation of refugees that was going on.  I, too, would have reservations.  I note Turkey's reaction to the coup with the crackdown and the arrest of teachers and journalists and the Turkish treatment of the Kurds.  Despite this, we are turning to Turkey to look after refugees.  I also note this recent development with Afghanistan and the threat to withdraw aid.  We have the expression, NIMBY, not in my back yard, and many European countries, including Ireland, have taken the route that it is okay that the solutions are elsewhere and it is up to somebody else to look after it.  None of us is stepping up to the mark.</p> <p>  Are those countries which have pledged aid honouring those pledges monetarily?  I am involved in an organisation called the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, which involves us working with African parliamentarians.  People are leaving African countries because of human rights abuses, for example, because of the lack of access to education.  We seem not so much to accept that as not to get into the root of those countries, so to speak, and put pressure on them to respect human rights.  Sometimes we look to close the stable door after the horse has bolted when instead we must see what we can do when the horse is in the stable.  I have questions about humanitarian aid being targeted at people with a disability - disability is finally in a sustainable development goal - and about unaccompanied minors.  I refer to the particularly vulnerable groups.</p> <p>  Returning to the issue of humanitarian and international law being completely ignored, we look at it in terms of Gaza.  What can be done with the rebuilding of Gaza?  The pledges have been made but nothing is happening.  We are familiar with the humanitarian crisis there.</p> <p>  One other matter, given the anniversary of another UN resolution that is coming up, is the relic of the Cold War which is the blockade against Cuba.  This has had a significant impact on Cuban society which has lost billions of euro because of it.  The UN passes a resolution every year condemning that with few exceptions, yet it continues.  When a resolution is passed or a humanitarian law is breached, when do we get into that mindset that we can do something about it?  The Commissioner's work will continue until we get back to that position.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.1084" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Christos Stylianides" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016100600002#G00400"><p>I thank the members for their questions and views.  They are constructive in our assessment regarding the situation.</p> <p>  I would like to clarify something from the beginning.  I am Commissioner for humanitarian aid.</p><p>My role, especially on the ground, is to find ways to provide humanitarian assistance.  It is important to act within the framework of humanitarian principles.  As this role is important in reaching refugees and migrants, sometimes I have to be very impartial and have no political engagement.  Sometimes, frankly, I avoid stating anything which might more or less destroy my impartiality and neutrality.  That is why some of the members' questions are difficult for me to discuss, as it might be difficult for me to visit any country to exert pressure behind the scenes for it to provide assistance.  For me, the major and moral obligation is to find and reach vulnerable people.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Darragh O'Brien in his concerns about some of the controversial aspects of the EU-Turkey agreement.  Many aspects of the agreement have faced many criticisms.  At the same time, there are specific figures in the agreement which are completely positive for refugees and migrants.  First, the influx from Turkey to Aegean Islands and the deaths on Turkey's shores were frustrating because of the image of Alan Kurdi on the beach.  Because of the agreement, fortunately, we have minimised the deaths on Turkey's shores and the Aegean Islands.</p><p> Many times in politics, as members know better than me, the dilemma lies between idealism and pragmatism.  As a politician, I am always pragmatic because I strongly believe in practical results and outcomes, which is important for me.  As a politician in Cyprus, I always believed in the pragmatic approach in all aspects of our political activities.  Regardless of the criticisms, the EU-Turkey agreement remains the only way to deal with this unprecedented crisis.  Otherwise, because of our disagreements within the institutions, we would have many approaches.  That is why, in a pragmatic way, we decided to sign the agreement to cope with this unprecedented situation.  That is the only way and why, as European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, I try to find solutions to provide assistance to make a difference on the ground.  Last week in Turkey I announced the largest humanitarian project ever funded by European funds, a &euro;348 million cash voucher scheme, through which we believe we will reach over 1 million refugees in Turkey.  It will deliver cash on prepaid cards to meet basic needs, including education, shelter and rent.   I strongly believe this is the only dignified way to provide assistance for refugees.</p><p> We found through our implementing partner, the World Food Programme, that we have very good collaboration with the Turkish authorities, particularly the Turkish Red Crescent, T&uuml;rk Kzlay.  Without their collaboration, there is no way to reach vulnerable refugees.  Above all, the alleviation of the suffering of vulnerable people is important.  That is why we chose the pragmatic way to mitigate the suffering of the people.  We have had negotiations with the Turkish authorities to reach this new state of play.  Now the situation is getting better.  I realise there are many shortcomings and problems, but I strongly believe it is better to give assistance through difficulties than to stay far away from the problem and discuss only principles and values.  That is my political philosophy.  I have to be pragmatic to reach solutions on the ground.  That is my role.  I am a doer.  I want to be someone who reaches solutions, not just discuss them.  That is why I insist on this happening through some of the controversial aspects of the agreement, regardless of its shortcomings.</p><p> Until now EU member states did not respond in a better way to give the impression that the European Union could deliver on this issue.  At the same time, through the institutions, we must insist on reaching a common EU position.  That is the only way to create coherence and increase and improve our reserves on the ground.</p><p>The situation is not one where I, as Commissioner, am in charge.  However, I note certain points and statistics.  The situation is improving compared to where matters stood a month ago.  In terms of relocation from Italy, there was no figure as such two months ago.  In the interim, however, 1,189 people have been relocated.  This is the beginning of the process.  By 27 September, 4,455 people had been relocated from Greece.  While this is not the ideal figure, it seems we have already started to meet our obligation to conclude our commitments through this process.</p><p> I note to Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan my view on the attacks on humanitarian workers and against international humanitarian law.  They are completely unacceptable.  This is why the European Union insisted - through me - at the last World Humanitarian Summit, or WHS, that our common position is to ensure that international humanitarian law is increasingly capable of putting political pressure on everyone to respect such law.  Unfortunately, we cannot achieve our ambition in the WHS but we have seen some improvements.  The situation on the ground, especially in Aleppo in Syria and in Iraq, is disappointing.  The most recent development has been attacks on and bombardment of medical teams and facilities, which is completely unacceptable.  As someone who comes from a medical profession, I note how catastrophic this development is.  This is why the European Union is putting pressure on the Assad regime - through all of our instruments and interlocutors on the ground - to find solutions and to protect at least basic medical facilities.  This is why we are trying, through our initiative with Federica Mogherini, to find ways to provide medical evacuation from east Aleppo to our hospitals in order that health care for wounded children, women and elderly people can be provided.  I share the Deputy's concern and disappointment about this matter.</p><p> I was asked specifically about unaccompanied minors and those with disabilities.  For unaccompanied minors, we allocate specific money and have many projects in Turkey and Greece.  To date, we have allocated &euro;25 million in Greece for 12 specific projects designed to provide social support to unaccompanied minors and to create specific shelters which are child-friendly in order to keep them safe and avoid sexual abuse or similar activities.  It is a tragic aspect of the situation.  However, through the projects and our humanitarian partners on the ground and in collaboration with the Greek authorities, I am sure that there have been improvements and that we can deliver more attention to unaccompanied minors in particular.  In many areas globally, including Iraq, Syria, South Sudan and the Lake Chad region, we have provided a lot of EU-funded projects which provide specific assistance to people with disabilities.  I am proud that DG ECHO and our partners always insist that the sensitive issues of unaccompanied minors and people with disabilities are addressed.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we have not seen that Europe of solidarity emerge.  In September 2015, the EU launched a plan to resettle 160,000 refugees from Greece and Italy to other EU member states.  So far, this has failed massively.  At the beginning of September, just over 1,000 people left Italy and 3,493 left Greece.  Countries such as Austria, Hungary and Poland have yet to relocate anyone.  Ireland has talked about taking people in but its rate in this regard is less than 10%.  The policy does not seem to be working.  The Minister of State with responsibility for Europe came before us yesterday and we put the same questions to him.  There is a problem.  Does the Commissioner see a contradiction in that many of the countries that have shown this lack of solidarity are those which are involved in supplying military aid to the parties involved in the conflict in the Middle East?  Every time there is a bombing or attack in Syria, Iraq or Yemen, people leave those countries and come to Europe looking for safety.  Yet, the countries supplying the weaponry to the Saudis, Iraqis and Turks are all involved in that.  Does the Commissioner see this as a contradiction and what can we do as Europeans to speak out against it?</p><p> In short, the system does not seem to be working.  Only one unaccompanied minor has been settled thus far in Ireland out of the 400 or so to be brought in this year.  We are almost in denial about this reality that the system is not working.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Commissioner but his observation that things are better than they were a year ago shows he is in denial.  I agree with my colleagues regarding the EU deal with Turkey.  It is a scandal that the UN is not being allowed into the camps to investigate what is going on.  My concern is that this deal is being used as a model for other conflicts.  There are plans, for example, to send people who fled Afghanistan back there.  We promised those people democratic values and so on but all they got was more conflict and war.  In many of these cases, the conflicts people are fleeing were caused by Europeans, Americans and others, but we are telling them they must return to the areas from which they escaped.  There is no welcome for them in other countries.  The majority of Irish people would agree with me that we want to see these conflicts resolved and people welcomed instead of turned away.  The system that is currently in place is not working and we must state it is broken and must be fixed.  There needs to be a collective effort to see how that can be done.</p><p> Reference was made to unaccompanied minors at Calais.  President Hollande spoke recently about dismantling the camp, which contains vast numbers of children.  Do the witnesses have any comments in that regard?</p><p> On Gaza, the UN report predicts that the area will be uninhabitable by 2020.  Recently, an aid flotilla was boarded by Israeli gunboats.  People living there are unable to access food, water and electricity.  Will the Commissioner comment on that situation?</p><p> High Commissioner Mogherini has talked about the launch of a humanitarian initiative for the political future of Syria.  I would like to hear more about this, specifically the intention to prevent further violations of humanitarian aid.  Colleagues referred to the situation in Aleppo.  It is appalling what is happening there and, again, it does not seem to be on anybody's agenda.  People are helpless and cannot see what may be done to help people there.  It comes back to accountability once again.  The recent intensification of the conflict there means more people will be travelling to Europe.  How do we break that cycle and work towards peaceful resolution of conflicts?  We must do things differently.  I do not see the likes of the Turkish or Afghani deals as the way to solve these huge problems.</p></speech>

As Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, does he consider Ireland's total contribution to the humanitarian assistance programme - which is in the region of &euro;142,000 for 2015, with a similar contribution allocated for 2016 - to be in line with that of other EU countries in the context of GDP output per capita?  Is it his view that this provisions should be increased given the current international crises that are unfolding and, if so, by how much or what percentage?</p> <p>  In 2015, the Government published an updated humanitarian assistance policy which aims to implement further structures and methodologies that will enable Ireland to continue to achieve its goal of providing humanitarian assistance, saving and protecting lives, eliminating suffering and maintaining dignity.  Will the Commissioner detail to the committee the areas of international humanitarian assistance provision to which this State and other EU member states should be allocating more resources?  I ask this as I seek to understand how Ireland can improve its efforts into the future.</p></speech>

The witnesses are very welcome.  Other speakers have voiced the concerns I share regarding the slow progress in the welcoming of refugees under resettlement and relocation programmes.  The Commissioner outlined the very slow progress at European level.  We all are concerned about how slow it has been in Ireland.  Colleagues referred to Calais and the number of unaccompanied minors there.  I will focus on the question of accountability and what the EU is proposing to do to ensure accountability for the gross violations of humanitarian law we have seen perpetrated in Syria, in particular by the Russian and Syrian Governments in their abandonment of the peace process, the deployment of air strikes on humanitarian aid convoys and the ongoing blockade of civilians, including many children in Aleppo.  What does the EU propose to do in terms of further sanctions against Russia, calling in representatives of the Russian Government and so on?</p> <p>  My colleague referred to Gaza.  Again, many of us are concerned that the EU is not doing enough to ensure Israel, in particular, is made accountable for violations of international human rights law in its treatment of civilians in Gaza and the ongoing blockade of the region.</p></speech>

However, I suggest to him that the EU is speaking out of both sides of its mouth on this matter.  It is talking about solidarity while, in reality, shutting the doors on the most desperate and vulnerable people fleeing the most appalling circumstances.  I did not understand the justification the Commissioner offered for the EU-Turkey deal.  It is nothing short of a direct flouting of the most basic humanitarian law in that it is allowing for the expulsion of people who should be given asylum and their exportation or outsourcing to a regime whose human rights record is shockingly bad.  Rather than Europe - one of the wealthiest, if not the wealthiest, blocs in the world - opening its doors to the people who are fleeing from Syria and desperate situations in other locations, we choose to seek to corral them in Turkey and pay the latter for that purpose.  That is shocking and it has consequences in terms of dealing with some of the root causes of the Syrian conflict.</p> <p>  One of the groups that deserves considerable credit for its role in resisting the malign forces in Syria is the Kurds, particularly the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK.  It is outrageous that the party is still on the international terrorist list and is being persecuted by the Turkish regime.  The PKK fought off ISIS and is one of the few progressive forces that could actually offer some type of solution to the horrible situation in Syria.  If Europe had any sort of ethical compass, it would be telling the Turkish regime to end its persecution of the Kurdish people.</p><p>The witness has spoken about practicality and pragmatism but there has been nothing more practical than the role of the Kurds in resisting ISIS in Turkey and they get no real support from Europe or anywhere else.<br/><br/>I also ask about the Afghan deal.  The leaked memo suggests that the European Union strong-armed representatives of the Afghan Government into agreeing a deal for mass deportation of Afghanis from all European states and made further European Union aid to Afghanistan conditional on the Afghan Government agreeing to this.  This is shocking.  Afghanistan is being ripped apart as we speak with war and it is a dangerous place, with renewed offensives in Kunduz and so on.  What does the European Union do?  It strong-arms the Afghan Government into agreeing to mass deportations of Afghanis from Europe.  Is that true and did that happen?  This is the report we are getting.  People who attended the conference and so on are saying the Afghan Government was strong-armed.  The <i>quid pro quo</i>was that aid would only be continued if Afghanistan signed up to this policy of mass deportations of Afghanis.  If it is true, it is shocking beyond belief.<br/><br/>I want to speak about double standards in the wider political stance of the European Union on some of the root causes of these conflicts.  Israel is an obvious issue.  Why are the human rights conditions around the trade association agreements with Israel not being invoked?  Why are those agreements with Israel not being suspended while Israel flouts basic human rights for Palestinians, particularly in Gaza?  Everybody knows that what Israel is doing to Gaza is absolutely criminal, breaking every international law, and yet the European Union continues to give Israel favoured trade status.  That sort of double standard then fuels radicalisation in the region.  Similarly, European states are continuing to export arms to the Saudi Arabian Government, which is involved with appalling atrocities in Yemen.  That is the type of double standard I refer to.<br/><br/>I agree with Senator Bacik, who spoke about the need for accountability from Russia arising from its absolutely disgusting attacks in Aleppo.  We also need accountability from European Union member states bombing the hell out of Syria.  How does that contribute and what is the European Union doing about its own member states bombing in Syria?  That kind of double standard is precisely what is ripping the Middle East apart, creating the conditions in which extremist groups like ISIS can flourish.</p></speech>

We have similar approaches and I share some of the concerns of my dear colleagues.  I would like to give my thoughts.  In South Sudan we face the definition of the man-made conflict.  There are two leaders who, unfortunately, are playing a political game with many controversial issues.  Sometimes in our institutions we have many regulations and are cautious about ensuring our humanitarian assistance and development aid go to vulnerable people.  We decided to continue this assistance because of the needs of the refugees.  If we chase this only with a political aspect and approach, in this case maybe we would have to cancel our assistance.  I believe in my obligations.</p> <p>  In many areas around the world I face critical regulations regarding the political situation but at the same time, as Commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid, my role is find ways to give assistance to vulnerable people in the likes of Turkey, South Sudan, Egypt or Nigeria.  The majority of African countries do not have the basics of the rule of law or the democracy that all of us respect.  We must find ways to provide assistance as this is our role, regardless of the political situation, our political disagreements and many other issues.  It is why I insist on an EU-Turkey agreement.  I call myself pragmatic because I want to provide assistance to these people in need.  This is my role.  There is a humanitarian principle and role.</p> <p>  If I engage in a political discussion, my role would be marginal at least and perhaps insufficient.  Give me the chance to protect my role as Commissioner responsible for humanitarian aid.  This is why I must not see the glass as half-empty.  That is quite important for me.  In order to keep my commitments, I must find solutions to provide humanitarian assistance in the likes of Aleppo, Gaza, Gaziantep, the Aegean islands, South Sudan, Nigeria and everywhere else.  Otherwise, these people will lose any hope for their lives, not just for a better future but to survive.  Our role is to save lives and protect children from radicalisation, forced recruitment and forced marriage.</p> <p>  Many times I see multiple dilemmas.</p><p>I have to protect my role as a humanitarian actor.  The humanitarian approach is above all.  This is my moral obligation.  This is my moral framework.  I understand the role of the parliamentarian as I served in Parliament many times, but in my current position it is critical to provide assistance to all people in need.</p><p> I thank the committee for their attention.</p></speech>

The committee concludes its public hearings today on the rising costs of motor insurance.  I have also asked Dr. Roux to comment on the recent remarks made by Mr. Ed Sibley, director of credit institution supervision, on the non-performing bank loans and in particular the statement that &quot;engagement with banks has already shown some evidence of a return of more aggressive lending practices and cultures&quot;.

General insurance protects people from financial loss that would disrupt their lives or businesses.  Having the appropriate insurance in place, which pays out when needed, enables consumers and businesses to conduct their business on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>  Before I delve into insurance pricing and supervision, let us remember that behind the cold numbers of motor insurance premiums and claim costs that show up in insurance accounts and in the bills we receive, lie the losses suffered in road accidents.  On the one hand, rising insurance premiums affect consumers and businesses.  On the other, we know how devastating road traffic accidents can be for the lives of victims and their families.  Reducing the number, severity and cost of road accidents is a worthwhile policy goal in itself.  As a secondary benefit, it would provide ground for sustainable insurance premiums.  Low premiums with high payouts cannot last and ultimately result in failure and further consumer detriment.  It is against this backdrop that I would like to set out the role of the Central Bank in the area of insurance and then to give an overview of the motor insurance market in Ireland.  I will also briefly cover areas of focus for the bank, together with some thought on how to address the challenge of increasing costs.</p> <p>  The Central Bank of Ireland has two specific mandates as regards insurance.  It is responsible for the prudential supervision of insurance companies authorised in Ireland.  It is also responsible for the supervision of conduct of business in Ireland, also referred to as consumer protection.  We describe this dual role and how we discharge it in our annual performance statement, which has been provided to the committee. </p> <p>  Prudential supervision seeks to ensure that insurance firms remain solvent, that is to say, that insurers are able to pay claims in full, as they fall due.  Given that claims are paid long after the premiums are set, this requires a forward looking assessment with respect to the entire business of the insurance and reinsurance company of its state of solvency, the establishment of technical provisions, and its assets and capital.  The Central Bank is responsible for looking after the solvency of insurance companies incorporated in Ireland, whether or not they belong to international groups.  However, when they do, supervision takes place in an international college of supervisors chaired by the supervisory authority of the head of the group.  Such is the case for all major domestic insurers such as AXA, Allianz and RSA, with FBD being the exception.</p> <p>  Insurance directives have prescribed for decades that prudential supervision of insurance undertakings, including that of the business they pursue through branches or under the freedom to provide services, shall be the sole responsibility of the home member state.  As such, foreign insurance firms such as Aviva and AIG, in the United Kingdom, Zenith and Enterprise in Gibraltar, Qudos in Denmark or Setanta in Malta, are incorporated, authorised and subject to prudential supervision by foreign authorities, and not by the Central Bank.</p> <p>  In the area of business conduct, the Central Bank has put in place a consumer protection framework to protect the interests of consumers in dealing with insurers.  The consumer protection framework also applies to European insurers selling in Ireland on a freedom of establishment basis or a freedom of services basis.  The consumer protection framework includes codes and regulations which set out standards for firms when dealing with consumers, including when selling insurance policies, handling claims and renewing policies as well as the provision of information and dealing with complaints. </p> <p>  The Central Bank does not have a role in the setting of premiums, and like all supervisory authorities in the European Union, EU, is explicitly prohibited by European law from having one by Article 181 of the Solvency II directive.  This is a long-standing prohibition carrying over from Solvency I.  In carrying out their dual mandates of prudential and conduct of business supervision, insurance regulators throughout Europe, including the Central Bank, cannot intervene on premium rates, but must rely on other instruments.</p> <p>  This is because the European single market for insurance has been set up by EU legislators on the basis of free market principles.  This is in keeping with the guiding spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  The contention underpinning this institutional choice is that over the medium term, the free play of market forces brings benefits to consumers which outweigh their costs.  However, it also means that the volatility of prices for insurance services cannot be constrained by insurance regulators including the Central Bank.</p> <p>  Insurance rates are driven by the money coming into insurance companies relative to the costs they subsequently experience, in a similar way to any other commercial concern but year-to-year insurance rates are also strongly impacted by the competitive environment faced by insurance firms.  Prices are affected by the underwriting or insurance cycle which plays out over a number of years. </p> <p>  Insurance firms may fail when poorly selecting risks or underpricing their policies, which is known as "underwriting risk".  This, together with limited shareholder support, is likely to have been the main driver of the failure of Setanta in Malta and Enterprise Insurance in Gibraltar, although only their local prudential supervisors are in a position to tell.  The Central Bank has adopted an intrusive, forward looking and proactive supervisory approach, including in relation to underwriting risk.  Our supervision is conducted through a combination of approaches, including off-site activities and comprehensive on-site inspections.  When we are not satisfied with the governance, monitoring and management of risks, including underwriting risks, we issue time-bound requests for remedial action.</p><p>Such requests can include revised business and capital plans, forms of contingent capital such as parental support and strengthened reinsurance cover.</p><p> In discharging its statutory objective in consumer protection to ensure that, in regulating firms, the best interests of consumers are protected, the Central Bank has focused on: clarity of price disclosure by firms; strong suitability requirements to ensure that any product sold is suitable for the consumer's needs and that any product recommended to a consumer from a range of products is the most suitable from the range available; and ensuring that consumers get relevant information sufficiently in advance to equip them to shop around.</p><p> Let me now turn to the motor insurance market and the way it operates in Ireland.  The Irish motor insurance market is concentrated across eight firms, most of which are part of large international groups.  There is also an active intermediary sector selling motor insurance on behalf of the insurers.  These non-life firms sell a variety of property and casualty insurance policies - there are no pure motor insurance companies among them.  These firms receive premiums from policyholders and investment income from their investments, while they pay out claims to policyholders and injured third parties and pay commission to their distributors, expenses to their staff, interest and dividends to their capital providers and premiums to their reinsurers.</p><p> For non-life insurance companies in Ireland, the balance of costs and revenues has been off kilter for several years.  Premiums and investment income have decreased while claim costs have increased, leading to sustained losses.  Regulatory returns submitted to the Central Bank for companies subject to prudential regulation in Ireland for Irish motor risk show combined underwriting losses of close to &euro;700 million for the years 2013 to 2015, inclusive.</p><p> The returns submitted to the Central Bank by companies subject to prudential regulation in Ireland or operating as a branch show that the gross premium for Irish motor business was a little less than &euro;1.3 billion in 2015.  This represents a reduction of 25% from the 2005 gross premium.  On the other hand, in 2015 gross claims incurred were &euro;1.3 billion.  This represents an increase of more than 40% from 2005, with much of this increase arising since 2012.</p><p> The non-life insurance industry has also been significantly impacted by the prolonged low interest rate environment.  Non-life insurers balance their underwriting results with investment income, mostly interest income from investments in government and highly-rated corporate bonds.  In a low interest rate environment, a much lower investment income cannot compensate underwriting losses to nearly the same extent.</p><p> The bulk of the insurance firms' payouts are through claim costs.  Injury claim costs account for the majority of motor claim costs and, due to the length of time it can take to settle these claims, the true or final cost for an insurer does not emerge for a number of years after it has set the premium and sold a policy.  However, there are a number of changes in the claims environment in recent years contributing to a greater overall cost.  These changes include an increase in claims frequency as a result of increased economic activity and miles travelled.  Average claim costs are also increasing, particularly for bodily injury claims because of a number of factors, including changes in court limits, the introduction of periodic payment orders and the potential impact of lower discount rates.  The Aspiro judgment is an additional factor of claim cost inflation.</p><p> In the face of increasing premium rates, the consumer protection framework provides that consumers must be given at least 15 working days' notice prior to renewal providing an opportunity to choose an alternative provider.  Based on external market research, it is clear that price is the main driver of consumer switching behaviour.</p><p> Let me turn to the supervisory action of the Central Bank and provide a few examples.  Last year, the Central Bank conducted a bodily injury review to investigate the trends in frequency and severity of these claims and the quality of firms' approach and governance around the issue.  We found a clear, if disparate, trend towards both greater frequency and cost of bodily injury claims.  We also found slower settlement rates, uneven data management quality, and instances where boards exercised less monitoring and oversight than required.  This highlighted that some firms were lagging behind peers in taking the full measure of emerging claims in their technical provisions and estimates of ultimate claim costs.  We issued recommendations to individual firms and made clear our expectation that up-to-date claims data inform reserving as appropriate.</p><p> This year the Central Bank undertook a sample review of motor insurance underwriting and pricing to investigate each firm's governance of its underwriting and pricing methodology, assumptions and decision-making around pricing.  We found that there was a significant time lag between increasing claim costs being experienced and the revision of pricing assumptions.  Some of this was due to firms underestimating the extent to which claim cost increases were structural and not cyclical, and some was due to firms taking commercial decisions to delay increasing prices in order to hold market share in the face of some competitors pricing much lower than break-even.  The delay in incorporating fully in premiums rates the current trends in claims experience contributed to suppressed premium increases, followed by a large upswing in premiums.  Had prices risen earlier and more gradually, some of the heavy losses firms have experienced here over the last few years, in particular, those firms that engaged in very low pricing, would have been avoided, and consumers would have started to pay higher premiums earlier, albeit at a more gradual pace.</p><p> In addition, given the patchy experience of foreign firms selling motor insurance into Ireland on a freedom of establishment or freedom of services basis, the Central Bank is engaging directly with the relevant home state regulators to ensure that they have a full understanding of the issues affecting the Irish market and to request they act accordingly.  The Central Bank is strongly proactive in this regard.  We provide our counterparts with clear information about claims in Ireland and remind foreign regulators of their responsibilities towards Irish policyholders.  Indeed, as already mentioned, the Solvency II directive squarely places the sole responsibility of financial supervision of foreign firms on foreign regulators, and prescribes that the home state regulator verifies for the entire business the state of solvency, its assets and its technical provisions.</p><p> As I mentioned at the outset, average premium rates over the cycle are driven by the overall claims charge, if not exclusively.  Policy actions that would result in a reduced level and uncertainty of claims would contribute to reducing the rise of average premium levels or might even reverse the trend.</p><p> This committee has heard the many strands that would contribute to that worthwhile goal.  Let me start with comments which are relevant to the topic but which lie outside the remit of the financial supervisor.  All actions that would reduce the number of road traffic accidents would be welcome.  Typical among those are improved infrastructure, stringent enforcement of road safety rules or continued enhancement of public awareness about the preventable causes of accidents.  The committee has also heard about the extent of fraudulent claims and the levels of uninsured driving that are said to prevail.  Policy actions that would help reduce either would also help reduce the claims charge that is ultimately to be borne by premiums.  Finally, the committee has heard about the role and effectiveness of the injuries board, and how it has contributed to speedy and fair settlements that avoid unnecessary legal costs.</p><p> I would now stress that greater certainty and reduced volatility of the claims factors would benefit consumers and create a more stable reserving environment.  Multiple decisions over the last three years, although taken for valid reasons, have had an opposite side-effect.  Since insurance companies need to book reserves with a risk margin, the greater the uncertainty, the greater the claims estimates.  In that regard, I can only welcome the publication of the revised book of quantum and hope it will steer broadly compensation settlements and decisions in the future.  All these policy actions would give a foundation for more sustainable insurance premiums.</p><p> On foot of the many strands of work involved, the Department of Finance is leading a multi-departmental insurance policy review.  The Central Bank contributes to this work and shares what information it has at an aggregate level to assist the Government to decide on next steps.</p><p>The Central Bank will continue to focus on the adequate protection of policy holders and beneficiaries in accordance with its dual role of ensuring the solvency of Irish interests and adherence to the consumer protection framework.  The Central Bank recognises that the significant increases in the price of insurance have an impact on consumers and is committed to working with the committee, the Department of Finance working group and other stakeholders as is appropriate to the mandate of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Irish motor insurance is less than 2% of business written in Ireland.  Most of the business we supervise is life insurance business and most of the non-life business we supervise is abroad.  The vast majority of motor insurance business written in Ireland covers foreign risks.  When I give answers, I have to not look at published accounts of these firms, given that the published accounts will cover much more than domestic motor insurance.  I must examine statistics in lines of business that cover Irish risks.  These are not strictly speaking accounting returns.  I can point towards the underwriting profit or loss.</p> <p>  During the past ten years, firms made declining underwriting profits until 2008.  From 2006 to 2008, it was &euro;700 million.  Since 2009, with a blip in 2011, they have made an underwriting loss every year.  In 2008 and 2010, they made losses of a little less than &euro;100 million.  There was a loss of &euro;34 million in 2012, &euro;189 million in 2013, &euro;230 million in 2014 and &euro;333 million in 2015, and we expect there will be a loss this year.</p></speech>

Regulatory returns submitted show combined underwriting losses of &euro;684 million for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015.  It is accepted and I agree that it appears in the statistics.  Motor insurance companies make losses in a number of years and a consequence is that they increase prices to try to return to profitability.  However, in the preceding years when they made profits, the profits were not carried forward.  The profits are distributed whereas the losses are not.  Does it not place an unfair burden on those who have to get car insurance?  If there are profits, they are taken by shareholders, whereas if there are losses, the companies do not look to the shareholders but to those who need car insurance.</p></speech>

The shareholders shouldered all the losses sustained since the beginning of the decade.  As the losses were removed from the wealth of the companies, they resulted in a net loss for shareholders and the value of the businesses was reduced.  The solvency of the firms was eroded and shareholders were asked to put more money into the companies.  During recent years, hundreds of millions of euro was put back into these companies through capital increases by the shareholders.  In a sense, they have covered the losses.  In the years when companies made large profits, one could say policyholders were paying too much for cover.  However, during recent years, they have not been paying break-even prices.</p><p>What is the situation with premiums charged today?  We will know only in a few years if they are over or under break-even.  Our sense is they may be barely breaking even, given the claims cost and charges.</p></speech>

It would have stable premiums, a level of profit that is neither too high nor loss-making - as a company must be a sustainable business - and no sector is seeing losses year after year that are eroding the capital base.  That is what we want to see.  When there are loss-making businesses, we get nervous because it erodes the solvency position.  When there is a very high profit margin, that is where the act of faith referred to by the Deputy comes into motion.  The presumption is that in a market where there is a very high profit, new entrants will come in and drive down premium rates.  That is what we expect to see.</p></speech>

The report published towards the end of last year relates to the private motor insurance statistics for 2013.  The point is made in it that younger policyholders continue to present the highest average surpluses.  Will the witness unpack that?  Is that indicating the extra amounts being paid by young drivers, on average, for their insurance is above what is justified by the extra risk associated with young drivers?  Is that a fair summation of its meaning?</p></speech>

My sense is if that is the case, one might expect some insurers to bring down the prices for young drivers.  That is what one might expect to see.  It would not go to the average level because young drivers have more accidents.  This goes back to my point on uncertainty.  When a person looks for insurance cover and there is a long history of being insured, the insurers know more about that person and can price more precisely about risk.  A young driver does not have a claims history and the insurers build in a greater margin for uncertainty.  They do not know if a young driver drives safely because there is no history on which to build.  One would expect a greater margin of uncertainty.</p></speech>

The definition of average surplus per policy is the average earned premium income per policy less average claim cost per policy.  If it is the case that the Central Bank is saying that younger policyholders continue to present the highest average surpluses, it indicates not just that they are paying more in line with the increased risk but they are paying more on top of that again.  Surely that is what is stated in the report?  It is not just saying that young drivers are paying more.</p></speech>

I would expect there to be a greater margin for uncertainty for young drivers but for me the point is that if the Deputy is right, we would see competitors entering that segment of the market and driving down prices.

As the Deputy said, this is a truism and is the insurance or underwriting cycle.

It is not that we do not see the figures or companies making losses.  We monitor solvency and when it is threatened or we see a trend that cannot continue, we act upon it.  We cannot prevent shareholders from deciding they will stay in the market.  What happened in the Irish market, until the failure of Setanta, was that at least one actor was always willing to underprice.  At that stage the commercial decision by other actors was either to price themselves out of the market - suffering losses for another reason because of their cost or expense base as there is not sufficient business to absorb it - or to make the opposite decision to stay in the market and ask for less than break-even prices.  We let this play out, because that is the insurance cycle, until there is a risk for the solvency of firms.  When there is a risk for the solvency of the firms, we act and we have done so.</p></speech>

As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in prices for consumers who saw increases of 28% last year and increases of 70% in recent years.  Rather than acting properly, the insurance companies took people on a peak-to-trough rollercoaster ride as they tried to follow the market.  Was it not the job of the Central Bank to say that this policy was imprudent?  The companies' underwriting was imprudent because they were building up unsustainable overheads.  As a result, they eroded their capital base.

He is saying we should have acted in a way that would have caused prices to increase earlier.  This would have meant that policyholders were paying more at an earlier stage.  There would have been a more gradual increase.  We cannot act in such a manner.  Firms have requirements and we monitor against those requirements.  When we were under Solvency I, as we were until the end of last year, firms had to respect a solvency margin because of the minimum harmonisation directive.  Rather than asking for the solvency margin, the practice in Ireland was to ask all firms to have between 1.5 and two times the solvency margin.  We decided we were not comfortable with the EU rule and we decided to set the Irish rule at a much higher level.  As long as one does not reach a requirement, one does not reach a requirement.  We are talking about actions that force commercial entities to do certain things.  We do not have the power to run these companies.  They either adhere to these requirements or they do not.</p></speech>

We have a very bad reputation for companies passporting into this country, or companies domiciled and operating in this country going bust.  As we know, people are picking up the price for that.  One of the recommendations suggested by the IMF is that the Central Bank should use its macroeconomic tools to develop its own stress test, in line with the European stress test, to look at extreme but plausible cases and stress them in terms of capital adequacy.  The IMF has pointed out that the Central Bank has the power to do certain things it has not done in the past.</p> <p>  I will repeat my original question.  When did the Central Bank become aware that, as the former Governor, Professor Honohan, wrote in a letter to the Minister for Finance, companies "built up an unsustainable overhead and followed an imprudent pricing and underwriting approach across most business lines"?  According to Professor Honohan, this "resulted in companies' business plans becoming less resilient to downside risks such as an increase in frequency and severity of claims"?  He went on to say "in effect, by failing to charge premiums sufficient to cover claims costs and expenses, several Irish general insurance companies have eroded their capital base".  The Central Bank is responsible for making sure erosion of the capital base does not happen.  I am asking when the Central Bank became aware that insurance companies in Ireland were acting imprudently, which I define as having no due regard to the consequences of their actions.</p></speech>

It is not the case that one wakes up on a particular day and realises that this is happening.  We engage with firms day in and day out.  We supervise them.  I do not agree with the Deputy's presumption that our job is to ensure there is no erosion of the capital base.  Erosion of the capital base is allowed in the insurance cycle.  Shareholders have a right to engage in that behaviour as long as we are satisfied that the company's solvency is not at risk.  As a result of our actions, since I arrived I have not seen any of the actors we regulate going bust.  They did not go bust because we monitored them.  We asked for and demanded parental support, reinsurance cover and capital injection.  This was done in due time so that during the period in question, none of the Irish policyholders suffered.  The only people who actually picked up the tab during that period were the policyholders.</p></speech>

When did the Central Bank become aware that this was the case?  I am not asking for a date or a time.  I am asking whether this was happening in 2010, 2012 or 2014.

In 2012, the underwriting loss was &euro;34 million.  That is a very small loss.  It was known about at the back end of 2013.  It gets serious in 2013.

In 2013, the underwriting loss was &euro;189 million.  That is a loss.  It was the first year in the underwriting cycle in which there was a large loss.  That 2013 figure would have been known about towards the end of 2014.  We had acted long before then.  We had detected the trends.</p><p>This was in 2014 when the first reliable information that claims were not just bobbing up and down and trends were being sustained emerged.  That is when it became clear that the underwriting cycle was becoming acute, but we had acted by then.  We asked the firms to take the actions for which we were allowed to ask, namely, to revise their business plans, explain to us how they could sustain their business models with the discrepancies between premiums and claims, set a budget for the losses that they were willing to take via distribution channels and explain how their reinsurance cover would work.  The actions have worked.  These companies are solvent.  The parental support, reinsurance cover and capital injections have worked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.1163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016100600002#G00200"><p>I take that on board.  I am not suggesting that the companies are not solvent - ensuring they are is the Central Bank's responsibility - but the Irish people are on a rollercoaster ride.  Individuals are being forced off the road and into parking up their cars.  Businesses have not been able to expand because of the dramatic increase in insurance premiums.  It is because of this boom-bust cycle of premiums going high, low and then high again.  There does not seem to be a proper approach to ensuring that premiums are based on risk.  If they were, they would not have been able to dip to an unsustainable level and they would not be where they are now.  Customers are the ones dealing with it.  There is a big difference between a 40% increase in a premium and a 2% increase year on year over a longer period.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about investment income.  I thank the Central Bank and Ms Cronin for writing to me earlier this year in respect of this matter.  Investment income has created a major loss for insurance companies that, in previous years, made up the loss in underwriting from investment returns.  I commend the Governor, Professor Philip Lane, on calling on insurance companies not to chase risky investment.  That was prudent.  According to the IMF report, investment income in 2015 was down by two thirds compared to 2011 and, as a result, motor insurance premiums in particular increased by 20% in some cases last year.  The IMF has made a direct link between the fact that quantitative easing has resulted in bond yields dropping to negative territory in some cases and low rates in others compared with where they were previously and insurance companies - having taken significant losses on their books - trying to make up for those losses in underwriting.  Is this Dr. Roux's view?</p> <p>  The committee has heard about a number of factors that might address the rising cost of premiums, for example, insurance claims, the courts and the book of quantum that we debated yesterday, etc.  Where do investment losses, as a factor of the increased premiums, stack relative to the other factors that have been mentioned heretofore?</p></speech>

Where one can supplement one's premiums with investment income, one sets those premiums at a different level than when one cannot supplement them with investment income.  That is an economic factor for insurance companies.  They operate in a world in which, if they stick to prudent investment, Government bonds and highly-rated corporate bonds, they will have low investment returns.  To pay for claims, expenses and commissions, they cannot rely nearly as much on investment income, so they need to increase premiums, which they do.  When their investment returns increase again, they will be in a position to reduce premiums.  That is not something on which they have much of a handle without chasing returns, as the Deputy mentioned, and opting for riskier assets.  If one keeps everything stable except claims, commissions, legal fees and so on and one reduces investment income, one must raise premiums.</p> <p>  How much does investment income account for in the profit and loss account?  Typically, the motor insurance line of business has two years of premiums on its balance sheet, which means that it will have two years of income to add to the premiums.  If one has a 5% return, one has a 10% investment income in one's profit and loss account.  If one loses that, one will have to raise premiums by 15%, for example, to compensate.  That is not specific to motor insurance in this regard.  The effect is even greater for longer lines of business.  It is a liability.  This situation is not specific to Ireland either, as it happens throughout the eurozone and other advanced economies.</p></speech>

Through a freedom of information request, I received the documentation that backed up the results of the stress test.  How many people participated then and how many are participating in the current stress test?  Will Dr. Roux clarify whether motor insurance will be examined in the current stress test?</p> <p>  In reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated, "For the low yield scenario exercise, it was found that the Irish sample was not particularly vulnerable to either of the low-yield stresses."  There are low yields and insurance companies have lost approximately &euro;100 million in investment returns over a three-year period.  As a result, they are not becoming insolvent, but they are pushing up premiums.  Did the stress test get it wrong?  Did it fail to identify some of the weakness in terms of a sustained low-yield environment?  Will the Central Bank take on board the IMF's recommendation and develop its own stress test, one that would examine an extreme but plausible scenario using its macroeconomic tools?</p> <p>  I have a final question.</p></speech>

Some 72 staff positions are sanctioned for 2016, yet only 58 staff members are in place.  The report also mentioned that the Central Bank was not considering taking summary proceedings, those being, criminal proceedings, against insurance companies and had instead opted for administrative sanctions.  Dr. Roux stated that there was a high cost to proving criminal cases and a low fine was imposed as a result, but is the Central Bank seeking for the fine to be increased in legislation?  Were there situations in which the Central Bank could have pursued criminal sanctions against the insurance industry?</p></speech>

EIOPA designed its stress test to examine major risks to the insolvency and sustainability of insurers in the eurozone.  A major risk is posed by those insurers that offer long-time guarantees on returns.</p><p>The firms are not Irish.  In the main, they are continental insurers that offer guaranteed returns over a long period when the investment income is way below it.  The gist of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, stress test is to look at insurers, located mostly on the Continent, that offer long-term guarantees and consider whether they will honour their commitment to their policyholders when the investment returns fall far short of the guaranteed return.  This is what is at stake.  It is not something that has a direct bearing on our industry.  There are no long-term guarantees in non-life because one can change premiums every year.  In life, most of the Irish industry offers unit-linked products.  The continental companies would have a serious problem in Europe and this is what the EIOPA stress test tries to address.</p><p> I am sorry but I did not jot down the next points.   </p></speech>

We operate below complement in enforcement and in other areas and this has gone on for years.  If our complement was increased then our staff number would increase.  We operate below the number of people required to do our job but it is not just a question of having enough people.  Our staff members are very dedicated and work well beyond their contracted hours.  Some of them have been with us for a sufficient length of time and are experienced but not many.  What we experience, and Ms Cronin and Mr. Sheridan can say, is that at any point in time, more than half of our staff will have been in their positions for less than two years.  That is not the right make-up for supervision, as one needs expert judgment but that can only be gained by experiencing an insurance cycle.  One needs to see what happens when times are good and bad.  Unfortunately, we do not have that expertise and, therefore, rely on a few experienced supervisors to train the younger staff. </p> <p>  As far as the triage of cases between the administrative sanctions procedure and the criminal cases is concerned, the situation has changed with the August 2013 Act because before that, we could only do a small amount of fines and enforcement.  The enforcement action of the Central Bank, while exemplary for being made public, would not have made a difference financially.  Now that we have revised legislation, and I thank the Oireachtas for having passed the Bill, is we need to show, during settlement or inquiry, the burden of proof, and the level of fine and speed, and that all points towards using our enforcement powers.  It is not to say that at times when we see criminal action that we will send it to criminal action but my barristers have told me that it is not often the case.  One needs a high bar and then one goes through a lengthy process but, unfortunately, one sees little.  We will not shy away from taking action.  When we see a case for it we will do it. </p></speech>

He has watched a gross underwriting loss from 2009 to 2012, with the exception of 2011, jump from &euro;189 million to &euro;213 million and, in 2015, to &euro;333 million.  I shall question Dr. Roux on the matter later as members wish to finish asking questions.</p> <p>  The Central Bank operates below its full complement of staff.  Is that a policy matter?  Is it due to the bank's inability to find the right people to fill vacancies?  </p></speech>

To ensure internal fairness in terms of staff, new staff are paid on the same pay scales as existing staff who are under FEMPI.  We have a public service pay scale but the private sector pay scale has increased.  As years go by, the gap increases between the pay the same person can get working for the Central Bank and working in the private sector.  The nature of financial regulation means a number of our staff can work either with us or in the industry that we regulate by way of consultation work or in professional services firms or law firms, for instance.  It is very difficult for us to sustain the discrepancy.  The Central Bank is aware of the matter and has designed an alternative reward model.  We know how we could pay our staff, were we put outside of FEMPI legislation.  That is all done but the decision to place the Central Bank outside of FEMPI is not for us to make.  If that decision were taken, we know how much to pay staff.</p></speech>

That is not to say we would ever think of aligning Central Bank pay with private sector pay.  People who work for the public good will be paid less and that is as true today as it will be tomorrow, whatever the situation.</p><p>That is a choice people make, but there is a point at which people come to us and say that their spouse or children do not understand.  Why would I deprive myself of a better life if I have an offer that means I will be paid 50% more?  At some point people just leave.  That is reasonable.  People build their lives.</p></speech>

We looked forward to his visit with much anticipation.  I believe he is the final witness.  I will start with a few brief questions.  In terms of the raw data available to the Central Bank of Ireland, is Mr. Roux satisfied he has all the raw data he needs from the insurance industry, and is he satisfied with the integrity and the timing of that raw data?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.1196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cyril Roux" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016100600002#J00300"><p>It is always a mixed bag.  We are just at the cusp of changing our data.  I will explain.  Until the end of last year, we were operating under Solvency I, which means that the data we received was based on Solvency I reporting.  Solvency I reporting was not unified.  We had our forms under which we collected information, and that was under-developed compared to what can be found in other markets.  Certainly, we collected less data than the financial provider I know best, by a significant margin.  That was the data we were operating under until the end of last year but as of this year, we are operating under Solvency II, and in that regard we have a changed world in terms of the quantity of data we are asking for, and the built-in integrity of data will be much higher.  We have moved from asking templates that I can print and give to the members to a different world where the data we collect is not something I can put on a sheet of paper.  It gets into a database and I can query it.  I am no longer able to say, "Fill in this template".  That is no longer the world in which we operate.  That data will be coming in the course of this year, and especially at the start of next year because that will be the first full year.  It will not just be for us.  I stress that the important part of it will be made public as a report on solvency and financial condition.  Members will see, in the spring of next year, each firm disclosing high quality data and high quality forms that will inform public opinion, views and public debate.  They will see a sea change in that data.</p> <p>  There will be teething problems in the first year of operation of a new system, so I do not think the data we will get next year will be of the utmost quality.  It will take two or three years so that in terms of all these teething problems, people will not make mistakes.  We are moving to a different world.</p></speech>

In terms of the Central Bank's consumer protection role, one person stated publicly last night that their insurance had increased from &euro;1,200 to &euro;7,000 in one year so it is of little solace to those people for Mr. Roux to say the Central Bank will get more data but it will not be available for a further two years.  Had that data been available when everything started happening, does Mr. Roux believe it would have flagged to him earlier, as the regulator, the need to do further investigation into what was going on in the insurance industry?</p></speech>

It seems to me that the factors at play in motor insurance over the insurance cycle in Ireland are very directional.  It takes time to see them emerging, but I think they became clear in 2014 and 2015.  Better and more data would have enabled us to fine tune the weighing of the various factors but I do not believe they would have changed our supervisory engagement that significantly.  I do not believe it has a direct or even indirect bearing on the current premiums asked of policyholders.  I understand the difficulty faced by the Senator's constituent, but it cannot be related to the granularity of the data we do or do not have.</p></speech>

If he does not have enough now with the extra data, it will impose further pressures.  What planning is he doing to ensure that there are sufficient resources within the Central Bank to be ready to do what needs to be done with that data?</p></speech>

We established, under the chairmanship of Sylvia Cronin, an extensive Solvency II committee.  The IT and data areas are something on which we spend a lot of time.  It involves not only insurance supervision, but our IT colleagues opening online reporting to collect XPRL data, which is a different methodology.  For me, the most difficult point, and this is not something about Ireland but in terms of all supervisors, is that when one moves from one referential to the other referential, one loses the time series.  One tries to do <i>pro forma</i>of previous data, but ones loses a history or a trend.  That is the most challenging part.  People are being trained.  We have put a good deal of resources into it.  We will encounter hiccups, like all regulators, but I am not concerned that will hamper our supervisory action because the trends are clear.  We will not lose sight of that.</p></speech>

Mr. Roux flagged in a letter to Mr. Derek Moran that additional measures that could be taken to strengthen the supervision of non-life insurance included consolidation of disparate insurance regulations in a coherent whole, transposing without further delay the Solvency II directive.  Has that happened?</p></speech>

Our Department is always up against the clock to transpose Solvency II, but we operate under Solvency II and that has been transposed in time.  That takes care of the first question.</p> <p>  With regard to consolidation, Solvency I was not consolidated in European terms.  There were 14 directives, but Solvency II swiped that clean and replaced those 14 directives with one.  We did the same, in a sense, so for all insurance firms operating under Solvency II, the transposing Act acted as a consolidator.</p><p>We have a handful of firms which are so small that they operate under Solvency I and we have not consolidated those.  In the main, the insurance companies we are talking about come under that.</p></speech>

Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, report which stated there are several powers under regulation which do not carry over to groups.  At the same time, the IMF knew at the time that all these partially observed principles would be observed once Solvency II came into effect.  They have come into effect.  The transposing instrument of Solvency II has given us those powers because it has changed groups of provision.</p> <p>  In my opening statement, I stated most of our domestic and non-life insurance companies belong to international groups, such as AXA and Allianz.  Groups of provision are much strengthened by Solvency II.  When we are the group supervisor, we have those powers.  When we are not, our counterparts have them.</p></speech>

One element is that the insurance compensation fund would cover the claims in full.  As the Senator knows, the insurance compensation fund would cover up to 65% of a claim or up to &euro;825,000, whichever is the lower.  The first building block of the Government's proposal is to ensure the insurance compensation fund now would cover 100% of claims.  While it would increase consumer protection, it would be paid for with an increased levy.</p> <p>  The Government's alternative financing arrangement for the extra 35%, which would be added to actual insurance compensation fund, would have MIBI pay for it.  The committee has heard the objection of the insurance industry about having to bail out their competitors for the consequences of them failing.  Insurance Ireland stated to the committee that it is like Dunnes Stores bailing out Tesco.</p> <p>  There is a balance of view.  It is the Government's decision whether or not to impose that 35% extra cost directly on the insurance industry - what the industry claims it would do it for them - or through an alternative route.  There are pros and cons for several options.  We will operate whatever the Government decides.</p></speech>

Money is being sucked out of local economies.  Is the impact of this on employment potential in rural areas a concern for the Central Bank?</p></speech>

Leaving aside my hat as Financial Regulator while putting on my Central Bank one, the Central Bank is part of the European system of such banks.  Its mandate is to ensure price stability.  When prices get out of hand in general, inflation affects people's lives.  Inflation affects the poor disproportionately.  That is why the European Central Bank is taking these actions, namely, to ensure price stability.</p><p>However, in the main, it has succeeded.  Although price inflation is not exactly where the ECB wants it to be, it is very low.  This means that, on average, price inflation is low.  It does not mean that some prices do not increase.  Insurance prices are increasing very sharply.</p><p> This raises the question as to whether rural parts of the country are suffering from local inflation in terms of their basket of goods and services.  I do not know the answer to that but they suffer an increase in those prices and they also suffer increases in other prices.  Health insurance premiums are increasing and the price of other items is also increasing, but the price of some items is decreasing.  For example, energy and fuel prices are decreasing.  In the main, overall, I am sure that some people noticed price inflation.  The price inflation of the goods and services they buy is significant, but as to whether it is a significant problem across the board, I do not know.  If that is the case, that is a matter for this committee and for the Oireachtas as a whole to decide whether and how to counter-balance the disproportionate effect inflation might have on some segments of the population.</p><p> I would add a further comment.  The &euro;1.3 billion in premiums that was mentioned by the Senator that is being taken out of the pockets of people is being given back in that claims are at the same level as premiums.  That money is not given back only to policyholders and victims, because insurance companies have to pay their lawyers and their fees can account for a large chunk of the money.  Claims have been increasing and sometimes that is to cover actual loss and sometimes it is cover questionable loss.  With respect to claims, the Senator has probably heard that much of it is blanket money given to every person claiming they have suffered whiplash.  Some people have suffered whiplash but the handing over of &euro;15,000 to any person who says he or she has suffered whiplash is money that goes back into his or her pocket.  In some cases such payments are warranted but in other cases they are not.  Such payments act as a redistribution machine.  A total of &euro;1.3 billion in premiums is being taken out of people's pockets but &euro;1.3 billion in claims settlements is being redistributed to other people's pockets.</p></speech>

Ms Sylvia Cronin is a member of the board of supervisors at the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, representing Ireland.  There we work together on finishing the single rule book, issuing technical standards, working on supervisory convergence and designing stress tests.  The Senator's question points to something more practical about the actual supervision of individual firms.  There are two elements.  There are the supervisory colleges.  When we supervise, say, AXA Insurance or Allianz, we are the supervisor of AXA in Ireland and there is a supervisor of AXA in Italy.  The head of the group is in France, so the French supervisor brings together the supervisor of AXA in Ireland and our colleagues in Italy in the same room in Paris in France to discuss the issues we see, the problems we face and the risks these companies are taking on.  We have a supervisory college where we discuss individual groups, such as AXA or another other group.  The AXA college meets every quarter, I think, and there are teleconferences, so the process is very live.</p> <p>  In banking we have a single supervisor in the eurozone and everything that takes place is decided by the European Central Bank.  In insurance, we do not have a single supervisor but we have a system by which the group supervisor takes the helm and drives the supervision of these groups.  I will complete the answer by referring to something that is even more relevant.  It relates to those firms that are not part of the group and are foreign firms such as Setanta and Zenith Enterprises.  We have been extraordinarily proactive here.  We have gone way beyond the polite practice of supervision and have written to our colleagues.  We have gone to see them and have put on the table the issues we believe they should be aware of and upon which they should act.  We have put their responsibilities squarely in front of them.</p></speech>

The Senator should have been in the room when I have told firms what they are going to do.  We issue letters and make the process formal and we can even issue directions.  We can direct them to stop writing business, but usually we do not need to do that.  The writing is on the wall.  It is better when people come to us, we tell them that we are not happy, this is what we want to see and that is what we see.  They call it management action and everyone is fine with that.  Management action, indeed, but we will have told them in no uncertain terms what we want to see happen.  I refer to various actions that I mentioned earlier in this hearing about parental support, capital injections, reinsurance cover, underwriting discipline and reserving.  We get into conversations and things change.  This is how we operate.</p></speech>

There can be several market equilibria.  Market equilibrium existed before the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  At the time, claims were adjudicated in court.  Then, through the action of the Members of Parliament - the predecessors of the members of this committee - the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was set up and claims were settled there with reasonable speed and with avoidance of unnecessary litigation and legal cost.  What we are told and what we see now is that people go to the Injuries Board with solicitors, for the most part.  They pay their solicitors to go to the Injuries Board and, in a number of cases, they reject the settlements offered to them and go to court because they believe they can get more out of it.  That is now the market equilibrium.  It is not something we can adjudicate on.  In a sense, it is an institutional and social choice.</p></speech>

It will have relevance to UK and Gibraltar firms operating here.  Some UK groups operate here with a subsidiary, such as RSA.  RSA Ireland Insurance is an Irish firm.  My sense is that it will continue to operate as an Irish firm.  Aviva and AIG are UK firms that operate here with a branch business under freedom of establishment provisions within the European Union.  When the UK moves outside of the European Union, the status of UK branches will change.  Perhaps there will be transitional arrangements or an agreement to enable UK companies to operate within the EU as a branch or perhaps not.  This is not something I can foretell.  We have seen UK firms operate on a branch or subsidiary basis and this has changed over time.  I expect there is potential for change.</p></speech>

There is business model risk, counter-party risk, underwriting risk, which I mentioned, and there is investment risk, to which Deputy Paddy Burke referred.  Firms can lose money on investments when they invest in riskier portfolios.  However, what we see in the main from those actors is that they have traditionally been rather conservative in their investments.  For the most part, they invest in Government bonds and corporate bonds.  The corporate bonds they select are highly graded and rated.  Then, there are some cash and cash-like instruments.  The parts of their investments more exposed or riskier are rather limited.  Thus far we have seen a conservative investment profile in these factors.</p></speech>

Under Solvency I, firms had diversification forced upon them.  Insurance companies could not invest in more than X% or Y% in each asset class and no more than X% or Y% in a given company.  There was forced diversification.  That was the world of Solvency I and it operated until the end of last year.</p><p>Solvency II is a different world.  Companies invest as they like, and in the main can invest in anything they like.  The price they pay for that is that the greater the risk of the investment, the more capital they need to hold against the risk of loss.  That is the change of world, because the world changed on 1 January 2016.  We have not seen companies turning around their investment all of a sudden and moving from the conservative, diversified world into something else since the beginning of the year.  They have the potential to do so if they want to but they have not given an indication that they intend to do so.</p></speech>

I do not think there is such a dearth of information that would prevent new entrants to the market.  I do not think that is the case.</p></speech>

Which of these statements is correct?  Does the Central Bank have sufficient information, hard data from Insurance Ireland, or is Insurance Ireland withholding information?  Does he believe that Insurance Ireland has more information that it could give the Central Bank that would inform different stakeholders in the industry?  That is what is being said.</p></speech>

I do not know.  I think that is a claim that has been made by Zenith Insurance.  It came at a very particular time, just on the heels of the failure of enterprise.  Zenith had been operating here and suddenly after the failure of enterprise the company said it did not have enough information, after having been here for years and gaining market share.</p></speech>

It may have come from Zenith at some stage, but I am referring to the statements that were made to the committee by witnesses such as Irish Road Haulage Association or other groups that came before us, who seemed to think that the Central Bank is not being given the full scope of information that is available to Insurance Ireland.  What I would like to know is whether the Central Bank has a full and total handle on the insurance industry in Ireland in the context of the information that it should have and should be in the public domain.</p></speech>

Insurance Ireland is a source of information for the statistics department of the Central Bank, which publishes the figures that we looked over at the very beginning of this hearing.  The supervisor, or the Financial Regulator, works on the basis of the supervisory returns.  The supervisory returns come from insurance companies and everything we ask for we get from the insurance companies.  That is the way it works.  We ask for the supervisory returns and we get them.</p></speech>

We do not require it.  We do not need it.  There are many ways to cut claims into different parts.  The information we need to do our work is a separation between material damage and bodily injury damage.  It is the settlement rates, a prori development.  It is what is covered by arrangements or not.  There are other things one would want to know about claims to inform public policy but this data is not information that is needed to conduct supervision and we are not allowed to ask for information that we do not need for supervision.  We have very strong powers to force insurance companies to give us the data that we need, but we cannot ask for data that we do not need.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.1287" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cyril Roux" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016100600002#N01900"><p>There are two points.  First, what is the equilibrium premium and, second, whether the high premium people pay today is the equilibrium price, that is, something which is sufficient to cover the claims that will come out of the policies that people buy.  The jury is out because we will know in several years time but our sense, and it is very preliminary, is that prices are at barely break even level.  If the claims were to stay where they are today, and if the investment income was to stay where it is today, then the equilibrium premium would be where they are or slightly higher.  That is my contention.</p> <p>  There is an insurance cycle, so year on year premiums can be higher or lower.  As this committee wants to achieve a significantly lower charge of claims, a sustainable lower charge of claims would be the way to give the ground for sustainably lower premiums.  This is why the work of this committee is so important in looking at fraud, whiplash claims and roads safety.  The book of quantum was published yesterday and the hope is that it will be used as judicial guidelines, although it is at the discretion of the Judiciary.  All of that is very important.  If the claims stay at the level at which they are now, however, and if the aggregate cost of claims stays at this point, there is no basis for a sustainable reduction in premiums.  That is why it is so important that the overall cost of claims goes down.</p></speech>

They do not get that sense of confidence from the Central Bank.</p><p> Mr. Sheridan's title is director of consumer protection.  I have to tell him motorists do not feel protected.  In fact, they feel no one is being protected, except the insurance companies themselves, and that they are being thrown to the market.  Dr. Roux must take note of this.  As a result, the premiums that are being asked of individuals who have been insured are outrageously high.  They have gone from &euro;1,000 to &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000.  Insurance companies that cover the haulage sector are increasing their premiums to the extent that they are putting companies out of business.  In fact, some of the hauliers will tell us - we heard it last night on the television and previously at this committee - that they insure now in a different country but those insurance companies abroad are linked to the same insurance companies that are represented here.  One must ask why that is the case.</p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh raised a further question on the economy.  Our economic development is being hampered and damaged by the high cost of insurance.  Taxi drivers have made it clear to us that their insurance costs are driving them out.  The Irish Road Haulage Association has come here and said the same.  Individual insurance policyholders have come to members of this committee stating they cannot go to work because they cannot get insurance, and they are looking to these Houses.  We are doing our best.  They are also looking to the Central Bank.  They are probably saying in their minds to Mr. Sheridan, "Where are you?  Can you please defend us from these high insurance costs?"  They are expecting an answer from the regulator and from their protector, the consumer protection section of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

This does feed in to how people conduct their lives.  It makes it more challenging.</p> <p>  Back to our role in terms of pricing, I must stress that we cannot, through the consumer protection framework, undermine the fact that we are precluded from controlling the rates that insurance companies charge.  Those are commercial matters for the insurance companies themselves.</p> <p>  In terms of consumer protection, consumers want and assume the insurance company will be there at the end of the day to pay out on claims and, as Dr. Roux mentioned already, claims are being paid out which represent the premiums that have been paid in over the years.  We have seen the detriment that occurs when insurance fails and a key consumer protection function we have is ensuring those firms are solvent at the end of the day and can meet their obligations.</p> <p>  The framework in place in Ireland is ahead of that in most European countries in terms of what we are doing for consumers and in terms of the staff who work in insurance companies meeting minimum competency standards.  We have rules in place and regulations, in terms of renewal notices and in terms of ensuring claims handling is fair and appropriate, and we also regulate the intermediary sector.  We do a lot in consumer protection, but in terms of price control, that is clearly something we cannot intervene on.</p></speech>

We are not saying anything different from what we are saying to the committee.  It is a matter of judicial discretion so the judges can decide to follow or vary from the book of quantum.

I thank Dr. Roux for his presentation.  There is nothing in the section on working towards a solution other than fewer crashes and more enforcement.  There does not seem to be anything the Central Bank can do to help.  I think we all know that if everybody slows down and has fewer claims and if we got rid of fraud, we would have no claims, which would be fantastic but we know people will have crashes and injuries.  It does not give me an awful lot of hope.  A revised book of quantum is included in the section on solutions.  There is quite a bit of talk that the revised book of quantum is purely reflecting what has happened and could lead to an increase in payouts as opposed to anything else.  There might be a bit more certainty but the only certainty seems to be that the price is going up.  That is what we have seen over the years.</p> <p>  People are looking at this and are clearly very exercised about it.  I think this is the last scheduled session.  We have had four and a half days of this stuff before this morning.  We keep saying it is lack of data.  The insurance companies say they give the data to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank says it does not collect the data because it is either not allowed to collect them or is not entitled to ask for information it does not need.  We would like to see visibility on the 70% of claims that, as far as I can see, are invisible.  We do not know what is happening in that sector.  We can see what is happening in the courts and we are told that court claims are not increasing.  We can see what is happening in the Injuries Board stuff and that is not significantly increasing yet motor insurance premiums have increased by 70%.  It is not a loss in investment income; it is a reduction in the amount of investment income earned.  Many commentators talk about how they have lost all this money.  It is just that they are earning less.  We know that but we do not have any visibility.  As far as I can see, the Central Bank does not have any visibility regarding the 70% of claims that are being paid out.  We asked Insurance Ireland whether it gives everything to the Central Bank.  It said "Yes" but then said that it only gives what is asked for.  When we then asked it for figures, it basically told us that it does not even compile some of the figures we were hoping to get.  There seems to be a significant lack of data available to us and regardless of whether it is the Central Bank's issue or someone else's one, we are not getting it.  Many people here might think the Central Bank would be a sensible place for it.  It might or might not be.  </p> <p>  In his comments on supervisory areas of focus, Mr. Roux referred to slower settlement rates, uneven data management quality and instances where boards exercised less monitoring and oversight than required.  That does not inspire a lot of hope in me or, I am sure, other members of the committee that the insurance industry is really serious about tackling the problem.  It seems to me that it is quite happy or at least content to just pay out bigger claims and pass on the cost to the consumer and that is what we are seeing.  There is the question of whether it is done in a cartel-like fashion.  We talked about signalling with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  Can the Central Bank give consumers and the public any hope that this situation will be improved or is it just a case of "they were too cheap in the past.  Get over it."?  </p></speech>

In the first half of the decade, prices were well below break-even.  They moved sharply up so that they might be break-even today.  To get a sustained decrease in premiums, you need a sustained decrease in claims and to get that decrease in claims, you need a number of strands and avenues.  One is, as the Senator noted, fewer accidents, fewer claims and fewer fraudulent claims, while another is lower cost by claim.  The incontrovertible fact is that claims must be paid by premiums and when you are in low-income or zero-interest-rate environment, there is no source to pay claims other than premiums.</p> <p>  We have the data we need to supervise and look after the solvency of these firms.  The data we need as supervisors are sufficient.  Why is that?  It is because we are not a statistics office as a supervisor.  We do not collect the data to give us answers.  We collect data to enable us to ask questions.  The spirit behind the data we collect is they will enable us and inform our supervisory engagement.  With that, we go into firms, inspect, look at the IT and work alongside the firm to understand where it is coming from.  We get other sources of data that are firm-specific.  By themselves, the data do not speak.  The data we collect are not for us to give the final view.  All these actual data are always blurred.  They are blurred either because you are looking at the accounts and then get the claims data from many different years all into the one place or because you try to look at the line of business and how things will develop.  Here you need to do forecasts, look far into the future and make an educated judgment about the trends you can discern.  You construct another blurred picture and mix all of that.  On the fact that you are not getting clarity, nobody gets clarity.  Carrying out supervision and getting a sense of where you want the firm to go is a complicated business.  We have the data we need to conduct our supervision because we do not rely on them exclusively and we know that if there are some biases in the data of firm A or B, we know how to correct them silently and make them talk to other sources of evidence we have, so we have the information we need to execute our mandate in respect of solvency.  </p></speech>

Why is that?  As I explained, it is because Solvency II is a sea change in the information chain.  It relates to the information you need to collect and means those on the ground, such as people in claims centres, need to ask different questions which are put into different treatment chains.  This is a major challenge not only for the supervisor in respect of getting ready but also for the insurers.  In the build up to Solvency II, they spent effort and energy in building the new information chains while the old information chains were creaking a bit.  You do not repair to the same extent something that you will abandon at the end of 2015.</p> <p>  In terms of governance, we wanted to carry out a public service by making available to the public the thing we saw and then by challenging boards to reflect on that and to contrast the situation of the information they got from the management to the information we give to them, as well as the situation of their firm to the situation of other firms.</p><p>We give that information and we use it to challenge boards to act upon it.  The risk appetite statement and the way it is articulated is very important for us.  It is important that the board monitors the risk the management takes.</p></speech>

If one looks at a niche player that would only concentrate on a particular age group or something like commercial vans, for example, they will have different economics.  At Setanta I was mostly on private vans.  I do not want to go into the specifics of firms but my understanding of Aviva or AIG business is that they are main players so their economics would be the same, at least for premiums and claims.  Then one gets into something more tricky which is how branches are treated.  A branch is not a company.  The way a UK company, for instance, will allocate cost to a branch is something it does the way it wants.

We were told by the Injuries Board that its claims have been fairly static over a number of years.  Court claims have been relatively static over a number of years.  Premiums are going up by 70% in line with alleged requirements.  We are trying to work out what has changed.  Whiplash settlements are higher here than anywhere else and legal fees are higher than in many other jurisdictions where they do not have an at-fault culture.  Our medical costs are different because they are not socialised the way they are in the NHS in the UK.  If the court claims and Injury Board claims are not going up, it must be that 70% of claims that are going up.  The investment income and the historic losses are part of that but we do not know what is happening to the 70% of claims that are being settled.  If the witnesses have that information, I would like them to share it with us.</p></speech>

They always have to think what the cost will be for the accidents that happen today.  If there are ten accidents today, what is the expectation of the settlement cost of those ten claims?  From a supervisory perspective, we have looked at the assumptions the insurers are making.  We have to be satisfied the assumptions the insurers are making include all the changes happening in the claims environment.</p> <p>  When we look at what has happened, we know for a fact that in 2014, there were increases in the limits for District Court and Circuit Court charges.  Second, there was the recovery of social welfare benefits which took effect in August 2014.  Third, the establishment of the Court of Appeal resulted in the appointment of new judges in October 2014.  Nobody knows what impact that will have.  It could result in an increase or decrease in claims costs.  Fourth, the discount rate reduced from 3% to 1% as a result of the Gill Russell case in December 2014.  They were four specific changes that happened in 2014.  Those changes need to be reflected in the assumptions within insurance companies when they are looking at their claims.  As a supervisor, we will be looking to see if they are included in the forecast of settlements in order that we have reassurance that companies have the reserves needed to pay out the claims.</p></speech>

The Central Bank has put in place these new changes and it is effectively, as the supervisor and regulator, asking insurance companies to charge more.</p></speech>

We are not saying people who should not be entitled to get a claim should get a claim.  Is there any hope for the 92% of people who pay in more and more while their car is getting older, they are getting older and they are probably getting better at driving over time?  Is there any hope there will not be a 70% increase?  I know we are not talking about signalling.  Is there likely to be more rather than less stability, based on all the changes the Central Bank has made to put more stability into people's balance sheets?</p></speech>

Ten to 12 years ago, prices and claims were high and the Government and the Oireachtas took action to reduce them.  There was an effective, multi-strand policy.  Ireland has done it before and this should give us comfort that a multi-strand approach would work.  Some decisions are judicial decisions that the committee and the Central Bank cannot do anything about.  When judges say, for good reason, an insurer cannot continue to operate at a 3% discount rate but must operate at 1% discount rate because it is the new normal and is what they should expect, it is incumbent on firms to recalculate their claims taking into account a discount rate that moved from 3% to 1%.  This means a higher claims provision, and we will ensure firms recalculate.  It is a judicial decision and a fact of life.  It is not a capricious judicial decision and is well reasoned but it has that effect.</p> <p>  On the legislative side, when the Government decides to ask insurers to pay for disability benefits, I do not question it.  It is probably for a good reason.  However, it will have an impact.  It means insurers will need to pay with premiums.  In everything we do, we must think about the balance of benefits for society and the impact it has.  This is what Members of the Oireachtas do every day when they make decisions in the House.  There is hope for greater stability.  I hope the book of quantum will be used very broadly, including in court.  We will have to see about that.</p></speech>

There are two complications.  One is that although risk weight is assigned to each investment class, the overall capital they need to hold is not the sum of it, as it would be calculated in banking.  Given that insurers believe they are cleverer, they diversify away their risks.  They can hold a diverse bunch of assets-----</p></speech>

They cannot increase their share capital.  The only way they can increase their capital is to increase their reserves.  The only way they can increase their reserves is by increasing their profits.  The only way they can increase their profits is by charging higher premiums.</p></speech>

As one increases one's reserves, one reduces one's ability to take investment risks.  One can only take so much risk on the basis of the size of one's balance sheet.  If one is taking a lot of reserving risk, rather than having an increased risk margin, one has less room for taking investment risk.  While I understand the Deputy's line of inquiry, I do not think this is what is playing out today at all.</p></speech>

As far as ordinary drivers from all age groups who were looking to get motor insurance, including young drivers, were concerned, this did not come to light in real terms until this year.

Those accounts are available.  The Central Bank reports on the aggregate profit and loss of firms each year as part of the macrofinancial review in its own economics publication.  If the Senator were to go back and look at the macrofinancial review that was published by the Central Bank at the time in question, he would see that it was made clear that the insurance cycle had turned, or was turning, and that these firms were making losses.  That was clear.  We fulfilled our mandate to the Irish policyholders because these companies remained solvent at all times even though they were starting to make losses.</p></speech>

I had a quick look at some of the rulings made by the Court of Appeal since November 2015, when it appears to have got going.  In some areas, the Court of Appeal appears to have significantly reduced the awards made in the High Court.  As Ms Cronin is probably aware, the reductions vary from 30% to 50%.  I assume that is factored in.  As we have heard, 14 companies - a majority of the 22 companies in the market - account for 40% of the market.  This figure has increased from 30%.  Can their customers be assured that the companies selling motor insurance to them are solvent?  How does Ms Cronin see the future for ordinary motor insurance customers over the next five years?  What would all the witnesses recommend in terms of policies from a regulatory end, from the perspective of the insurance companies and from a legislative end, in terms of the Government and the Legislature?</p></speech>

This is my main concern.  That is why this committee and the working group chaired by Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, are so important.  They need to come forward with policy actions that will bring down claims.  Prices do not slavishly follow claims.  For years they can be below the claims and for years they can be above them.  A factor that has driven prices down below a break-even level was the willingness of some actors - either here or elsewhere - to get into predatory pricing.  If one or two actors engage in predatory pricing, that forces prices down.  It is not a sound way of getting premiums down, but it is a way and it has operated in the past.</p></speech>

The sound way to bring premiums down is to bring claims down.  We cannot see that inordinate profits are being made in insurance.  We welcome the review that has been started by Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC.  The Chairman asked earlier if insurers are working as a cartel.  That is a matter for the commission to inquire into, which it is doing.  We are ready to assist it in its inquiry.</p></speech>

Mr. Sibley's speech last week focused on the difficulties with regard to the non-performing loans and the problems they cause for borrowers, banks and the wider economy.  He noted that the number of non-performing loans had significantly reduced and is expected to continue to reduce.  However, these loans remain elevated at the level of &euro;45 billion across five domestic lenders.  We think that efforts need to be redoubled to continue to bring them down to more normalised levels, in particular for mortgage loans.  Mr. Sibley noted, and this is what attracted the attention of this committee, that the memories of some people, both inside and outside the banks, appear to be short.  We have already seen some evidence of a return of more aggressive lending practices and cultures.  However, that is not to say that the banks are out of control, they are not, or that they are returning to pre-crash practices, they are not.  We need to remain vigilant in respect of the risk that the lessons from the failures of the period up to 2000 are not heeded.</p> <p>  In our recent supervisory work and on-site inspections, we have identified weaknesses in new lending practices and in controls in some of the domestic lenders.  They include, for example, a need for better oversight and challenge from the boards of banks in terms of banks' risk appetites, which are used to govern and quantify lending decisions.  We have seen strategies that are focused on deriving increased volumes of lending without sufficient consideration of risk factors involved.  We have seen their return to the use of league tables to incentivise staff to drive lending volume without sufficient consideration of quality and we have seen issues with pricing models that take insufficient account of the underlying risks.  It is disappointing to see these issues emerging but they are only emerging trends and we notice them as they emerge.</p> <p>  The banks and the supervisory regime are entirely different from what they were in 2008.  Again, we identified these issues as they began to emerge and we require them to be remediated now.  We challenge the business models and strategies and have ensured greater bank capitalisation and a better funding position.  As we do in insurance, we constantly challenge the banks to ensure that they do proper underwriting.  In this context, it would translate into effective credit risk management arrangements.  We require the weaknesses that we saw in our on-site inspections and other work to be remediated and we also use macro-prudential instruments.  We use counter cyclical buffers and other buffers.  We use mortgage measures, the loan-to-value, LTV, and loan-to-income, LTI, measures, that constrain the risk that banks and borrowers take.  It is in that context that I assure the committee that we are vigilant in ensuring the mistakes of the past are not repeated, especially in the context of the high level of indebtedness in Ireland and the challenges of the banking sector.</p></speech>

Those in government have given the Central Bank the authority to decide on these matters and this is a very serious matter of us to decide on because it affects people's lives.  I assure the Senator that the commission of the bank, which makes those decisions, and the whole bank - the supervisory part of it, the banking supervisory divisions and directorate, the economics part and the financial stability part - are working very hard to take into account all viewpoints, experiences and evidence that is given to us in order to assess the impact it has on borrowers, banks and the wider economy.  As we did previously, we will publish a number of elements of our research and economic studies to answer the question that the Senator asked.  The latter will inform the decision the commission will take in the November.  I am one member of the commission, the membership of which is nine or ten now.  The debate has not taken place.  As commission members, we are given information, research, studies and elements to consider what would be the best course of action.  At this stage, we have opened the consultation process, although it had never been closed.  We are considering the evidence.</p><p>We will act on this evidence to see how best to protect people.  When these measures were introduced and this calibration was chosen after serious deliberation, we saw which cohorts of borrowers got into trouble, which were over-indebted and got into protracted financial difficulties.  We do not believe that it is fair to disregard that evidence.  That helped our decision.  We would not want large cohorts in risky lending practices or being exposed to the risk of being over-indebted in the future.  We have to balance that with the need of families, particularly young families, to establish a home, and we do.</p></speech>

It is effectively getting to the point where because there is no demand and people are not able to meet the deposit levels, it prevents supply coming to market.</p></speech>

Is Dr. Roux concerned that because it is a percentage of a total amount and if that is relaxed to 10% the house price will go up in an inverse relationship to the extent that, instead of a person having to find 20% of &euro;400,000, he or she has to find 10% of &euro;800,000 or &euro;80,000 either way?  There has been a slower rate of increase or even slight dips in Dublin.  The people who might have been looking in Dublin have moved to the Kildare, Meath, Wicklow commuter belt because that is the only place they can get their 20% deposit for a house.  Is that a concern?</p></speech>

I am joined by my departmental colleagues, Niall Egan, principal officer of working age and child income policy; Erika Klein, assistant principal officer of working age and child income policy; and Fiona Ward, divisional manager of the Dublin south division.  I am also joined by Paul Hessian, a higher executive officer in my division.</p> <p>  Since 1997 the one-parent family payment, OFP, scheme has played an important role in providing income support to lone parents.  The scheme currently supports almost 41,000 lone parents and is estimated to cost approximately &euro;500 million in 2016.  The jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, JST, supports almost 15,000 lone parent families and is estimated to cost approximately &euro;177 million in 2016.  In total, more than &euro;1 billion was spent by the Department on lone parents during 2015 across all schemes including family income supplement, FIS, back-to-work family dividend, child benefit and other schemes.  The one-parent family scheme has undergone significant reforms since budget 2011, which have seen the qualifying age of the youngest child for receipt of the payment gradually reduce to seven years of age.  There are special exemptions for those who are recently bereaved, are caring or are in receipt of a blind pension.  Prior to the reforms, the OFP scheme was payable until the youngest child was 18, or 22 if in full-time education, with limited engagement from the State.  Spending on the scheme exceeded &euro;1 billion per annum from 2008 until 2012.  This support produced poor results in terms of tackling poverty rates among lone-parent families.  The scheme was administered centrally, resulting in many lone parents being disconnected from the education and employment supports that were available to them.  The need to tackle these issues through an active labour market policy approach was addressed in detail in the OECD report, Babies and Bosses: Reconciling Work and Family Life, which was published in 2003.  The report argued that the passive income support policy towards lone parents until their youngest child was aged 18 or 22 years was a significant contributory factor to the low levels of employment and high levels of poverty among them.  The Department reached the same conclusion in its report, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, published in 2006, which highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s outlier status in terms of the maximum qualifying age of the youngest child.  The report recommended that there was a need to bring the OFP scheme in line with international standards where there was a general movement away from long-term and non-conditional income support and towards a more active engagement approach.   </p> <p>  The first reforms to the OFP scheme were introduced by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2010.  On foot of this change, from 27 April 2011 a new entrant could remain on the one-parent family scheme until his or her youngest child&rsquo;s 14th birthday.  Budget 2012 extended these reforms so that a lone parent&rsquo;s entitlement to the OFP scheme would continue until his or her youngest child&rsquo;s seventh birthday.  The reduction in the age threshold of the youngest child was implemented on a phased basis for all recipients during the period 2013 to 2015.  As part of the Department&rsquo;s wider reform programme, in particular the integration of the Community Welfare Service and the public employment service elements of F&Aacute;S into the Department, the administration of the OFP scheme was devolved to Intreo centres, thereby connecting lone parents with the integrated services now available in those centres.  A number of changes were made to the original reforms including the introduction of the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, which was a significant change as it gives lone parents whose youngest child is under 14 years of age choice around work and caring for their young children.  Another change was extending the existing special provision for carers to lone parents caring for people other than their children.  This extended the existing arrangement where a lone parent with a child in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance can remain on OFP until that child&rsquo;s 16th birthday.  Payment of OFP for those in receipt of the blind pension was extended and the back-to-work family dividend was introduced, which is paid on top of an individual&rsquo;s family income supplement entitlement.  Lone parents affected by the reforms transition to alternative income supports including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment and family income supplement.  The reforms ensure that, for the first time, lone parents gain improved access to the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service.  Those who transition to JST or JA have access to a case officer who assists them in producing a personal development plan.  This tailored plan supports them towards appropriate education, training and employment support opportunities based on their individual circumstances and requirements.  </p> <p>  The implementation of the reforms was thoroughly and carefully planned by the Department.  The Department set up an implementation group and a dedicated project team, given the large numbers involved, in 2015.  In addition, the Department liaised with other Departments on the reform, most notably the Departments of Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs.  The Department regularly engaged with lone parent representative groups on the reforms.  This involved consulting with them on the content of the correspondence issuing to lone parents and their feedback was taken on board.  The lone parent representative groups received regular information updates and regular briefings in advance of each July and after each budget.  Issues raised by the groups concerning specific individuals were followed up and resolved.  Since 2011 all affected customers have received a number of letters from the Department explaining the changes to the scheme.  Approximately 18,000 people transitioned from the OFP scheme between July 2013 and June 2015 to alternative social welfare payments.  The final phase took place on 2 July 2015, when approximately 25,500 recipients transitioned from the one-parent family payment to another of the Department&rsquo;s income supports.  Of the 25,500 customers affected by the OFP reforms on 2 July 2015 the majority transitioned to the following schemes: 13,600 to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment; 2,500 to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme; and 8,100 to the family income supplement scheme.</p><p>Affected customers were invited to an information seminar with staff at their local Intreo offices.  These seminars began in February 2015.  Approximately 750 information seminars were held throughout the country and approximately 25,000 people attended.  Every effort was made to contact customers who did not respond to the invitation.  In 96% of cases, the transition to another social welfare payment was seamless.  For the remainder, a contingency plan was in place if a customer was without payment where a designated member of the community welfare service was available in each Intreo office to arrange a supplementary welfare allowance payment in the interim.</p><p> It will take several years before the full impact of the reforms can be assessed.  This is due to the fact that lone parents on foot of the reforms will take up education, training or employment support programmes which will take time for them to complete.  However, early indications show some positives outcomes.  More than 3,000 lone parents became new FIS recipients by the end of 2015, indicating that these customers entered or increased their employment.  Through the combination of earnings and FIS, these lone parents have been lifted out of poverty.  A total of 4,500 JST customers have either met case officers or are being scheduled for appointments.  Of these, 1,400 have met case officers and agreed and are progressing with personal plans.  Of those 1,400, just over half have moved into education and training, ranging from personal development to third level.</p><p> Along with the changes to the reforms, there were other measures contained in budgets 2015 and 2016 which benefitted lone parents.  For example, budget 2015 maintained the OFP income disregard at &euro;90 and budget 2016 introduced the following measures: the alignment of the JST means test with the more generous OFP means test; the FIS threshold was increased by &euro;5 per week for each of the first two children; child benefit was increased by &euro;5 to &euro;140 for each child per month from January 2016; a 75% Christmas bonus was paid to recipients of long-term social welfare payments, including to OFP, JST and back-to-work family dividend recipients; and the fuel allowance was increased by &euro;2.50 to &euro;22.50 per week from January 2016.</p><p> The Department&rsquo;s social impact assessment of the cumulative impact of budgets 2015 and 2016 showed an increase in the average household income of employed lone parents of 2.8%, comparing favourably with an average household increase of 2%.  The Department is continuing to build on the OFP reforms and the key areas are child care, in respect of which the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is the lead on the development of the single affordable child care scheme, and barriers to third-level education for lone parents, in respect of which the Department of Education and Skills is taking the lead.  The Department of Social Protection is continuing to work with those and other Departments on these and other relevant issues.</p><p> I thank members for their time and I would be happy to answer any questions they may wish to pose.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the fact that her job is to administer the scheme as it stands.  Policy is a matter for the Government and administration is a matter for the public service.  I have a question for the Minister on lone parents later on this afternoon so I will have a chance to discuss the policy there.  The witness stated that there was regular consultation with lone parents right throughout the process whereby the change was brought about.  The implication seems to be that they more or less went along with it.  That does not seem to accord with the reality.  I have been in regular discussion with the various lone-parents groups and I have not met anybody, quite frankly, who is happy with the changes.  I say this with the greatest of respect to the witness.  The picture she paints does not seem to accord with the reality as experienced by me on the ground.  I have constant complaints through my constituency office from lone parents who have lost out.  These are working lone parents, not non-working lone parents for whom nothing has changed.  I understand that the basis of the policy is to activate more lone parents and get them out to work.  However, I have a regular flow of complaints - the latest was last weekend - from single parents whose income is less as a result of these changes.  We had a visit last week from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The written submission it provided us with stated, "The main impacts of the reform of the OFP have been to reduce the income of lone parents in employment; and to reduce the likelihood of lone parents who are not in employment, education or training to take up work or education in the near future".  That is the conclusion reached by Society of St. Vincent de Paul, having done a survey on the matter.</p> <p>  We are now also in possession of the Millar report.  The Millar report is very critical of the changes.  It states that the OFP "needs revision".  It states that the OFP has had the perverse consequences of both reducing household income and reducing the incentive to go out to work.  I came into possession yesterday of a matrix done by SPARK, one of the organisations representing lone parents, that showed clearly the changes to the detriment of working lone parents, especially once the back-to-work family dividend ceases.  As we know, it is only a two-year payment of 100% for the first year and 50% for the second.  Therefore, I am a bit baffled to hear that everything seems to be grand, incomes are up and everybody is happy.  I cannot speak for my colleagues and I can only speak for myself.  This is the experience I have had.  This is what I have been told by organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, SPARK and all the different organisations representing single parents.  As I say, it accords with my experience.  I do not want to take up too much time.  How does the witness reconcile that and answer all of these criticisms?  Everybody seems to be unhappy from the point of view of working lone parents.</p> <p>  I understand that a single parent who is working - and, therefore, getting FIS - and who is in receipt of maintenance payments, will be advised, or there is going to be a campaign, by at least one or more of the organisations representing the sector, to the effect that he or she should transfer from FIS back to JST when the back-to-work family dividend runs out.  This will be done on the basis that he or she will be better off.  I have been sent figures which prove this.  If the basis of the policy is activation and to encourage single parents to go out to work, the effect of it seems to be that there will be thousands of single parents advised next year - by way of a public campaign - to go from work and FIS back to JST.  The latter is exactly the opposite of the direction in which the policy was supposed to lead them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.1484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016100600002#E00300"><p>I welcome the officials.  Not only do I and many lone parents have concerns, as Deputy O'Dea correctly stated, many organisations also have concerns.  I will go through some of those concerns in a moment.  We know all of the facts and figures in terms of the numbers of single-parent families.  One in four families is a one-parent family.  That is a sum of 215,000 one-parent families across the State.  We know the figures in terms of poverty.  A total of 23% of one-parent families live in a consistent state of poverty.  Those figures are not mine; they are recognised and approved figures.</p> <p>  One of the harshest cuts that was implemented and that has compounded the difficulties lone parents are facing was that to the one-parent family payment in 2012.  It has had a hugely detrimental impact, not just in terms of poverty or access to education but right across the board.  We know that the Minister of the day said that these cuts would not come into effect until we had a Scandinavian-type child care service within the State.</p><p>That has fallen off the radar.  There is no affordable child care and certainly no Scandinavian model in place here.  We will wait to see what comes out of next week's budget but I would not hold out much hope for it.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission report recommended that the State actually reverse these measures that were introduced in 2012, in the absence of an adequate and affordable child care system being in place.  That commission has called for a reversal of these measures because of the detrimental impact in terms of poverty and all the other areas.  There are questions to be asked around that specific element but I also have other points to raise.  I will put the point separately to the Minister later, but based on the recommendation by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, could I get a view from the Department officials who are here now?  Has the commission's report been taken into consideration at all by the Department?  Has the reversal of the measures been costed by the Department?</p><p> Another recent report "Lone Parents and Activation; What Works and Why", commissioned by the Government, carried out by the UNESCO- child and family research centre, is a review of the international evidence in the Irish context.  There are some lines in the report about the policy changes to lone parents which certainly strike a chord with me but, more important, show clearly the real world facts affecting the real people about whom we speak.  The report states: "[the change] has the</p><p>perverse effect of encouraging welfare dependency and reducing household income."  We know from lone parents themselves that these changes have trapped them in greater poverty and they feel stuck.  They cannot leave their children at home alone, they cannot afford child care and therefore they cannot go out to work.  They are worse off than before.  This Government-commissioned report backs up the evidence from the real world.  Perhaps the officials could offer a view on that.</p><p> We have already touched on the lone parent families who are living in consistent poverty, which is 23% of lone parent families.  That compares to 8.2% of other families who live in poverty.  We know the facts there but the measures that were introduced are compounding the problems of poverty for single parent families.  The at-risk rate for single parents is 31.7% who fall into that category.  I have specific questions around that report and the poverty faced by single parent families.  Of the 23,000 children across the State who are reported to be living in consistent poverty, do we know how many of those children are actually in single parent families? Do the officials have those figures and facts or could they be provided to the committee?</p><p> It is clear that in order to tackle childhood poverty it is essential that poverty in one parent families must be targeted.  Can the committee get an overview on how the Department is actually going about this? I do not want to put words into her mouth but the witness said that the measures introduced in 2012 have given a certain perception but we need an overview of what is being done to target those families.  The reality, on the ground, says differently.</p><p> Another serious aspect of the impact of the cuts on single parents is in the area of back to education.  There is huge concern.  While lone parents on the one parent family payment can receive the back to education allowance, new measures that were introduced reduce the age of qualifying children from 14 years to seven years.  People are being told they can go on to the family income supplement but once a single parent goes onto that payment they do not qualify for, or are not entitled to, the back to education allowance.  That measure has had a huge impact on single parents which is hard to quantify.  I am not sure if it is easy to break down the figures, but could those figures be forwarded to the committee so that we can see how many single parents have been denied the back to education allowance due to these measures?</p><p> There has been a lot of talk about another report that was due to be published in August on barriers to educational access for single parents.  In the programme for Government it was planned to have the report published before the budget.  We know the budget is next week and we know that report has still not been published.  All the evidence from these organisations states the measures already introduced are having a detrimental impact on these families and I fear we are now entering a budget without the report.  With regard to the back to education allowance, I do not want to pre-empt the report's contents and I am sure the report will highlight some concerns there.  Part of the process in the programme for Government was that this report was to be available, so the budget could be framed around some of the measures such as removing the barriers for access to education for lone parents.  However, as the budget approaches we have not seen the report.  I am not sure if the Department has seen it or is aware of the report's contents.  I am not aware of it and I do not know when the document or report is going to be published.  Perhaps the witnesses have some inside information from the Minister.</p><p> Based on the facts, is the Department seeing the barriers that have been put in place through these measures and cuts removed with regard to facilitating single parents to return to education?  Can they give the committee some facts and figures?  It is probably difficult to break it down from the overall back to education allowance applications.  I do not know if it is an easy process to whittle it down to see how many of those applications are from lone parents, prior to 2012 and subsequently.  I thank the officials for appearing at the committee.  The measures that have been introduced are a huge area of concern and are having a detrimental impact.  They are not helping lone parents.  They are actually compounding the difficulties and the real poverty that exists for these lone parent families.  The figure of 23% living in poverty comes from 2013 and I would be interested to see the more up to date figures on lone parent families who live in consistent poverty.</p></speech>

I understand, as has been said already by the officials appearing before the committee today, that they are responsible for the administration of the payments and not the policy.  There are however some points I wish to make.  The cuts to lone parent payments were probably the most controversial cuts during the austerity years because they have impacted so hard, particularly on the parents who are working.  At the time we had this discussion in 2015 we made the figures very clear for the Department with regard to the example of a lone parent with one child earning &euro;8.65 per hour, which was the baseline used by SPARK.</p><p>Someone who was working 20 hours pre-July 2015 would have been on a wage pf &euro;173 a week, in receipt of the OFPA of &euro;176, family income supplement and the fuel allowance, giving him or her an income of &euro;453.  By July 2017, lone parents will have lost &euro;80 of that sum.  We brought these figures to the Minister and the Department never questioned them.  They were accepted as being close enough to the correct figures.  Lone parents who are working 20 hours a week will lose 18% over the two years; those working 28 hours, 14%; and those working 35 hours, 11%.  I do not know how the Department can state these working parents have not lost out.  The issue should be addressed in the next period as a matter of policy.  SPARK has come up with a few effective measures in its pre-budget submission to address the impact of the different payments and so on.</p><p> I wish to raise a child maintenance issue.  In July 2015, 15,000 lone parents were transferred from the OFPA to the jobseeker's transition payment.  When the legislation was being drafted for that payment, the Department forgot to include a provision covering a liable relative.  As a result, in October 2015, it wrote to thousands of dads to tell them that as their former partner was no longer in receipt of the OPFA, they had no further obligation to the Department to pay maintenance for their child, unless a court order was in place.  This has resulted in a significant reduction in the maintenance payments made to single parents.  Non-custodial parents have received letters telling them that they are no longer obliged to pay maintenance, yet the parent raising a child is expected to seek maintenance because the Department told him or her to do so.  I would like to hear a comment on this because the lone parents in question have been put in a difficult position as they have to approach their partners to seek maintenance, even where they have had rows with them, when it should be paid directly.</p><p> I understand the reason the officials say they do not make policy, but there are other issues, particularly the poverty rate among lone parents with children aged under 18 years, which stands at 22.1%.  It is 7.9% for families comprising two adults with one to three children aged under 18 years, while it is 11.9% for other households with children aged under 18.</p><p> Last Sunday I participated in a debate with a Minister.  I asked him why the Government would not introduce a financial transactions tax.  He replied that the reason it would not entertain something like it was that it felt jobs would be lost.  We have a scenario where the circumstances of many one-parent families were not poverty proofed.  We tend not to protect those who are most vulnerable.  I would like the officials to examine the suggestions made in the SPARK pre-budget submission to tackle the measures in which they believe they were dreadfully let down.</p></speech>

This measure was introduced in 2012 and there have been more anomalies and holes in it than Swiss cheese.  The more I look at it, the more it looks like single parents were targeted for political reasons.  Deputy Joan Collins touched on what it was all about.  As she said, next year the income of a lone parent who is working 20 hours a week and in receipt of social welfare payments will be down by 18%.  If that is intended to remove people from poverty, it has been completely ill-thought out.  I do not know who is thinking this stuff up and would like the issue to be addressed.</p> <p>  Deputies Joan Collins and Willie O'Dea mentioned the child maintenance issue.  It throws up many questions, with parents having to chase up others who leave the scene.</p> <p>  I did not read all of the Miller report, but it categorically states labour activation measures ultimately do not work; therefore, somebody has got the policy wrong.  Single parents are exposed to consistent poverty which this attack on them has compounded.  Somebody has to ask questions about why this is happening because in the past four years we have gone backwards rather than forwards.  Single parents will say there had to be changes to the OFPA, but, overall, everything that has been put in place has been detrimental to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.1489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016100600002#G00300"><p>I welcome the officials and thank them for their presentation.  Previous speakers have highlighted the amazing number of holes and anomalies in this policy approach and it seems that each time the Department attempts to put a patch on one, another issue arises.  There is a patchwork of measures in place to cover over a fundamentally flawed approach.  I will not touch on them or the many new problems arising, but I will do so, if we have time later.  There will be more holes because people continue to face real life challenges.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Ryan for delving into the origins of this issue.  While it is worth revisiting, it may also be worth throwing a different eye over it.  The fundamental problem highlighted at the beginning, for example, in the Babies and Bosses reports and others was the limited engagement by the State or its failure to engage with lone parents and to support them adequately in accessing education and employment.  It was not a failure of lone parents, many of whom were striving to improve their lives and access opportunities.  The 2006 report mentioned by Ms Ryan contained proposals to support lone parents.  I question the way it was framed because it did not focus on conditionality as the main issue.  It referred to what a meaningful set of supports for lone parents would look like.  It was a combination of the child care and social supports needed, as well as education and training opportunities.  The narrative was to provide support for lone parents in accessing opportunities, not conditionality.  It is, therefore, important that we do not retrospectively pick out one aspect which was focused on to the detriment of the thrust of the report.  At the time, many lone parent groups engaged with the constructive proposals made in it which were then lost, for example, those relating to the introduction of Scandinavian child care models.</p> <p>  A fundamental problem with which the Department needs to wrestle in all of its schemes is the underlying assumptions, or push and pull.  Rather than focusing on the pull factor of greater supports and incentives for lone parents, there is an assumption that we need to move towards giving a "push" and focus on conditionality.</p><p>The obstacle all along has been the assumption that lone parents, some of the busiest people in Ireland, are somehow not looking, pushing for or seeking opportunities.  That fundamental assumption is visible across many other areas and I hope we will question it when we come to deal with other areas, such as qualified adults.</p><p> We need to focus on the pull and the supports, rather than a narrative of conditionality because that narrative has brought all of these problems upon the Department and upon lone parents.  The assumption is that we need to move people to the live register before we can give them decent training and opportunities.  Why were all the case workers with their personal development plans not directed to those on the one-parent family payment?  I am sure there are many who would have appreciated a heavy investment in resources in that area.  Instead they must first be pushed into the live register.  That clearly does not work.  The jobseeker's transitional payment has been introduced.  It should actively recognise the value of caring but instead of an active engagement, it has waived the requirement for full-time employment, which is a small step and is not enough.  However, by putting people on jobseeker's transitional payment, the Department lost visibility of lone parents in the system and was no longer able to respond in the same appropriate way to their concerns.  I recognise this was a political decision not that of the witnesses who are officials. </p><p> If I believe we have used the wrong cart we have also put that cart in front of the horse.  The measures were not adequately or appropriately designed and were implemented well ahead of any of the ameliorative supports being put in place.  Any response now comes afterwards.  We talked about 3,000 lone parents whose income has improved, out of 43,000, that is less than 10% of those who have been moved.  When we say "they moved" we should be clear they "were moved" from the one-parent family payment.  That leaves more than 90% of lone parents whose income has not been shown to have improved.  As for the 4,500 appointments with case workers, that is less than 10% of all those who have been moved.  Child care hours run to tens of thousands for the women, mainly, who have been moved, while the number of child care places accessed is in the hundreds.  These people have been shown to be the poorest in the country and most at risk of deprivation, and to have the least wealth resources, according to the wealth survey last year.  They do not have something to fall back on while things are being sorted or child care is being arranged.  They do not have reserves.  People only go without and deprive themselves when they have to make hard choices on the basics of life.  We have asked them to carry this period of transition rather than front-loading a period of support and transition before asking people to engage with them.</p><p> The risk that has been thrust onto lone parents applies at an even more dangerous level to maintenance payments.  The Department - because of the anomalies, because it is the live register and jobseeker's transitional payment and not one-parent family payment - has not only sent the message to absent parents that it will not look for maintenance but has placed a requirement on lone parents to contact partners, including partners who potentially engaged in domestic violence.  Whether it has been proved or not, many lone parents who might have been affected by domestic abuse have a genuine fear of being forced to chase up and press a former partner and they fear the penalties if they do not.  The human rights report was mentioned but we have a public sector duty, which affects the Department and which I am sure the Minister is cognisant of because we raise it with him all the time, to ensure human rights and equality.  We also have a duty in respect of poverty proofing.  We have commitments to gender and equality proofing in the budget.  There is nothing more clear than that this is a gendered issue because it affects women in the majority.  Surely all of these considerations give us an opportunity and a mandate to go back and re-examine this policy.</p><p> I believe the Department has engaged constructively with anomaly after anomaly.  I recognise it has sought to change the policy in respect of reducing income disregard when that was shown not to be working.  I believe it can now take the Millar report and all those strong mandates which it does have, as an opportunity to review, consider a change in direction and maybe to learn from some of the mistakes made around that process.  I will not discuss the specific issues but I know the witnesses are aware of them because I have spoken to Mr. Egan about anomalies in connection with back to education, the student universal support, SUSI, grants, the education and training board, ETB, courses and rent allowance, that patchwork of measures.  In respect of those who are not on jobseeker's transitional payment but on jobseeker's allowance and who have teenage children, the excellent research by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, which the Department funded, on minimum essential standards of living showed that the cost of raising a teenager in Ireland is much higher than that of a younger child yet those lone parents on jobseeker's allowance who have a child aged more than 14 are completely invisible in respect of that cost.  </p></speech>

Case officers have worked with many lone parents on delivering tailored plans.  Has there been analysis of the type of educational opportunities or training or employment opportunities they have taken up?  Access to child care is a problem and I look forward to the announcement of a new package in the budget next week.  It is a particular challenge for lone parents.  It is a particular challenge also that they cannot access the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance when they move to on the family income supplement, FIS.  Does the Department have plans to tackle that or do the witnesses think there is a need to do that?</p></speech>

Within the Department, what significance is being given to the Millar report?  How is it being analysed?  Will the Department read the recommendations and findings and issue its own report, supporting further change or whatever, based on the Millar report, which was substantial?</p> <p>  Ms Ryan indicated the Department is responding to an administrative process.  Policy decisions were made but that is a different issue.  If the decisions were made and well motivated, the challenge within the Department is to ensure there are no unforeseen consequences and that the changes are analysed and kept under constant review and the reforms as initiated are amended to ensure anomalies are dealt with.  Ms Ryan mentioned in her reply that 18,000 were moved from the one-parent family payment between July 2013 and June 2015 to an alternative social welfare payment and a further 25,000 from 2015.  Later, she said it would take several years before the impact of the reforms could be assessed but early indications show some positive outcomes and referred to more than 3,000 lone parents.</p><p> My concern is that the Department is using global figures rather than a qualitative approach.  In other words, I do not expect it can follow every individual but there must be some sort of tracking of individual families that can show who is benefiting.  There are always unintended consequences.  Somebody could well transition back into the workplace but the cost of child care could mean he or she would be worse off than before.  It is that type of analysis that is required in the Department.  It is not a matter of policy; it is procedural.  The Department needs the types of analysis and information I describe to ensure the policies it is implementing do not have the negative effects about which we have expressed concerns.</p><p> I would like a little insight into whether the qualitative analysis and measurement to which I refer, based on the tracking of individuals, even in sample cases, are being carried out to ensure the policies do not have unintended negative consequences.  I acknowledge the global figures are available but they do not drill down into what members on this side of the room are encountering in their clinics.  We all have examples of people who have come to us who feel they have been negatively affected.  I am wondering whether qualitative analysis is feeding into the policy decisions of the Department.</p><p> I will not delay the meeting any longer.  There were several questions on several topics for Ms Simonetta Ryan.  I will now afford her an opportunity to address them, particularly those on the administrative side.  We acknowledge the policy is not Ms Ryan's responsibility.</p></speech>

I will be asking my colleagues to contribute because they have a certain amount of expertise also.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Dea asked about consultation with lone parent groups.  It is acknowledged that our main role is to implement policy but I can talk a little about the policy separately.  As part of our role of ensuring that the policy is implemented, that people get paid and that everything works as it should, there was a lot of work with the lone parent groups.  We made sure that people at least understood what was happening.  Letters were issued and people were engaged with.  Considerable work was done on the ground.  To some extent, this work continues, including in respect of talking about the kinds of letters we are issuing, etc.  When I talk about consultation, that is really what I am talking about.  The reform entailed a huge change for everybody.  It was obviously a huge change for the recipients but it was also a huge change for us to make sure the measure was implemented and that people got paid.  This has to be our first priority in operational terms.<br/><br/>A number of Senators and Deputies raised the question of consultation in a broader way and asked whether we are listening.  As acknowledged by some of the speakers, the way in which some of the reform arrangements have been amended as we went along shows we do listen and read, and we are aware of what people are saying.  Departmental officials regularly meet representatives of non-governmental organisations and other groups at various fora.  We do keep in touch.  The jobseeker's transition payment, which was a major change through the reforms, was a way of reflecting the fact that we did understand and hear that child care issues would arise for people.The objective was to allow somebody with a schoolchild between seven and 14 the flexibility to work part-time and have his or her child minded.  It is not full-time education because it is really primary school one is talking about.  Up to age seven, the arrangement allowed for more full-time care.  The change to the scheme was major and very significant in terms of how we administer the jobseeker's payment.<br/><br/>A number of speakers have raised the Millar report.  It was not actually commissioned by the Department.  In fairness to everybody, we need to be clear about that.  The Department's social inclusion division provides support for social policy research, and the Millar report was funded under that.  We are very interested in determining the areas of activation that work best for lone parents.  That was an area on which we were looking for more information.  The Millar report, while we believed it might address that in more specific detail, focused more on people's experiences and international experience.  There are some points in the Millar report with which we probably agree and some on which we have counter-views based on our own experience.  People need to be aware that we did not actually commission the report.  It is not a departmental report.<br/><br/>From a policy perspective, a thread that has been running through the whole approach to helping lone parents &mdash; this goes back for many decades and there is nothing new here &mdash; concerns the question of how one can prevent single parents, who are largely women, from becoming locked in poverty for many years, from not progressing and from not getting an education.  It is a matter of deciding on the best policy?  There is agreement on this, and it is actually reflected in the Millar report that the principle of activation is a good direction to follow.  One can talk about how one might go about that.<br/><br/>With regard to the policy direction, some unintended consequences arise when one gets into the complexities of starting to change the social welfare system, which is so complicated.  There is acceptance that groups of lone parents, although not all and by no means the majority, have lost out as a result of the reforms.  Some of the changes that have been made have been an attempt to address that.  No doubt, there will be others.  Mr. Niall Egan will talk a little about this issue and what happened to the various groups of lone parents.<br/><br/>I will ask my colleague, Ms Ward, to talk about what we are doing on the ground in terms of the activation of lone parents and our experience of working with people.  A lot of research has shown that the education of the mother is very important in determining the level of poverty experienced by children.  It is not just a matter of work <i>per se</i>because the experience of working helps to lift people's self-esteem and enhance their development.  These are all important factors.<br/><br/>I might return to the issue of maintenance later because it is complicated.  If I get into that, it might deflect people from the points they wish to raise.  The Chairman asked some questions on how we are following on from the reforms, tracking and obtaining information.  It is early days but we do have systems in place, particularly in respect of the jobseeker's transition payment.  Mr. Niall Egan will probably want to talk a little more about this.  The data on the payment are very recent because the scheme has only just begun.  We wanted to wait until the school year started and all the rest of it.  It is very early days so we do not have a large amount of information.  Once somebody is on the jobseeker's transition payment, however, we put him or her into our system to measure his or her distance from the labour force.</p></speech>

Deputy John Brady raised poverty rates in 2013.  He said the rate among lone parents was 23%.  Deputy Joan Collins raised the figures for 2014, which are from the survey of income and living conditions, which provides the most recent figures we have.  I acknowledge there has been a small drop, down to 22.1%, but both Deputies are correct that lone parents have suffered and continue to suffer in this regard.  They are much more at risk of poverty than any other cohort.  That is not a new story, however.  The poverty rates of ten years ago, in 2006, were 50% higher than those of today.  Almost 34% of lone parents were in consistent poverty ten years ago.</p><p>That was four and a half times the ratio in the general population.  Currently, it is two and a half times.  That is not acceptable, but we have had a major problem with poverty in respect of lone parents.  I wish to bring this to the committee's attention.  It is what the OECD report picked up on in 2003.  The OECD recognised that we had an issue, pointing out that - I agree with Senator Higgins on this - the State did not engage with lone parents for years.  We put them on a payment for up to 18 or 22 years in respect of a single child, or even longer if they had several children, and we did not engage with them.  As Ms Ryan stated, those payments were processed centrally in a location in Sligo and were not dealt with locally.  Due to how the Department had structured itself, lone parents were distant from what supports were available.  This is one of the reasons referenced in the OECD report.</p><p> The principle behind the reforms is to break that down and bring lone parents much closer to available supports.  Combining the public employment service with the income supports traditionally provided by the Department has allowed for a better relationship with all individuals - jobseekers, recipients of the one-parent family payment and lone parents who are receiving jobseeker's transitional payment, JST.  They know where they can go to get supports.</p><p> As my colleague stated, the forms were not introduced at the best time economically and their introduction has caused people a loss.  That there have been issues with the forms must be acknowledged.</p><p> I wish to bring a further point to the committee's attention.  Any lone parent who is in receipt of the family income supplement, FIS, is not at risk of poverty.  Such lone parents and their families are out of consistent poverty.  We can categorically state this.  Based on 2014 data, the consistent poverty threshold for a lone parent with one child is &euro;278 per week.  If that lone parent is receiving a combination of earnings from employment of 19 hours at the minimum wage, which is the smallest amount of money that someone can get from employment, and FIS, he or she is earning in excess of &euro;100 more than the threshold.  I acknowledge that he or she may be in deprivation and have issues with, for example, the cost of child care.  We all know that child care is expensive and is a major issue for many of the Department's customers.  However, FIS is a very effective tool for lifting lone parents out of poverty.</p><p> Deputy Brady asked how many children of lone parents were at risk of consistent poverty.  I do not have the definitive figure for him but, based on our most up-to-date figures, there are 134,000 children living in households that are in consistent poverty.  That is unacceptable.  The single largest cohort within that group are the children of lone parents.  Those who are most at risk of poverty and are the furthest down are those lone parents who have no income other than social welfare.  The aim of what we are trying to do is to help lone parents on an individual basis by engaging with them, in particular those who are not in employment, and finding for them whatever supports are available.  Importantly, the JST does not require them to seek work.  It allows an engagement process to take place between our case officers and an individual based on his or her circumstances.  If that lone parent is in a position and wishes to return to employment, the case officer will offer the available supports.  This may include access to FIS, the back to work family dividend or subsidised child care.  Obviously, subsidised child care is not as widespread or available as we would like, but the Government intends to examine that matter.  This is the nature of reform.</p><p> Deputy Collins raised the issue of losses and referred to SPARK's figures specifically.  Am I correct that those losses were based on someone who worked 20 hours?</p></speech>

In budget 2016, there was an increase in the FIS thresholds, child benefit and the national minimum wage.  I believe that SPARK's figures were based on the national minimum wage.  All these increases are helping to reduce the loss somewhat, although there will still be a loss.  Thankfully, the economy is recovering.  It is possible that the lone parent accessed more employment or received a pay rise.  There has been a significant loss for that cohort if lone parents were on FIS before they made the transition, but it may not be to the same extent as SPARK's figures show.</p> <p>  The 3,000 people to whom the Deputy referred are new FIS recipients, not any of those who exited last July.  That figure does not relate to anyone who has moved off FIS.  This is a direct result of the Department's engagement with lone parents since February 2015 advising them that the best option for them is FIS.  According to our feedback from local offices, many lone parents were not familiar with FIS.  At 3,000 of the 25,000 recipients, the new cohort accounts for 12% or 13%.  We want it to be more, but it is an encouraging sign.</p> <p>  There was a question on the activation of lone parents.  As my colleague mentioned, the process started this year with the JST.  We have a new activation case management system that enhances visibility of that payment's cohort from an activation perspective.  These figures have been provided to the committee.  Approximately 4,500 people have been or are being engaged with and 1,400 have definitely had an engagement with a case officer, of whom just over half have gone into education or training.  This is a positive outcome.</p> <p>  I should have stated at the start that one of the Department's problems with the lone parent population is that it is a very diverse one.  It includes people who are incredibly well educated but might be missing some experience or for whom child care is an issue.  At the other end, we have many who are distant.  They might have left school early or have numeracy and literacy difficulties.  Key for the Department is being able to provide an individualised approach to each parent based on his or her specific need.  The engagement with case officers is designed to identify the best plan for each individual.</p></speech>

The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has proposed that people should be able to receive JST and FIS subject to means testing.</p><p>That would serve as a way of ensuring that people who wanted to access some of the other measures that come with the jobseeker's transitional payment, JST, for example, would be able to benefit from that while still accessing family income supplement, FIS.  We have seen cases and anomalies arise where lone parents who are on FIS try to access back to education measures.  Is there potential for concurrent payment of JST and FIS?  I know there have been concerns in the Department about that but I would like to know the thinking on that now.  It is building on the point made by Deputy O'Dea.</p></speech>

I will give the reason for that.  The Treoir report, Watch Them Grow, indicates the labour market readiness of one parent family recipients.  That is a direct policy issue for us, and it is an operational issue.  Some 30% of those lone parents who are not working have never worked.  That is the reason the work with those who are far from the labour market is so important.  I would like Ms Ward to have a chance to talk about that.</p></speech>

It is possible in certain circumstances, usually if they have one child or a small number of children, and it involves a high level of maintenance.  Our figures show that many FIS recipients would not necessarily be incentivised to move back to JST but I have to acknowledge that is because FIS currently does not treat maintenance in the same way as our working age schemes.  That is because our working age schemes are predominantly for social welfare recipients and it is their core income.  Family income supplement is different.  It is an in-work benefit designed for people whose main income is their wages from employment.  It is something we are aware of and that we can examine in greater detail.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins asked about FIS and JST concurrent payments.  The issue here is the disincentive effect.  In terms of allowing lone parents on JST to have access to the family income supplement, ideally, we want to help them, even those on the family income supplement, to earn more money so that they transition off family income supplement.  We do not want them remaining on those schemes and having a dependency in terms of that in-work benefit.  The issue with this is that if a JST recipient received FIS, the benefit for every additional hour they would work would be less than 20%.  We then have to factor in the cost to them of taking up that additional hour.  They would very likely not be incentivised to increase their hours from work, which, from the Department's policy perspective, would be counter productive to what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

The better solution from the Department's perspective might be enhanced access to affordable child care, and to reduce the cost for the lone parent to access and take up additional employment while addressing the care issue.  The point about the family income supplement is that it has a minimum hours threshold of 19 hours, therefore, depending on the individual circumstances, it already facilitates lone parents' access to employment while still maintaining a caring role.</p> <p>  If I have time I will address the issues about maintenance.</p></speech>

With regard to incidents of abusive partners, the Department's policy is very clear on that.  We will not require a lone parent to seek maintenance where there has been an abusive relationship in the past.  We have clarified that with a few lone parent representative groups because that issue had been raised with us, and I want to be clear on it.  We acknowledge the very difficult circumstances, and we do not want to put people into dangerous situations.</p> <p>  On maintenance and the liable relative provision in particular, to be clear, the Department did not forget to include the liable relative provision in the jobseeker's transition.  The original policy intention of the liable relative provision originates in the concept of the State recouping the cost of paying the one parent family payment.  It was introduced in 1995 or 1996.  The number of lone parents in receipt of a payment for maintenance is approximately 35%, yet we know the liable relative provision relates to fewer than 8%.  We know that many lone parents, through existing arrangements, have that ability and using the family law provisions, they have an obligation to maintain a child.</p> <p>  Extending the liable relative provision to the jobseeker's transition payment is complex because not all lone parents who transitioned off the one parent family payment went on to the jobseeker's transition payment.  Jobseeker's transition, by its very nature, is done over seven years.  From our Department's perspective, in theory, we could consider extending it to all our schemes across the board.  However, that would entirely duplicate a system that exists under family law and the relevant support services.  I refer to the family mediation service and the legal aid board that already provide assistance to people seeking maintenance supports.  While we are looking at this issue, I stress that we are operating in a complicated landscape.</p></speech>

Currently, we are calling all of them in for one to one meetings with the case officers.  They will go through their individual circumstances and outline the various education and training options that are available and the employment supports that might be suitable for them to assist them in identifying the steps they need to take and to avail of opportunities to secure employment.</p> <p>  We also run information meetings for our JST customers in partnership with community training providers, the local partnerships and the local education and training boards, ETBs.  They outline to them the types of programmes they have that might be suitable for them.</p> <p>  We are conscious, as Mr. Egan and Ms Ryan mentioned, that a number of lone parents would be very distant from the workforce and that some of the pre-existing programmes would not be suitable for them.  We are working with the local ETBs to develop pre-employment type training programmes of short duration of about nine to ten weeks.  They are held in the morning only during the school term because if they have a child of, say, seven, the child is in school.  It is about focusing on personal development, skills and profiling.  We hope that at the end of those programmes our customers will have a plan for how they might progress further.  They might identify other training and education programmes also that might be suitable for them.</p> <p>  We are the very early stages in our engagement with our customers and for those customers, it is a different way of engaging with the Department in that we expect them to come in to us.  The results so far have been mixed.  I will give an example of one programme, which we developed with a local ETB adult education service.  The course started on Monday, but to get to that stage we had two group information sessions with the adult education service to which we called 65 of our JST customers, and 38 customers turned up.</p><p>Of that 38, 20 said they were interested in partaking in a pre-employment programme.  A further session was called to identify what lone parents wanted in their programme, and 16 people turned up.  Four of those had issues around literacy, and they were referred to the literary service.  The remaining 12 were interested in personal development, skills and profiling, so we put a programme in place.  That programme started on Monday, and three of the 12 people attended on that day.  That was very disappointing because of all the work we put into that but we realise this is a group of customers who are not used to engaging with us in a proactive way.  We will follow up with those who did not attend to determine what prevented them from attending on the day.  We are not giving up on them because if we can get them to participate in that type of programme, they can move on to do other things.  That is our position in the division.  As I said, it is at an early stage.</p></speech>

These transitions are very important.  The pre-development work is excellent and necessary but in terms of the training opportunities people are taking up, concern has been raised about the way ETB courses are structured and whether people are able to transition into them.

We are looking at all that in terms of developing programmes that would be suitable for them.  We are starting with the pre-employment programmes.</p></speech>

First, I was interested to hear that the Department did not commission the Millar report.  I am at a loss to know what difference that makes but the fact is that the Millar report is very critical of the system as it currently operates and states specifically that it requires revision.</p> <p>  Second, I believe it was Mr. Egan, in reply to Deputy Collins, who referred to the SPARK matrix and said that there had been some changes. I have the matrix from a week ago, taking into account the change in the minimum wage, etc., and the losses are still substantial.  There is only a marginal difference between those and the figures quoted by Deputy Collins.</p> <p>  In his reply to Deputy Higgins on the suggestion from SPARK that jobseeker's transition and FIS should be paid together, Mr. Egan stated that the marginal benefit would be only 20% of the wages.  I presume the intention from SPARK was that the jobseeker's transition would not be counted in the assessment of the FIS.  What is the point in introducing an extra payment and then counting it in the means test for the other payment they are getting?</p> <p>  I note that the vast majority of the people on FIS were on FIS and the one parent family allowance before the changes were introduced.  They are now on FIS alone, plus their employment.  Beforehand, they were employed, had the one parent family allowance and FIS.  The one parent family allowance is gone, and FIS has increased, but it has only increased by 60% of what was the one parent family payment.  It is a weak argument to make that if that does not bring them below the poverty line, it is all right.  It certainly brings them a lot closer to the poverty line than the position they were in previously.</p> <p>  The case was made consistently in the D&aacute;il by the previous Minister about the need to activate lone parents, deactivation measures, etc.  Linking lone parents, as they were, to the activation system did not require all these changes.  They did not have to be put on jobseeker's transition or whatever.  They could have been linked in anyway.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.1520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1306" speakername="Joan Collins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016100600002#M00700"><p>No.  The points I made have been addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-06a.1521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2016100600002#M00800"><p>I thank the officials for their presentations and for answering the questions but I want to make a specific point on the Millar report.  I note the comments made, but the officials effectively rubbished the report when they said it had not carried out the work it was supposed to carry out, and that they would have counter views on the many issues highlighted in the report about which serious concerns have been raised.  It would be very useful if they would put those counter views in a report which could be brought before this committee.  That would inform us of their views on the very serious points identified by Millar in the report.  Can we get a comprehensive response from the Department with regard to the Millar report?</p></speech>

The point Deputy Brady raised was an issue I raised also.  What will be the formal response from the Department or what is the approach to the Millar report?  I take the point that the Department did not commission it, but it is a substantial report on this issue to which there will surely be a departmental response.  What format will that take, and when will that happen?  I call Ms Ryan.</p></speech>

We were asked about this particular report and we made some comments on it.  I would not say we rubbished the report.  I accept there is some interesting and useful material in it about the international position, people's views and so on, but we have our own views of some of the statements in the report, some of which are contradictory.  The report does acknowledge that the overall thrust of policy around activation is sound.  I do not have the sentence in front of me but there is a reference to that effect in the report.</p> <p>  In terms of policy direction, in anything I have ever read there is general agreement, subject to all the other issues, on policy direction and the importance of supporting lone parents into work, education etc.  However, when we get into the detail, issues arise, and then there are other consequences from that.  I cannot honestly say that the Department intended to critique the report.  I am not sure if that will help anybody.</p> <p>  In terms of our views on the reforms, as I stated at the outset, we are aware of the different views of various people on those, and the inputs from them on this area.  Some of those have already led to significant changes being made to these reforms.  The next wave of that process will be on the jobseeker's transition payment to see what happens and identify the challenges.</p> <p>  I would accept from reading other reports in this space that in terms of working with lone parents who are very distant from the labour market, it is not easy to design programmes for them because they face particular challenges, some of which Ms Ward outlined.  We had hoped the report would have given us something more specific around that, but perhaps that was a big ask.  It might be something that we just have to tailor at local office level, which is what we are trying to do.  I cannot honestly say that the Department had intended to produce a critique of the report.</p></speech>

From the point of view of the committee, this is our starting position on this issue.  Our starting position with a number of issues has been to examine the Department's response.  From that point of view, the historical background given in the officials' opening statement is useful to the committee.</p></speech>
