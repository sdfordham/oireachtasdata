I raised that when the officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government appeared before the committee last week.  Have we set a date for the Valuation Office to come before the committee to speak on the issues I raised, particularly as they pertain to the increase in commercial rates due to revaluation?</p></speech>

Will any other officials appear before the committee with the officials from the Valuation Office?  It would be helpful if one or two officials from the line Ministry, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, who deal with revaluations would come before the committee with officials from the Valuation Office.</p></speech>

I have checked the Act and the Minister has power to revoke and amend the Act if necessary.  It would be helpful if officials from the Department that is the line Ministry were to come in as well.</p></speech>

People are now paying property taxes directly into the local authorities yet they see in a number of local authorities, particularly in the Dublin area, large sums of money being spent on rennovating council chambers, with more than &euro;500 being spent on chairs and so on.</p><p> There is a broader issue here in that when central Government makes a decision, the trickle-down effect of the cost at a local level does not come under the same level of scrutiny, and I wanted to put that on the record.  We have corresponded with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform previously about our frustration at not being able to examine these areas, and this is another example of it.</p></speech>

I do not want to sound like a broken record but it has a relevancy when it comes to the levying of commercial rates as well.  Whether it is the spending of the property tax or the levying of commercial rates, it is an issue that needs scrutiny.  It is unchecked in some local authorities as far as I can see.</p></speech>

I suggest that we sit for some time in private session at the commencement of our meeting on 11 July to discuss that draft.  If members have any amendments to make they should contact the clerk before next Thursday.  If they want to raise any other issue around it they should raise it with the clerk.</p><p>  Can we agree our agenda for our meeting on Thursday, 11 July 2013 at 10 a.m.?  We will meet with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The agenda for the meeting will consist of the 2011 Annual Report and Appropriation Accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General: Vote 7 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances; Vote 42 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform; Chapter 6 - Financial Commitments under Public Private Partnerships; Chapter 12 - Vote Accounting; and Chapter 13 - Procurement without a Competitive Process.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  When the representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform attend next week, Mr. Quinn, the official was responsible for procurement.  Could we ask him to attend as well because they overlap in terms of procurement and public-private partnerships.</p></speech>

The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which is generally referred to as the EGF, was established by the European Union to assist workers made redundant as a result of the impact of globalisation trends, or arising from the economic crisis.  Programmes funded by the EGF aim to facilitate the early reintegration of workers into alternative employment and to promote entrepreneurship.</p><p>  In Ireland, EGF programmes were established to assist workers affected by the Dell, Waterford Crystal, SR Technics and TalkTalk closures.  A further programme was established aimed at assisting three categories of workers in the construction industry.  The budgeted cost of the five programmes was &euro;99 million, and they were planned to meet the needs of a total of around 14,000 workers.</p><p>  The EGF funded 65% of the budgeted cost of the early programmes, reducing to 50% of the budgeted cost for TalkTalk employees.  EGF funds are provided in advance by the EU, based on the estimated programme cost.  Where the outturn cost is less than budgeted, a refund must be made to the EU.</p><p>  Supports available for those who participated in the programmes included training programmes provided by F&Aacute;S, local authorities, vocational education committees and private colleges; assistance in undertaking third level education courses; and county enterprise board assistance for small business start ups.  Income support during retraining or re-education was also be eligible for funding.</p><p>  Each of the programmes has a maximum of two years&rsquo; duration from the date of application for EGF funding.  At the time of finalising my report, the programmes for Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics workers had finished and outturn data were available.  The programmes did not attract the expected number of workers and those who participated took up less costly measures than originally envisaged.  As a result, the final cost of the three completed programmes was &euro;17 million, or 45% less than estimated, and &euro;11 million was due to be refunded to the EU.</p><p>  Early engagement with affected workers is a key factor in maximising participation in the programmes.  Overall participation in the three completed company-based programmes was 87% of eligible workers, with participation lowest for the SR Technics programme at 76%.  This may have been due to the fact that there was no central co-ordination unit for that programme.  There was also a longer period of waiting for EU approval of the proposed programme.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s application for funding for the construction programme was submitted in June 2010, which meant it could include support measures for workers in that sector until June 2012.  Final EU approval for the programme was received in November 2011.</p> <p>It was only at that stage, about six months prior to the programme's completion, that eligible construction workers were contacted and became aware of the opportunities.  The Accounting Officer will be able to inform the committee on the final programme uptake relative to target.  The expenditure outturn on the construction programme was approximately &euro;35 million, which was &euro;20 million or 37% less than estimated.  As a result, a refund of &euro;13 million was due to the EU.  The chapter found that the Department did not regularly monitor participation or expenditure and was dependent on the support providers for such information.  This prevented the Department from identifying the low uptake of support at an early stage.  That would have allowed more scope for steps to be taken to improve participation.</p><p> Determining the outcomes for the targeted workforce is critical in evaluating the effectiveness of programmes and in shaping future programmes.  In particular, it is important to establish how many workers were re-employed and to assess what the outcome might have been in the absence of the programme.  The response of participants to the Departments' surveys on outcomes was low and there was little canvassing of non-participants to establish the reason they had not availed of the opportunities available to them.  As a result, it is not clear that any of the reviews of the three complete programmes gives reliable overall indicators of the outcomes for the targeted workforce.</p><p> In the interests of better targeting of any further programmes, the report recommended the use of person-by-person data to monitor participation and help identify whether there is a need to re-direct the focus of measures, the introduction and monitoring of implementation plans for participants and more comprehensive assessment of outcomes for both participants and non-participants.</p><p> The National Training Fund was established in 2000 as a ring-fenced fund to support the training of those in employment and those who wish to take up employment.  It also is used to provide funding of research into existing and future skills requirements of the economy.  The context for the fund's establishment was a shortage at the time of skilled labour in certain key economic sectors.  The fund is resourced primarily by a levy on employers of 0.7% of reckonable earnings of certain categories of employees.  In July 2011, the levy was reduced to 0.35% for employees earning less than &euro;356 per week.  The income of the fund from the levy proceeds in 2011 was &euro;316 million, which was a marginal increase on 2010 levy income.  European Social Fund, ESF, receipts into the fund tend to be less consistent from year to year.  In 2011, some &euro;80 million was received, including &euro;24 million in refunds relating to ESF programme activity from 2000 to 2006.  No ESF funding was received in 2010.</p><p> The resources in the fund are applied under two main programme areas.  Approximately three quarters are spent on programmes of training for those seeking employment.  Most of the remaining expenditure is on training and upskilling of those currently in employment.  F&Aacute;S is funded under both headings.  It received a total of &euro;286 million from the fund in 2011.  The other main beneficiary of the fund in 2011 was Skillnets Limited, which received a total of &euro;14.5 million.  This is a company established mainly to provide financial support for training of employees of established businesses.  My office reported in 2010 on the utilisation by Skillnets of its funding and on weaknesses in the control of its spending.  I should also point out that the audit of the 2012 accounts for the National Training Fund is ongoing at present.</p><p> The audit of the 2012 financial statements of F&Aacute;S has been completed and they also are before the committee today.  The primary function of F&Aacute;S is to provide a range of training programmes and supports to both unemployed and employed people.  The agency's activities in 2012 were mainly funded from the Vote of the Department of Education and Skills and the National Training Fund.  Total expenditure by F&Aacute;S in 2012 was &euro;442 million, compared with &euro;943 million in 2011.  The transfer on 1 January 2012 of the employment services and community programmes functions from F&Aacute;S to the Department of Social Protection accounts for most of the decrease in expenditure year on year.  A clear audit opinion was issued in respect of the 2012 financial statements.  However, my audit report drew attention to an impairment charge in 2012 of &euro;4.1 million in respect of a vacated training centre, as well as asset write-offs in 2012 of &euro;1.2 million with regard to two vacated leasehold properties.  I also drew attention to an investigation of a jobs initiative scheme being carried out by F&Aacute;S.  Potential irregular expenditure with regard to this investigation is estimated at up to &euro;150,000.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013070400005#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to make this statement concerning the examination of three areas of interest to the committee.  As requested, I have forwarded some advance briefing in respect of each of these issues and I will therefore keep this opening statement quite short.  I will deal with each of the issues in turn.</p><p>  The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGF, is an EU fund that provides co-financing for approved programmes of guidance, training, education and enterprise supports for workers made redundant as a result of the adverse impacts of globalisation.  National sources must meet between 35% and 50% of total costs of EGF programmes.  To date since 2009, Ireland has had seven EGF programmes approved in support of approximately 13,100 redundant workers.  One programme is still operational, namely, that in support of almost 600 workers made redundant at the TalkTalk call centre facility in Waterford and at a number of ancillary enterprises.  Since 2009, the Irish authorities, overseen by the EGF managing authority in the Department of Education and Skills, have provided more than 21,330 individual interventions to some 9,355 beneficiaries on the six completed programmes.  To date on the TalkTalk programme, almost 1,760 interventions have been provided to 390 beneficiaries.  Approximately &euro;59 million in funding has been expended on the completed Irish EGF programmes with &euro;5.4 million available for the TalkTalk programme, which will finish in February 2014.</p><p>A review of the EGF process in Ireland was undertaken by the Department in 2012 to assess the fund's strengths and weaknesses.  This involved a public consultation process.  Irish EGF programmes have also been audited by the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors and examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Arising from these various examinations and the review of the EGF conducted on Irish programmes, greater emphasis is now being placed by the EGF managing authority on the improved monitoring and evaluation of outcomes for EGF beneficiaries.  This approach has been assisted by improved data flows from the Department of Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and by the undertaking of a series of longitudinal surveys for the managing authority both during the actual programme implementation period and up to 12 months after programme completion.  These analyses indicate increasing levels of employment and corresponding decreases in unemployment for the cohorts involved on all relevant EGF programmes.</p><p>  The Irish Presidency of the European Council achieved the agreement of a general approach on a new EGF regulation for the next 2014 to 2020 funding round at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs, EPSCO, Council in Luxembourg on 20 June 2013.  The agreement allows the next Presidency to enter into trilogue discussions with the European Parliament with a view to implementing a new and significantly broadened EGF by 1 January 2014.  All institutional stakeholders view the fund as a concrete and practical instrument of solidarity with the tens of thousands of workers being made redundant through changing world trade patterns.</p><p>  On the 2012 F&Aacute;S financial statements, as members will be aware, F&Aacute;S has undergone significant organisational change over the past few years.  On 1 May 2010, responsibility for F&Aacute;S and all its functions transferred to the Department of Education and Skills.  Responsibility for budget and policy in respect of employment services and community employment programmes transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  F&Aacute;S was therefore funded by both Departments for the financial year 2011.  F&Aacute;S employment services and community employment programmes, including approximately 700 staff, subsequently were transferred to the Department of Social Protection on 1 January 2012.</p><p>  The financial statements and annual report for 2012 were laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in June 2013 in keeping with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  In 2012, F&Aacute;S received &euro;424 million from the Department of Education and Skills and approximately &euro;700,000 from other Departments.  F&Aacute;S was also in receipt of other income of &euro;3 million from training and other activities.  The Estimate for F&Aacute;S for 2013 from this Department amounts to &euro;419 million.</p> <p>Staff costs amounted to &euro;63 million.  The F&Aacute;S staff count, as at 31 December 2012, was 1,096 full-time equivalents.</p><p> F&Aacute;S delivers an extensive range of programmes to those seeking and changing employment, redundant persons and school leavers as well as marginalised and disadvantaged groups.  Over 65,000 persons completed training programmes in 2012.  This included over 30,000 persons, both unemployed and employed, who participated in evening courses and online programmes.</p><p> The number of those entering apprenticeship during 2012 was 1,434 which was 10% higher than the 2011 level.  In 2012, the total number of apprentices across all phases of training was 8,862.</p><p> Following the enactment of the Further Education and Training Bill 2013, it is expected that F&Aacute;S will cease to exist later in the year.  It will be replaced by the new further education and training authority, SOLAS.  As part of this process, F&Aacute;S training courses will be transferred on a gradual basis to the newly-formed Education and Training Boards.</p><p> On 1 May 2010, responsibility for the National Training Fund was transferred from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the Minister for Education and Skills.  Funding from the National Training Fund is allocated by the Minister for Education and Skills with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in accordance with the provisions of the National Training Fund Act 2000.</p><p> The fund provides for expenditure on training for those seeking employment, training for persons in employment, literacy and numeracy training; early school leavers; and persons with disabilities.  It also provides funding for the identification of existing and future skills needs for the economy.  While the fund does not form part of the Vote of the Department, expenditure is allocated as part of the Estimates process.</p><p> The fund is mainly funded by a levy on employers of 0.7% of reckonable earnings in respect of employees in class A and class H employments, which represents 75% of all insured employees.  This was reduced, in 2011, to 0.35% for low-earning employees as part of the Government's jobs initiative.  It also receives funding from other sources such as the European Social Fund and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.  The total income in 2011 was &euro;400 million and expenditure amounted to &euro;326 million.  The surplus in the fund at the end of 2011 amounted to &euro;178 million and this will reduce to an estimated &euro;117 million at the end of 2013 due to an anticipated reduction in receipts.</p><p> On an annual basis, F&Aacute;S receives approximately 77% of the expenditure from the fund.  In recent years, a number of innovative projects have been funded through the National Training Fund's contribution to the Government's Pathways to Work and Action Plan for Jobs initiatives.  Funding for these in 2013 include &euro;22 million for Springboard, &euro;20 million for Momentum and &euro;5 million for ICT skills conversion course.</p><p> Expenditure from the fund is subject to public service accounting rules and is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The 2011 accounts were audited and certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p> Together with officials from the Department and our colleagues in F&Aacute;S, I will be happy to deal with any questions arising from the issues outlined.</p></speech>

The figures I will quote have all been rounded off.</p><p>  Over this period, F&Aacute;S has concentrated on meeting its core objectives.  These are to provide relevant training to our learners who are mainly unemployed persons; to provide employment support services to our clients, which responsibility ceased following the successful transfer of the F&Aacute;S employment services and community employment programmes, with their accompanying staff and other resources, to the Department of Social Protection at the end of 2011 - 772 staff members or 720 full-time equivalents were redeployed as part of this process; to continue the programme of improvements and reforms to our training products, quality control systems and governance systems; and following the decision of Government, to prepare for the winding down of F&Aacute;S, the establishment of SOLAS and the transfer of training centres, staff and other resources to the new education and training boards.  This work was carried out in the context of ensuring prudent management of budget resources and meeting the obligations of the Employment Control Framework.  Since the beginning of the moratorium, staff numbers - full-time equivalents - have been reduced from 2,271 to 1,068 today, a fall of over 1,200 or 53%.  Over the period from 2009-12, the cost of operating F&Aacute;S has reduced by some &euro;480 million in total compared to 2008 as a base year.  This takes into account the transfer of resources to the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>  Unemployment rates continue to be high with average unemployment over the period, ranging from 14.5% in January 2011, to 15% in January 2012 and to 13.7% currently.  Yesterday, according to the live register report, it stood at 13.6%.  F&Aacute;S responded by introducing a new training strategy in 2011 which seeks to optimise the use of its resources.  This entails balancing the opportunities that employers are providing and the skills-sets they require, with the needs of persons who are more distant from the labour market and, therefore, require longer periods of support and progression.  This has, for example, meant responding to the needs of the ICT industry for entry level and intermediate skills while providing digital literacy tuition for learners seeking to improve their competency.  It has also meant a reduction in the volumes of construction related training which, in turn, has been reoriented to courses supporting green technologies and retro-fitting.</p><p>  In 2011, 50% of the overall F&Aacute;S budget of &euro;943.3 million, representing 64% of the programme budget, was used to provide income support to those accessing our programmes.  Of the balance, 28% was spent on other programme costs, 15.4% was spent on pay and overheads and 6.6% on pensions.  Some 163,000 interventions were provided across the range of programmes.  I have similar figures available for 2012.</p><p>  As referred to previously, with the expected passage of the legislation to establish a new further education and training authority, SOLAS will be established and F&Aacute;S will be wound down.  This will bring to an end an organisation which has served Ireland for some 25 years.  Despite the many challenges and serious issues which the organisation has faced, particularly in recent years, it has demonstrated a considerable commitment to supporting its learners and other clients.  In so doing, the staff of F&Aacute;S have demonstrated considerable resolve, resilience and expertise in their work.  No doubt this team of people, who will soon leave F&Aacute;S, will bring their commitment and expertise to bear in the new education and training boards and in SOLAS as they transfer in the near future.</p></speech>

If I can make one comment, I acknowledge what Mr. O'Toole acknowledges in his statement.  We have had many a stormy meeting with F&Aacute;S at this committee, in my time and previously, but as F&Aacute;S is about to be wound down and new structures put in place, it is important to acknowledge the excellent work carried out by the overwhelming majority of Mr. O'Toole's staff throughout the country who I and my colleagues on this committee would deal with on a regular basis in all of our communities.  Change in any workplace is difficult but when one looks at the figures that Mr. O'Toole presented, in terms of both the structural change and the vast drop in the number of staff at a time when we are facing an unemployment crisis compared to the large numbers of staff at a time when there was full employment in this country, it is a testament to their dedication.  I wish to put that on the record of this committee.</p><p>  I will direct my questions to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; on the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.  We all will be aware of the unemployment crisis that we are going through and clearly we want to see every possible cent of funding tapped and utilised effectively.  In looking through the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, no doubt there is good work being done on in the utilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for Ireland but there are a number of areas where, as Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; acknowledge, there is room for improvement.  He also acknowledged in his opening statement that there are new regulations on the future operation of the fund, and I might get his opinion on that later.</p><p>  The first point that struck me was what constitutes an intervention as opposed to an effective intervention.  I note in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, at 17.27, states:<blockquote>The Department collates data on the number of occupational guidance interviews provided.  However, it does not record the extent to which individuals availed of more than one guidance interview.</blockquote>If, for example, I was a worker in Waterford Crystal or TalkTalk and I turn up for an initial guidance meeting about my future options, that constitutes an intervention but I may go away and never obtain further educational training, go on another course, re-skill or up-skill.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; might comment on how the system captures effective interventions as opposed to actual interventions.</p></speech>

There have been a number of different reviews of the EGAF and we have certainly learnt a lot from them.</p> <p>We should place the Deputy's comment in the context of considering a group of redundant workers.  We all recognise the trauma that a group of workers goes through in the time leading up to redundancy.  Typically but not absolutely in terms of the EGF, the workers would be working in a company, although I know there are companies that are linked.  Sometimes, the company might help in getting staff ready for a redundancy and sometimes it might not.  We are all aware, from our interaction with our friends in society, never mind the EGF, of the trauma that unemployment brings to any individual.  In the early days of redundancy, it is quite difficult to find ways to engage.  What we are seeking to do and what we have learned in the EGF unit is that we must seek to engage in as many different ways as possible.</p><p> The standard former mechanisms that were in place within F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Protection have been integrated in Intreo.  That has to be a very formal part of the intervention such that people who have been made redundant will have interaction with the State services.  That is an appropriate interaction.  The interaction can lead to some people moving on to further training immediately, or it can lead to a period of reflection for those who may want to enter training at a later date.  Others may already be moving to employment and may not even need the type of interaction in question.  The difficulty and challenge with knowing what is effective and not effective is that, because of the different backgrounds of people who are made redundant, they can take different options.  The key for us, as has been advised in the audits of the European Court of Auditors and Comptroller and Auditor General, is to try to capture a way of measuring the effectiveness of the overall outputs - that is to learn for the future - while at the same time having a real manner of engagement with the groups of people who are made redundant so we can try to develop the programme locally to meet their needs to the greatest extent possible.  In some cases, it is possible to develop particular unique programmes to assist where there are a number of redundant workers in a similar position.  This can mean the work is done by a private contractor, or it can mean that F&Aacute;S steps in.  It is all in the manner of the engagement.</p><p> In terms of the review of the effectiveness, on an ongoing basis and afterwards, the comparison has to be between those for whom there has been some intervention and those for whom there has been none, while not forgetting that there may be reasons there has not been an intervention.  The reason may be because somebody has moved on to employment relatively quickly and, therefore, did not need an intervention.  It may be that it is more mobile workers who do not require intervention.  That may not always be the case.  We have developed - we have given quite a lot of details in the brief - a quite sophisticated way of trying to measure the outcomes.  We did this for the construction workers and for TalkTalk.  It is a matter of trying to contrast the impact on those who had no intervention with the impact on those who did.  We have a lot to learn from that on a continuing basis.</p><p> We are not just learning for the EGF.  It is right and proper that we have be a big focus on the EGF.  Obviously, today, there is a chapter on the EGF, but for us it is really a matter of how we deal with people being made redundant.  Not all workers who are made redundant are made redundant in the context of a redundancy that arises from globalisation or under the crisis derogation that we had.  They may not be of that scale.  Therefore, we must learn continuously how to work with people who have been made redundant and the unemployed.  In that regard, we work very much in partnership with the Department of Social Protection.  We are working very closely with F&Aacute;S in that regard. </p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; mentioned the issue of linkages.  There has been some success in finding linkages from other companies, spin-offs or spun-off areas that are adversely affected by the closure of a firm.  On a cursory glance, one would be concerned to see that there were no linkages established with construction programmes.  When one goes beyond a cursory look, one sees the real difficulty.  The construction applications related to 3,272 different companies in the sector.  I very much understand the difficulty in applying the concept of linkages.  Given the particular crisis in terms of unemployment within the construction sector, has Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; any thoughts on how linkages could possibly be formed?  Do we really need to face the harsh, unpalatable reality that it is nearly impossible to apply the fund to linkages when so many smaller-scale companies are involved?</p></speech>

Where there has been a redundancy in a company, it is easier to identify the linked companies.  We have had some success in identifying the linked companies.  With the sectoral one, it was much more difficult.  That was not realty an option to the same extent because there was not the same regional aspect to a group of workers that could be worked with.  There were not the same types of companies linked informally.</p><p>  With regard to TalkTalk, the role of the F&Aacute;S co-ordination unit is very helpful because it can be the one to identify the various individuals, whether they were employed by TalkTalk or in the linked companies.  It can talk through the options and supports and then consider various individualised possibilities, such as personalised services.  We would have introduced a new element after the various reviews and audits.  We introduced an expenses contribution scheme.  We were getting feedback to suggest that while the fees we were willing to pay for further and higher education were helpful, there were additional expenses arising from attendance and participation in learning.  We introduced a particular scheme on that basis that has been in operation for the TalkTalk staff.  We understand from the feedback that it is very well received and is enhancing participation and learning.  </p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General's report states the records for the SR Technics programme were collated by a private company.  The next point outlines how there can be difficulties in that there may be long periods before valid records are received, etc.  What is the logic behind using a private company?  Do we lack the capacity to do this work internally?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013070400007#F00700"><p>I suppose we are seeking as a government to have a certain level of outsourcing of work, where appropriate.  We have had difficulties and challenges in making staffing resources available.  We are all in a declining ECF environment.  In this regard, I include ourselves and F&Aacute;S.  That was one of the reasons, in particular, for the delay in putting the necessary co-ordination arrangements in place for SR Technics.  We ended up putting a contact point in place for both F&Aacute;S and the Department of Social Protection in relation to SR Technics.  We have learned from that and we will be having a F&Aacute;S co-ordination unit for any further case.</p><p>  We found the involvement of a private company very helpful.  We tendered for the assistance of a private company.  We had to go through two tenders in respect of SR Technics to come up with somebody.  The advantage of having a private company is that the EGF can be sporadic.  We had the cases of three companies and the construction sector very much in quick succession, then a bit of a break and then TalkTalk.  It is more difficult and challenging to assign F&Aacute;S and departmental staff at short notice when an urgent matter arises.  If there is a contract, it is easier not to have to pay unless there is a need.  When a need arises, we can draw down the assistance.  We have found that very helpful.</p></speech>

Can Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; expand on what such courses are?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.78" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013070400008#G00200"><p>Ireland has a strong private training system and of the 80% of F&Aacute;S funding which is outsourced to public and private providers, a high proportion goes to the latter.  There are many private colleges in the higher education sector.  We are very supportive of their active engagement in the various programmes.  An example is the momentum initiative, which is deliberately designed to have programmes which lead to people accessing employment again.  We had open tenders, which F&Aacute;S organised, for public and private providers.  This is outside the EGF.  We are very supportive of the private sector getting involved.  We are trying to put in place an appropriate mix of public sector further and higher education and training which must meet a wide range of needs.  Public sector provision must meet the needs of school leavers, adult learners and the long-term unemployed, including the needs of the long-term unemployed aged under 25 years.  We have been developing aspects of specialism within that over the last three or four years and there are limits and cost pressures to address.  We have had to increase the pupil-teacher ratio for post-leaving certificate courses and reduce the funding for higher education institutions.  We have had to reduce the funding and number of staff available to F&Aacute;S.</p><p>  There are challenges to operating within the private sector and we are very open to the concept in the EGF of grants which a redundant worker can use for a training or higher education programme.  The person will know what programme will meet his or her needs and fund the fees with the grant.  We are as positive as possible about the balance between the public and private sectors.  The EGF is framed in that context.</p></speech>

The Department has also acknowledged it to an extent today.  People who have availed of an intervention are asked to complete a survey.  In the case of SR Technics, the rate of non-response to the survey of outcomes was 67%.  Even in the case of Dell, it was 42%.  While people have suffered what Mr. &Oacute; Foghr&uacute; correctly calls "the trauma of redundancy", they have also availed of public money and received a benefit from it in terms of returning to employment or starting a business.  However, there is an unwillingness to respond to the survey.  Perhaps it is a matter of human nature that people get surveys and do not fill them out.  Can we strengthen the structures in place to ensure that we get the information back?  It is not a question of filling out the survey for the sake of it.  It is about the fact that we do not know how 67% of people in SR Technics who received an intervention felt how it went.  It makes it difficult to form an opinion on the success of the outcome.</p></speech>

The change we have implemented on foot of our own review and the various audits to which I have referred is to integrate information from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection to provide that the assessment of outcomes is not primarily survey based.  We can get the full information by looking at pps numbers to see if people are in employment or receiving something from the Department of Social Protection.  If there is no record, it may be that the person has departed from the labour force completely, is not in receipt of a welfare payment and is not making a Revenue return.  He or she may have emigrated.  The information we have provided to the committee sets out the various data sources we use in that context.</p><p>  We made a call arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report about the extent to which we would go back to get information.  We carried out a detailed examination and decided to include construction workers.  We were not sure we could do so, but made a big push to ensure we included them in the Department of Social Protection and Revenue information to the greatest extent possible.  We have done it with the construction workers and are doing it with TalkTalk.  We will operate on that basis going forward.</p></speech>

I have read the Department's views on the issue of the return of &euro;11 million, which was not spent.  I understand that the issue is more complex than it appears at first glance.  Some people would take the view that the Department received &euro;11 million which it did not spend, whereas the Department might say that there was an overestimation.  The idea is that it is almost better to ask for more than one needs, which can be given back, rather than to have too little.  I do not know if that is a fair way to portray it.  I am not sure that view is fully borne out in respect of the lack of awareness of the availability of interventions.  For example, only one third of the publicity budget which was made available to promote interventions was spent.  On the three finalised programmes, as little as 10% of the available publicity budget was spent.  Is the Department satisfied that the money that is being given to Ireland for these interventions is being spent in devastated towns where there have been major job losses?  Are we doing everything we possibly can to ensure we do not have to give the money back and that everybody who is eligible for an intervention can access it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013070400008#G00600"><p>Clearly, we seek to maximise the expenditure from the estimation we have given and the available funding.  We are not happy to have to return amounts of any significance.  However, it is very challenging to maximise expenditure in the context of the nature of EGF arrangements as confirmation comes fairly late in the process.  We have sought and discussed upfront ways to increase expenditure by reference to the national training fund and the Exchequer contribution.  We know that we will never achieve 100% spending because a maximum amount will never be realised.  The TalkTalk experience shows that even where we are implementing a programme having learned all the lessons and are getting relatively positive feedback from the workers, there are still workers who do not engage or who have engaged to an extent, but have entered employment and do not want further measures.  We know that the spending maximum is not 100%, it is somewhat below that.  All other countries are struggling in this regard.  While I am not sure if a spending average has been calculated since 2011, we are above the average overall and have only had one programme which was below the European average.</p><p>  The question of awareness is a key one.  One of the difficulties we have experienced has related to the initial national blast from the media to say that money is available.  There has been some criticism about this.  When we started off initially, we did not have the communications systems in place to ensure that people attending F&Aacute;S would be made aware of the programme.  We accept that.  It often happens in our business that there is a media announcement but not everybody on the ground knows about it.  It was exacerbated in that case as the initial media announcement took place before we had worked out exactly what we were going to do.  We were developing the concepts and ideas as the announcement was happening.</p><p>  Engaging with workers is harder in sectoral rather than non-sectoral programmes.</p> <p>The engagement in a company-based one is to get in on the ground with the company with the F&Aacute;S co-ordination unit and a consultative group that is recognised by the workers as being representative of them and meeting their needs.  Where we do that, we will seek to maximise.</p><p> It is worth saying that we deliberately overestimate when we make the initial submission because we want to leave scope for any possibility for any worker whereas when it comes to the actual expenditure, the expenditure has typically been somewhat less even on a per worker basis in respect of those who have assessed.  In summary, we are not happy to be returning money.  It is not a position we want to be in and we are seeking to maximise the return from TalkTalk and any future ones.</p></speech>

As far as I know, the average is a 2011 average and I am giving the Deputy our total, counting TalkTalk.  I expect that like everything else, other countries have improved as well.

Obviously, it is an extremely important sector where huge numbers of people are unemployed.  I know Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; sent some of this in the material but could we pad it out a little for the record of the meeting?  The Comptroller and Auditor General report noted that the Department did not have standardised procedures in place for the compilation of regular meaningful data on the number of individuals participating, interventions provided and the related costs in respect of the three construction programmes.  I know this was because these outturns do not become available until the programme is completed.  I understand that this is the Department operating completely in line with the scheme but while it might operating by the rule book, are there not missed opportunities in terms of not having this data at an earlier stage to make sure the interventions are as tailored and targeted as possible?</p></speech>

It cannot ever be an absolute tracking because there may be additional EGF-only expenditure associated with it but there is also expenditure running in various programmes which is part of the typical expenditure of F&Aacute;S or an institute of technology that is very difficult to track and take out.  It can be monitored but it cannot be done so absolutely.  Yes, we have learned the lesson and are seeking to do it in a more co-ordinated and enhanced way.  We will have a real challenge if and when we have another sectoral.  We are obviously not pleased that there was another occasion in TalkTalk but the fact that we had another opportunity to test the concepts for improvement that have been identified in the various reviews was very fortuitous for us in the context of being able to design a set of arrangements.</p><p>  We also have a lot of challenges if there is another sectoral application.  I do not know if there will be another sectoral application but we talked about the possibility.  It is looking very likely that we will have an EGF.  Unfortunately, in the past couple of days, we have also had job loss announcements.  Whether those announcements give rise to the possibility of EGF applications remains to be seen because they must be made in periods of time and of certain volumes within periods of time.  They are within globalisation but, hopefully, it will be expanded back into the crisis after the start of 2014.  We must take the lessons we learned from construction and seek to apply them to the overall if there is another sectoral.  The figure of 63% in construction is in the context of the difficulties and challenges we had with construction.  It is notable that we got that level of completion.  I would like it to have been higher but it is notable that we got to 63%.  Even looking at the effectiveness of it and the numbers of people involved who are in employment, in the context of the national dialogue about construction workers, the fact that a certain proportion of those construction workers are back in employment, regardless of whether or not they received support under the EGF, is heartening.  It is heartening that it is possible for construction workers to re-enter the labour market at the moment.</p></speech>

Somebody might have had funding for part but not all of a course.  Obviously, this leaves people in a situation where they are effectively left out of funding.  Why were workers approved for funding for courses that spanned longer timeframes than the amount of funding they were provided with?</p></speech>

Obviously, there are some relevant higher education courses that are longer than two years and if workers were willing to commence on an understanding that they would seek to complete them, I do not think we should not allow workers to commence them under the EGF.  We would seek to help them in any way we can, provided it is in a manner consistent with the EGF and our overall funding arrangements.</p></speech>

The Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland - Winter 2012 Review, which was published in April 2013, contained a number of comments about the high level of unemployment and the fact that this continues to be a very pressing issue and talked about the structural reform agenda.  It acknowledged that reforms relating to further education and training are progressing but it basically said that fast progress is needed and we need training programmes that are closely linked to the labour market.  Could representatives from the Department and F&Aacute;S give a response about where they feel we are in respect of the troika review?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.93" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013070400009#H01100"><p>We have detailed engagement with the troika when it is here and certainly are seeking to address many of the issues it is raising.  We have quite a few initiatives under way to seek to enhance employment relevance.  I will let Mr. O'Toole deal with the detail of what is happening within F&Aacute;S.  A NESC review of the employment relevance of further education and training generally is under way and will be completed in the autumn.  We have commenced a very important review of apprenticeships.  There is a considerable amount of discussion on the European stage about the relevance of apprenticeships so we have commenced work on that and are looking options for developing the apprenticeship model.  We have also issued guidelines to the VECs in respect of aligning their provision with the skills needs of enterprise on the basis of some Forf&aacute;s work on the alignment of further education needs with the labour market.  We have a number of specific initiatives where we are targeting unemployed people and are working with higher education on part-time and Springboard courses.  We are also working on the Momentum programme, which F&Aacute;S is organising on our behalf.  We can provide the committee with more details of those.</p> <p>The IECT programme is an important skills initiative not primarily aimed at the unemployed.  We provide a number of conversion programmes in ICT for graduates to encourage students to take up ICT and science and technology programmes generally.  This goes back to secondary level education through, for example, the literacy and numeracy emphasis, project maths, bonus points for maths in the leaving certificate and the work being done to reform the junior cycle.  In regard to bonus points for maths, the proportion of leaving certificate students taking honours maths at leaving certificate level increased from 16% to 20% last year and the indication is that the proportion will increase by a further 4% this year, although that will not be confirmed until the examination results are issued.  When people study maths, it opens them to considering other career options.  We provide a wide range of measures across the higher education and training system to enhance the employment links of education and training.  This is not to say that education is solely for employment.  I do not need to get into this debate, other than to note that education is underpinned by a range of other values.  The work of the expert group on future skills needs is important in this regard, by ensuring education and training are relevant to employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Toole" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013070400010#J00200"><p>In the F&Aacute;S part of the equation, the reform involves structural and strategic aspects.  We have been working with the Department and others to implement reforms on both fronts.  In terms of structural reform, the organisation has downsized and transferred two significant divisions to the Department of Social Protection.  In line with the enactment of the legislation, we will wind down F&Aacute;S, work with the Department of Education and Skills to establish SOLAS and transfer approximately 80% of the remaining staff along with the training centres to the 16 new education and training boards.  As members can imagine, these structural reforms involve a lot of work in themselves.</p><p>  Strategic reform relates to the fitness for purpose of investments in training.  We are as aware as everybody else of the need to continually reflect on the impact of our work.  In 2011 we introduced a new training strategy through which we sought to balance the resources available to us against our purpose.  We identified various drivers of our training, including those with a primarily economic focus, that is, were designed to meet the needs of employers in terms of the skills provided, and the programmes that are primarily driven by social inclusion and equity.  We are seeking to balance those drivers, measure their impacts and improve them.  We have introduced 100 new or redeveloped programmes, many of which are tailored to specific skill niches.  Others being improved through the common award system that was formerly under FETAC to ensure fitness for purpose.  We are also improving how we survey and measure outcomes in this regard.</p><p>  The SOLAS legislation anticipates that SOLAS will propose a strategy to the Department of Education and Skills on how its investment in further education and training can be optimised for the future.  The intention is to prepare that strategy in the first six months of the life of SOLAS so that it can be brought to the Department for broader consideration.  That strategic development process will be informed by a wide ranging consultation with the actors in the area and the review outputs of the NESC report on the impact of further education and training, both of which will give us a better understanding of further education and training.</p><p>  Perhaps it is useful to explain the role F&Aacute;S will play in this process.  Like many countries, Ireland operates a national framework for qualifications from level one to level ten.  The F&Aacute;S training space is between levels three and six.  We are primarily focused on entry and intermediate skills, whether in crafts or basic entry level for people who need to go further.  We are constantly striving to optimise the impact of that.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Harris regarding the good work that we regularly encounter F&Aacute;S doing in our communities.  This work never gets headlines in the press but it valuable none the less and some excellent people have dedicated their entire careers to working with F&Aacute;S.  That needs to be acknowledged.  The dissolution of F&Aacute;S and the transfer of its functions should not be seen as a reflection on these individuals' work.</p><p>  Mr. O'Toole outlined the process of transformation in F&Aacute;S.  When is it expected that the sign will be taken down from the organisation's door?  I am not sure what will happen to Mr. O'Toole or his board.  I assume the board has to dissolve and his position become redundant.  When does he expect the door to be locked?</p></speech>

The legislation is well advanced and once it has been enacted it will be for the Minister for Education and Skills to determine a date for its commencement and for the establishment of SOLAS.  I know from the Department and the Secretary General that the intention is to do so at the earliest opportunity this year.</p></speech>

I understand it finished Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad yesterday.  The Minister is keen to establish SOLAS at the earliest opportunity and he has met the board of F&Aacute;S and thanked it for its work, while recognising that it must continue to do that work until it is completed.  He gave his thanks, and that of the Department, for the work it has done over the previous three years.</p><p>  We hope to establish SOLAS as a body as early as possible in the autumn.  SOLAS will not be able to undertake all of its tasks at that stage, however.  It will begin to undertake its tasks but it will still need to organise the delivery of training until the training centres are transferred to the education and training boards.  Our target is to transfer at least six centres before the end of the year and the remaining centres by the end of the following year.  There will be a rolling transfer of training centres to the education and training boards from the point when SOLAS is established and for approximately one year afterwards.</p></speech>

Instead of transferring the training centres first it is being given a function for which it is not designed so that it can dispose of that function over the course of a year.  That appears the wrong way to proceed.</p></speech>

By establishing SOLAS, it can continue to manage the responsibilities of F&Aacute;S while taking over overall policy advisory responsibilities in regard to the further education and training sector and work on the proposals to which Mr. O'Toole referred.   It is a matter of ensuring the new arrangements are in place and planning to transfer the others.  We found that a big bang transfer date would not work and it is more helpful to plan for a number of stages.  We entered into a consultative process and have published an implementation plan.  This is a huge programme of public sector reform when combined with the education and training boards established on Monday.</p> <p>We have established an education and training reform office in the Department.  We are bringing in experts to be part of that to help plan and work with F&Aacute;S and the ETBs in rolling out its implementation.  It is a three- to four-year programme of change, which will involve the introduction of shared services, new ways of doing business and new financial systems in the ETBs in a consistent manner across all of them, and it will take a lot of work.  We are conscious, for example, that we planned for the establishment for SUSI.  Notwithstanding that, what is clear from the review we undertook is we did not plan sufficiently.  We needed to invest as many resources in the initial planning for this, so that is why we are not jumping into the transfers.  We are seeking to plan them appropriately and well.  It is vital that there is continuity of provision because we are in an economic downturn and, technically, in recession again, and we need to ensure the provision of further education and training is not threatened by this and that no balls are dropped.  That is the important thing that makes a difference for the learner on the ground.  We are working closely with F&Aacute;S and the ETBs to ensure the transfer takes place as seamlessly and in as planned a way as possible.</p></speech>

They are basically entities established with the future capacity to deal with these skills and training centres.  Are they currently continuing their main operations under separate VECs?

We had a series of amalgamation of bodies.  It was just as I described and it was business as usual.  There was no difference in the provision of services.  The teachers are being paid by ETBs this week when they were paid last week by VECs and so on.  There is a continuation in the provision of services.</p><p>  The ETBs will have developing functions over time.  Training is one example of that.  The fact that they are there will enable them to support schools in different ways over time.  There are some changes but, again, it is not a big bang.  It will be a gradual change and one of the important things we had worked through over a long period was identifying who the chief executive officers of the ETBs would be.  They all commenced office on Monday.  Each ETB has agreed a date with the Department on when they will have their first meeting.  Technically the Minister has to decide the date but he decided that on advice from the ETBs.  They are all having their first meeting in the next few weeks.  Some may have had that meeting.  They are working on with their regular business.  The ETBs include all the members of the former VECs, but after the next local government elections their membership will be reduced.</p></speech>

All the VECs had separate branding, including logos, letterheads and so on.  This needs to be controlled in order that millions of euro is not spent on new signs, logo design and rebranding of offices and so on.  If there is a backlash, that is where it will come from if we spend a fortune rebranding and making things look nice with the new headings.</p></speech>

We heard concerns such as that during the process and to be fair to the ETBs and Education and Training Board Ireland, which is the IVEA's successor body, they have taken an initiative in partnership with a private partner to design a consistent logo for all the ETBs in order that there will not be separate logo design going on.  There will be a single consistent logo for all the ETBs.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned a number of issues relating to fixed assets in his opening statement.  The note referred to intangible assets, the first of which was in respect of the Cabra training centre, for which there was an impairment charge of &euro;4 million in 2012.  According to the notes, &euro;7.4 million was spent on the centre and there was an impairment charge of &euro;4 million but at the end of December 2012, the &euro;7.4 million expenditure was worth &euro;1 million.  Can Mr. O'Toole explain this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Toole" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013070400011#K00700"><p>I will do my best.  The Cabra training centre was brought into being in 1975 when AnCO purchased a factory that made bowling equipment for approximately &euro;400,000.  Over the intervening 35 years, F&Aacute;S and AnCO spent approximately &euro;7 million on capital works improving and equipping the centre and making it fit for purpose.  The total expenditure over 35 years was about &euro;7.4 million.  The building was built in the 1950s and over that period of time literally tens of thousands of learners either attended Cabra or had training managed from there.</p><p>  The impairment arises because at the time of disposal following 2010, the carrying value of asset - in other words, how it was reflected in the books of F&Aacute;S - was greater than the net recoverable amount.  It was carried in the books on an historical cost basis.  The &euro;7.4 million charge is accumulated, the depreciation is charged against that annually and the result is termed the net book value.  That is the accounting convention used by F&Aacute;S and by many organisations.  Buildings are written off over a period of 50 years.  There is not an active market in F&Aacute;S training centres so on the rare occasion they come to the market, it is basically what the value is for their alternative use.  It was on the basis that people might use the asset.  What has happened is that the site and the buildings are going to different State organisations.  An Post is developing a sorting office on the site and we have handed the remainder of the site to the Department of Education and Skills for a national school.  At the time of disposal, we looked at what market opportunities were there and we had the site and buildings valued at &euro;1.5 million.  A repair was required to the roof and that is where the net realisable value of &euro;1.2 million came into being.  It reflects the commercial value of its alternative use at the time of disposal.</p><p>  The observations of the Comptroller and Auditor General mean we need to look at our depreciation policy to see if it is appropriate to write off buildings and fittings over that period of time.  It reflects the fact that the assets are purchased and developed not as commercial assets but as State institutions and if they go on the market where one is looking for alternative uses, it will depend on market conditions at the time.</p></speech>

The accounting policy of historic cost and accumulating depreciation is the correct one.  We do not have a revaluation policy on an ongoing basis because there is no simple basis for that and there are accounting criteria in this regard.  What it prompts is a need to look at whether the universal, one-size-fits-all depreciation charge of buildings over 50 years is appropriate in all cases going forward.  That is the issue, as distinct from an inappropriate accounting policy.</p></speech>

F&Aacute;S acquired a temporary premises in, I think, 2007 and began the process of putting some people into it.  It took a ten-year lease on a building in Birr and it equipped and fitted out that building to operate as a temporary premises for the ten-year period.  In 2010, the then Government indicated that some of the functions would be split off and in July 2011, the current Government decided on the winding down of F&Aacute;S and the establishment of SOLAS.  In February 2012, the Government decided that the decentralisation in respect of F&Aacute;S was to be discontinued.  We had a five-year break clause on the lease in 2012.</p> <p>We took the option to close the operation because we believed it to be the most commercially sensible thing to do at the time as we did not require the out office.  This entailed writing off the accumulated fitting costs carried in our books. It was a sunk cost at the time.  We have saved the rent and operation costs for five years and we believe on balance it was the correct decision to take and hence the charge arose.</p></speech>

To implement the decentralisation policy, 17 people were put in an office in Birr at a rent of  &euro;100,000 a year and a site for &euro;1.5 million was bought which is now worth &euro;150,000.  Five years into the lease it was broken, leading to a capital write-off of approximately &euro;1 million in 2012 and the policy was ended.  This seems to be an extraordinary waste of money for no benefit and a policy which was questionable from the outset.  I understand F&Aacute;S was under instruction at the time to implement the policy but it seems an extraordinary waste of resources.</p></speech>

The depreciation charge is 2%, which assumes a 50 year life of the improvements.  This is the point we have raised with F&Aacute;S.  We must examine this because in reality it should be depreciated over the life of the lease and in this case it was a ten year lease because it was anticipated that at the end of ten years a new building would be on the site.  More generally we will examine with F&Aacute;S its accounting policy and see the implications.  F&Aacute;S is effectively in its last year of operation and it will wash out anyway in the final reckoning, but it is an important principle that improvements made to a leasehold building should be depreciated over the life of the lease or otherwise as appropriate to the nature of the improvements made.</p></speech>

F&Aacute;S has had a long lease on two premises on Baggot Street, a main office and an adjoining office.  The tenure in one is due to complete this year and we are actively seeking alternative premises suitable for SOLAS which will have a much smaller staff compliment than the F&Aacute;S head office.  We are taking advice on this and looking for an appropriate premises.  We aim to exit the building this year if it is possible and move to an appropriate premises for SOLAS which will be much smaller and should be more economical to run and operate.</p></speech>

One is up this year and we intend to hand back the building.  The other is not up until 2017.  It is a much smaller building and we will have a use for it.  With regard to the overall accelerated depreciation we went through an exercise where we reviewed much of the expenditure on leases, particularly before the transfer to the Department of Social Protection, and where they had been written down over 50 years and we brought them back to the period of the lease.  Unfortunately some of them slipped through, Birr being one.  With regard to the accelerated depreciation in 2012, we looked at the depreciation policy on this and put in an additional charge for 2012 given that we would be exiting in 2013.</p></speech>

The figure of &euro;150,000 was mentioned.  This is a matter that has been raised in the House and at this committee a number of times by Deputy McGrath.  The report states that the estimated cost of work on the site to date is approximately &euro;4 million, that some or most of that &euro;4 million was taxpayers' money and that the project is not yet complete.  Whose responsibility is it, in terms of ownership of the project, that almost &euro;4 million in taxpayers' money has been spent on this project to date?  It is now not only a question of an investigation into the spending of &euro;150,000 but an investigation into how this asset will be realised for the State, which has already spent &euro;4 million on it.</p></speech>

The project involved refurbishment of a famine hostel outside Tipperary town.  There are a number of items included in the &euro;150,000.  Pobal is conducting an investigation, which I understand is also with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Wearing the State's hat, we provided funding for the scheme which, in our view, was not spent correctly.</p></speech>

The reported figure is &euro;4 million of taxpayers' money and some public donations.  The project has now cost the State in the region of &euro;4 million.  I understand a considerable amount of work remains to be done.  Will the State now have to write off further moneys in terms of security for the building, etc.?  I am interested in knowing what is happening in the regard to the &euro;4 million.  It is one thing if an investigation into how the &euro;150,000 and &euro;4 million was spent is under way, but who is investigating the state of the property and what can be done with it to save the money already invested in it so that there is not a further loss to the State?  Obviously, it would be of benefit to the local community if this project were to be completed.  I agree on the need to investigate what happened in regard to the &euro;150,000 and the &euro;4 million but I would like to know if our &euro;4 million is being protected in terms of the construction and works already completed.  It is not good enough to just say there is an investigation going on.</p></speech>

The problem came to my attention in 2009 and 2010 and we carried out a review of the lease.  We have concluded that the lease of the premises was not capable of fulfilling its remit, which was to provide a workshop.  I understand that at the time - a period in the last decade - F&Aacute;S was rapidly scaling up to meet the demands of the construction sector and was acquiring temporary premises around the country to put in additional workshops for apprentice and craft training.  This was one such location.  The issue is that this was such a building, but the health and safety requirements on our side for putting in an apprenticeship workshop meant the premises were not suitable.  That is when the problem arose.  The individual concerned left in 2008 and we have been trying to get to the bottom of that over the past couple of years.</p></speech>

We are delving into the history and records as we find them.  As part of the review there was a written response from the individual concerned, which outlined the background to the lease.  He considered the need to provide a workshop and there were probably issues within the team as to whether the premises were suitable and whether the building would comply with regulations.  There was a question that was not sorted out prior to entering the lease and that is the core of the issue.</p><p>  As my colleague indicated, we have carried out two actions since.

The lease was signed and the person concerned was in employment for a period afterwards.  Can the witness tell me what, if any, action or discussion was had with that person?  It is not a good day out for any agency to be signing leases with health and safety issues and it is a really bad day out for any agency to sign a lease knowing there is a health and safety compliance issue.

Mr. O'Toole has appeared before the committee previously and we have pored over the entrails of F&Aacute;S and the controversies therein.  I am not questioning his position in that respect.  However, I do not believe one can create this new culture if there is what amounts institutional amnesia.  We all understand that people come and go and people retire, and when one is newly arrived in a position one cannot have immediate access to the fine detail.  However, on any matter, and I am choosing this specific example, there must be a paper trail, records and some recollection of what happened.  It is astonishing that somebody who is charged with signing a lease on behalf of a State agency, knowing that there was a health and safety issue, got no rap on the knuckles, reprimand or questioning, in so far as we can ascertain because there would be a record of that too.  In different circumstances, and there is an investigation of other, albeit different, circumstances involving similar expense, it is a matter for Garda consideration, and that is as it should be.  I accept the witness's answer on that.  However, one cannot have corporate negligence and sloppiness, and then the answer is that person in question retires and the organisation does not remember.</p></speech>

It was formerly a factory which made bowling alley equipment, as we understand it.  It was purchased for approximately &euro;400,000 and over time AnCO and then F&Aacute;S spent &euro;7 million on improvements to it, equipping it, modernising it and all the things that needed to be done over that period of time.  The State's investment over 35 years was &euro;7.4 million in capital and tens of thousands of people were either trained in the centre or their training was managed from that centre.  It closed in 2010 and at the time we took a view on the property.  What has happened is two State organisations are going to utilise it.  An Post is developing a sorting office there and the remainder of the site and building is going to the Department of Education and Skills for a new national school.  That is what happened the investment over the period of time.</p><p>  The impairment charge arises because the carrying value in our books, which is the historical cost of the centre less accumulated depreciation, was greater than the commercial value as an alternative use.  There is no market in F&Aacute;S training centres so when the issue crystalises if one closes a centre and one looks at it commercially, it is what alternative use could be made of it.  At that time in 2010 the valuation was &euro;1.5 million, but there was a charge relating to the roof and therefore it became a net &euro;1.2 million.  That has been taken up by An Post and the Department of Education and Skills.  The impairment charge therefore arises because we sought to depreciate the building and the improvements over a 50 year period at 2% per annum, and the historical cost, the accumulated depreciation and the carrying value was greater than &euro;1.2 million.  That is where the impairment charge arises.</p></speech>

I looked at the figures regarding Dell, Waterford Crystal, SR Technics and TalkTalk.  The inadequacies of the monitoring processes and the need to beef them up have been acknowledged all round.  I have two worries in respect of that fund.  The first is the reimbursement of over &euro;11 million to the EU.  We discussed this here previously.  The Minister was moved to describe the handling of that matter as maladministration, if I recall it correctly.  He used very strong language about it.  That is worrying.  How effective is this?</p> <p> We make investments at an EU level in the likes of this initiative or in F&Aacute;S.  I note that, in 2012, F&Aacute;S spent &euro;298.9 million on the basis that persons were upskilled and re-entered the workforce.  One would not draw much heart from the limited feedback that one sees here in respect of Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics.  There is a significant non-response rate to outcome surveys.  On those in education, in the case of Dell, the surveys showed 9%; in Waterford Crystal, 12%; and in SR Technics, 10%.  For skilled workforces, that strikes me as low.  On those employed or self-employed, in Dell, it was 21% of those reporting back which is a small number; in respect of Waterford Crystal, 15%, which is also a small response rate; and in respect of SR Technics, 15%.  There is no outcome data for TalkTalk.  This might be a general question but I want to put it nonetheless.  Are we getting value for money?  Are the workers getting value for money?  Is there a flaw in that approach? Is it tied up with the maladministration of which the Minister spoke at the time?</p><p> I put the same question in respect of F&Aacute;S.  Of the moneys spent, there were 83,000 learners and 5 million training days.  That sounds impressive, but what is the outcome?  What is the return because that is why the investment is made in the first instance?  If these are not getting the unemployed back into the labour market, albeit in difficult circumstances, surely we need to re-evaluate not only the systems and the oversight, but maybe the approach itself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.341" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013070400017#Q00200"><p>Touching on the maladministration first, I do not want to go back over old ground but Ms McManus covered that with the committee when she was here in February of last year and indicated that there had been communications issues.  Perhaps that is what the Minister had been referring to.  She indicated that she had written to the European Commission about that following the Minister's comments at the time.</p><p>  Deputy McDonald raises an important issue.  We have had some discussion about this already today.  It is not just a question about the EGF.  It is a question about our further education and training and our higher education interventions generally, but, obviously, it arises particularly in the context of the EGF.  In a challenged labour market, how effective is it possible to be in getting people back to work?</p><p>  In the EGF, we have certainly learned from the various programmes that we have and the way in which we work with the workers, especially in TalkTalk, which is not yet completed and for which we cannot yet have the outcome data, to design a package which suits their needs best in the context of where they are living and where they wish to work.  It enhances the likelihood of employment as much as we possibly can in the current labour market.  Obviously, it cannot always be an immediate likelihood, given the challenging time we face, but it certainly enhances their likelihood as much as we can.</p><p>  The figures we have for Dell, Waterford Crystal and SR Technics show that, of those surveys, a relatively high proportion were in employment 12 months after the post EGF final report: 44.85% for Dell, 58% for Waterford Crystal and 53% for SR Technics.  Then there are some others who are in education and training.  That is not to say that we should not seek to have a higher proportion in employment over time.  Of course, we should.</p><p>  There is the nature of the various elements which we fund under the EGF - ensuring that the learning opportunities are accredited is a key item; ensuring that it is not necessarily just that people can follow learning opportunities where they are provided by State-funded providers and that they can also access private provision; the support we give to people to pay for the fees, whether for further or higher education; the enhanced educational costs that we are willing to pay as well, which we have paid under TalkTalk; and the elements of customisation that we have been able to mix-in having regard to each of the groups, which has been very important.</p><p>  As I was saying earlier - I know that we are in a very challenging time - the extent of the people under the various programmes on construction who have entered the labour market is relatively high given the negativity that we hear about construction and about former construction workers.  We fully accept that it could be better, but if we look at our surveys, for example, on the basis of the Revenue data and on the basis of Department of Social Protection, DSP, data, 43% of those who completed NACE 41, 41.5% of NACE 43, and 62.9% of NACE 71 are back in employment, and we have on active labour market programmes approximately 10%, 11% or 12% in each of those categories.  That is not to say that we would be satisfied at all with the 30.6%, the 29% and 14.8%, respectively, who are unemployed, or the other, which is 13.7%, 17.8% and 11.4%, respectively, which could be, for example, either that they have left the workforce and have retired or that they have emigrated.  We are getting more effective data in terms of the outcomes from the EGF which if helpful to us.</p><p>  Furthermore, and coming back to the broad point, we need to continually work on the labour market relevance of further education and training programmes.  NESC is undertaking a piece of work for us at present.  We have issued advice to the VEC sector to try to ensure that it is making its programmes as relevant to the labour market as possible.  The establishment of SOLAS and the initiatives that it will take over time will assist and enhance the labour market relevance.  We are also reviewing the apprenticeship which we see as an important element in terms of the labour market.</p><p>  We also have a number of important interventions.  Momentum is one, which F&Aacute;S is undertaking on our behalf, which involves public and private providers.  Springboard, which involves part-time higher education, is important.  The ICT Skills is more of a higher education intervention but is particularly aimed at ensuring that we have enough people to move into the ICT skills area where a lot of employment is available at present.  We are trying to ensure that we have a balanced provision across further and higher education of relevance to employment, and it is absolutely vital that we seek to enhance that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.368" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Toole" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013070400018#R01300"><p>We are reviewing 2012.  First, what is the F&Aacute;S part of the equation?  If we consider the national framework of qualifications as being a ten-point scale, F&Aacute;S primarily operates at levels 3 to 6.  Therefore, we deal with entry level, intermediate skills, reskilling and upskilling.  That is our space within the equation.  Our client group includes people who are among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in the country, people with significant levels of educational attainment and skills who cannot find a job in their particular areas of expertise, and everyone in between.  Manifestly, there are not enough jobs for everybody, so we help people to compete for the jobs that are available.  For many people, it is not a one-shot fix whereby we carry out an intervention and a job is offered - it is not a question of pass or fail.  Many people need a lot of support due to their background, their educational attainment, their levels of skills and confidence and their generic and specific skills.  At all times we optimise the use of the resources available to us.</p><p>  There are two primary drivers of the programmes that we provide.  First, there is an economic driver, with skills and programmes tailored as best we can to an identified need in the labour market.  The primary driver of other programmes is social inclusion and equity, with the aim of ensuring we do not exclude people from what is a very difficult labour and employment market.  </p><p>  In 2012 our total expenditure was &euro;441.6 million.  It is important that members understand that &euro;164.3 million of that figure is spent on income support, which provides people with an income while they undergo the training programme.  The balance of the investment, &euro;277 million, is spent on putting programmes in place.  For that investment we undertook or provided 83,500 interventions, 77,000 of which were for unemployed people and 5,600 of which were for the apprentice cohort, with a smaller quantity of 2,000 mainly for people employed in other sectors.</p><p>  The first attainment that one can examine is the learning outcome.  As many as 88,000 certificates were received by F&Aacute;S learners.  Obviously, this figure of 88,000 does not map exactly onto the figure of 83,500 interventions, because people are in transition from one year to another and may not have finished a programme.  That is why the figures are not exactly the same.  All of the 88,000 certificates are third-party and are not issued by F&Aacute;S but by other accrediting bodies, principally FETAC, which is now called Quality and Qualifications Ireland and accounts for 70% of accreditations, but also a range of other accrediting bodies, such as City &amp;amp; Guilds or industry-specific bodies.  Therefore, the learning outcome is tangible in terms of recognition of a person's attainment or completion of a course.</p><p>  One then can examine the impact and what happens to learners after they exit a F&Aacute;S course.  There have been a range of positive outcomes.  Obviously, at all stages, one would like people to find work.  Many people have found work but some are moving on to further education and training, so we divide these into two categories: those who are progressing in their training, and those who are moving on to work experience or other programmes.  F&Aacute;S seeks to track those outcomes in what is a very volatile market and is conducting two pieces of research that are relevant.  First, research is being conducted on how the population in general are undergoing transition between employment, unemployment and what is termed economic inactivity, such as retirement or education.  There is an enormous volume of movement.  A lot of people are moving from unemployment to employment and back out again.  They have periods of inactivity when they go on to further education, third level education or whatever they are doing, and then they go back to employment.  There is a huge volume of activity for people who are employed or moving between jobs both in their own fields and outside them.  I draw attention to that point because these are not simple top-line numbers from which one can draw conclusions.  It is really important to understand the dynamics of the labour market. </p><p>  At present we have only preliminary outcomes for the second piece of research, and the work is still ongoing.  We have taken a sample of people who exited F&Aacute;S courses in 2012 and analysed what happened to them over the year.  The preliminary results indicate a total positive outcome for the economically driven programmes that varies between 71% and 81%.  A positive outcome is a period of employment or progression to a work experience programme or further or higher education.  With regard to the programmes that are driven by social inclusion and equity - which cater to people who are always going to find it more difficult - there are positive outcomes for between 54% and 74%.  In other words, the intervention, whatever it was, has enabled them to progress or be placed in work.</p></speech>

I wish to touch on a couple of issues.  I do not know if my general question has been asked already.  The total annual budget stated in the F&Aacute;S annual report for 2011 was just short of &euro;1 billion, but programmes cost &euro;736 million, overheads cost &euro;40 million, pension cost &euro;62 million and staff cost about &euro;105 million.  If one divides the sum for programmes by 163 interventions for that year it works out at roughly &euro;4,500 per intervention, and if one includes the overall costs of &euro;1 billion then it is roughly &euro;6,000 per intervention.  Is that value for money?  The role of F&Aacute;S is to provide jobs and get people ready for jobs.  Would it be better to give the money to employers to take people on rather than giving it to F&Aacute;S to provide more training?  That is a hard question but a relevant one, and I ask Mr. O'Toole to address the matter.</p></speech>

The income for participants on community employment schemes and on the various training programmes came from F&Aacute;S and that was 50% of the total budget.</p></speech>

One is looking at that.  I suppose the other point is that F&Aacute;S does not provide employment.  F&Aacute;S training helps people to compete in a labour market, which is the most difficult it has been for as long as I can remember.  We are one part of the equation.  We are helping people gain entry level and intermediate skills within our remit which gives them a better chance of competing for the jobs available.</p></speech>

A lot of those are inactive.  We have looked at changing the mix.  Traditionally, F&Aacute;S was known for providing construction-related courses, and we still do a small proportion of those.  There are still 100,000 people employed in construction, notwithstanding the challenges of the sector.  However, we have moved into areas we believe are more relevant to current labour market conditions and, as I said, are helping people to access service level jobs.  ICT, for example, is topical and a lot of the demand there is at the top end of the scale.  This year, or maybe last year, we put in place 6,000 places at entry and intermediate level for ICT skills that are relevant to the ICT industry.  There is a huge demand from learners, unemployed people, for programmes which help them in digital literacy and we are satisfying that demand, in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

However, we work in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection to ensure there is a flow of data between the Department and ourselves and at a macro level informing the Department of Education and Skills.  We have certain tracking systems but as the Secretary General said earlier, we are developing new systems.  As part of the development work from Intreo and the development of SOLAS and the new education and training boards, we will develop a new learner database that will plug in and integrate with the Intreo system, so that we can improve our more direct tracking of individuals.</p></speech>

Obviously, coming from Limerick and given what happened with Dell, I have a particular interest in it.  In regard to the funding which has been returned to the EU, in Dell's case, 40% was returned.  Interestingly, in the case of Waterford Crystal, it was a low as 20% while in the case of SR Technics, it was 60%.  In terms of NACE 41, construction of buildings, 35% was returned, in the case of NACE 43, specialised construction activities, it was 39% and in NACE 71, architectural services construction, it was 15%.  Why is there such a disparity?  It looks as if approximately &euro;23 million of EU funding will be returned, which has to be queried.</p><p>  In the case of Dell, the reason was the application process.  I was able to download the application from the EU website but it did not match the requirements of many of the people.  A large amount of it was to do with courses they would not attend.  The amount put towards people going down the self-employed route was very small and that is borne out by the fact that in July 2012, of the number of people employed by Dell, only 67 of them, which was fewer than 5%, were self-employed.  I know many of the people from Dell and there was a huge entrepreneurial spirit in Dell.</p><p>  If the application process was right, nothing would be returned to the EU.  Some &euro;23 million in funding from the EU should have been spent.  How is there such a disparity in the level of refunds between the different groups?  Will Mr. O'Toole tell me abut the application process which was grossly deficient in the context of Dell?  I studied the application process and it did not match the overall requirements.  The people involved in the implementation of the EGAF on the ground - I think at that point they were from F&Aacute;S - were very good but they were constrained by what was in the application.</p><p>  A general approach on the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the EGAF 2014-2020 has been agreed.  One of the weaknesses of the original application for those in Dell was that one could not transfer between different categories.  One could not switch between the self-employed or the third level categories, for example.  Given the way the applications were made, funds were going to be returned because they could not be spent as they did not cater for the needs of people in Dell.</p> <p>I feel strongly about this issue.  I believe the money could have been better used in the area of enterprise and employment.  A number of people who worked with Dell could not qualify for assistance because there was no mention of funding for enterprise in the application form.</p></speech>

We appreciate the concerns expressed by the Deputy.  More effort and energy has been put into reviewing our initial approach, whether by the Department's officials or auditors and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We have learned a great deal from the various reviews and audits that have been undertaken.  In terms of the comparison between how we are doing relative to others internationally, which I covered earlier, we do not have information on international comparisons since 2012, but on average we are 10% better than the average on average.</p></speech>

I think we can design programmes to meet the needs of individuals.  From the surveys conducted on the former Dell employees, a significant proportion of the 2,600 former employees had an education standard of junior certificate or less.  One would like people to get to the point at which they could do third level degrees.  However, such an aspiration was not compatible with the profile of people who had worked in Dell.  These people wanted to work.</p><p>  We need to have an overall rethink on education.  Third level degree level education is only part of the spectrum of education.  Let us consider the educational system in other countries.  Germany is a powerhouse in terms of manufacturing.  Germany has a traditional third level education system but in addition it has a crafts and an apprenticeships stream, in which people are being trained while working in jobs.  That is one of the reasons it has kept its manufacturing base.  I am well aware that Italy and other countries refunded 60% or more of the funds they received.  My hope is that we will spend all the money that we get from Europe.  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to comment on the application process.</p></speech>

We do not want to be average and we are already 10% above average, which is quite a lot and we would like to do better than that.

We have identified under TalkTalk that we will continue to have the further and higher education grants, as well as particular programmes, developed to meet the needs of groups of redundant workers who have similar needs.  We have also identified the need for course costs and a particular grant for that.  There were innovations such as particular customisation needs under the Dell programme.  F&Aacute;S designed an internship programme which included training and on the job placement for a number of private companies.  I know the Deputy will be aware of that.</p><p>  In parallel but not under the EGF, we did an accelerated tailored level 7 conversion course.</p></speech>

I would like to know the reason for the disparity in refunds between the various programmes.  It is clear that almost 80% of the fund was spent in the Waterford example.  That is to be welcomed.  In the case of SR Technics, approximately 40% of the fund was spent and 60%, which is very high, was refunded.  Has the Department come to a conclusion - apart from the overall issues relating to Ireland, Inc. - regarding the reason the refund amounts were much lower in the cases of some of the particular EGF programmes for individual companies or groups?  To give some examples, some 75% of the fund was spent in the case of the architectural services programme, nearly 60% of the fund was spent in the case of the specialised construction programme and some 65% of the fund was spent in the case of the construction of buildings programme.  All of that is to be welcomed.  The case of SR Technics clearly stands out because just 40% of the fund was spent.

We were really in a learning process when the first three come together.  We were challenged by that.  The TalkTalk programme came along after we had completed a review process.  We knew that engagement with the local workers, the local community and the F&Aacute;S co-ordination unit on the ground needed to take place at an early a stage as possible.  We provided money upfront on a national basis outside of our national contribution to the EGF.  The specific design elements of the TalkTalk programme included the provision of job-focused private training, arranged through Skillnets, and the EGF course contribution.  We were providing grants to pay for fees, but we have now broadened that out to defray expenses relating to mobility, accommodation, course equipment and materials.  There has been a high level of ministerial engagement as well.</p></speech>

We have made sure we have been engaging with the community.  The community has been taking the lead as well.  We have enabled the community to take the lead.

There is an increase in the case of TalkTalk, but it is not massive.  Can Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; explain the factors that apply to the 38% of TalkTalk workers who do not get involved in, engage with or participate in the measures?  As he said earlier, many of them went into additional employment.  He has explained why the participation level cannot reach 90% or 100%.  Can he outline why it is just 62%?</p></speech>

We cannot get a response from them.  It is very hard to get behind the figures.  We have some information on their labour market status, which can be gleaned from Revenue and Department of Social Protection data.  Of the 194 people in question - this information was compiled before we got the extra 28 people to engage - 98 were already employed and 62 were categorised as "other", which could mean they had emigrated or had retired.  There could be other reasons.  Five people were on programmes which do not fall within the ambit of the EGF and 29 people were unemployed.  Obviously, we are really trying to influence and engage with those who are unemployed.</p></speech>

That is fair enough.  Does the Department have any idea of what the projected underspend will be when the course finishes in February 2014?  That might be a difficult question.  I would like Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to compare the figure in the case of TalkTalk with the figures for the other companies we are looking at here.  Maybe it is impossible for him to do so right now.</p></speech>

I think the success in the case of the construction programme that achieved an access rate of approximately 85% can be attributed to the small and very engaged population in that example.  I would not overstate the level of engagement in that case.  The average figure across the construction sector as a whole is 63%.  We would hope that TalkTalk would be the highest.  I am not saying it will be, however.</p></speech>

The case of TalkTalk is relevant to where I am from.  The bigger picture relates to the national agencies that deal with these cases.  How much interaction and connectivity do Dr. Fields and his colleagues have with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland when they are designing courses?  When the two agencies recently looked at Waterford and the south east, they identified deficiencies in the skills base in the region, for example, when it comes to languages.</p> <p>This may not be directly relevant in some cases.

I was present at a meeting in the IDA offices in relation to a company that was about to come into Ireland.  We discussed what F&Aacute;S could do to meet its skills needs, which it set out for us in that area.  We communicate this information to the appropriate regional director who builds it into the business planning process.  We can fast-track some of this, depending on the location of the inward investment.  We have a strong business planning process, which the board reviews every three months.  Each region has to submit a business plan, setting out the connections it has made in the region and nationally.  We have a good process in place in that regard.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and their families and staff and, in particular, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for his Trojan work in organising, supporting and participating in the Oireachtas charity walk in the beautiful Mourne Mountains in County Down last weekend.  The Deputy has been strong in his advocacy of the group that benefited from the funds raised.  I commend him and all involved on what was a joint venture between the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly and they raised funds for Rett Syndrome Ireland.  I congratulate Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and we now know why he looks so fit.</p></speech>

I would like to record my appreciation of the work of the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, other colleagues in the Houses and our counterparts in the Northern Assembly, particularly those who turned up and participated last Sunday.  I would make a last little appeal.  The members will remember very well that Rare Disease day is the last day of February.  It is very much built around a leap year, a rare day one in every four years, 29 February.  On that day we hosted a range of organisations here which work with people with rare diseases across this island.  One of those was those organisation that works with people with Rett syndrome, which affects young girls only and it presents after ten to 18 months.  The child develops normally up to that point and then it is a nightmare for the family, for the parent or parents as the case might be, and for the child.   It is such a difficult set of circumstances to imagine.  I will just mention what Rett Syndrome Ireland said about the disease.  It said: "Imagine the symptoms of Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Parkinsons , Epilepsy and Anxiety Disorder ... [and] ALL in one little girl.  One has got to see it to understand it".  We will close the collection tomorrow and for any of those who participated we would appreciate if they have any small little contribution to make if they put it in an envelope in the Minister, Deputy Deenihan's pigeon hole, my pigeon hole or Deputy Eric Bryne's pigeon hole.  Anything at all small would be welcome because it is a collective effort.  It is not a party but an Oireachtas endeavour with the Northern Assembly this year.  Any small contribution they would like to make would add to the collection in support of this very worthy cause.  There are only some 60 children with this disease on the island or Ireland but, sadly, that is 60 too many.  We hope that advances will be made in regard to this serious disorder and that hopefully a time will come that this will never present again.</p></speech>

The idea for it emerged from a conference we had in Waterford in February.  I appreciate this opportunity and also thank Paul for all his help.</p><p>  To introduce myself, my name is Vanessa Lacey and I am the health and education office for Transgender Equality Network Ireland or TENI.  I also sit on the committee for transgender health care in association with the HSE as well as other voluntary organisations of which I am a part, including Integration Waterford which includes all marginalised communities in our area of Waterford city - it looks at diversity and bringing that forward.  </p><p>  I want to say a little bit about language and differences.  I am talking about gender identity.  This is a deeply rooted feeling of being male or female whereas the term "transgender" is an umbrella term and refers to those people whose gender identity is different from what was recorded at birth.  </p><p>  In regard to myself, I appear before the committee today a very proud Waterford woman and a proud Irish woman.  However, I am not a stereotypical Waterford woman or Irish woman.  At the end of this month I will be 49 years of age.  I was born in Waterford city.  At birth I was identified as male.  My parents and the midwives did not know my gender identity and the hospital staff or GPs could not have known my gender identity.  However, my gender identity for as long as I can remember is female and always was.  I do not get any prizes for that, that is the way it is, it is human diversity.  It is nobody's fault, it is how life was for me.</p><p>  As a young child growing up, I did not think there was anything wrong until my expression of my gender was either frowned upon or I was punished for it.  In the 1960s and early 1970s in Waterford, being the way I am and being way I have grown up to be was not the run-of-the-mill.  It was frowned upon so I conformed to my parents' and society's expectations.  I went to a Catholic boys school and then I went into secondary school.  I left school at 14 years of age after failing every examination I could possibly sit because I could not concentrate on what was going on.  I conformed again and I was lucky enough to have two wonderful relationships with people, both of them female, and I was married and I have two wonderful children.  My wonderful children have supported me through this process and this process has taken six years.  </p><p>  However, I have lost contact with most of my family members.  My mother died two and a half years ago and prior to that she did not talk to me.  Coming back to what I am going to speak about and to make the matters plain for everyone, I would point out that two and a half years ago my mother died and three years before she died my brother asked me if I was wishing to carry Mam's coffin.  I said, "No.  Not really, I have not really thought about it".  He said, "That is good because I cannot imagine any member of this family wanting to put their arms around you".</p><p>  It is estimated that 1% of the population experience some form of gender variance.  That equates to around 50,000 people in Ireland.  However, a small percentage of people transition to a new gender role or seek medical help for transgender-related experiences.  As a country we are only coming to understand gender identity and the needs of our transgender community.  I will highlight some of the issues.  The World Health Organization defines health as not simply the absence of illness but the presence of wellness.  Ireland's transgender population does not enjoy good health.  In a recent survey carried out in Ireland it was found that 78% of transgender people had seriously considered ending their lives and, believe it or not, a startling 40% of people attempted to take their life at least once.  The national average for suicide is 1.6% and this begs the question, how many transgender people are included in this 1.6% and how many people today are planning to take their own lives due to feelings of despair with regard to their gender identity?</p> <p>I also seriously considered taking my life because I was afraid of the shame I would bring on my family.  This is the impact of the lack of awareness of this issue in society.  The high rates of depression, anxiety and suicidality are exacerbated by the fact that transgender issues have historically been doused in stigma, stereotyping and discrimination.  The term used for this is "transphobia".  This will take many years to combat and eradicate, allowing transgender people and their families to seek necessary treatments, procedures and legal documentation and move on with their lives in safety and inclusivity.</p><p> Access to health care is one of the most urgent issues facing the transgender community.  Some transgender people feel so desperate and trapped in another gender that they need to undergo a transition from one gender to another in an effort to lessen the deleterious factors on their mental health.  This may include accessing mental health services, hormone therapies and surgical procedures.  Up to December 2012, transgender people received hormone therapy through St. Colmcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown, which is the major centre for endocrinology in Ireland.  The patient figure in this regard has tripled since 2006.  Currently, 160 transgender people are receiving this therapy.  There is anecdotal evidence that some transgender people seek hormone therapy in the UK and other EU countries and that some purchase hormones through the online black market.  Hormone treatments have been proven to alleviate stress and anxiety and are a medical necessity.  It is vital that individuals are able to access these services in a safe and timely manner.</p><p> There is no doubt that this service needs to be expanded.  The case for vibrant and healthy services is clear, as the long-term financial effects of the treatment can potentially be cost effective, allowing the person to return to the workplace or school environment, free to be himself or herself, in a society that is growing in awareness and accepting of diversity.  Under the instruction of Dr. Philip Crowley, the HSE has made positive steps to develop pathways and provide a service to transgender people and their families.  A transgender health working group was developed in 2011.  This group consists of members of the HSE, Dr. Crowley, Ms Mullen, Ms Gleeson, Mr. Perry, Mr. Giambrone, myself and a member of GLEN.  We appreciate everyone's services.</p><p> In 2012, research was carried out to ascertain the level of transgender awareness within the HSE, the statistics on which are interesting and are included in the packs which members have received.  Following this, a series of events was arranged in the first half of 2013.  As I mentioned earlier, a conference was held in February, to which we invited the president elect of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.  We have since developed and are delivering training to HSE staff and members of other organisations throughout the country who are in touch with transgender people.  We are happy to be working in collaboration with Dr. Crowley's office.</p><p> TENI's objective is the development of a safe and accessible health service for transgender people.  However, serious barriers remain.  These can be overcome without huge financial strain.  It may only take willingness to engage and collaborate.  The key is engagement and collaboration.  We have a good relationship with the HSE and welcome that we can meet with and discuss issues with it.  Collaboration and engagement is key in this area.</p><p> In regard to children and young people, members will be aware from the press conference on Tuesday at which Senator Zappone's Private Members' Bill was launched that there has been an increase in the number of children coming out as transgender.  For example, in 2012, TENI was contacted 80 times by families whose children and teenagers were exploring their gender identity.  There is currently only one support for families of transgender people.  It is called TransParenCI.  It is a fantastic group which connects families with others with similar experiences.  It was developed 18 months ago and has during that time become one of the biggest transgender family support groups in Europe.  It is a positive development.</p><p> For some children, access to age-appropriate treatment is a medical necessity.  For young people under the age of 16 years who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and are supported by family members, it is indicated that treatment with hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones can substantially relieve the negative symptoms of their condition and allow the young transgender person and his or her family to continue with their lives.  Unfortunately, these services are not yet available in Ireland.  This saddens me.</p><p> In some instances, young people go through child and adolescent mental health services, CAMS, and, if lucky, they are referred to the Tavistock clinic in the UK.  I was informed three weeks ago that three cases were recently referred to that clinic.  In other cases, clinicians are unaware of what actions to take and the child's life is put on hold, often with drastic consequences.  Deputy Buttimer will recall that at the conference in February, a parent spoke of how her daughter had attempted suicide on a number of occasions, the last attempt being almost fatal.  Luckily, the girl was saved and referred to the programme in the UK.  Some parents take their children abroad at substantial cost to them.  Others take the initiative and access treatments from overseas or on the Internet, which treatments can be dangerous if the chid is not medically monitored.  These drastic measures are taken when the family's primary focus is to keep the child alive until the age of 16, when they can access medical treatment as an adult.  This treatment has been researched and proven.  It is important it is made available, even if this means experts training others in this area.  We have contact with these experts and this can happen.  Again, it is a matter of collaboration and engagement.</p><p> The medical treatment of young transgender people is often seen as controversial.  However, research carried out to date suggests that these treatments and procedures are safe, that hormone blockers are reversible and that psychologically the patient does not suffer further dysphoria.  There is clear preliminary data from the EU and US which indicates that young people have positive mental health outcomes following access to this treatment.  These supervised treatments have many benefits.  The child can develop and comfortably live in the desired gender and ultimately will be able to move on with his or her life and education.  As human beings, we perform much better if we can be ourselves.</p><p> How can the committee help?  As the rates of transgender people coming out are rising throughout the world, Ireland's health service must be competent in addressing the needs of its communities and families.  Developing and rolling out training is key to enabling health care workers gain skills and feel confident in this area.  As this training becomes widespread, it has the potential to upskill service providers, enabling them to provide a service locally.  This can have the benefit of easing the bottleneck that currently exists in the endocrinology unit in St. Colmcille's Hospital.  Expanding this service can have enormous benefits for all.  In this regard, we would certainly require the collaboration - I apologise for my continued use of the word "collaboration" - of Professor O'Shea and his team.  However, this is about more than Dr. O'Shea and his specialist team.  Various departments within the HSE need to be involved as, collaboratively, we can provide this service with little impact on the economy.</p><p> In the longer term, education is key to decreasing and eradicating transphobia.  TENI is engaging with educators in this regard with a view to developing educational tools that explain gender identity to all ages.  I recently with a member of St. Patrick's College in regard to the provision of age-appropriate books on this issue to its students.  It is hoped the students will have access to these books from next year.  Education is the future.</p> <p>If this issue is addressed holistically, it will certainly contribute to the welfare of the transgender person, and the education and support will contribute to decreasing and eradicating transphobia.  I urge the committee to help us to facilitate this process and bring trans-related health care into line with that of other European states.</p><p> As I stated earlier, there is no service provision for younger transgender people in Ireland.  However, and I will conclude on a positive note as I do not like to leave anything on a negative note, we are addressing this issue at present and there have been talks with CAMS and also with the paediatric endocrinology department of an Irish hospital.  I cannot give any confidential information or I would probably be shot.  If these talks lead to a reality, Ireland will be in a position to deliver a safe and quality service to transgender people using an informed consent model.  There is a long way to go in these talks and that is why I did not mention the hospital, but I am positive that this will happen.  Again, it comes down to the engagement and collaboration but I am very confident this will happen.  These young people are our future and supporting them to be themselves will reap benefits for this generation and the next.  It will allow families and people to move on with their lives.  If we remove the stigma from this issue, people will realise there is no threat and there will be no fear of this.  We can provide the health care and educate people and just move forward.  This matter should not be an issue.  We must move forward with this.</p><p> I thank the committee again and apologise if I took too much time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.516" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Broden Giambrone" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013070400005#D00500"><p>I wish to echo Vanessa's comments and thank you, Chairman.  You have been a great ally to the transgender community and we really appreciate your support.  I also thank the committee for joining us today.</p><p>  There are urgent health care needs facing the transgender community of all ages in Ireland.  However, I will take a few minutes to talk about another crucial issue that affects the transgender community, which is legal gender recognition.  At present, transgender and inter-sex people in Ireland are unable to obtain birth certificates that show their true gender.  Ireland has an obligation, as yet unfulfilled, to provide a pathway by which amended birth certificates can be issued.  The State's obligation arises from international and European commitments on human rights.  It is more than five years since the High Court declared Ireland to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  So far, we have failed to find a remedy to this situation and the transgender community has waited too long.</p><p>  Gender recognition is a public health issue.  Birth certificates are foundational documents and are required for daily living.  They are required for official purposes such as obtaining a personal public service, PPS, number, accessing social welfare and getting married.  Individuals regularly come to TENI who are unable to travel because they cannot get identity documents in the correct gender.  People have been denied placements in college because their leaving certificates are under one name and gender identity and the college has dismissed them because it thought that was an error.  It is not an abstract thing but a very practical matter for many people.</p><p>  A person whose gender does not match their identify document runs the risk of daily difficulties, but they also run the risk of being consistently outed as their birth gender.  This can result in transphobia, discrimination and, in the worst case, violence.  The transgender community across the world has high rates of violence perpetrated against it.  In large part, this can be due to the confusion around the gender that people present and the gender as which they are legally recognised.  The possibility of having legal gender recognition acknowledged by the law can have a profound impact on the daily lives of transgender people.  It can facilitate people's ability to enter education, gain employment and access health care and other social services.  Ultimately, it leads to a better sense of well-being.  As Vanessa said, the rates of suicide attempts and suicidality in Ireland are off the charts.  They are higher than anything I have ever seen.  At 40%, we have a real obligation to do whatever we can to make people's lives easier.</p><p>  In 2011, the Government created the interdepartmental gender recognition advisory group, which we call GRAG.  It recommended what the process for gender recognition should be.  It proposed that in order to be recognised an individual would have to provide a certain amount of evidence.  I will not go through all of it because the report is in the public domain but I wish to refer to one issue, the medical evidence and the validation criteria.  The group proposed that in order to be recognised one must have a diagnosis of gender identity disorder or have had gender reassignment surgery.  This is a highly problematic proposal.  First, by tying recognition to a diagnosis of gender identity disorder the Government will automatically exclude people who are inter-sex, because they will not be able to avail of the rights within the recognition.  Three births in 200 are inter-sex affected, so this is not a minor community.  It is a real issue for people as this is a significant proportion of our population.  Furthermore, the nomenclature for the way we define diagnosis is already changing.  The American Psychiatric Association has changed from gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria.  It would be pointless to put an archaic definition into our law.</p><p>  However, it is not just about terminology or who will not be included.  It is also the fact that the approach has increasingly shifted.  International human rights discourse has stressed the need to depathologise gender recognition and to acknowledge that legal rights should not be contingent on medical treatment pathways.  Having a diagnosis of a mental illness can really reinforce stigma.  Transgender people have often been seen as sick or mentally ill and have had their gender identity seen as something that needs to be fixed.  This is not dissimilar to the fact that homosexuality also featured in the American Psychiatric Association's <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> some decades ago.  Transgender people are still in it.  There is a real stigmatising element in putting that into law.  As one transgender person told me, &quot;I am not disordered, I am just me&quot;.  This issue must be highlighted and we strongly feel that it should not be codified in the legislation being brought forward.</p><p>  At present, the current best practice in gender recognition exists in Argentina.  Last May, it brought forward the best practice gender recognition legislation.  It allows an individual to self-declare who they are.  They are the arbitrator of their own identities and they can say that, put it forward and have it recognised by the state as such.  This avoids the pitfalls of many of the GRAG's proposals, particularly surrounding the medical validation process.  We advocate that gender recognition decouples medical interventions from legal recognition.  We propose that the State use a statutory declaration process that affirms the transgender person's identity but also provides a legally robust process.  It would not require any surgical procedures, hormonal therapies or any other psychological or medical treatments for an individual to be accorded their basic human rights.  This position has been supported by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which is a professional body of over 650 physicians and mental health professionals who are engaged in clinical practice in this area.  They are the international experts.  This position has also been supported by the HSE.</p><p>  At present, the Government is in the process of drafting heads of a Bill that will be put before the committee on education and social protection in the autumn.  However, two Private Members' Bills have been produced.  Last week, Senator Katherine Zappone, supported by Senator Jillian van Turnhout, introduced a Bill in the Seanad.  The Bill was informed by best practice.  It came from the transgender community and it is rights compliant legislation.  We urge the Government to take up this Bill or to introduce a similar Bill.</p><p>  There is no doubt that medical treatment and access to health care for transgender people are absolutely necessary.  Vanessa made a very strong statement to that effect.  However, transgender people, like all people, should be availing of the health system when they have a health need, not to obtain a legal right or to be legally recognised.  Transgender people's health needs should be addressed by the health system and their legal needs should be addressed by rights compliant legislation.  Anything else would run contrary to principles of human rights and dignity.</p><p>  We are here to urge all Deputies and Senators to support legislation that will ensure that transgender people have a process to have their affirmed gender recognised under law, without having to go through restrictive or burdensome processes that will negatively impact on their health and their human rights.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I now call Dr. Philip Crowley to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.518" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Philip Crowley" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013070400006#E00200"><p>I thank the Chair and members for their invitation to attend this meeting.  I am joined by my colleagues from the HSE, Ms Caoimhe Gleeson and Ms Louise Mullen.</p><p>  The HSE is working in partnership with Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI - the national voluntary organisation which supports transgender people in Ireland - to establish a recognised treatment pathway for transgender people, to support the requirement for gender recognition legislation and to develop information for health and social care professionals working with transgender people.  I will indicate later why that is very important.</p><p>  In the context of the issues which Ms Lacey and Mr. Giambrone have highlighted, I will first deal with the matter of gender recognition legislation.  The HSE acknowledges that the decision to change one's gender and subsequently apply for a gender recognition certificate is often twinned with social and familial rejection - as Ms Lacey so powerfully described - and the loss of employment, both of which can result in high degrees of social and economic hardship.  Thus it is important to recognise that these decisions are not made lightly, arbitrarily or without considerable sacrifice.  However, the HSE also recognise that these decisions have life affirming benefits for the person and often complete a long and complicated journey of seeking to live legally and physically in his or her preferred gender.  The HSE considers that the decision to change one&rsquo;s gender requires a suite of clinical, surgical and psycho-social supports and interventions.  It considers the process of gender reassignment and any resultant diagnosis or treatment to be quite separate from an application for a gender recognition certificate.</p><p>  The HSE endorses a gender recognition process which places the responsibility for self-declaration on the applicant rather than on the details of a medical certificate or diagnosis.  In doing so, the emphasis is placed on the process of legal recognition of that self-declaration as opposed to the legal recognition of the medical certificate and/or diagnosis.  The HSE considers that this process would be simpler, fairer and, most importantly, pragmatic.  It would certainly be easier to legislate for because it takes account of both transgender and intersex people with differing backgrounds and contexts.  For example, this process is accessible for an applicant who may have transitioned years ago and who may not have any current medical interactions - nor wish to have such interactions - or applicants who may have accessed all of their care outside of the State, which is becoming an increasing phenomenon among the members of the transgender population for reasons of cost and access.  The HSE considers that this process has the potential to minimise unnecessary stigma or hardship on the applicant.  That is why we support it.</p><p>  There is currently no agreed treatment pathway in place for transgender people - including, and importantly, adolescents - and existing essential services to enable the transitioning process, for example, endocrinology, psychology, psychiatry and speech and language therapy, are relatively under-resourced, oversubscribed and predominantly concentrated in Dublin.  Certain surgical interventions are not performed in Ireland and can only be accessed in the UK or other jurisdictions.  There is general agreement that this is appropriate, particularly in light of the small number of procedures that would be carried out here.  The HSE, in collaboration with key advocacy groups and professional bodies, has begun the process of designing and agreeing a recognised treatment pathway for the transgender community, which includes children and adolescents.</p><p>  There are a number of principles which will underpin the treatment pathway.  It will take account of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health standards of care, version 7, WPATH 7, recommendations, particularly with regard to language and the contested area of diagnosis; it will use the term "gender dysphoria" rather than that of "gender identity disorder" in line with WPATH 7 recommendations and the wishes of the community; it will take account of adult, adolescent and intersex issues; it will be designed to ensure that both primary care services, namely, those services accessed through GPs, community mental health teams and allied health professionals, such those who work in the areas of speech and language therapy, social work and occupational therapy, and specialist services, for example, psychology, psychiatry, endocrinology and certain surgeries, can be accessed on a local and a regional basis; and it will be designed to empower professional bodies to provide services and supports through a clear, seamless and simplified process.  The HSE recognises and acknowledges that the lack of an agreed treatment pathway is problematic for transgender adults, children and their families.  It is, therefore, committed to ensuring that this pathway will be agreed and signed off on by 2014.</p><p>  Reference has been made to resources and to information on transgender health care.  In tandem with the development of an agreed treatment pathway, the HSE, will develop a suite of information and training resources to support health and social care professionals to provide informed care and treatment to the transgender community.  The HSE is working closely with TENI in the development of these resources.  It will draw on forthcoming guidelines from the UK, as well as from best practice in other jurisdictions.</p><p>  In 2012 the HSE undertook a survey among our staff to ascertain the level of understanding of transgender issues.  We received a fairly healthy 793 responses to our online survey, from which the following findings emerged: 90% have not had specific training in providing services to transgender people - that may not be a surprising revelation but it is fairly stark none the less; 32% knowingly provided health or social care services to transgender people; 19% have a good or expert knowledge of transgender issues; the provision of services to transgender people was greatest in the mental health and therapy counselling areas; 74% want training - this is the most positive finding from the survey; 75% want further information on transgender issues; 70% provided contact details in order that we might remain in touch with them; and 26% provided qualitative data in respect of the issues as they see them.</p><p>  The HSE recognises that this is a new and emerging issue for many health and social care professionals and understands that clear and consistent information and guidance are required to ensure transgender people receive safe, appropriate and quality care.  My colleagues and I will be happy to answer any questions members may wish to pose.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013070400006#E00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  I have a number of questions I wish to pose for my own information rather than for any other reason.  In the context of growing up in Ireland, has Ms Lacey noticed any particular changes in societal views in recent years?  We are trying to build a more tolerant Republic that is respectful and open in which groups and individuals will be respected for what they are as opposed to what we would like them to be.  Has she noticed any changes in this regard?  If such changes have occurred, have they given people further confidence in trying to establish their identities in an open manner?  When people express themselves publicly and want to address their gender variance, it falls to the HSE and others to assist them in doing so.  Obviously, therefore, the issue of resources is going to be key.  In that context, has Ms Lacey noticed the development of a greater level of awareness among, for example, health care professionals?</p><p>  One of the matters about which I, as a layperson, would be concerned is the high level of mental health issues among people of gender variance, to which Ms Lacey referred.  Ordinarily, they can become very isolated and their first port of call can be their GPs or other care professionals.  Does Ms Lacey believe enough is being done to highlight the issue of gender variance among medical professionals?  Is the process of understanding beginning to feed into the broader health service?</p><p>  It may be an indication that I have been around these Houses for too long but I still recall a time when people - even some in my constituency - openly campaigned against the provision of assistance to those of gender variance in the form of therapy and surgical procedures.  I recall people protesting to the old health boards and stating that it was a waste of resources, etc.  To be truthful, what occurred was quite nasty and insidious.  I hope that the position in this regard is changing and that there is greater understanding among people in general.</p><p>  It was stated that 1% of the population experience transgender variance.  That is a sizeable number.  If we were discussing a figure of 1% in the context of another matter, it might give rise to alarm.</p> <p>All the 1% figures add up quickly to many individuals and people.  Is there a general recognition at the highest level in the HSE, the Department of Health and the Government that this issue is not going away and that it must be addressed and dealt with in a meaningful structured way?  I am asking because the gender recognition advisory group, GRAG, has been established.  Will Dr. Crowley explain whether it is established under the Department of Health or another body?  Where is it established?  Does the HSE sit on GRAG and, if not, why not?</p><p> One of the witnesses cited Argentina as a model for gender recognition law.  Are there any other countries not necessarily nearer but with a similar legal system to ours?  Are there other countries of like mind or like make-up in terms of their legal and parliamentary restructures that would serve as a good template for us to examine the options quickly, in view of the fact that we are in breach of EU and human rights law?  We need to address it not only because we are in breach of the law but because it is the right thing to do.  Will the witnesses cite that?</p><p> I was jotting down notes as we have been going along so I do not necessarily have anything prepared.  Some years ago there was a debate about the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  There have been various debates about sexuality in general in the country, about family make-up and the various forms of family.  It never ceases to amaze me that we almost have to be forced to make decisions about conferring rights on people because we believe that by conferring rights on people somehow we are taking away rights from other people.  I cannot understand the logic but it seems to arise frequently in our society.  There is an idea that if we confer a right or entitlement on one person then we diminish another person's rights or entitlements.  That is probably a statement more than a question.</p><p> My final question is for Dr. Crowley.  He made reference to the HSE working, supporting and understanding.  Is there capacity within the HSE at present to train clinicians and care professionals?  I am not making a political point, but is it seen for what it is in terms of mental issues, therapy, counselling, surgical supports and endocrinology and everything that flows from that?  Is it genuinely seen as an important issue?  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.522" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013070400007#F00200"><p>I welcome all on the panel this morning, including Ms Lacey and Mr. Giambrone, who addressed the committee on behalf of the Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, as well as Dr. Crowley and those who have accompanied him from the HSE.</p><p>  The statistics the panel have highlighted in respect of suicidal ideation among the trans population are most alarming.  Suicide prevention is regularly an issue of address at the committee.  I have it to say that the details raised have escaped the discourse to date, even at this committee.  I welcome the fact that the members of the panel have highlighted them this morning because it is important that the seriousness of the matter is understood.</p><p>  One point struck me from listening to and examining the contributions of Ms Lacey and Mr. Giambrone.  I am unsure how to extrapolate the detail but I imagine it is like everything else relating to suicide and suicide attempts, that is, it is likely that we are not reflecting the full extent of it because we do not know the full extent.  That is what it comes down to.  As a society, we must come to terms with the fact that we have a high incidence not only of suicide but of suicide attempts and the underlying causes of suicidal ideation.  We should be prepared, as a society, to step up to the plate and acknowledge that we are collectively contributing to this by our respective failures to understand, learn and broaden our awareness.  Nowhere is this more in evidence than in respect of the testimonies that the panellists have given this morning.</p><p>  I thank the panellists for their presentations.  The fact that we are addressing the issues that impact on the trans population this morning is indicative of a changing outlook throughout society generally and that is to be welcomed.  I commend people from all political backgrounds who have participated in this morning's engagement.</p><p>  The panellists have left me with some concerns in respect of two of the contributions.  Ms Lacey made reference to Senator Zappone's recently published Bill and Mr. Giambrone made reference to the fact that there have been two such Bills.  However, he did not go on to say that Deputy McLellan and myself are proudly members of the party that published a gender recognition Bill only six weeks ago.  I will not ask Mr. Giambrone to tell me what is deficient in it here and now, but he may have some comments.  Our team worked very hard on bringing it forward and we are proud to stick our flag on it.  I encourage all political parties and the political system to step up to the plate on this issue again.  Political leadership is required as well as a willingness to do things.  I commend my party colleague, the lead Deputy on the legislation, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh.  I am the health spokesperson but we collaborated on it.  Deputy McLellan, who sits with me on the Joint Committee on Health and Children, and I are proud of the body of work that went into it.</p><p>  I reckon the Chair will ring his bell shortly but I have a number of questions.  Before I go to some of the questions one alarming point came across in Ms Lacey's contribution.  She spoke about the services available to young people under the age of 16 years.  It merits highlighting because in the next paragraph Ms Lacey stated that the family's primary focus was to keep their child alive until the age of 16 years.  It is time for Ireland to waken up.</p></speech>

That is what it all comes down to, but I am heartened by the findings highlighted by Dr. Crowley, including the finding that 74% of the respondents are seeking training.  That is encouraging.</p><p>  I understand how difficult all of this can be across the board and without exception, irrespective of the circumstances of people in terms of financial backup and support and familial backup and support.  What is the position among people from poorer backgrounds?  What about the medical card dependent community?  This affects people across the board.  I am asking the question because it does not come across in what I have seen to date.  Are trans people and transition procedures covered by the medical card?  What services, treatment and therapies are available on the medical card?  What after care and continuing care is available to those dependent on the public health system?  Does the HSE and the Department of Health fund TENI or any other support group and, if not, why not?</p></speech>

I am relatively new to this issue and because it is relatively recent I am still struggling with my vocabulary.</p> <p>I say that because it is an issue that is not widely discussed.  I have tried to talk to friends, family members and others about it.  I feel I am relatively new to the issue and they feel they know nothing about it other than what they read in a sensational media report which does not provide the knowledge and briefings we get as Oireachtas Members.  For me, it brings home the reality that while we are having a really important discussion here, there is a wider societal issue.  I was very struck by Ms Lacey's very moving testimony and the importance of her right to her identity.  There is also the importance of family life, especially for children.  Even as we grow older, family life and those family ties are very important.</p><p> Given my children's rights background, my questions are first on children and the process of identification and understanding.  Where do they seek support?  How do the parents help the child to have the vocabulary to understand that they are going through a process of realisation?  I am saying this as an Oireachtas Member who is fortunate to get all the briefings and background.  I get the vocabulary piece.  In rural or urban areas the information facilities and supports are not there for the families and children.  I am sure Senator Zappone will inform the witnesses of her excellent Bill, which I was very happy to support.  At the launch on Tuesday it was very moving to hear from two young people with distinctively different experiences.  One was being bullied in school and ended up with the only option of being schooled at home.  That indicated a real failure of today's Ireland.  When I listened to Ms Lacey, I became conscious that because so much of our education is delivered in single sex schools, we have to find a way to balance and deal with the issue.</p><p> I would also be interested to explore more about the inter-sex issue, particularly around birth certificates and carrying through.</p><p> No mention was made of older people.  Can I just assume there are no issues there?  Obviously I have been very focused on children, but given that Irish society is waking up to this issue in some way and that a ripple effect is taking place, will some people now come to a realisation that helps them to understand their identity and who they are?</p><p> I have a question about asylum seekers.  From my meetings in direct provision centres and talking to different individuals, this is one of the issues leading to people seeking asylum.  However, they are very often are put in very inappropriate accommodation perhaps with people of nationalities that would not have any tolerance of this issue.  Is that an issue that has been raised?</p><p> In 2014, when these HSE plans are all cleared, they should come before the committee for discussion.</p></speech>

Three and a half years ago before TENI could employ people through Atlantic Philanthropies, transgender issues were probably 30 years behind lesbian and gay issues.  However, I am delighted to say that we have probably caught up ten of those years in the past three and a half years and we definitely have a momentum behind us and have certainly reached a tipping point.  Society's attitudes are changing as we raise awareness and that is extremely positive.  One of the main components of that is a group we have created out of that.  Far from being a Frankenstein's monster, it is something absolutely beautiful.  I refer to the family group, TransParentCI.</p><p>  There is often a question about people regretting this process.  The two main reasons would be gatekeepers stopping people from access to treatment and loss of family.  As I have said, I will never get my mother back and will never get her peace of mind back.  However, I believe others will in future.</p><p>  We do not yet have data on mean ages.  Whereas two or three years ago the mean age of people attending the groups was in their 40s and female identified, now younger people are coming out all the time and their families are supporting them through the parent support group.  The resources are very limited but the family, health care and education are key.  If it can be addressed holistically, it is a win-win situation and can be done really cheaply.  It will not cost much money at all - it is a buy-in and we can provide training as we have outlined in our submission.</p><p>  The second question was on health care providers and their attitudes.  I am trying to break down barriers with them by showing a human face to demystify some of the issues and I am getting people to open up a bit.  I have already presented to child and adolescent mental health services - it was important to get in there - and also to paediatric endocrinology as well as other services.  Some people are willing to engage and others are not.  Unfortunately, engagement with the main endocrinology service in Ireland is a problem.  However, there is miscommunication with biggest providers of health care to transgender people in Ireland, GPs, who cannot even get a response to a telephone call, e-mail or letter.  That can have serious consequences, especially when one has all the other issues with one's family, one's life and one's children.</p><p>  When the GP cannot get a response to a question about a prescription, we are talking serious business.  I know at the moment members are dealing with the abortion debate which is extremely serious and I commend them on all the work they are doing on that.  However, let us not allow this situation to become worse in five years' time where there is a suicide letter left because of something as simple as a communication from health care practitioners.  If anything I want to leave that message here today.  It is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed.  Communication, collaboration and engagement are key.</p><p>  Access to colleges training GPs is a problem.  We need to get the doors open and provide a service.  We are competent to provide very good training and have had good feedback on our training.  We do baselines and evaluations at the end of it so we have a good indication we are providing that.  There is transphobia in services.</p> <p>That is where the Health Service Executive could come in and say we should listen to these people who are experts in their field and that this is not some sort of whim.  That is a serious suggestion that can be taken from this meeting.</p><p> Suicidal factors is an extremely serious issue in that 40% of people are looking at it.  Those three questions filter in to some of the questions asked by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  It is serious.  I do not want to sound like a parrot repeating something but it is about access to health care, legislation, transphobia, educating people and young people being unable to access hormone treatment.  That happened recently where the family had to get their general practitioner to contact someone in Barcelona to get a prescription to give a hormone blocker to a child because the child was suicidal.  That is a service we should provide here.</p><p> I apologise to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in for not mentioning the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  I should have mentioned it but I will cheer him up now by saying-----</p></speech>

During the Atlantic Philanthropies period, I worked in development work and we created TransParenCI, among other groups.  We also created the Trans Groups in Ireland through which all the transgender groups throughout the country, including the parents group, would meet every three months and discuss problems, challenges and what they would do as a strategy.  I am delighted to say that we are now an all-Ireland group, the Trans Groups Alliance of Ireland, and we work hand in hand with others across the Border.  That is the future for us.  We have had great experiences in that, and I hope that has cheered up Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in-----</p></speech>

The issue of medical cards is a serious one.  We are delighted that many of the treatments are provided through the HSE.  Today is 4 July.  On this day two years ago, at this time, I was under general anaesthetic in Charing Cross Hospital.  Today, I am alive and extremely happy, although I am giving out about various issues, but at least I have the opportunity to do that.  I am extremely happy that I undertook to do that, and I thank the surgeons for keeping me alive but, and there is always a "but", a number of areas stand out that are not covered, and one that is extremely important is laser therapy.  That must be on the agenda, as well as voice therapy and other such treatments.  Those are the two most important issues, especially when laser therapy can prevent complications developing after surgery.  It is not typical to have laser therapy just for the removal of facial hair.  It is to allow free movement in society.  Also, it is extremely important to have laser therapy in other areas before surgery.</p><p>  To answer Senator van Turnhout's question on transparency and family support, it is the key.  I put a great deal of time into developing that group, and if I stop working tomorrow, I will know that I have developed that wonderful group which is moving from strength to strength.  In 18 months we have brought them away for a weekend where they did therapeutic work with the fathers, mothers, siblings and children of transgender people, because it stops the situation I spoke about earlier.  When all family members are brought in, it demystifies the situations around it.  We are telling them the care pathways that are available, and that allows them to move on.  We are dealing with it in a holistic manner.</p><p>  On the education front, education is the key to ending transphobia because we are educating society.  I would love to see age-appropriate books not just in second and third level education but in primary school.  The key is to explain to children with age-appropriate literature that this is an identity issue.  That will ensure children as young as two to five years of age are aware of their gender identity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.540" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Broden Giambrone" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013070400009#H00600"><p>I will be brief.  On the first question on gender recognition and like-minded countries, we are looking at Argentina because, as we say, that is the North Star.  Europe does not have that North Star.  The proposed recommendations of the gender recognition advisory groups are drawn from the United Kingdom's Gender Recognition Act of 2004.  That was an important and progressive Act when it came in, but nine years on, it has become clear that it contains some major shortcomings, and pitfalls have arisen.  Not everyone who should be able to avail of their right to be recognised in the UK is able to do so through that scheme for many of the reasons we have highlighted today, including issues such as the validation process, the panel process, and many of the imported schemes.  That is probably seen as one of the more progressive ones but we have it on good authority and also from anecdotal evidence from the transgender community that it is not working.  We are in a position now where we can make legislation work for the transgender community in Ireland.</p><p>  Countries across Europe are now examining their gender recognition Acts.  What is interesting is that, for the most part, most countries in Europe have gender recognition.  In countries like Sweden it was introduced in the 1970s.  While that was progressive in the 1970s, it is now considering updating it.  Countries like Sweden and the Netherlands are in the process of examining introducing more human rights-based legislation.  In the coming years, we will see more countries moving in that direction but, unfortunately, because the process was brought in at an earlier date, we are now looking at moving it forward progressively in Ireland because there is nothing in place, and that is a unique opportunity for us.</p><p>  While the system in Argentina is different and is in a different context, it shares many of the same issues faced by Ireland.  Looking to Argentina is useful.  In the past year, more than 1,000 people have had their gender recognised and no issues have arisen.  People have been able to avail of this process and the sky has not fallen in.  There is a real utility in looking at that as a model.</p><p>  On the final point, it is an opportunity for Ireland to lead the way in terms of human rights in this field.  That would not cost anything but it would make a huge difference for a small group of people, and it does not have any significant pitfalls.  It is important to keep that in mind.</p><p>  In terms of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, I echo Ms Lacey in issuing my sincere apologies for not mentioning that.  That was a fantastic Bill published on 23 May by Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh.  I would like to commend him highly and Stephanie Lord, who did a significant body of work on that Bill, particularly in looking at the Argentinian model and trying to import that into an Irish context.  Similarly, the Bill examines issues of self-determination, the integrity of transgender people, and human rights.  That is another excellent model and I would encourage everyone to look at that Bill.</p><p>  On the intersex issues raised, intersex issues are highly stigmatised in Irish society, even more so than transgender issues.  For people who do not know, when we say "intersex" we mean a person who is born with or develops reproductive or sexual anatomy in a different way.  Transgender people's identity is different from what was assigned at birth.  For intersex people and intersex conditions, that is a little different.  It is a highly invisible community but these identities can be quite fluid.  There are more than 40 intersex conditions, some of which do not even have names.  When someone is born with the condition, the doctors make the best guess they can based on those, but that can change.  This area of medicine is not at its fullest and therefore what we see is that people might come to a different identity in childhood or in adolescence.  That is the reason it is vital we have a gender recognition Act that can accommodate these individuals because if we do not do that, situations can arise where people are denied access to schools, which can put a major burden on their families.</p> <p> The inability to support intersex families can further stigmatise people.  This is a significant issue and both of the Private Members' Bills we are discussing would go a long way towards providing support for these individuals and families.  The asylum-seeking community is another issue and something which has only recently been highlighted for TENI.  People seeking asylum face multiple discrimination.  They often face discrimination in their countries of origin and also face it when they come to Ireland.  Individuals who have faced persecution or discrimination in their countries and are now claiming asylum here have come to us.  They run into many issues regarding sex-segregated facilities.  They have documentation from their country of origin which they could not change there because there is no gender recognition process.  When they come to Ireland they cannot change their documentation here.  Not only do they struggle with coming to a new country but they are further stigmatised in Irish society.  This can be a real challenge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.542" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Philip Crowley" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013070400010#J00200"><p>Several questions were specifically directed to me and I will attempt to answer them briefly.  The HSE is committed to meeting the needs of the transgender community and I hope our presence here today alongside TENI is a clear demonstration of this fact.  A question was asked whether we participated in the gender recognition advisory group.  I understand it was an interdepartmental committee so the Department of Health was represented.  We made submissions to it, as did a number of the specialists who work on our behalf to deliver services.</p><p>  With regard to access to care, the medical card covers the services provided in Ireland to the community and should be provided with regard to people's needs without any discrimination.  This is not to state access is not an issue and I will return to this point.  It is fair to state services have developed through the pioneering efforts of a number of forward-sighted individuals who trained in the UK and gained expertise in the particular needs of the transgender community.  We do not think this is adequate for the emerging community, which is why we have commenced the process to develop an agreed treatment pathway with more than one centre.  At the same time we would not seek to have a huge number of centres where expertise becomes diluted.  As with everything, and as we know from previous debates, there will be a balance between access and quality of care.  We will try to increase access by creating more expertise and signing up other experts, particularly in endocrinology and mental health services outside of Dublin, which is critical for the community.  This process is under way and we need to continue to dedicate ourselves to it.  If asked we will bring to the committee the outcome of this process.</p><p>  With regard to whether we fund TENI, we do not fund a large number of advocacy organisations but we do provide a small amount of funding to TENI to support the work of Ms Lacey because we see this particular community benefits hugely from the informed support someone such as Ms Lacey can bring, which is far ahead of what many of our staff could bring to members of the community.  It creates a bridge between the community and the services which, as we start to develop them on more competitive basis, is critical.  This is why we provide funding for the post.</p><p>  Ms Lacey asked about laser therapy and voice therapy.  It is easy not to take such therapies seriously.  Ms Lacey can explain much more eloquently how critical such services are to making a successful transition.  I understand we do not fund these therapies at present and they may be the victim of a sense they are purely cosmetic.  I certainly understand this is not the case and it will be part of what we must examine in developing an agreed treatment pathway.</p></speech>

With regard to the survey which showed 90% of service providers have not had specific training, for which group in the health care sector does Ms Lacey believe training should be prioritised?  Will Dr. Crowley tell the committee what is the programme for the next one to two years in terms of the provision of training?  According to the survey, 74% of people indicated they wanted training.  Is there a planned approach on this and when is it likely to be rolled out?  Which sector needs to be prioritised to ensure those dealing with this issue have the required training and skills?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.544" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013070400010#J00400"><p>I am constantly reminded when I sit in this room of how privileged I am to be a member of the committee.  I have repeated this a number of times but it is a fact.  We sit here as public representatives but when we leave this room many of the groups which have made presentations to us have left an impression.</p><p>  I need to make many notes because I have a head like a sieve.  Ms Lacey and the other witnesses are welcome.  I found Ms Lacey's words moving and uplifting.  Knowing who one is inside is very important, no matter what one looks like on the outside, and this is something everyone can learn.  I am sure the witnesses are aware that at present the committee is discussing the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill.  The section on suicidal tendency has openly divided members of my party and others in various groups.  Listening to the presentation I was struck to hear 78% of the community have considered suicide because they feel different.  This is an enormous figure and I was very disturbed to hear it.</p><p>  The Chairman does not like me telling stories because he thinks I go on too long but I will keep this short and sweet.  I grew up in a large family and I was a girl in the middle of boys.  I was the tomboy on the road because I did not look for a doll or a pram but played cowboys and Indians and football out the back.  I am still identified by many local people as a tomboy because I wear trousers and have short hair.  For whatever reason I met a lovely boy who became a lovely man and who is now my husband.  I have a handsome son and four lovely girls.  When I meet people who are different, whether it is how they dress or look, I am reminded that inside of them there is a deep sense that who one is is who one is.</p><p>  I visit various schools to speak to transition year students and I am amazed at the questions they throw at me about who they are and where they are going.  I always state that being oneself is probably the most important thing any of us can be.  I have great hope in the young people of the country.  They are open and non-judgmental about the colour of one's skin or how one speaks or looks.</p><p>  Ireland is in for a huge change in the coming years.  It will be a different and better Ireland.  We have started this change.  We can see the difference that pupils from other countries make in a school.  When I was growing up one looked at an atlas to see where Africa is, but now pupils sit beside somebody from Africa or elsewhere.</p> <p>There is great hope, particularly given our young people.  Sometimes we see them negatively but, from my experience in the community and of giving talks at schools, the situation is different.  There is nothing wrong with being different.  Whether we believe in the man above or not, we were all different when we were created.  He broke the mould after every one of us.  It is important that we each have our own identity.</p><p> I will not comment on what our guests have requested, as I have heard it from everyone.  I am interested in reading poetry and books, although I am not an intellectual who sits with a book every night of the week.  Usually, I leave here for home very late and read the first two pages, and my husband takes my glasses off in bed.</p></speech>

The Chairman will embarrass me, and I am not easily embarrassed.  I hope my husband is not watching this.</p><p>  I will conclude on a quote that sums up what our guests have been saying: "In the Violet Room, she closed the door, And when I came out, He was no more."

To be honest, it is not a subject about which I am well informed.  As other members have stated, we are lucky that various groups appear before the committee and give us the information that we need.  Since many of the questions that I was going to ask have been covered, I may make a few points instead of asking questions.</p><p>  The suicide statistics are frightening.  I cannot believe that 40% have attempted suicide and that 78% have had suicidal tendencies.  This was an eye-opener.  I have never given much thought to when children identify.  The two to five years age group was mentioned.  I am shocked.  I would have expected it to be in the teens.  A point was made about what families must deal with, including trying to keep their children alive until they reach 16 years of age.  This is new and frightening information to me.</p><p>  I noticed that 74% would like to be trained.  Are there plans to roll this out?  It was mentioned that the cost was covered for public patients, but who covers the cost to those who do not have medical cards?  Perhaps I missed it.</p><p>  Transphobia remains a serious issue.  Will our guests outline how they challenge it, seek to reduce it and, hopefully, eliminate it in their work?</p><p>  It was stated that, as hormone treatment had presented positive outcomes, an increased availability would be welcome.  Are there plans to increase its provision?</p></speech>

I missed a little of Ms Lacey's part.  This week, the select committee is debating the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013.  There seem to be such absolutes in Ireland.  One is absolutely male, absolutely female or absolutely pregnant and would never think of suicide.  I thank our guests for shining a light into Ireland's dark corners and for demystifying what is happening.</p><p>  I am conscious that young people watching this meeting may be wondering where they will go.  What simple advice would Ms Lacey and the others give to these young people, to any mother, father or relation who is worried or even to older people?</p><p>  The network provides a pack.  I have looked through the booklets - they are good and informative and tell the stories of different people.  They are definitely worth reading.  I would appreciate it if our guests could offer that advice.</p></speech>

I wish to make a point and ask a question.  In Irish health care, there is a strange intersection of publicly funded institutions that are privately owned and accountable to entities that are not appointed by the public.  This is a long way of saying that we have many hospitals that are run by the religious.  Is there any indication of systematic discrimination against the needs of trans people by hospitals?  I note that the institution where most of the trans-related endocrinology takes place is St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown, which is staffed by fine people but would not be considered a national centre for anything.  I am not saying this disparagingly.  My colleagues from St. Vincent's provide the consultant care there and it is a regional hospital that, for historical reasons, provides some of the overflow services for endocrinology and obesity work, which cannot be done at St. Vincent's.  Are the main university hospitals stepping up to the plate and doing what needs to be done or is any of them systematically saying "No".</p><p>  With reference to the point on endocrinologists not answering the issue, our guests might take that matter up with Dr. Crowley and ask why the HSE and the Department of Health have conspired over the years to give us the smallest number of specialists in every speciality of any country in the OECD, typically running at figures that are approximately 70% of the UK's figures, which in turn are approximately one third of the continental figures, giving us a figure of one in five of the recommended number by international standards.</p></speech>

They depicted a terrific picture of collaboration and partnership, as Dr. Crowley indicated in some of his comments.  As a lawmaker, such a progressive partnership and collaboration is heartening and gives me hope as to the development of this area for transgender people.</p><p>  I wish to ask Ms Lacey a couple of questions.  As many of my colleagues indicated, she spoke movingly about her experience.  Will she share a little bit more?  She stated that she was not recognised in law as an Irish woman.  If she was, and when she will be, as it will come, how would it make a difference to her family?</p><p>  Ms Lacey provided the estimate of 1% of people being transgender and stated that 160 people presented at St. Columcille's Hospital and that 80 young people's families had contacted her.  When we enact law for the recognition of transgender people to their preferred identities, will this percentage increase?</p><p>  How Dr. Crowley outlined his presentation in terms of treatment pathways, the legal issues and the information and awareness training being provided to staff was brilliant.  My question on a timeframe for the process is virtually the same as Senator Burke's.  The HSE made submissions to the Gender Recognition Advisory Group, GRAG, but some of Dr. Crowley's comments about what we need in terms of law seem to have moved beyond its report's recommendations.  That report is two years old.</p><p>  I have commended Sinn F&eacute;in on its Bill publicly and via media statements.  I have also discussed my Bill.  It is critical that lawmakers have two different approaches.  It is important that we act.  Legislation could be initiated in both Houses.  Dr. Foy was mentioned.  It is in respect of her case that Ireland continues to be in breach of international human rights law six years later.</p> <p>I do not know if members are aware but Dr. Foy has initiated new proceedings because Ireland has not acted when found to be in breach and six years have passed.  It is critical that we act.</p></speech>

It is appropriate we salute Dr. Lydia Foy for the campaigning work she has done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.554" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Vanessa Lacey" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013070400012#L00300"><p>I refer to generationality.  Senator van Turnhout mentioned older people.  We work with people as young as 82 years of age to children as old as six years of age.  They all experience very different things.  We have an ageing community.  We are all getting older but, I suppose, it is great to get old because at least we are alive.  Older people, many of whom have lost their families, are getting old, they are going into institutions and they will be alone.  We need a service there.  That is something which, I suppose, has been overlooked.  We need to think seriously about providing a service to older transgender people, as they get older.  Younger people being supported by their families will have had a different experience, as will those in the middle and the children of transgender people.  We need to take a holistic approach.  TransParenCI is totally under-resourced, which is an issue.  TENI supports that organisation.</p><p>  I refer to Senator Colm Burke's question on whose priority it is.  I think it is across the board.  One would think endocrinology and mental health care are a priority but I think it is across the board to social care and so on.  I gave a full day's training to Youth Work Ireland on Friday.  It was very interesting and a great training day.  Again, it is a priority.  All of these things are a priority.  This will go on for years because training was not provided before but now it is and I thank Dr. Crowley and the team for that.</p><p>  I thank Senator Zappone for sharing that.  I always say to my 13 year old and to my 17 year old, who has just done his leaving certificate, that education is the key.  I gave presentations to fourth, fifth and sixth years in Newpark Comprehensive, Blackrock, which is probably the best school in Ireland.  Walking into the room is a terrifying experience because I am a 6 ft. 3 in. transgender woman and I suppose that is very intimidating.  I normally bring in loads of sweets to soften people before I start.  However, I am conscious that there could be some negativity but I have to say that of hundreds of students, the feedback was amazing.  They were like bunny rabbits sitting in the seats and lapping it all up.  I got e-mails afterwards commending the training and the experience.  This is the way forward.  Again, one is just speaking about a difference.  It is a very positive thing but one needs to get into the schools to educate the next generation.  I love this generation because I have two inspirations at that level, namely, my own two kids.  That is key. </p><p>  I refer to transphobia.  It comes back to Senator Zappone's contribution.  I do not want to keep going on about it but education is the key.  Positive media work is important and it has been happening in Ireland.  Ireland has been very successful because we have a population of less than 5 million, so it is easy to educate it.  We are at a really good point here.  By looking at a holistic service, health care and legislation, we can nail transphobia in the schools.  We can do it really simply.  It is very positive in that respect, living in this wonderful country.  I love this country so much.  That is the way to go forward.  Educating about difference will get rid of transphobia.</p><p>  I refer to the work I do with Waterford Integration Forum.  Marginalised communities come together to educate each other and society.  We are all diverse, we are human beings, so it is natural. </p><p>  In response to Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, I mentioned younger and older people.  People have different experiences.  I would tell people to contact us to see if we can help them.  We are limited by resources.  We have two full-time employees and one part-time employee and at times, it is difficult to get to everyone, as the rates are rising.  I hope we get more money in the future but that is another issue, although maybe it is the issue. </p><p>  Senator Crown referred to discrimination in hospitals.  There have been cases of discrimination.</p></speech>

I would be able to change my documentation and, to go back to the talk I gave in the Council of Europe a few weeks ago, be legally recognised as an Irish woman.  I had my grandfather's medal from 1921.  I am quite proud to be an Irish woman and I would like to be respected as part of Irish society, which would feed down to my kids who are extremely proud of me.  I am proud of them also.  We must have legislation because I want to be part of this society.  At the moment, I do not feel quite part of it but I am hopeful this country will do the right thing.  I am sure members will do the right thing.  If they do, I will bring in some of the sweets I gave to the fourth, fifth and sixth years.</p></speech>

As it stands and of the estimated 1%, many of those individuals experience gender variance.  Not all of those individuals will pursue medical treatments or would want to be recognised.  However, the issue of recognition is not just about changing one's documents.  That is a very practical side of it and has real effects on real people's lives, but it is also very much about the State recognising transgender people exist in society.  That is a significant component of it as well.  It is not an abstract idea.  Transgender people exist but they are often invisible.  Many people will say to me that they have never met a transgender person, which may or may not be true.  I am transgender and most people would never read me as transgender because I am not visibly transgender.  People may know more transgender people than they think they do.</p><p>  Recognition is about documents but it is also about the State seeing one and making the invisible visible and about acknowledging that transgender people pay taxes, go to school and have jobs.  When one has recognition, people will be less scared of coming out, less scared of telling their families, less scared of losing their jobs and less scared of all these barriers which prevent people from being able to be who they really are.</p><p>  By moving this forward in a progressive and inclusive way, it will bring people out of the shadows.</p> <p>I do not know if the numbers increase but visibility and the number of positive experiences will.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-04a.572" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Phillip Crowley" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013070400013#M00200"><p>I will answer the questions directed at me.  There are two aspects to training.  One type of training we will require is training a wider cohort professionals to provide expert care.  That will evolve from the pathway of care process.  If we identify other centres where particular services will be provided, personnel should be peer trained from existing centres and perhaps peer supported for a period of time.  In creating access we do not want to diminish quality. </p><p>  The second aspect of training which is very important is awareness raising, which is an important first step.  I would prioritise general practice in terms of awareness raising, training and articles in the forum journal, and we can help to ensure that happens.  </p><p>  There are other priority groups.  For example, allied health professionals have key roles.  It is an area in which there are a couple of pioneers who are seeking to provide care, which is very centralised, and perhaps through them we can work with colleagues to provide a more accessible service.  Administration staff need to be trained in records, which are important and this links to the points made by Mr. Biambrone and Ms Lacey.  It is another area we need to prioritise. </p><p>  In regard to medical cards, I understand people can still access services.  The real issue is that people with funding can bypass services by accessing them elsewhere but waiting lists remain.  That brings me to Senator Crown's question.  I am very disappointed he is not present to hear the answer.  He highlighted Loughlinstown Hospital as being the centre for the endocrinology service.  That happened by chance because we have a very well qualified specialist who has had access to training.  He could be working in any hospital, but perhaps not that to which the Senator referred.  I would be very interested to hear what hospital that is.  He may be able to tell me outside of the committee.  I commend it for the service delivers and would not denigrate it because it is not a university hospital.  </p><p>  In regard to some of the questions on partnership, the directorate I lead is entirely committed to partnership with communities, families and patients.  Throughout my career I have sought to create those types of partnerships.  I do not believe that with what is coming down the track in regard to what is right, wrong and ethical, we should just deliver care to people.  Rather, we should deliver it in partnership with people. </p><p>  A very capable organisation like TENI is an obvious partnership for us because we are, relatively speaking, clueless in regard to the issues.  If we think we are not then we are in trouble.  The first step of awareness is understanding what one does not know.  That has been very educational for us and is a partnership I hope will thrive, notwithstanding the pressures on us all in our different roles and the need for TENI to be independent advocates, which they will continue to be.  We will still, it is to be hoped, have a space where we can work in partnership with it and commit to doing that.  I have addressed all the questions directed to me.</p></speech>
