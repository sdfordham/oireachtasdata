As the Chairman has said, I am accompanied by Mr. Cormac Healy, senior director of Meat Industry Ireland, MII.  The committee has already received a detailed submission from MII setting out our thoughts on climate change in the context of our agriculture sector but also highlighting the significant contribution that the meat industry makes to the Irish economy and to the rural economy in particular, as well as the opportunities for growth in meat exports that we believe can be achieved in a sustainable manner as part of the wider agrifood targets and objectives set out in Food Wise 2025.</p> <p>  MII is the business association in IBEC that represents the meat processing sector.  The meat sector, which includes beef, pigmeat, sheepmeat and poultry from farm through to processing and export is one of the most important indigenous industries in the national economy.  In 2017, it generated &euro;3.95 billion in exports and it provides direct employment to approximately 15,000 people, as well as indirect jobs in associated service industries.  In particular, the sector supports more than 120,000 farmers throughout Ireland.  It has a major impact on regional economy spend and rural economic activity.  In many of the rural areas where processing facilities operate, the meat plant is often the largest local employer.  Rural towns such as Bunclody, Edenderry, Bandon, Athleague or Shercock, among many others, do not benefit significantly from foreign direct investment and therefore are heavily dependent on these meat processing facilities and the employment and services demand generated by them.</p> <p>  Meat production and processing has a long tradition in Ireland and it is the most important indigenous sector when account is taken not only of output value but also of its regional spread, as well as the number of farmers involved in livestock rearing for meat production.  The sector has made significant progress towards achieving Harvest 2020 goals and the potential exists to further scale up the industry to generate increased exports, rural economic activity and job creation in the regions in the coming years.  Export values have grown by 60% over the past five years and Irish meat is exported to more than 50 countries worldwide.  Under Food Wise 2025, the meat sector has ambitious plans to sustainably grow annual exports by an additional &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022000002#G00300"><p>I apologise.  A significant proportion of this growth is linked to expansion in the dairy sector, which is already well under way.  These growth plans exist in the context of global demand for protein arising from forecasted population growth, expanding middle class communities, increased urbanisation and shifting dietary preferences.  The growth in global food demand and Ireland&rsquo;s potential to contribute significantly to global food security is accompanied by the competing challenge of climate change.  By 2050, the global population is expected to reach 9.8 billion and the planet will need to produce 70% more food while conserving available land, water and energy resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Whether through Ireland&rsquo;s grass-based production systems for beef and lamb or our superior production efficiencies in pig and poultry, Ireland should be seen as a source of sustainable food supply to global markets.  While recognising that we need to continue to work to reduce the environmental impact of our agrifood production systems, Irish meat production has strong environmental credentials and is among the lowest in greenhouse gas intensity per kilogram of output in Europe and globally.  Curtailing meat production in regions of the world that are eco-efficient producers, allowing for expansion in less environmentally efficient areas, simply leads to carbon leakage and does little for the global challenge of climate change.  Meat Industry Ireland members fully accept the challenge of climate change and the need for increased action to minimise the impact of meat production on natural resources.  We also accept the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to protect our natural environment for future generations.</p> <p>  Agriculture has always been a critical component of the Irish economy and given the lack of heavy industry within Ireland, it represents a significant portion of the overall emissions from the economy, which accounted for 19.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2016.</p><p>That represents 32% of total greenhouse gas emissions in the economy.  In contrast, agriculture in the UK, with more than double our emissions level, only represents 8% of its overall emissions.  Nonetheless, the meat sector continues to work collaboratively with the State and its agencies to minimise this impact and to reduce emissions, while at the same time sustainably growing our food exports.  Although the sector has expanded between 1990 and 2016, it should be noted that emissions from the sector reduced by 3.5% during this period.  In the same period, overall national emission levels rose by 10.4%.  This serves to highlight the successful efforts being made by the agrifood sector to reduce emissions and grow sustainably.</p><p> While accepting the serious nature of the climate change challenge, it is important to stress that progress is being made by the agrifood sector.  Important initiatives aimed at further reducing agriculture's impact on the environment are already under way.  However, we must realise that the mitigation potential of agriculture and food production is limited compared with other sectors of the economy, as agriculture emissions arise largely from biological processes.  The livestock and meat sector will continue to focus on sustainable intensification, driving increased efficiency and improved productivity, better grassland management and reduced inputs per unit of output.  Ireland's grass-based systems give us a unique advantage in the production of beef and lamb.  It should also be recognised that the Irish pig and poultry systems are among the most efficient in Europe and are making significant strides in emissions reduction.</p><p> A key initiative on the beef side has been the introduction of the beef data and genomics programme, which is targeting improvement in key productivity parameters such as age at slaughter, calving interval, age at first calving and so forth in order to lower the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions and to deliver dividends in the economic performance of beef enterprises for farmers.  While the scheme has only been in place for a short number of years, ICBF data already demonstrate the progress made on these productivity criteria and the benefits accruing in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  In terms of carbon footprint Ireland is one of the most efficient beef producers in Europe and work is actively under way to make further improvements in this area.  The Bord Bia quality assurance schemes now include a significant carbon footprint element which accumulates a range of information used to generate a carbon footprint for individual farms.  This information can be used to help producers identify areas within the farm where efficiencies can be made.  Ultimately these efficiencies, once adopted, have positive impacts on farm level carbon footprint and on the bottom line for farmers in terms of profitability.</p><p> Meat processors have been involved in a range of initiatives, at both production and processing levels, aimed at improving efficiencies and animal performance, delivering sustainable intensification and minimising emissions from the sector.  These initiatives include using demonstration farms to highlight to the wider farming community the benefits of particular types of production systems and improved management practices aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving margin at farm level.  MII also provides support for the Teagasc BETTER Farm Beef Programme, whereby processors have provided financial support and expertise to these groups.  A key element in these better farms is a focus on grassland management, breeding and production methods, all of which are important to maximise efficiency.  In addition to processor involvement in the BETTER Farm Beef Programme, some individual processors have established their own demonstration and research farms to develop production and finishing systems either for suckler beef or dairy beef which deliver what the market is looking for while maximising best practice in breeding, feeding, grassland management and animal health for dissemination to farmers generally.  I was glad the committee visited one of these processor farms in the latter part of last year.  The invitation to visit another one is open to the committee at any time it might wish to avail of it during its busy schedule.  We would be happy to arrange it if that would be helpful.</p><p> MII is working closely with Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to establish a soil carbon sequestration project in order to demonstrate the potential of the soil carbon sink in Irish grassland and look at best practice to optimise carbon sequestration.  Soil carbon sequestration is an important element of sustainable agricultural practices.</p><p>It will help to reduce the net greenhouse gas emissions at farm level and will help to increase soil productivity, increase water retention and reduce flood water run-off.  The aim of the project is to develop greenhouse gas reduction blueprints for different farm types and foster greater integration between research, policy, producers and processors to maximise on-the-ground efforts to maximise carbon sequestration.</p><p> Healthy animals will ultimately perform and thrive better than animals which are sub-optimal.  A key aspect of emissions is age at slaughter.  By reducing this over time, the sector can make significant improvements in terms of emissions from the animal sector.</p><p> Animal Health Ireland plays a crucial role in maintaining and improving the national herd health status in Ireland.  Since 2015, Meat Industry Ireland beef processing members have been providing significant financial support to Animal Health Ireland to run a specific programme, Beef HealthCheck.  This programme aims to improve the  health of the cattle herd by providing postmortem feedback to producers on lungs and livers harvested from the cattle.  Detailed reports are provided to farmers allowing them, together with their veterinary practitioner, to identify appropriate interventions and practices which can help to improve animal health within their herd.</p><p> Together with Enterprise Ireland, Meat Industry Ireland has established the meat technology centre last year as an industry-led initiative which will build a strategic research and innovation base in beef and sheepmeat processing.  Among the six pillars of research within the centre, there is a specific focus on genomics, with close co-operation between the centre, Teagasc and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation.  This is aimed at improving the genetic make-up of the national beef herd.  The centre has already shown the potential for genetics to reduce age at slaughter, which is a key factor in the control of emissions.  Another work stream within Meat Technology Ireland is meat safety, incorporating packaging with the primary aim of developing new processes and products to maximise the shelf life of Irish beef and lamb and, ultimately, to reduce waste.  This is most relevant when considering that approximately one third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted.</p><p> Within the pig meat sector, processors are working closely with Teagasc and University College Dublin to support various projects aimed at improving the health of the national pig herd, reducing the need for antibiotic usage at various stages of the pig life cycle and, ultimately, improving the efficiency of the national pig herd, thereby reducing emissions from the sector.</p><p> Meat processors are participating in Origin Green in which measurable sustainability targets are set against a baseline for continuous improvement.  A detailed sustainability plan is developed by each company and independently audited each year to ensure companies are making progress towards reaching their goals.  </p><p> As we continue to improve the sustainability and carbon footprint of our operations across the beef sector, we believe that continued support is needed for the beef data and genomics programme to maximise its coverage of the national suckler herd, to ensure it delivers on the real potential of breeding technology and to improve productivity and reduce emissions per kilogram of output.  Major progress can be made on calving interval, age at first calving and overall livestock productivity.  All of these will greatly enhance environmental and economic sustainability.</p><p> A relatively small reduction in the average age of slaughter would have significant benefits in terms of reduced emissions from the national herd.  Further productivity in the beef sector is possible through the use of sexed semen.  This has the potential to optimise dairy replacement heifer numbers while also enabling more usage of beef sires in the dairy herd offspring, thereby improving overall productivity.</p><p> The pig industry stakeholder group chaired by the Department in 2016 recommended that a substantial investment programme be introduced for pig enterprises.  As productivity in the pig sector continues to increase, additional housing capacity is needed to optimise pig health and welfare.  Improving housing standards will allow for increased energy efficiency by modernising lighting, ventilation, insulation and flooring.</p><p>Ultimately, this would have a positive impact on pig health and reduce emissions per kilogram of meat output.  </p><p> A fuller range of initiatives is open to the sector.  With appropriate support at Government level, collectively it could make further significant inroads towards minimising the impact of the agrifood sector on climate change.  These include the installation of renewable energy facilities as well as anaerobic digestion at farm and processing level.  Enhanced farm advisory services aimed at improving overall productivity, and therefore reduced emissions intensity, is a key requirement.  We need to promote the use of the carbon navigator to identify potential emissions reductions and financial gains through better management practices.  Knowledge transfer will play an important role in maximising on-farm efficiencies both for land and grass management, encouraging farmers to adapt appropriate management practices.</p><p> Post-2020, it is clear the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, will have a strong environmental focus.  Properly structured, this can help agriculture contribute to climate change mitigation.  However, to be effective, the future CAP must be fully resourced financially and needs to be focused on supporting active producers.  The proposed direction of CAP post-2020, where the overall principles or objectives will be set at EU level but member states will draw up their own CAP strategic plan for implementation, could assist in determining which measures best suit local conditions.  The Pillar 2 rural development programme must maintain a strong budget.  It covers support for important schemes such as the beef genomics, on-farm investments through the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  All of these schemes contribute greatly to improved environmental performance of the sector.</p><p>  I outlined a range of measures in which Meat Industry Ireland member companies are already engaged.  As an industry with an extensive and leading role in the agrifood business and the largest net exporter of beef in the EU, we recognise and accept fully we must and will do more to ensure the production and processing of meat products will continue to be conducted in the most sustainable manner possible.  We know a significant increase in meat production cannot be considered in isolation from its environmental impact.  That is why we are already committed to the range of actions outlined here.  It is why we continue to explore other avenues where, together with Government and key stakeholders, we can intensify work towards an improved and sustainable environment for all.</p><p> Our credentials as the fifth most carbon efficient beef producer in Europe demonstrates we are on the right course better than anything.  We do, though, have further to travel.  We fully subscribe to the Food Wise 2025 objective that, as the food sector continues to develop and grow, development must be undertaken within a framework of sustainability.  Equally, it must be acknowledged that the mitigation potential of agriculture and food production is limited compared to other economic sectors.  Because agriculture is so strategic to the Irish economy and does not have the heavy industry counterweight other countries have, its greenhouse gas emissions are statistically disproportionately higher than countries where agriculture emissions are nominally much higher but represent a much lower proportion of total emissions.  Nonetheless, agriculture emissions have reduced by 3.5% in the period up to 2016 compared to a rise of 10.4% in national emissions.  That tells its own story.   </p><p> Ireland has a number of natural advantages, including a temperate climate favouring a grass-based livestock production system that is far more efficient than intensive feed systems practised elsewhere.  Curtailing output here while output increases in less carbon efficient areas of the world would be contrary to the global objective of mitigating climate change.  It is the wrong solution to a global problem.  I have not touched on trade agreements, in particular Mercosur.  We might return to that during the course of our conversation later.  Overall, as an industry, MII will continue to grow the sector responsibly and sustainably.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Clive Carter" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022000002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.</p><p>The aim of this presentation is to highlight the positive contribution of the Irish arable sector to the Irish economy, ecology, climate change and environment and recognising the current and future potential of the sector, having a positive stimulus to the environment and also reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  This document will discuss key areas of the industry and propose more mitigation measures to be implemented to provide a long-term sustainable arable sector contributing positively to the overall carbon footprint of Irish agriculture in an environmentally positive way, while continuing to make a significant input to the Irish economy.</p><p> The role of the arable sector was virtually ignored in Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025.  These omissions in Food Harvest 2020 prompted the launch of the Tillage Sector Development Plan 2012, yet the tillage sector was burdened with most of the mandatory greening requirements and production altering changes in the most recent review of CAP, such as the three crop rule, ecological focus areas, EFAs, buffer strips, etc.  The arable sector should not be targeted and used as a future scapegoat for climate change, which happened previously, to allow for a further increase in beef and dairy, as happened in the past.  The challenge for all in our country is to reduce carbon emissions from food production, energy use, transport and manufacturing while continuing to maintain fully traceable indigenous food output, retaining employment while maintaining a positive environmental impact.</p><p> The EPA published a report in 2016, which stated that agriculture accounted for 33% of all carbon emissions in Ireland, while transport was 19.8% and energy was 19.7%.  Emissions from cattle alone accounted for 14% of carbon emission.  This figure is not a true reflection of Irish agricultural emissions, as Ireland is not as industrialised as other countries in western Europe and agriculture accounts for a higher proportion of industry.  Ireland is likely to miss its targets for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for 2020, according to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  This will result in a cost to the State in the region of &euro;120 million for every 1% above the mandatory figures agreed in the Paris Climate Change Agreement, COP21.  Some are predicting that we could be 20% above our target by 2020.  The time to act is now and not bury our heads.  There needs to be a clear policy roadmap, helping to deliver a reduction in carbon emissions and any potential fines, alongside creating sustainable renewable energy, jobs, food, revenue and adding positively to the overall wealth of the country, its environmental upkeep and diversity for years to come.</p><p> Irish arable farming can tackle greenhouse gas emissions head on, while maintaining output of food, employment along with broader environmental and economic benefits for the country through increased output; reduction in food miles and added value; multi-use crops for food and energy, such as cereals, proteins, sugar beet and oilseed rape; better land management, including more organic fertiliser and precision agricultural technology; improved greening, environmental and ecological benefits; collaboration of farmers with other sectors; and the traceability and indigenous supply.</p><p> A key area where Irish arable farming has an advantage over imported food produce is the reduction of food miles.  Our grains are produced locally, giving local employment, whereas imported grain do not.  Imported grain has crossed thousands of miles via rail, road, air and sea to arrive at a port and then to be transported by rail or road to a processing plant, a few miles away from a local farm that is perfectly able to produce a similar if not better grain.  We currently import &euro;450 million worth of sugar and Bord Bia has said that approximately 60% of the feed and meal fed to Irish cows, beef, pigs, etc., is imported of which 70% is from genetically modified organism, GMO, origin.</p><p> Due to our traceability standards, encouragement is needed to produce premium markets and crops such as malt barley and gluten free oats.  These crops, grown locally, add value to the economy and provide extra jobs and revenue to the country.  One hectare of malt barley can produce over &euro;100,000 in revenue to the country, based on revenue figures.  It is important that these crops are protected and encouraged.</p><p> As stated, Ireland is going to miss its targets for renewable energy and will face a likely fine of millions.  This money could be better spent developing a sector that has the potential to bring down emissions, create jobs and create a high value domestic export driven product.  We would like to see research into this area to quantify the potential long-term benefits of tillage farming for carbon sequestration, managing waste, and positive environmental impact.</p><p> According to Bord Bia, the beverage industry exports in 2016 were &euro;1.5 billion of which &euro;500 million was whiskey.  Whiskey exports are set to triple by 2030.</p><p>Beverage exports could well pass out beef exports by that time.  Currently, only 1% of land in the country is used to grow malt barley.  What if rather than growing carbon positive crops to mitigate against the growing cow numbers, they could be used to mitigate the carbon emissions in the production of beer or whiskey?  Just a thought, but imagine the marketing power of a GM free, fully Irish, carbon neutral beer or whiskey?  However, farmers would have to be paid accordingly for such a product.</p><p> Recently, the Citizens' Assembly recommended a carbon tax on agriculture.  If a farmer is deemed to be carbon positive, should they get a tax credit using the potential of carbon positive crops?</p><p> The production of protein crops, such as beans, peas and lupins, lead to several positive resource and environmental effects as well as being a very high protein crop for animal feed.  Proteins also have a nitrogen fixing capacity reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertiliser.  Reduction in disease levels and improvement in soil properties, such as organic matter and structure, cause an increase in subsequent cereal crop and reduction in carbon dioxide emissions due to reduction in fertiliser use.  A protein crop when growing releases five to seven times less greenhouse gas emissions per unit compared to some other crops.  Across Europe there is a big interest in producing home grown GM free proteins, particularly for animal feed, and the production of Irish proteins mitigates against both carbon emissions and protein.</p><p> Recently, it was realised that the EU needs to reduce its 95% deficiency in soya as it imports 95% of its soya requirements.  This is a massive volume that could be produced locally.  The current protein payment should be maintained and expanded on.  It has been a success story of the previous few years.  Millers that previously found it difficult to include beans in rations are now investing in technology and methods to handle them, realising their potential.  We should be aiming to be exporting food grade beans and peas in the coming years, plus there is a big demand globally for proteins.</p><p> Food production should not suffer in order to produce renewable energy.  There is scope to produce energy from by-products and first generation biofuels where the by-product from that process can then be used for animal feed, such as wheat and sugar beet for ethanol.  Oilseed rape is a multi-use crop which can be used for food, that is, cooking oil; energy, that is, biofuel; and animal feed.  Oilseed rape also contributes positively to the bee population during its flowering period, contributing to the local ecology.  Sugar beet is also a multi-use crop for food, that is, sugar; and, energy, that is, ethanol and anaerobic digestion, which releases biogas.  The beet pulp from the process is a high protein animal feed.  Sugar beet is also one of the best filters of greenhouse gas emissions during its long growing season, which could be up to a year, in some cases.</p><p> We listed transport in our introduction as being the second highest in carbon emissions, with 19.8%, behind agriculture.  Agriculture can help reduce our transport emissions by developing a strategic policy on renewable energy as stated already.  Biofuel from first generation crops and on-farm anaerobic digestion from slurry, food waste and organic manures, etc., can produce biogas which can also be used in our transport sector.  On-farm anaerobic digestion plants and research and investment is required as is a specific rural development policy like the policy in the UK and Northern Ireland.</p><p> Investment in technology has consistently found solutions to problems, particularly in agriculture.  From mechanisation, plant breeding and chemistry, we have seen yields rise dramatically over the last few decades helping to feed an expanding global population.  More recent developments in global positioning system, GPS, and precision farming have been able to reduce input use by up to 10% in some cases.  Urea is a cheap source of nitrogen for farmers, but can be less efficient in very dry conditions.  The development of protected urea enables farmers to capitalise on a cheaper source of nitrogen and prevents losses to the environment.  Having submitted this statement, I found out that according to Teagasc figures, protected urea is more stable in soil, lowers ammonia emissions by 84% and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 73%.  A few farmers are trialling chemical nitrogen, applied in a liquid form, on growing crops for better foliage uptake.</p><p> The arable sector carried the can on most changes in the most recent CAP, such as the two and three crop rule; ecological focus areas, EFAs; buffer strips; and cover crops.  While some of the measures can have a positive impact on farms, the enforcement rather than encouragement of these measures has resulted in many smaller producers opting out of the arable sector and, ironically, going into mono crop production - grass.</p><p>Arable land is a haven for birds and wildlife during the hungry winter months alongside being a habitat for smaller mammals.  Most bird watchers are keen for an increase in arable area.  Commercial beekeepers are establishing working relationships with tillage farmers which are beneficial to both parties and the environment.  A vibrant tillage sector which has a diversified cropping plan including beans, peas, oilseed rape and cover crops is key to keeping and expanding the bee populations.  This is encouraged by varying times of flowering of different crops prolonging the production season and creating food reserves for bees over the winter months.  Mono-cropped grass, even with white clover in the mix, does not provide food for bees.  The wild bird cover measure in GLAS has been beneficial in providing diversity in intensively managed grassland but we would like to see that broadened to include a bee and insect cover as an alternative for GLAS members on 100% grassland and to include wild flowers or later flowering crops.  The greening measures adopted in the previous CAP reform have been implemented very well for most of tillage farms.  Under the new CAP negotiations and simplification, we would encourage no changes to the greening requirements for tillage farmers, apart from a greater flexibility on the ground for growers and a ring-fenced and higher budget for farmers for adopting these measures.  The entire tillage area should be ring-fenced and encouraged to expand by investment in new technologies, markets and crops.</p><p> We propose the following recommendations for implementation: a linked Irish food and renewable energy roadmap; a focus on the positive environmental aspects of Irish arable farming; an aim to increase the arable area and the variety of crops; the encouragement rather than enforcement of environmental measures; the prevention of further penalisation and scapegoating of the Irish arable sector; a review of REFIT to encourage local community energy production; the development of end use markets for renewables; no reduction in the biofuel inclusion rate across Europe; the recognition of quality assurance and traceability; co-operation between farmers, industry and Government on food and energy matters; and a rural development plan that encourages long-term jobs, transport and energy for communities.</p><p> Many Irish arable farmers are afraid of what is coming down the line for them in the future regarding COP21 and the next CAP review.  No other agriculture sector has seen as many enforced measures recently and every effort must be made to review that policy and encourage small and medium growers to produce sustainably and efficiently which will benefit the entire environment of Ireland.  Arable farmers are connected to the environment and the soil, they depend on them for their living.  We are constantly trying to improve both for the future.  The acres devoted to tillage are on a serious downhill slide, 14% fewer acres in the last five years alone, and 5.75% in the last year, one third of what it used to be before 1945.  The first port of call for this joint Oireachtas committee in relation to climate change is to stop the slide of the area under tillage.  Tillage farming is at worst carbon neutral and most likely carbon positive.  The more acres devoted to tillage the less of a problem we are creating as regards climate change.  We have solutions to climate change, the question is, are our Governments going to invest in them?</p><p> While watching RT&Eacute; news last night, the main topic was the critical volume of plastics in the ocean.  We may not have all the solutions for this but one might be the growing of more hemp.  It can be used to reduce and replace plastics in certain circumstances, alongside with bioplastics that are produced from sugar beet.  Crops have potentials in not just the food industry  but also in the pharmaceutical and energy industries.</p><p> Recently, at the national tillage conference in Kilkenny in January, a Teagasc chief economist acknowledged that the arable sector was number one for ticking all of the boxes in terms of the environment, climate change and ecology.  We are way ahead of all other sectors.  We are currently second in economic aspects but number one in environmental terms.  This must be quantified and acknowledged.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

We move on now to the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association.  I wish to acknowledge that the association was due to appear before our committee last week with the other farm organisations but because of change of times, it did not suit so we welcome the association today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bridget Murphy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022000002#N00300"><p>I am from the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association.  My colleague, Mr. Joe Condon, will also make a presentation.</p><p>The Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association is a farming organisation representing farmers producing quality livestock on the most demanding terrain and in the most harsh weather conditions on this island.  The evidence supporting this is the supplying of tens of thousands of lambs as stores into factories and the setting up of producer groups in targeting this specialist sector through protected geographical indicators, PGI, statuses.  We supply of thousands of weanlings to market each year and in doing so support more than 25 livestock mart co-ops and public and private services.  We are the bread and butter for our towns and villages, what we earn is spent in the local community.  Overall sheep numbers in Ireland have been growing in recent years.  The annual census in December 2016 showed that there were 36,000 sheep flocks in Ireland and 3.9 million sheep.  Mountain and mountain cross sheep accounted for 44% of this figure.  There are two major problems in hill sheep farming.  One is economic and the other is environmental.</p><p> Global and local factors place us at a time of considerable uncertainty and change, however one thing is clear.  Economies and people cannot survive without an environment to support them.  Our need, as farmers and rural communities, for economic and social well-being is dependent on the well-being of the environment we inhabit.  We understand that ensuring healthy, thriving, connected ecosystems is critical to our survival.</p><p> Up on the hills and the marginal lands, we are experiencing the effects of climate change.  Our fields are constantly wet, often too wet to bring in hay or silage and too wet to leave the stock out on the land.  In certain areas, we housed cattle as early as August last year and are now facing a fodder crisis.  Slurry tanks are overflowing and the land is too wet to spread it out.  Flood and storm damage are now regular complaints.  Dry days for maintenance work on flocks or the land are few and far between.  We could go on.</p><p> The EPA in its 2016 report, Ireland&rsquo;s Environment &ndash; An Assessment, states that responding effectively to climate change is both urgent and long term.  Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to reduce vulnerability to the adverse impacts of climate change, while producing quality food to feed a growing global population, are the tasks ahead.  It is clear that both our sector and the State have urgent and pressing needs.  The job at hand is how we dovetail these needs to benefit all.</p><p> Past experience reveals that when the State has EU directive or compliance needs that can only be met by our lands, they meet them at our expense.  Most recent examples are the land designations in the form of special areas of conservation, SACs, and special protected areas, SPAs.  These designations are designed to help protect Europe&rsquo;s most valuable and threatened species and habitats - 600 sites over 14% of the country&rsquo;s land.  The State gets the best of Natura sites, and we get a list of 39 actions requiring consent.  These actions include the requirement of planning permission for fencing, costing some farmers in excess of &euro;4,000 for engineering fees and Natura impact studies.  Should a farmer wish to sell, they have to notify prospective buyers that the land is a designated site and this burden is added to their property folio?  The only outcome here is devaluation of property.  This situation is unacceptable.  We have called for a payment of &euro;150 per hectare per year to be paid to landowners with designated lands, a small price for Europe and the State to pay farmers to curtail their farming enterprises and to help protect these sites.</p><p> A few important points should be noted.  Our current income - our grants - is still based on livestock.  We are rewarded, or not, for stock numbers and land use practices from 20 years ago.  Although the basic payment scheme, BPS, does not require stocking densities, the areas of natural constraints, ANC, payments do, as do GLAS payments, if one entered it via commonages.  Any destocking or demise of the suckler herd will have a detrimental effect on those vital payments.  Going forward will require a fundamental change of values.  Our hill and Natura land is no longer worthless, unproductive and marginal.  It is of high nature value.  It provides many opportunities to meet critical eco-services and market commodities, for example: clean water; clean meat, with a low carbon footprint, reared on the best of mixed diets in a manner that manages grazing in the uplands ecosystems; carbon credits through sequestration of peatlands; low intensity permanent pasture or woodlands; renewable energy solutions; pollinator corridors; and biodiversity habitats among others.</p><p>These opportunities belong to the farming sector and they must be paid for.  Since the 1990s hill and Natura farmers have worked tirelessly to bring their farmland habitats to a favourable conservation status.  Blanket bog peatlands must be sustainably grazed to retain eligibility.  It is necessary that we stop playing the farm and environmental agenda against each other.  This issue is going to require everyone to work together.  It is time to find areas we can build on rather than pursue issues that divide us.  We are calling for a table of stakeholders - farmers, local community and business interests, and environmentalists among others - to be independently chaired, to start developing another vision for our rural future.</p><p> We would rather take a little time and plant quality forests and agro-forestry with long lasting benefits for all involved than chase after quick money at the expense of the farmer, the land and the rural areas.  Other options exist, ones which are better for us, our land, environment and communities.  We can also look to neighbours, for example, Scotland and Norway which face the same issues we do.  They are already implementing solutions with success.</p><p> It is time for the Government and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to start talking to farmers and rural communities, not to talk at us.  If they need us and our land to meet their needs or the needs of the day, especially issues relating to climate change challenges, food security, renewable energy commitments and carbon sequestration then they should talk to us.  They should not decide our future for us, especially when those decisions involve planting 470,000 ha of our country under Sitka spruce by 2050.</p><p> With those points guiding us, we submit the following: When examining the needs that determine the afforestation programme it becomes clear that there are other ways to meet those needs.  We believe that there are smarter ways to achieve our renewable energy commitments.  Solar power is an affordable and instant solution compared to, with luck, a 30-year crop of trees to burn.  We recommend that the Government pursues solar farms.  Many farmers would be more than willing to mix solar panels and livestock in the same field.  Wind farms are also an alternative.  However, communities need to be brought on board such projects and to benefit from them.</p><p> Trees are being grown to sequester carbon to meet our greenhouse gas, GHG, emission targets.  We acknowledge climate change as a side effect of global warming and we understand that we have to do what is needed to fix the problem.  That includes planting trees but that does not include planting Sitka spruce, especially on green bogs or peatland.  Peatland, wetland, forests and low intensive grassland farming sequester carbon.  Peatland and green bog in good condition can sequester four or more times the amount of carbon than spruce.  The most effective use of such land is thus to leave it as peat or bog land and pay the farmer for the sequestration services rendered.  The better condition the farmer keeps the ecosystem in, the higher the payment.</p><p> We call for an end to all monoculture plantations, especially those of the invasive species, Sitka spruce.  We call for clear felling to be banned and replaced with continuous cover practices.  For the majority of Irish timber exports, the UK is the only viable market and the uncertainty around the outcome of Brexit places considerable strain on this eggs-in-one-basket approach to the wood product sector.</p></speech>

Such measures would include the following.  The conservation of permanent pasture; the conservation of peatlands and wetlands; the maintenance and improvement of Natura and commonage farmland habitats; maintaining agriculture in areas with natural constraints; biodiversity-enhancing cattle grazing schemes, especially on the uplands where it is acknowledged that livestock manage the diverse plant life; a burning and land management scheme that reduces the risk of wildfires and their spread; no imposition of collective action clauses to gain access to schemes; and no collective agreement for commonage farmers to gain entry to any scheme.</p> <p>  Farmers need to be rewarded fairly for the delivery of ecosystem services as they relate to soil, water, biodiversity, air quality, climate action, and the provision of landscape amenities for the public good.</p><p>Where it can be demonstrated that farming systems or practices provide carbon sinks, the carbon credit should be owned by the farmer.  Measures for generational renewal should include a young farmers and early retirement schemes</p><p> We recommend that further research be carried out to quantify the carbon sequestration properties of extensive farming on commonage and Natura farmland.  Research should also be carried out to quantify the carbon sequestration properties of broadleaf trees compared to conifers and the age at which sequestration is most effective.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should be the clearing house in trading carbon between different farming systems.</p><p> Due to increased rainfall, more flexibility is required at member state level to set slurry spreading dates that take local conditions and weather patterns into account because the one-size-fits-all EU regulation all is unworkable.  It is becoming impossible to spread slurry in the current manner.</p><p> Bio-digesters and anaerobic digestion are essential, and the solution for the uplands in that regard is on a co-operative scale.  Such digesters would be developed in partnership with local communities or smart villages, providing them with gas and heat.  The particulate could be returned to farmlands as fertiliser.</p><p> Farmers with natural environmental constraints should be rewarded for the enhancement and preservation of such natural resources and the production from those farms as regards sheepmeat, beef, and cottage industries should be marketed to premium-paying customers.</p><p> The Oireachtas must bring forward legislation to make agricultural land a special asset of the State, as already determined by the EU Commission.  Non-farmers should not be given the same grant rate or premium payment as farmers.</p><p> There is a closed period for cutting hedgerows to protect habitat loss for biodiversity but foresters can clear fell during this closed time, completely removing habitats.  Farmers in existing forestry contracts should not be forced to replant.  Should they wish to do so, they should be given the option of putting in mixed broadleaf and be paid annually for sequestration and other services rendered.  There should be no carbon tax on agriculture.</p><p> I thank the members for their time.</p></speech>

It was of great interest that very little research has been carried out on this area by Teagasc for some time.  I discussed that with several people and I would like the opinions of the witnesses on the feedback I received in that regard.  The view of those to whom I spoke was that, in spite of all the rhetoric, there is an increasing sense that the powers that be in the State wish to focus on intensive farming rather than support typical small family farms, in particular hill farmers and those working on difficult land.  Approximately 75% of a typical farmer's income comes from single farm payments, which are critical to their survival.  In other words, the view I received is that a lot of nonsense is being spoken in this regard.  There is much rhetoric about climate change and so on but, in reality, the research and resources of the State and the way that CAP payments are disbursed is geared toward intensive farming and profit-making at the higher level, to the detriment of small farms.  To back that up, recent research demonstrated that over the past 20 years 42% of family farms in the west of Ireland have ceased operation.  Other evidence recently given to the committee indicated that, in spite of all the talk of getting young farmers involved, one in three farmers under the age of 44 has gone from the land in the past ten years in Ireland.  The witnesses can probably discern my viewpoint on the matter.  The way agriculture is being dealt with across the State is failing geographically and in terms of targets.</p> <p>  I would like some honest feedback from the witnesses in that regard.   Do they perceive that to be the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.29" nospeaker="true" time="15:30:00" ><p>The evidence suggests it is.  That hill farmers in Donegal had to rely on research from the North of Ireland for information on how they can best utilise their sheep to comply with European environmental regulations and continue to draw down support was damning in that equivalent research has not been carried out in the South.</p><p>The committee is going through the process of hearing from all farming organisations and relevant interested parties and all the submissions are available to be viewed.  It is now time for honesty about the way agriculture is being dealt with and supported throughout the country, in particular as we go into another round of CAP negotiations.  That is my view and that of farmers to whom I have spoken in recent weeks and I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022000002#R00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I took a couple of notes on the presentation by Meat Industry Ireland.  I would like a little more information on its representatives' views regarding the future of grassland in terms of carbon sinks.  Mr. Carroll stated research is ongoing in that regard.  At what level is that research?</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll also mentioned that the Irish model is very different from that in other countries, in particular as regards the intensive feed systems utilised in many countries, especially for beef production, whereby cattle are housed all the time and are never free roaming or free feeding such that they go out and find their own food.  It is a very intensive model of beef production.  I sometimes fear that such a system is becoming more prevalent in Ireland, which would be detrimental to the image we portray whereby we market our beef as being from free-roaming, grass-fed animals from family farms and so on, which is where consumers from any country would like to think their meat comes.  Such production model is generally the case in Ireland but I fear that we are moving in another direction.  Is the intensive feed system more profitable?  I assume that is the reason for its usage.  I direct that question to the representatives of Meat Industry Ireland.  We must realise that money talks and that things will move in the direction of where the most profit can be made, regardless of what we want to do in terms of carbon sinks and so on.  Ultimately, the farmer or producer will opt for what pays best.</p> <p>  In regard to the grain and tillage sectors, Mr. Carter mentioned that the tillage sector is an excellent carbon sink and, in particular, that sugar beet, with its long growing season, is one of the best carbon sequestration models, and is probably better in that regard than forestry and many other things.  What is the source for that?  I ask Mr. Carter to provide further information in that regard.</p> <p>  Both the Irish Grain Growers Group and the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association mentioned anaerobic digestion.  A problem for many farmers is that they have too much slurry.  Many farmers in my area received grants to build slurry tanks and are now storing slurry but have nowhere to put it because it has rained from August until now.  What is to be done in that regard?  If climate change is to lead to more frequent wet periods, that will have a detrimental effect on what can be done with the slurry that has been stored.  One option is to consider anaerobic digestion and what can be achieved in that regard.  </p> <p>  Has much research been carried out on the bovine digestive system and its resultant emissions?  A report was published last year regarding a type of seaweed that could be fed to animals to assist in that regard.  I assume there was some chemical make-up within the seaweed that had an effect on the bovine digestive system and I wonder whether any further research has been done into isolating that and its potential usage.  It is possible that it was an airy-fairy report but it seemed accurate to some extent.</p><p>Is there any research being conducted to see if science can solve some of these problems?</p><p> The grain growers mentioned hemp.  I knew a farmer in County Roscommon who grew hemp exceptionally well on very marginal land.  Of course, he needed a licence to grow it because of its particular leaf and the problem that one could be growing something else in the middle of it.  As everyone knows, there is no drug involved in hemp, but as it has the same leaf, the danger is that people could be producing cannabis in the middle of it.  Could there be some alteration - I would not say a genetic modification - in order that it would have a different colour or something else to make it easier to obtain a licence?  It offers a real option because the issue of plastics will really come at us in the next couple of years and we will need to find alternative models of packaging.  Hemp has been around for centuries and could be used again.</p><p> The representatives of the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association mentioned forestry, of which I am very much aware given where I come from.  I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, about agroforestry and farming among trees.  He told me that it was under review in the hope something could be done.  The existing grants are very poor and nobody takes them up.  Given the amount of work involved in fencing, etc., they are useless.  If there was a proper grant available, a farm producing cattle, sheep or whatever else would have the economic advantage of the timber, as well as the carbon sink of the forest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022000002#S00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  Mr. Carroll represents the meat industry and, interestingly, all of his presentation had to do with the farm.  I know that the farming sector makes a major input into the meat industry, but I would like to hear what the meat industry is doing to address the issue of climate change.  Farmers' representatives frequently appear before the committee.  Only a couple of sentences in Mr. Carroll's presentation were about the meat industry.  It would be interesting to tease out the issue further.  What are the meat factories doing to address the issue of climate change?  Are they using renewable energy resources and improving their production methods?  Farmers are doing what they are doing and being forced to do so.  What are the meat factories doing to reduce the level of carbon emissions?</p> <p>  A few weeks ago we heard a presentation on Origin Green.  I note that some meat producers, Origin Green companies, were prosecuted for causing pollution.  What is the value of Origin Green if that is the case and if producers are not contributing to improvements in their environmental performance?</p> <p>  In his presentation Mr. Carroll said Ireland's meet industry was the fifth most carbon-efficient in Europe, as if that was good.  I do not think it is great because it puts the meat industry where it should be.  I could be wrong and would like Mr. Carroll to expand somewhat on what he said and perhaps show me where I might be wrong.  I do not thing it is that big a marketing tool.  We are probably one of the major agricultural producers in Europe.  Where do we stand compared with France and other agricultural producers?</p><p>What are the factories doing on carbon reduction?  We have already heard what the farmers are doing.</p><p> Mr. Carter outlined some very positive things that can be done by both organisations to reduce carbon.  I ask him to give examples of where they are being done at the moment?  Are people waiting for a grant before doing so?  Are there places we could go to see it?  In the committee, we often hear of people waiting for money before anything is done, which can be a bit of a difficulty.  Are these things taking place on the ground now and can we see it actually working?</p></speech>

Quotas have been imposed in Holland where cow numbers have had to be reduced because of the phosphorus production.  One of our sectors has been expanding very rapidly, as has been outlined in the tillage presentation.  I wish to acknowledge three excellent presentations today.  Our tillage acreage has dropped very significantly in recent years.</p> <p>  We have the most sustainable dairy production in Europe.  Mr. Carroll outlined that our beef production is the fifth most sustainable in Europe.  Irrespective of how sustainable we are, we will be a long way from meeting our climate change targets.  We need to focus on what Ireland can do to ensure we can farm sustainably and commercially.  One of the most interesting points made by the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association was the need for the hill lands to be left in their natural state.  They provide a far greater carbon sink in that state than as forestry.  We sometimes feel that forestry will solve the issues of us.  I recently read a frightening statistic on the amount of forestry needed for one extra cow.  Forestry will definitely not solve the issue for us.</p> <p>  The challenges we need to face are coming down the track very quickly.  Historically we have been known for steer beef production.  Can steer beef production be sustainable under climate change?  Given the age at which cattle are slaughtered, is it an efficient use of resources?  Can steer beef production meet the challenges coming rapidly down the track?</p> <p>  Mr. Carter made an excellent presentation on tillage.  Our tillage acreage has dropped very significantly because of issues with profitability.  I fully agree with Mr. Carter that increased acreage is needed to meet our targets.  The issue we need to address is how to arrest that slide.  A few months ago, this committee published a report on the tillage sector.  Diverse forms of food production will be a key part of meeting our targets.  At the moment all the signals are that we are heading in one direction with one sector expanding rapidly.  Unfortunately, that will bring increased challenges.</p> <p>  Commissioner Hogan is quoted as saying that the targets under Food Wise 2025 need to be abandoned now in the context of climate change.</p><p>That is startling for the economy and the country.  We have to face up to these issues and try to find solutions.  They are not going to go away.  The Dutch have already had restrictions imposed on them.  This week we were granted a derogation for another four years.  It was given full status by the Commission.  However, four years will pass quickly.  Will we be able to regain that status in four years time?  As maintaining the <i>status quo</i>will not serve in the future, we have to make changes and adapt our production methods.  All of the increased production is in one rapidly expanding sector; all of the others are shrinking.  We will have a discussion in the D&aacute;il tomorrow on the suckler cow herd, beef production and the challenges posed by climate change.  A lot of hard questions have to be asked.  What we are doing now will not be okay in five years' time.  Therefore, we have to adapt.  <br/><br/>The presentations were excellent.  However, every sector is putting forward what it considers are the solutions for its viability, rather than what we all need to do to beat the challenges posed by climate change.  Last year was a wet one and we saw the challenges that brought in storing slurry and the huge investment made in that regard.  This year extra conditions have been brought forward for slurry spreading, with more and more coming down the tracks.  We need to get ahead of the game and make sure that when the European Union looks at the issues of climate change and sustainable food production, we will be top of the class.  Is steer beef production sustainable?  How do we arrest the decrease in the acreage used for tillage?  I refer also to the recognition of hill farmers' land as a carbon sink and how we can stop land abandonment on hills.  We need to be to serious about the challenges facing us.  They will come at us at a rate of knots.  For a long period we had quotas in dairying.  A different quota is coming at us fast.</p></speech>

They were excellent and went into great detail.  I want to touch on a couple of points on which I would like our guests to come back.</p> <p>  On the challenge of meeting our climate change targets in the context of the upcoming CAP, I am interested in hearing about the negotiations and how the CAP will be structured.  Given the challenges posed by climate change, what changes need to be made to how the CAP will be structured the next time?  What do the delegates believe needs to happen?</p> <p>  The Grain Growers Association seemed to be broaching the idea of a carbon tax.  I ask for that idea to be fleshed out.  Will it be a significant part of the debate?  It is something the Citizens' Assembly recommended, but it is not something with which I agree.  However, I am interested in hearing the individual delegates' perspectives.</p> <p>  On being an carbon-efficient producer of meat, I am interested in the views of Meat Industry Ireland, in particular.  We are currently fifth in meat production but first in dairying.  I am interested in the delegates' perspectives on what other countries might be doing better, those that are ahead of us in the beef production table.  What are others doing from which we could learn to bring us up the table?  I noted in MII's presentation that more carbon is emitted in British beef production than here.  What are the differences between our system and the British system of production?  Why is it much less carbon efficient?</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to contribute to a report the committee is producing.  What one thing would the three groups like to see come out of the report?</p> <p>  How much intergroup communication is there?  Every group is doing great work on behalf of its own sector or organisation and the figures are good.  As highlighted in all three presentations, if we had an industrial environment, our percentage of agricultural output would not be near as high.  The first presentation quoted figures that indicated while our level of emissions from agriculture was 30%, in England, with twice the output, it was only 8%.  We are all aware of that figure which camouflages the situation and puts the emphasis back on agriculture.  This is a global issue and agriculture is only a certain part of it.  We hear that 70% of the grain Irish cattle are eating is imported from Russia by boat, train and lorry.  While it might not be under the umbrella of agriculture, it is adding to global greenhouse emissions.  I heard somebody compare it to a corner forward on a team scoring 1-2.  The team loses but the scorer is happy.  It has to be a team game in agriculture and all other sectors.  Can there be communication between the sectors to eliminate that one example of 70% of the grain being imported when it could be grown here.  It is not affecting the figures for agriculture, but if we do look at the bigger picture, the hauling of that grain from Russia, or wherever else, is having a major effect on the overall figures.  I know that the grain growers cannot force the meat sector to start using Irish grain.  However, could there be some incentive from one to the other.  Has that issue being looked at?  Have the groups talked collectively to see where improvements could be made that would be beneficial to each sector?  As I asked, if the delegates could write a line in the report we are formulating, what would be the one thing they think would have the greatest impact to help the sectors while improving the environment?</p></speech>

That may or may not help the discussion.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll referred to the fact that the committee had visited a processing plant before Christmas.  It was a very useful exercise.  I also had the opportunity to visit a trial farm in my part of the country which I found very useful.  Perhaps we might be able to receive some more information on it?  Perhaps the delegates might know about it.</p> <p>  Deputy Jackie Cahill made a point about increasing numbers in the dairy sector and how we could take advantage to alleviate the difficulties coming down the line.  I refer to extra numbers, moving out stock quicker and producing an animal that is easy to calve, yet fleshy from the processing point of view.  How can that be done genetically and what are the technologies involved?  Teagasc is involved, as is the Irish Cattle Breeders Federation.  That is the way to go and it could be very useful.  Perhaps that issue might be teased out also.</p> <p>  We will start with the Grain Growers Group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Cleary" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022000002#V00500"><p>Let me answer Deputy Martin Kenny's questions first.  We thank Deputies for their questions because they are drilling right down into the difficulties we see.  </p> <p>  A question was asked about sugar beet and from where we obtained our information on the greenhouse gas statistics.  We used the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Committee of the House of Commons, EFRA.  We also looked at the EU statistics for arable crops which were most beneficial to greenhouse gas filtration.</p> <p>  The other element is the long growing season.</p><p>Mr. Carter referred to it.  For those who are not familiar with the crop, there is a long growing season.  A lot is grown in Ireland for feed.  It is not just a commercial sugar crop.  It has large roots and leaves.  It is planted in March and grows until harvest time, which is normally from the end of October or November until January.  As well as being a carbon filter, it provides significant habitat cover for wildlife in the autumn and summer.</p><p> Another significant element is linked to the beef and dairy sector.  The capacity of the crop to absorb nutrients and synthetic or organic fertiliser is four times that of any other cereal crop.  In terms of the arable sector in general, people are talking about the additional difficulties this winter given the excess of slurry and the lack of capacity for storage.  The arable sector has great capacity, but there needs to be a lot of engagement between the arable areas of the country and areas where there are significant slurry storage capacity problems.</p><p> Deputy Cahill referred to the sustainability of our sector.  On-farm diversification is important.  We need to examine anaerobic digestion because it has the capacity to utilise extra slurry or surplus sugar beet or maize as a source of material to generate gas.  Some in the transport sector are already converting HGVs to biogas.  On-farm anaerobic digestion needs to be examined and resourced more.  There is a major issue in terms of implementation and planning for on-farm anaerobic digestion.  There is significant capacity in that area.  It will not happen if we all sit in our own sectors.  There needs to be joined-up thinking, as Deputy Cahill said.</p><p> There is capacity in our sector to produce first generation biofuels.  An EU directive which was implemented ten years ago was never enacted.  I know some people who set up companies to produce pure plant oil from oilseed rape plants.  The refit tariff was pulled and many went out of business as a result.  It is the simplest form of conversion.  Oilseed rape is crushed and pure plant oil can be blended to use with diesel.  It is a very simple process.  The cake which is left can be used as a high-protein animal feed.  That is one simple on-farm mechanism to add value to a product we produce.  It is a solution which we have ignored over the past few years.  Many biofuels are being produced from sugar beet and wheat on the Continent.  A significant amount of wheat is going into ethanol in France.  We are not talking about using our cereal crop for the biofuels sector because we need to produce feed for our livestock.  There is capacity to expand.  In order to survive in our sector we need diversification.  The more we can do on-farm to add value to any product we produce, the more sustainable we will be in the future.</p></speech>

I will start with Deputy McLoughlin, who said he feels the CAP is geared towards productive farms.  The original CAP was established to ensure food security for Europe and was linked to the food produced.  The more productive farms received larger payments.  When the system changed and subsidies were no longer linked to food production, the more productive farms still received more.  Those productive farms have been receiving a bigger cut than less productive farmers.</p><p>I am a small farmer and may not be the most productive, but productive farmers are still receiving a bigger cut and are producing more for their CAP payments.  While hill and sheep farmers in Donegal feel their sector is being underfunded in terms of research, they are not the only ones.  Most other sectors feel they are being underfunded in Teagasc, or it is underfunded in most sectors which are not grass or dairy-based.  A small part of Teagasc is devoted to tillage and it does incredible work given its resources.  We would love to see that sector expanded. Every other sector, such as beef, would love to see its sector promoted a bit more.</p><p> Deputy Kenny mentioned hemp.  It was an example of what could be done.  I thought about it yesterday and decided to mention it.  I do not know much about it, but it was an example of how we can solve a few problems.  I understand it was produced in Ireland 100 years ago and still is.</p></speech>

Deputy Pringle asked where things are being done.  I am doing some small things on my farm.  I am not in GLAS.  I am trying to install reed beds and plant trees on my own whenever I can.  I am not in receipt of any finance for that.  These are my projects and I try to do as much as possible.  Most farmers are the same.  The vast majority of tillage farmers have a few acres of grass which are not as intensively managed as a productive dairy or beef farm.  They may have a single cut of hay.  They have more biodiversity, with longer flowering periods, more flowers and old hay meadows.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill referred to only one sector expanding.  He is supporting what we have said.  Perhaps there has been too much of a focus on dairy farming in the past.  We may possibly face trouble in the future in terms of environmental issues.  We need to promote our food grade export crops and quantify the carbon sequestration and mitigation of the tillage sector.  We would be very keen to get Bord Bia and Origin Green on board to prove these facts for us.</p> <p>  Deputy Daly mentioned the carbon tax.  We would not support a carbon tax, but the Citizens' Assembly recommended a carbon tax on agriculture.  We would not like to see any further tax on farmers.  The sector has enough problems as it is.  If such a tax were introduced, would a tax credit be available for people who are carbon positive?  If one thing could be done now to-----</p></speech>

Perhaps a bronze bullet for the moment.  The protein payment has been very beneficial for farmers.  We hope to reduce the amount of protein being imported and there are benefits for the environment.  Beans are a great crop and we would love an extended and expanded protein payment.  It is a win-win for all farmers, including beef, dairy and arable farmers.  Peas and beans sequester carbon and have no nitrogen input and a lower nitrogen input in the following crop.  We would like to expand that into oilseed rape and other crops.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Healy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022000002#Y00100"><p>I will try to go through the questions as they were asked.  Senator Mac Lochlainn asked questions about intensive farms versus smaller farms.  The starting point is to look at some of the numbers from a meat sector perspective.  We process cattle annually from more than 60,000 farmers.  We process meat from 25,000 sheep producers and 60,000 beef farmers.  There are large numbers of small operations as can be seen from those figures.  In the beef sector, the average number of animals processed per farm is 30.  There is still a huge network of small farms.  I am not necessarily qualified to answer the Senator's question but schemes such as the beef data and genomics programme, which we talk about a lot and are very supportive of, are open to all.  Many of the schemes that are part of CAP pillar 1 and particularly pillar 2 are open to farms of all sizes.  That is all I could say on that.  The Senator gave figures on farm reductions.  Generational renewal remains a big challenge for agriculture and farming in many countries.</p> <p>  Deputy Kenny mentioned the grassland and the carbon sink.  The Chairman said representatives from Teagasc will appear before the committee.  I ask the committee to spend a bit of time on the issue.  We are not qualified to speak on it but I will comment on a number of things that we understand to be the case.  Permanent grassland sequesters carbon.  It is a huge sink of carbon but is not fully accounted for in the overall accounting system globally or at European or Irish level.  As a result, the livestock sectors in Ireland, Britain and elsewhere get a bad rap.  There is not total agreement globally on how to count it.  Climate change science is a new science and there is not agreement.  We need to point it out if we feel there is a positive contribution that is not being recorded.  </p> <p>  I will mention another aspect of the work we are trying to do.  The only thing one gets credit for is further enhancements that are made, which is the same as in the forestry sector.  Much of our existing forestry is not counted but new plantings are counted.  The project we are trying to establish with Teagasc concerns outlining best practice on permanent grassland.  Some areas are more suited to further stocking and some are more suited to reduced stocking and perhaps some planting.  The issue is how to maximise the sequestration from the permanent grassland we have.  It is not our field of expertise.</p> <p>  In terms of a move to intensive feeding, we are still very much a grass-based production system.  Our advantage in beef and dairy production and other livestock pursuits is that we can grow grass.  I am not sure if there has been intensification; I do not necessarily agree with that point.  One of the things that happens is that in winter there is a certain amount of housing required but in the final months of an animal's life there are production systems that will finish them off faster.  One key factor from a meat sector perspective in terms of climate change is the age of slaughter; finishing animals earlier has an impact.  The fact that Irish beef and lamb is grass-based is still a huge marketing attribute.  </p> <p>  On the bovine digestive system, research on seaweed was published a number of months ago but we would need to harvest all the seaweed in Ireland, England and the world to produce a counterbalance.</p><p>However, Teagasc has done a great deal of work.  There are cows with little containers strapped to their backs measuring everything to do with the digestive system.  All of this comes back to the fact that we are discussing biological processes, not changing a car engine or moving to electric.  We will not have electric cows.  We are stuck with a biological system, so the mitigation potential is limited.</p><p> This brings me to Deputy Pringle's point about us focusing on the farm level.  It is the raw material that the processing industry works on, but that is purely because the farm level accounts for the largest proportion of greenhouse gas emission volumes.  It is recognised that more than 90% of emissions are at farm level.  Hence, we have to address those.</p></speech>

That is the reason for the focus.  We will never solve the challenge unless we work with farm organisations and farmers to confront it.  It is a challenge for livestock production.  Of the volume associated with agriculture, 90% occurs at farm level, so that is where we have to tackle the issue.  At processing plant level------</p></speech>

Origin Green tries to pull together all of the bits that the whole Irish agrifood sector is working on to improve its sustainability and its environmental position, be that at farm level through the quality assurance scheme and the measurement of carbon or at processor level in terms of what processors are doing.</p> <p>  Regarding someone being prosecuted under an EPA licence or the like, issues have arisen - unfortunately, it will probably happen again - where plants have exceeded a limit.  Some of the more recent issues have related to noise pollution.  Unfortunately, many of our plants are close to built-up areas and towns.  It is important that this be clear.  Recently, the EPA published a priority list of sites, and some of the agrifood companies that appeared on it did so over noise or odour issues, not necessarily something being released into water systems or the like.</p></speech>

The monitoring of Origin Green would be acting before that anyway.</p><p>Those who do not make an effort or are constantly in violation of environmental requirements should be excluded from Origin Green.  However, it is also important to note that things can go wrong in a facility licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency.  One-off events can occur and must be addressed, but they do not mean the company in question is not committed to the Origin Green programme. </p><p> Deputy Jackie Cahill raised specific issues about steer beef production.  We are not in favour of moving to young bulls and are not necessarily moving in that direction.  Steer and heifer beef production has been the unique selling point of Irish beef and that will continue to the case.  Nevertheless, it is possible to produce steer beef at much younger ages than is the case.  Part of the challenge facing us in making progress in dealing with climate change and reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions will be to improve the uptake of the production systems Teagasc is demonstrating on the demonstration farms to which the Chairman referred.  We cannot walk away from this issue without a fight.  There are ways to produce off-grass at a younger age that would have an impact in reducing the carbon footprint.  That is the bottom line and if we can work to that end, we will have done something to improve our position.</p><p> On Deputy Charlie McConalogue's question about the future structure and design of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, I am sure the farm organisations have much more definitive views on the issue that we do.  If we were to express a view, we would like the CAP to be channelled towards schemes that provide support for farmers such as, for example, the beef data and genomics programme.  I understand a significant amount of funding provided under the scheme comes from national sources.  Not only do the schemes provide direct support but they are also delivering progress.  The beef data and genomics programme, for example, has been in place for only three years or thereabouts, during which time calving intervals have declined by 12 days.  In addition, the number of calves in the suckler cow herd has increased from 79 per 100 to 85 per 100.  That figure needs to increase to 95 per 100, the ratio in the dairy sector.  Progress is being made under the schemes and the CAP could help in that regard.  In that context, wider budgetary issues arise, but we do not need to discuss them in detail today.</p><p> Senator Paul Daly referred to the discussion taking place between the various sectors involved.  There is no benefit to agriculture or the food industry if one sector plays off or tries to outdo another.  One of the interesting points, to which Mr. Cleary alluded, is that Food Wise 2025 included a specific recommendation, if that is not too strong a word to use, that the pig and grain sectors dovetail more on account of the land available for slurry, as well as for grain.  In the poultry sector Manor Farm is taking some new initiatives, including building new housing facilities on tillage farms.  That area needs to be examined further. </p><p> Senator Paul Daly also referred to a silver bullet, but there is none.  If he were to push us on what we would like to see included, we need, first, to ensure our base is right, by which I mean the point from which we measure ourselves.  That brings me back to the issue of soil sequestration of Irish grassland.  We need to get this right.  Is it being accounted for appropriately in the various figures that have been used?  We must also ask how we can enhance soil sequestration.  This can be done through programmes such as the beef data and genomics programme as it uses breeding and the best of science to try to improve the picture.</p><p> I wished to make a point about demonstration farms, but I cannot recall the question I was asked.</p><p>There are a number of such farms.  The one to which Deputy Pringle referred focuses on how best to get beef from the dairy herd given the expansion in the dairy herd.  There is a demonstration farm in the west and Dawn Meats has one focused on suckler beef production, on which it is working jointly with McDonalds and Teagasc.  Again, it is trying to do this in real farm conditions as opposed to a laboratory or research farm conditions.  These farms must stand on their own two feet.  The one members visited last year was a Kepak farm.  It is a commercial operation that is trying out the best things in animal health and different production systems.  This type of farm is important as we must constantly push to identify what are the best and most efficient production systems.</p><p> Deputy Cahill indicated we must face up to climate change.  We must also stand up and fight to some extent because agriculture is in the spotlight in terms of climate change and has a role to play in that regard.  I understand that, with the exception of New Zealand, Ireland's agriculture sector accounts for the highest percentage of national greenhouse gas emissions.  The reason is that we do not have dirty industries such as mining and heavy manufacturing plants.  We need to be clear that we must not place an excessive emphasis on agriculture and that we are efficient.  I accept that we must also make up more ground.  Unfortunately, these are biological processes and we cannot re-engineer cattle.  While we can breed and improve, progress is incremental.  A significant amount of work is being done, although we still have some way to go.</p></speech>

The reason is that the sector has demonstrated that it is taking action in many areas.  The Chairman stated we would return to this issue.  Beef and agriculture are being bargained away by the European Commission to close a deal with South America.  It seems we will be happy to import more product from South America to close a trade deal while, on the other hand, we want farmers and industries here to contract in order to meet climate change requirements.  That is a contradiction.</p></speech>

He is correct that there is a complete lack of research on land management in the uplands and forestry.  As a matter of fact, in the area of forestry, we still do not have definitive research on what sequesters what better.  The reason is that there is an agenda at work and this has been determined.  The issue then is why carry out research when the plan has already been made.  The world of agribusiness has little use for the uplands because upland farmers do not buy chemicals, spread fertilisers or use large items of machinery.  We are, therefore, pretty useless from the perspective of the remit.  The uplands are also the area that has been targeted historically for forestry.  Poorer and more marginal land has been viewed as the area to be planted with forestry.  In some senses, our future has already been figured out and this conclusion is borne out by the absence of research.  This takes us back to the point we have been making in calling for a new future to be created for us.  The Senator is dead right that we need extensive new research to start underpinning that.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny asked a question about slurry tanks filling up and asked what we should do with the slurry in such cases.  We have spent &euro;710 million under the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, on low slurry emissions spreading.  We had 12,000 applications for these spreaders.  This is a significant amount of money given that, for example, an anaerobic digester would cost approximately &euro;500,000.  This means we could have purchased 1,400 anaerobic digesters with the money spent under TAMS on low slurry emissions spreading.  The question that arises, therefore, is why money is being focused on this area when alteratives are available.  Perhaps we need to start challenging pre-existing solutions.</p><p> On the question about the INHFA and agriforestry, as long as there is only a five-year grant available, it will not be a solution, given the level of uptake, upkeep and management.  A period of five years would only help to establish it.  Historically, farmers have farmed with trees.  The legacy of hedgerows and tree-lined fields bears this out.  Unfortunately, the Department's policy is for fields to have a lot of green grass, with everything else having red rings around it and to be deducted from farmers' payments.  We need to see a fundamental shift so as not to punish people for engaging in agriforestry and other practices unless it is paid for.  I do not know whether I have been clear.  People can engage in agriforestry and be paid for it, but if they themselves grow tree, they will be penalised for it.  It will be deemed to be scrub and brush and deducted.  I was asked to where the committee could go to see agriforestry being engaged in.  Some of us are already engaging in it but being penalised for it.  Where I have planted copses on my farm, they have been ringed and subtracted because they are not part of a programme.  It is very difficult for farmers to take the initiative and start being more proactive when we are punished for doing so.</p><p> Deputy Thomas Pringle asked what farmers in Ireland could do to farm sustainably in the future.  We have mentioned bees in the case of grain producers.  I would love it if bees could start to be seen as a livestock unit.  At this stage, we are being forced to farm with livestock units.  Where people want to increase the use of bees, they must increase the food available to bees - trees in the spring and flowers in the summer for diverse grazing.  However, when sheep are farmed, no flowers are left as the sheep will take care of them.  If bees could be perceived as a livestock unit, farmers could to start to reduce their sheep numbers and increase the number of beehives by 50 to meet their livestock unit levels.  Regarding the diversification of grazing regimes on a mountain, for example, a donkey and a breeding mare qualify as livestock units but a native hill pony does not.  Donkeys' feet do not survive on wet mountains.  They are a legacy from when turf used to be brought down from the mountains.  Perhaps we might consider deeming native hill ponies as livestock units.</p><p> Deputy Jackie Cahill asked about how land abandonment could be stopped.  I will add his question to Deputy Charlie McConalogue's on what we would like to see being done.  Land abandonment is not just a matter of letting land go because someone cannot make enough money from it.  When it comes to sheep farming on hills, there are two demographics, the first of which is ageing farmers, be it a bachelor farmer or spinster who has no one coming up behind him or her to take over the farm because there is no viability or livelihood to be made from it.  The simple answer is to have livelihoods based on output.  People would stay if there was an income to be made.</p><p> The second demographic is the two-job farmer.  In how many careers does someone rely on a second job to allow him or her to stay in the first?  Essentially, we need a second job to survive.  Because of that, we are called part-time farmers when we are not.  In fact, we usually have a 40-hour job and then go home and work for another 40 hours on the farm.  Providing some support for farmers to have a livelihood will be important.  Otherwise, they will have to find a second job.  Unfortunately, this means that they will reduce the level of their participation in farming and environmental, maintenance and day-to-day work on the farm will be sacrificed.</p><p>However, like I say, the simple answer is that we need livelihood based on outputs.  In response to Deputy Cahill, the smallest farmer cannot access things like TAMS.  TAMS is there to allow farms to modernise.  Unfortunately, with TAMS, a farmer must pay up front and claim it back.  A single farmer - a single female farmer - cannot afford to pay up front because the bank will not give her a loan for that.  This means that the most vulnerable farmers who need those grants the most cannot get access to them.  Somehow we need to look at how we can allow those vulnerable sectors to access things like TAMS.</p><p> Regarding the silver bullet, we would certainly like to see the committee include in its report a recommendation for an end to Sitka spruce plantations and the clear-felling of them.  Quite honestly, we need to start seeing hardwood, broadleaf, long-term forests.  It goes back to what we were talking about in the research.  If we can prove which one is sequestering better and more, let us put in the one we know will deliver the best results in the long run.</p><p> The last thing was the carbon tax.  Everybody is right.  The farmer does not need another tax.  Once again, the farmer does not need to be punished for what is happening on their land.  However, perhaps we could look at something like a carbon rating, for example, if somebody has a house with a really good energy rating, they would get a better price for that house.  If a farmer is producing livestock in a manner in which their carbon rating is good, that needs to be rewarded so perhaps we could have something similar to the BER system rather than a tax.  That is just a thought.</p></speech>

Carbon trading is already taking place globally and carbon credits are being bought.  I will provide a specific example.  Qantas in Australia bought the rights for 450,000 hectares of cover crops.  It is growing mustard as a cover crop.  It is using it as a biofuel for its aircraft but the quantity it will produce will be insignificant.  What Qantas bought are the rights for the 450,000 hectares for carbon credits so, obviously, trading has already started on the positive side.  Do I want to see a carbon tax?  Absolutely not.  We have enough of penalties.</p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly asked about the silver bullet.  This committee did an excellent job on the report on the future of the tillage sector.  My silver bullet for our sector is very clear.  I would like to see more Irish arable produce being used for feed and food products for Irish domestic consumption.</p></speech>

There has been all sorts of business here today so I was unable to stay for the discussion, but I read with real interest and listened to the presentation from Meat Industry Ireland.  I also read the two other presentations.  I am very much at one with what the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association said in its presentation.  It is the right approach to Irish agriculture and is in tune with what I see happening in or what I hear from the European Commission and indeed Commissioner Hogan when he spoke at Food Wise.  The association's broad review of what we need to do not just in farming but also in forestry is particularly useful.  I will concentrate on forestry.  The association is right in terms of the switch to a completely different mode of forestry, as I read the association's presentation, so that we do not just grow forestry for lumber but see it as a carbon storage system, an aid to biodiversity, a leisure development and helping with our water management.  As the association says in its presentation, this is a move away from the system we have at the moment towards continuous cover and using alder, ash, rowan and a range of native species.</p><p>I think the association said somewhere else that when we get the value in that carbon sequestration, which will have an increasing value, the value should accrue to the county where the carbon is stored.  That is a critical element in the switch to a new form of forestry.  Our ambition should be 20,000 ha of that type of forestry so that we are not isolating communities in the likes of Leitrim and elsewhere where there is real public concern at the moment.</p><p> If I am reading the food production side of the association's presentation correctly, and I apologise if I am simplifying it, my understanding of where the Commission will go in terms of asking countries to come forward with new approaches to the CAP is that it will be looking for exactly this type of farming, which is more diversified, is all about soil husbandry and goes back in some ways to the old ways where rotational farming and less reliance on single markets was the way to go.  If there is a divide in the country in farming between the north and west and the south and east, and there probably is in land terms, it may favour the north and west.  I was talking to my colleague beside me and said that this is what we need to do.  That is where the help and resources are needed.  I very much support the analysis and general approach of the association.</p><p> I do not want to be deeply critical of Meat Industry Ireland's presentation but it seemed to be taking the country in a different direction towards a much more intensified reliance on international commodity markets and a much more capital and carbon-intensive agricultural system.  We had very interesting discussions with members of the farming and environmental communities.  My concern is that we are running the risk, particularly from an EU perspective, of being seen not to play our part in the climate challenge we face.  We are a country that is getting a lot of favours with regard to Brexit and corporate tax.  My concern is that at some point we are going to be told we are not going to get off on agriculture and land use.  That is just my assessment of what I hear in Brussels from the broad stream of the environmental community.  I hear that they increasingly talk about us in that way.  They talk about us with regard to agriculture the way they talk about Poland with regard to coal.  It is of deep concern to this country that our reputation as a green country and an Origin Green producer, which is a valid one, is in fear of becoming really damaged by international sentiment that we are not doing that.  I do not believe that continuous assessment of the efficiency of Irish agriculture per kilogramme is a valid argument in response to those European concerns.  I listened to Professor John Sweeney, one of our best climate scientists, say that it is the cumulative quantity of carbon that is key, not efficiency.  I think we have had an additional 400,000 cattle in the past year or so.  Each is equivalent to an SUV on the road in carbon terms.  If we keep going in this intensified numbers game, we will run into a climate backlash that will have profound consequences for the marketing of food from this country abroad and indeed our whole trading system.</p><p> It is not an attack on Irish agriculture.  I agree with what I read in the presentation by the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association.  We must move away from a war between the environmental movement and the farming community.  It is in both our interests to work together because farmers will be on the front line of our climate response, flood management and biodiversity protection.  They are the protectors of our environment.  Young farmers are starting to think and experiment that way.  The reason I am critical of a reliance on the old system, particularly in the beef and dairy sectors, is because it is not serving farmers.  I was startled when I looked at some of the figures yesterday relating to average incomes for Irish farmers compared with those of Danish, Dutch and German farmers.  They are getting twice the income so it may be serving the meat industry but I do not think it is serving Irish farming in terms of getting real incomes.  I think the Natura approach, which is one I would support, will provide a better future in terms of paying Irish farmers because we will paying them for carbon, biodiversity and flood management as well as paying them for food production.</p><p> I think our metric here is not just on carbon.</p><p>We cannot just obsess about the carbon.  We have to look at the social aspect to this.  The other concern I have is about protecting, and keeping to, the old ways.  The average age of the Irish farmer is now 55.  It is almost impossible for young people, as I understand it, unless they are directly connected to a farm, to get into farming.  Sons or daughters of farmers are increasingly not going into farming.  They see those figures in terms of income levels and they see it is not as rewarding as it should be.  I very much appreciate the chance to add those few thoughts on the basis of what I have read here but I will look back on the video of the meeting.  Despite my critical comments, and I do not want to be in any way personally critical about it, I respect the meat industry's right and interest in terms of presenting its case.  However, we need to have some forum where the environmental movement sits down with the farming and food industries and works out, as best they can, what interests we have in common.  It is about getting young farmers involved, it is about fewer inputs which is more profits for farmers, it is about getting payments for all that new form of forestry and new form of carbon storage and, critically, it is about making sure that money goes to Donegal, Roscommon, Mayo and Leitrim, that quarter of the country, in particular.</p><p> I would like to go back to the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association presentation.  Professor John Sweeney, our best climate scientist, has said that what we are going to see with climate change is the north and west getting hit with worse weather - unfortunately, with wetter winters and more intense weather events.  Friends of mine, farming in Donegal and elsewhere, have told me they have not seen anything like last summer and the last nine months with non-stop rain.  The south and east will have different problems, and will probably be drier.  We have a common interest in addressing this climate challenge together, but addressing it with a view to social revival, a revival of rural Ireland.  A green approach in high quality continuous-cover forestry, in keeping carbon in the ground, including peat, critically, and in flood management is where we can and should go.  The food we will sell out of that system and the tourists we will bring in from that system will also help revive rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I would not agree with all of them but you are entitled to them.  </p> <p>  Generational renewal is a huge issue that is going to affect us all.  We had the European Court of Auditors before our committee discussing two reports it produced, one of them on the young farmer and the other on the rural development programme.  A startling statistic is that 1,000 farmers a week are leaving farming in Europe.  This is not an Irish issue.  It is happening throughout Europe.  By 2040, which is only 20 years away, there are going to be very few farmers around.  It is a huge issue that we have to address.  The other issue, which I believe was mentioned in the presentations by some of the groups, is one that is going to come up time and again, especially in view of the CAP negotiations, namely, the active farmer.  Who is an active farmer?  What is the definition of an "active farmer"?  There is a huge issue around that.</p> <p>  I will go to Mr. Condon first.</p></speech>

On the CAP, I would say that a capping of payments at &euro;65,000, a degressive payment for larger farms and a redistributive payment to medium to smaller farms would possibly answer a lot of the problems relating to land abandonment.  On the research issue, I would say that there is serious research required on the effects of designations on farming in these upland areas.</p> <p>  One other point I would like to comment on is our opposition to the carbon tax.  I read the transcript from last week's meeting and it is pretty unanimous that there is opposition to it.  I would call into question the make-up of the Citizens' Assembly that voted 90% to 10% for a carbon tax on agriculture, when one has a huge chunk of the population, including all the employees in the meat industry, close to 450,000 people involved in farming and processing.  For such a proportion of people to vote for it, and for there to be such opposition from the agriculture side, tells me that there is some dissonance in that system.</p></speech>

Indeed, it would probably help.  The point was made that we should not be looking at production on a per kilo basis but on a global basis and that is fine.  However, we must then have a discussion about why those people in Europe to whom the Deputy was referring are happily using agriculture as a bargaining chip to close off a deal in South America that will allow more product to be produced in a less environmentally friendly way and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean.  Whatever way one wants to measure it, Irish agriculture and particularly livestock, beef, lamb and dairy production, has a strong set of environmental credentials by virtue of our grass based system.  Those credentials will stand up anywhere.  Let us have that discussion but let us be fair about the way we have it.  We never see as much focus on the transport sector, for example, which is the next largest polluter in terms of the rankings.  Agriculture is certainly up there and a high contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the Irish context by virtue of the absence of other industries like mining, for example.  Transport is the next largest and has increased over the last decade in terms of its emissions but agriculture, as I understand it, has not.  Agriculture is trying so let us recognise that and give the sector its place as part of the solution rather than as a villain in the scheme.  I would have to question where all of the jobs will come from in terms of alternative sectors.  We constantly hear general discussions about jobs and the rural-urban divide.  Indeed, plans were announced last week for the future development and direction of the country and whether such development will be in Dublin, Limerick or Waterford.  Agriculture and food processing are generating economic activity in many rural areas and I do not hear alternatives to that being suggested and that must be highlighted.  It is true that we have to do more and cannot sit back.  We are under the spotlight in terms of there being more work to be done in the agricultural sector.  There is more work to be done in meat and dairy processing but we must not forget the 120,000 farmers in that sector or the 50,000 direct jobs in food processing, as well as the linked jobs.  They are valid economic contributors in every parish and county of Ireland and we cannot ignore them in our overall rush.</p> <p>  I am not sure what favours we are getting in the context of Brexit, as referred to by the Deputy.  At Brussels level one will sometimes hear of a focus on Irish agriculture and certainly in the context of dairy expansion it was mentioned.  However, some of the dairy expansion in Ireland by global standards was far less than that which took place in other countries within the community.  That said, in percentage terms the expansion was very significant.  In global terms the UK's increase in milk production was phenomenally greater than Ireland's.  Our percentage was high but our overall volume increase was not so high.</p></speech>

The last CAP compelled any farmer with more than 30 ha to grow three different crops on his or her farm.  On our own farm we grow six crops, three of which are break crops.  They have all added significantly to our overall output.  We are growing beans and peas as high protein feed for livestock and oil seed rape for energy production.  I would remind Deputy Ryan that when he was a Minister the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff, REFIT, scheme for biofuels was closed which caused a lot of distress to farmers who had invested heavily at the time.  Many went out of business as a result of that policy change.</p><p> The Chairman spoke about young farmers.  I agree with him that they need to be supported.  There was a significant amount of help available for them from the national reserve in the past two budgets, but a lack of access to funding at low interest rates for full-time, active young farmers is a very significant factor as it affects continuity.  Many young formers are still interested in agriculture and it is a great life.  All they want is to make a reasonable living from it in the future.</p><p> To answer Deputy Eamon Ryan, our sector has changed significantly in the past ten years.  Most arable enterprises in the south east are sustainable in terms of the environment and climate change.  We will improve in time; all we need are the right supports.</p></speech>

We had some meat in France which we thought was not of as high a standard as we would have in Ireland.  Most accept that the beef we produce here, on family farms where it is grass fed and cattle roam free, is better.  However, the farmer in Ireland only receives the average price.  The meat industry should reflect on this.  The price of Irish beef on shelves in continental Europe is good, particularly for prime cuts.  The farmer is getting a raw deal and should be getting a better price for his or her product.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.91" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Healy" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022000002#HH00400"><p>I will answer it.  The average price paid to beef producers - this was the case for most of last year too - was 107% of the EU average.  We export 90% of the beef we produce, but in most states there is a domestic premium, with consumers paying a little more for their home product.  However, they have an import requirement and in many markets we are coming in as the next supplier.  Many years ago the price would have been 90% or 95% of the EU average, whereas now it is above the overall average, which reflects a strong performance.  I have never met a farmer who did not believe he or she should get more for his or her produce, but there is also competitive pressure among the various proteins and the price has to be compared to that for pork and chicken.</p></speech>

That is the gripe of the farming community.</p></speech>

When an animal is processed, its constituent parts go to many countries and some attract a premium.  The overall return from a market dictates what is paid.  The preference is usually for local produce, but we are often the second supplier.  That is where the challenge lies.</p><p>In many cases, it returns a price which is above the price that prevails in many of those member states.  That is a strong performance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.95" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018022000002#JJ00100"><p>I agree with Deputy Kenny.  He has hit the nail on the head.  Irish farming has great attributes in that it is largely family farm-based and pasture-based.  We are able to keep cattle out for much longer than in other countries.  To show that it is not as intensive, I understand that the average Irish dairy cow produces approximately 5,000 litres of milk a year.  In Northern Ireland, where it is done differently, it is 8,000 and it is 10,000 in the UK.  That lack of an intensified system should mean that, in a market which values that and which wants to know about origin of material, we have a competitive advantage over Brazil and over British and other farms.  We risk losing it now because Michael Gove, in the British Government, was saying that that is how it will go, towards really high quality, having a better connection between the consumer and the farmer and certifying that it is sustainable.  In those circumstances, the current system where we do not get the premium price and just get the average price shows that something is wrong.  I think the way to change that is to nail down our sales marketing as a green sustainable nation with regard to our food.  We should go for the premium market.  We only represent 1% of global production so we can fit into that, sell it at that price and not do it on the hoof but as a select, targeted marketing exercise.  That cannot be done if we are not looking after the environment and we cannot do that, in all conscience, when we are saying as part of Food Wise 2025, that we will increase our agricultural emissions by 11%.  Phil Hogan is saying this.  He has come over to say that we cannot do that.  We cannot in all conscience sell ourselves in that way for a better price if, at the same time, we are increasing our emissions.  We have to deal with it in transport, which I spend most of my time on, and in energy.  We have to have a 100% reduction in emissions in energy.</p> <p>  Looking at how others have done this, New Zealand has gone ahead of us in the intensification, with a very similar pastureland-based system.  They thrashed their country.  They got a huge increase in dairy production but they are in a rapid reverse because they realised that it is not sustainable and does not work.  It is the same with the Danes.  They went with a really intensive capital-based system.  The average Danish cow starts life with a &euro;30,000 debt on it.  We should not be going that route.  We should be going for Irish family farms and higher quality.</p> <p>  I left out the grain suppliers.  I had the fortune yesterday to meet a young Irish farmer, Johnny Greene, I think he is called, in Carlow.  His grandfather might have founded the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA.  It comes from a proud tradition.</p></speech>

Smart farming and BASE farming is an opportunity.  Agro-forestry, protecting biodiversity and carbon management are the green way to go, which will be the future of Irish farming.  It is far more secure, it pays better and it fits into our sense of pride.  We are right to have pride in our family farm-based system.  It provides a really secure future and that is the way we should go.  As part of that, we should aim to cut our emissions and not let them rise.</p></speech>

The rural environment protection scheme and agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, were before that.  All those environmental schemes have made a huge contribution to the dynamics of this.  In my opinion, that will continue.  I think, with no disrespect to older farmers, that the younger farmers are buying into the principle of these initiatives.  Even though we will increase meat production, that does not necessarily mean that we will have thousands more cows.  The old line, "better before bigger", is where we are going as opposed to having bigger numbers.  We will be more efficient and get more out of the numbers that we have first.  That is the point that we must make first.</p></speech>

If agriculture even just stood still at the moment as other parts of the economy started to decarbonise, including the transport sector, housing and other industries, our percentage would still be high.</p><p>We will remain in the spotlight and that needs to be recognised because food production is a natural, biological process.  The ability to mitigate carbon output is limited and yet farmers are trying.</p><p> When we talk about our European colleagues, we always have to remember that we are coming from a low production base.  The volume involved in our dairy, dairy expansion and the plans that the dairy industry has is a far lower volume than other member states have increased by in the same period.  We need to retain perspective.  We are a small producer in the global context, and while percentage figures might sometimes look big, the total volume is very small, whether for dairy, meat or other sectors.</p></speech>

It was all-encompassing, including the farm organisations, processors, producers and all the rest.  Everybody came together and produced that.  I mentioned the point before at different meetings about looking at it again.  Having said that, from a dairy point of view, a target was a 50% increase in production.  We are probably well down that road already without having a huge increase in numbers, as I mentioned a few minutes ago.  Much can be achieved more efficiently without having to go down the road of a huge increase in numbers.</p></speech>

I think it was a brilliant exercise and I agree with his analysis.  If we are not doing that, another proposal that could be followed, if we are to benefit from being more efficient than others, is that we should look, perhaps, at moving agriculture into the European emissions trading scheme, ETS, which would give us a measure of efficiency compared with other producers.</p> <p>  We mention Brazil and that we cannot deal with Brazil because Brazil is not going to handle the issue.  The truth is that Brazil will have to do something.  The Paris Agreement applies to every country in the world.  I do not believe America will stay out of it.  It would be a complete pariah if it did.  At some stage, it will come back in.  Brazil is in it and it has a similar problem with land use emissions.  It will have to address the issue in its beef industry.  We are not alone in this.  On the matter of our size, people say that we are only small.  The way that this climate response is going is that it gives everyone an opportunity to take part in the solution, which is a better system.</p> <p>  On the scale, we should cotton on to land use, land-use change and forestry, LULUCF, and carbon sequestration.  Even stopping peat production and the big power plants would mean that 5 million tonnes per annum of emissions from peat could be saved almost immediately.  Doing the devil and all in grass management, we might get 1 million tonnes of carbon abatement or carbon reduction.  This has to be looked at.  We have to bring forestry, bogs, land use and agriculture together.  It is not the farming sector on its own.  It is an integrated issue.  I think, above anything else, that we need a national land use plan that goes from the mountaintops to the sea, looks at what we are good at with farming and other areas, and where we really concentrate on biodiversity, natural parkland, forestation, a new type of forestation and what type of farming we do.</p></speech>

There is a roadshow, if I can use that phrase, to nearly every part of the country.  Everybody is free to attend, whether as individuals or part of an organisation.  I have attended two.  There is one main issue - the amount of money involved.  It is not about the active farmer or anything else but the amount of money involved, which clearly is very important.  The budget is crucial and there will be a major discussion about it.  If we have more subsidiarity and give member states more flexibility, it will be a crucial part of the process.  However, I take the point which I will convey to the Minister that there should be engagement with all stakeholders when the time comes.</p></speech>

I missed some of what Deputy Eamon Ryan had to say, but I got the flavour of it towards the end.  Everything we have said is about progressing the climate change agenda in a proper way and operating on the basis of sustainability.  It is a journey, not something that will happen overnight.  The differences between us are not massive and, as has been said, in work together we will solve some of the problems.  There is a role for the Government, the industry and farmers - everybody has a part to play.</p> <p>  I am puzzled by the Deputy in talking about premium markets being lost or missed.  We are exporting to the best premium market which delivers the best returns, but we are also exporting to a market that has been substantially renationalised.  In the case of France and Italy, the markets have a preference for their own products.  The value from these markets is greater than that from an Irish product exported to these markets.  Notwithstanding that, as Mr. Healy stated, in 2017 the average price paid was 107% of the European Union average.  The only market that would have been ahead of us in that price grading over the course of the year was the United Kingdom which is paying a premium price to its own producers.  I do not know which premium market the Deputy believes we should be in.  This is an industry that exports to 50 markets and we continuously chase access to the premium markets.  We are not always at liberty to trade with these countries because we either need trade agreements that are negotiated centrally or we need bilateral agreements on which the Government negotiates on behalf of the industry.  It is not as simple as pressing a button and chasing access to a particular market.  I do not disagree with the point that if we were to go in with an enhancement of Origin Green and sustainability credentials, it would be a help.  We should look at what we are facing in a year's time; we face the loss of a premium market.  If it could be replaced, it would be a great day's work.</p></speech>

There is a large population on a small island, no matter what way Brexit works out.  One of my concerns is that Britain will use the opportunity of being free from the CAP system and to do its own thing to aggressively seek to have a green system.  That is what the Minister in question has said he wants.  We could, therefore, find ourselves selling at a lower price because in the end the consumer would be willing to pay for it.  I am sure the business is not easy.</p> <p>  Addressing climate change is a journey which will take time.  We will make mistakes in going backwards and forwards.  If we do not set ourselves a target for real carbon reductions rather than increases, we will not be able to trade under an Origin Green brand and obtain a premium price that should apply to Origin Green materials.  That is the future.  In a world that is cooking and where climate destruction is becoming more evident, we will not be able to trade unless we act in every sector, including transport and energy.  We can do it and be very good at it.  More than anything else, it could be good for Irish farming if we were to organise it properly.</p></speech>

How would the farmers in the south east survive?  That would be cutting their payments and cutting production, moving the money away.  We would be advocating for more money to go to productive farmers who are trying to implement better sustainability measures.  At the end of the day we have to produce food.  We cannot just cut production.  The idea of this committee was to get stakeholders involved.  My view would be to try to increase or maintain the level of food production in each sector and also try to mitigate these things by trying to improve the emissions from each sector.  Cutting production would have a negative effect for the economy and for everyone.  We have heard a lot about rural economies and the benefit of agriculture to those economies.  We should not try to cut production to effect change in our carbon footprint when we can do it using other technologies and other systems.  We in the arable sector have been advocating that being carbon neutral or carbon positive can benefit both worlds.  This is something that should be looked upon rather than just cutting production.</p><p> I would say also that Meat Industry Ireland have mentioned about the grass-based system, but could there be a benefit to more intensive use of cereal rations?  I read a report recently that more intensive rations and more intensive finishing of animals has had a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions due to earlier finishing times.  Could this be an area that could be looked at to promote our own feeds?</p><p> Reference was made to the origin of food and the origin of meat and dairy.  Currently we are importing 60% of our feed imports for animals.  How can we guarantee the traceability of Irish produce and label it as fully Irish when 70% of that comprises GMO and imported grains.  We should be looking towards producing more of our own feeds for animals.  As the Chairman said, in the past ten years all sectors - dairy, arable etc. - have come a long way and made great ground in trying to reduce their carbon footprint and still are.  It is a slow road and there is a long way to go.</p></speech>

Organic farming has shown that food can be produced to the highest standard with low inputs but the consumer will not pay the premium that compensates the farmers for it.  If we think that by meeting all of the challenges we are going to face on climate change that the consumer, especially a British consumer, will make up the shortfall, we are fooling ourselves.  The British consumer has always looked for cheap food and that will not change.  As Mercosur has been mentioned already, the reality is that Mercosur will do a lot of damage to the climate change targets that we are trying to meet here in Europe, and that is the reality of it.  We have already conceded to allow 100,00 tonnes extra to come into Europe.  We can produce that a lot more carbon efficiently than what South America can do to get it to market in Europe.  If we think that the European consumer is going to make up the shortfall for us and all of the extra costs that are going to be imposed on us, we would want to get into the real world.</p></speech>

That is clear.  That is why we have CAP.  CAP is the right approach to support Irish farming.  But CAP is now changing and we in the next two years have the chance to change it and we have a flexibility because it is back to the country.  The reality is that if one looks at a range of sectors, not just farming, they are not commercial.  I am told by commercial foresters that forestry in the south east can be very commercial but is just not commercial in the north-west.  It is one of the reasons why if one wants to develop that continuous cover which takes a longer time and has biodiversity and all sorts of other gains, the market will not pay for it and we have to have a CAP system that will.  The same would apply for just about every form of agricultural production, particularly for farmers in the north west.  The big issue in our national planning framework is to try to avoid that depopulation, particularly in the north west.  CAP should involve targeting certain areas.</p> <p>   A friend of mine is a plant geneticist and he always makes a simple point that Ireland's advantage is that we are good at grass.</p><p>This is a natural grass-growing environment.  Grain is a grass and, while we should not leave land uncovered, we should use grain to feed animals.  We might consider feeding grain to human beings and then look for direct connections between high quality arable farming and the consumer, with our neighbours in the United Kingdom.  There is a market for it.  It would be more efficient than feeding a cow to produce the protein we need.  The maths, physics, ener0gy and ethics associated with food production suggest a grain-based diet is what we should go for.  We could be really good at it.</p></speech>

Television coverage and web streaming are also adversely affected.</p><p>I welcome the stakeholders and thank them for their patience while we dealt with some issues in private session.  Today's topic is the apparent shortage of substitute teachers throughout the State and issues related to recruitment and retention which are important in the functioning of the top class education system which the country aspires to have.  I highlight my use of the word &quot;apparent&quot;.  The issue of the shortage of substitute teachers was raised with the joint committee last November by Ms Margaret Conlon and the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association, CPSMA.  Prior to these items of correspondence and apart from anecdotal evidence, the committee had had no formal communication on this matter and not undertaken a study of this topic.  We decided to list it as a matter of priority in our work programme for 2018 and schedule a meeting with stakeholders as early as possible.  The purpose of the meeting is to establish from the stakeholders the level of any shortage and whether it is ongoing or temporary.  Therefore, the use of the word &quot;apparent&quot; is to indicate to all participants that the committee is approaching the meeting with an open mind and has not prejudged the outcome prior to hearing from the stakeholders.  Had the meeting been about the topic of &quot;the shortage of substitute teachers&quot;, it could have been suggested the committee had already found through research that there was a shortage, rendering the meeting unnecessary.  Sometimes, as in this case, the use of certain terminology can be misinterpreted unintentionally, but the use of the word &quot;apparent&quot; was necessary.  I hope I have clarified the matter, but I will be happy to include a note on it.</p><p>We have received a number of written submissions from other bodies.  They will be included in our consideration of our report.  We will hold a second public hearing on the issue, to which we will invite other interested and relevant stakeholders.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Ger Curtin, president of the ASTI; Ms Deirdre O'Connor, assistant general secretary of the INTO; Mr. Paul Byrne, past president of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD; Mr. P&aacute;iric Clerkin, CEO of the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN; Mr. Seamus Mulconry, general secretary of the CPSMA; Ms Breda Corr, general secretary of the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE; Mr. D&oacute;nal &Oacute; hAinif&eacute;in, cathaoirleach of An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, COGG; Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc, director of the Teaching Council; and Ms Joan Russell, director of school support services in Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI.</p><p>We have received numerous requests from many of the participating organisations to include second speakers.  As a committee, we decided at our previous meeting to limit every organisation to one delegate.  The delegations will understand why.  It is important that every organisation and stakeholder have an opportunity to make its opinions known.  Time is important.  If we want to issue an efficient and timely report, we need to be able to maximise use of the time available to us.  I will invite each delegate to make a brief opening statement of a maximum of three minutes duration, which will be followed by engagement with members.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call on Mr. Curtin to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Where we come from, it is not an apparent but an actual shortage.  According to school managements and the State Examinations Commission, it is difficult to recruit people to handle oral and practical examinations, for example.  The main reason is that schools cannot find substitute teachers to cover for those teachers while they are out.  This is a real problem and the evidence cannot be doubted.  Schools cannot afford to release teachers because of the shortage of substitutes.</p> <p>  Recruitment is, undoubtedly, an issue.  A major reason is the unequal pay scales.  It has gone on for too long.  The system has been in operation since 2011 and is restrictive.  Quite a number of young people who are qualifying as teachers are choosing not to work in the State because of the unequal pay scales.  Casualisation is also an issue.  Reference is made continually to young teachers starting on a salary of &euro;36,000.  That is grand if teachers are on full hours, but many of our new teachers are on fewer hours.  Recruitment agencies go to colleges to recruit the best young teachers who then move abroad where they can be on full salaries and full hours.  This is causing a serious problem.  The level of casualisation is unbelievable.  If a young teacher qualifies at the age of 24 years, he or she will only reach the top of the salary scale at the age of 51 years.  That is outrageous and impossible.</p> <p>  The volume of reform and work is also an issue for younger teachers entering the profession.  The work overload, the intensity of that work and the austerity measures are starting to pile up.</p> <p>  A lack of promotional posts is another issue.  Teachers see a way in and a 27-point salary scale, but they do not see an opportunity to be promoted until they are well into their teaching careers.  It is a pity that budget 2018 did not follow through on budget 2017 in that regard.</p> <p>  A supplementary panel needs to be implemented as quickly as possible, as recommended in the Ward report.</p> <p>  There is another model of shared employment for teachers in different schools, particularly in specialist minority subject areas such as physics or chemistry in which there may not be a full workload for a teacher in a single school.  There is scope for that teacher to be shared.  This model has worked in ETBI schools.</p> <p>  Regarding the hours culture and casualisation, teachers need a living wage.  Why not give them a guaranteed number of hours per week?</p> <p>  Retention is emerging as a serious issue.</p><p>Unfortunately, I hear too many teachers use the expression, "I cannot wait to get out".  The recruitment of retired teachers to take up teaching positions in specialist subject areas has been proposed.  Why would teachers return to the education system when they cannot wait to get out of it?  The other problem with bringing retired teachers back into the system is that doing so-----</p></speech>

I will address the shortage of substitute teachers and the broader issue of teacher supply.  I am pleased to note the joint committee is approaching with an open mind the question of whether there is a crisis in substitution teaching.  Our job is to convince members that this is a real problem in primary schools and we have presented clear evidence to support this view in our written submission.</p> <p>  To give a snapshot of the current position, INTO's "sub-search" facility shows that the number of schools seeking substitute teachers exceeds the number of qualified teachers available.  For example, the facility showed today that 15 teachers are available for 50 jobs, comprising substitute posts, maternity leave positions and fixed-term posts until the end of the year.  These figures refer only to regular absences as opposed to casual absences that arise when a teacher falls sick in a given week. </p> <p>  A survey of school principals by our colleagues in the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, found that schools were experiencing difficulty in sourcing substitute teachers in the early part of the current school year and this difficulty persists.  Every day, we speak to principals and teachers working in primary schools that are experiencing a real shortage of substitute teachers.</p> <p>  The issues of a reliable supply of substitute cover and proper regulation of teacher supply have been of great concern to the INTO for some time.  Our submission details evidence of the problem, including testimony from primary school principals who have indicated how the shortage of substitute teachers impact their schools daily.  Principals speak of dividing classes and using special education teachers to cover for teacher absences.  The submission also refers to the moment when every primary school teacher's heart sinks as the classroom door opens at 9.15 a.m. and seven additional children arrive for the rest of the day carrying bags, coats and chairs.  These approaches to covering for teacher absences are inadequate and unsustainable.</p> <p>  The wider issue of teacher supply is a complex one, which is addressed in the Striking the Balance report.  A number of factors are contributing to the current substitute teacher shortage.  We share the concerns expressed by Mr. Curtin regarding cuts in teachers' pay since 2011, particularly for new entrants.  These cuts are having an impact on teachers who are taking the decision to move abroad to work.  Accommodation costs are another factor.  We have anecdotal evidence of teachers agreeing to move to Dublin to take up a vacancy caused by maternity leave and then deciding two or three days later to decline the post because they cannot secure accommodation.  </p> <p>  On possible solutions, the Minister recently announced, as a short-term measure, a decision to remove the cap on the number of days a teacher on career break can substitute.  While this is a welcome decision, a second proposed solution, involving the imposition by schools of restrictions on career breaks, addresses a non-existent problem.  We do not have evidence that year-long posts in primary schools are not being filled.  Posts of one year's duration are being filled and offer a valuable route to permanent positions for primary teachers through contracts of indefinite duration and-or the supplementary panel system.</p></speech>

The brief submission prepared by the NAPD is based on the valuable work being done by the association on addressing the practical needs of its members in securing qualified substitute teachers.  In compiling the report, cognisance was given to the 2017 technical working group report, Striking the Balance &ndash; Teacher Supply in Ireland.<br/><br/>As members will have seen from the introduction to the submission, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals has been representing the voice of school principals since 2008.  They will also have noted that the NAPD has been working in partnership with Mr. Kyle McLoughlin of Posude Limited since 2014 to create and maintain a national substitute database in the form of <i>SubTeacher.ie</i>.  This system is now a valuable resource for post-primary schools in sourcing substitute teachers.  The operation of the database for the past three years has yielded a valuable set of statistics on the number of substitute teachers sought by schools and the number of substitute teachers available by subject and location.  Regular analysis of the data shows a significant discrepancy between the number of teachers sought and the number available and allows us to drill into where the shortages in substitute teachers are being experienced. <br/><br/>As a deputy principal of a school of 650 pupils, I can state from first-hand experience that there is a serious shortage of substitute teachers in many subject areas.  At times of peak demand, it is sometimes not possible to source a sufficient number of substitute teachers to cover classes.  The reasons for this shortage, which are set out in the submission, correspond with the findings of the technical working group report of 2015.  They also include more recent changes in post-primary schools, which have affected the numbers of teachers available for substitution work.<br/><br/>Demands for substitution created by teacher participation in continuing professional development and work for the Professional Development Service for Teachers, the junior cycle for teachers and the State Examinations Commission have exacerbated the problem.  Our submission suggests some possible short-term and longer-term solutions which could help to alleviate the current challenges in the area of teacher supply, recruitment and retention.<br/><br/>The lack of teacher supply is one of the biggest stress points for all stakeholders in education.  To this end, I wish the joint committee every success in its work on this issue.  I thank members again for inviting me to speak on behalf of the NAPD and I will endeavour to provide clarity on any areas of our submission on which they may seek clarification.</p></speech>

I confirm that this shortage is among the most pressing issues affect primary schools and school leaders.  While many schools have had significant difficulty finding available and suitably qualified substitute teachers, certain school types have severe difficulty in doing so.  They include Gaelscoileanna, special schools, island schools, those located in remote areas and one-teacher schools.</p> <p>  There is direct evidence that the position has become increasingly challenging and is getting worse over time.  This is confirmed by the IPPN's consultation with school leaders, both directly at our conferences and in surveys we undertook on substitute teacher availability in 2015, 2016 and 2018.  Our most recent survey in January confirmed that 42% of schools had failed on ten or more occasions to find a substitute teacher since September.  The Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, also reports that 90% of its schools have experienced difficulty finding substitutes since September 2017.  The Teaching Council report, Striking the Balance, also noted significant issues with regard to primary education, including that only 64% of absences were claimed for by schools.  A key conclusion in the report noted "significant concerns regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the current substitute teacher system" and stated "there is a risk that this dysfunction can have a negative impact on the quality of pupil learning."  The IPPN shares these concerns.  Schools, particularly principals, are dealing with the shortfall and its consequences.</p> <p>  The biggest impact of the shortage of substitute teachers is on children whose learning suffers, particularly in the case of longer-term absences.  There is a workload impact on the principal, which means his or her attention is drawn away from leading teaching and learning.  In the case of the 59% of teaching principals, the position is much worse as their teaching also suffers.</p> <p>  Schools are considering revising policies affecting teachers' professional learning opportunities such as career breaks, extra personal vacation days, secondments and job-sharing.</p><p>Principals are making decisions that are frankly distasteful such as asking resource teachers to cover for absences, teaching classes themselves, splitting classes and, in extreme cases, hiring unqualified or partially qualified people to teach pupils.  This is far from ideal.  Understandably, parents ask challenging questions and there are no easy answers.<br/><br/>There are a number of potential solutions that would at least alleviate the shortage of substitute teachers over the next few years while the crisis is at its worst.  The first is supply teacher panels to ensure trained subs are available regionally.  This would offer security to new graduates and provide cover for the leadership days of teaching principals.  Restoring pay equality for new entrants to the profession would also help retain newly qualified teachers in Ireland.  The IPPN strongly believes that the teaching practice element of the fourth year should be considered as an internship.  This would allow for greater flexibility in the redeployment of host teachers, including to cover for their colleagues' absences.  Teachers who are job sharing should be allowed to provide substitute cover outside of their existing contracted hours should they so wish.  They are currently prohibited from doing so if their contract is in their school.  Clearing redeployment panels earlier and ensuring all teachers seeking work register with <i>educationposts.ie</i>and TextaSub would also help.  The Department has taken a number of measures to address the issues relating to the shortage of substitute teachers in the short term.  However, more needs to be done if schools are to see an improvement in the challenges they face in this regard, especially in the longer term.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.151" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Mulconry" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018022000002#H00300"><p>The CPSMA is very grateful to the committee for highlighting the critical issue of the lack of substitute teachers in primary schools and for the opportunity to present to the committee.  There are three points I wish to make.  First, the committee's letter of invitation referred to the apparent shortage of qualified substitute teachers throughout the State.  Both the work of the Teaching Council and our survey proved conclusively that the shortage is not apparent but is real.  The report entitled Striking the Balance showed that over a five-year period, one third of substitutable days were not covered.  Our own survey late last year showed that 90% of primary schools that took part in the survey reported difficulties sourcing subs and 83% found it more difficult to source a sub this year than last year.  In short, the evidence is in, the argument is over and the debate is finished.  We have a crisis in primary schools.</p> <p>  Second, the substitute crisis is having a major impact on the education system and, more importantly, the pupils in our schools, particularly the most vulnerable children.  It limits opportunities for teachers to avail of vital training for programmes such as the FRIENDS for Life and Incredible Years in DEIS schools.  These are programmes aimed at promoting resilience in pupils who need it most.  Without substitute teachers, teaching principals cannot take their principal release days.  These days are vital for principals to complete essential school management, administration and leadership tasks.</p> <p>  The third and most important point is that we need urgent action now to alleviate the issue and this will demand resources.  At the very minimum, we need a targeted marketing plan to get registered retired teachers into schools and if necessary, financial inducements to encourage them back into the workforce.  Like so much else, the substitute crisis is a reflection of the lack of investment in primary school education.  We are now spending less per pupil than Donald Trump's America.  It is time to invest in primary education.</p></speech>

I will not be able to stay for the second round as I have to go to an appointment.  Obviously, it is extremely clear that equal pay and investment can turn this situation around.  In terms of all of us continuing to advocate for this and support the groups that advocate for it, one of the things that stood out for me was teacher sharing.  I do not know whether that would be across different schools in different regions, so could somebody tell me what it looks like in practice and what is needed to make it a reality?  I think Mr. Curtin mentioned it.</p> <p>  The other issue was the supply panels.  I know this seems really straightforward but, again, what does that look like and how can it bring about some change in the interim while the other bigger fights and the big picture are happening?  I picked up on Mr. Mulconry's point about the impact on pupils.  I know we need to support our teachers, but last year my daughter was in her leaving certificate year and was without Irish for three months in a DEIS school that would already struggle in terms of reaching certain points to be able to progress.  My daughter was left with no substitute and the school did not split the pupils into different classes either, so the class was literally left idle during that hour and told to go off and study.  This was significant for me in looking at how the teacher substitution situation is having an impact, especially in those crucial years such as junior or leaving certificate.  Does anyone have any other comment?  Have people looked at how it has had an impact on pupils?  I do not know whether it would be too early for research into it but are people looking at the links between poorer outcomes for some schools or pupils based on this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018022000002#H00800"><p>Unfortunately, I must go the Chamber to speak on the national development plan later on.  I will stay here as long as I can but I must go when the debate starts.  I thank those who have presented so far and look forward to hearing from the rest.  I know those who have already spoken have said that there is no doubt that there is a crisis.  I think Mr. Mulconry used the word "crisis" and also referred to the fact that the Teaching Council carried out the survey.  Perhaps Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc would outline the extent of the crisis and how it manifests itself from the survey carried out by the Teaching Council.  It is important that we have a full picture of what is happening.  Clearly, as Senator Ruane just said, there are shorter-term and longer-term issues, the longer-term issues being pay equalisation, trying to attract teachers who have gone abroad and increasing supply through training.  With regard to shorter-term issues, I was also interested to hear a bit more about the supply teaching panels.  It would seem to be a fairly straightforward thing to do, so perhaps somebody could expand on what needs to be done there.</p> <p>  I spoke to a primary school principal this morning who told me she made 46 phone calls because a teacher had rung in to say she was sick and could not come in.  Ms O'Connor made the point that the short-term filling of posts in particular is a real difficulty.  The principal later texted me to say that she still has not got somebody for tomorrow because that teacher will be out again tomorrow, so that illustrates the seriousness of the issue.</p> <p>  In respect of subjects in post-primary education and the specific subjects where the witnesses have told us shortages exist, can this committee do anything in that regard, for example, with regard to those who educate people in languages, home economics, etc.?  I think there is only one college for home economics.  Can this committee make specific recommendations about increasing numbers of people in those colleges?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018022000002#H00900"><p>I thank everyone for their presentations.  It is obvious to me that pay is the big issue for new teachers coming through.  Why would someone opt to stay here?  Even if they did opt to stay, I can see why they would go abroad after a year or two because not only are they on lower pay, they probably also have a much larger class size, have to battle for everything, for example, resource hours or special needs assistants for children who need them, and cannot find anywhere to live that is affordable.  Of course, people are going to leave.</p> <p>  We must address not just pay but some of the other issues around funding.  I think Mr. Mulconry touched on the fact that we must start taking it seriously and look at the class size issue.  I do not know the witnesses' experience but I regularly meet parents who cannot get a special needs assistant or resource hours even though we are constantly told that they have been increased.  Housing is a different topic, but obviously it has an impact on that sector because people cannot afford to live here, particularly in Dublin and especially when they are on far lower pay than their colleagues.</p><p>I want to ask two things.  There is a teacher shortage, yet so many teachers are not getting full-time hours and are on fixed-term contracts.  Will the witnesses explain and expand on that?  We hear of teachers who get a year somewhere but also of a teacher shortage.  How is that the case?  Is it because of the subject?</p><p> I would also like to get the witnesses' opinions on special allowances for students, particularly in post-primary where they are in the leaving certificate cycle.  From transition year onwards they are being left without adequate qualified teachers.  I believe some kind of allowance should be given.  It should not be expected that students should have to do their leaving certificate without proper teaching hours.  If that idea were suggested and pushed, would it help to arrive at solutions for the situation?</p><p> I feel angry as a parent to be expected to send children into a school but they are not getting the same chance as somebody in a school two miles down the road.  We are supposed to put up with that.  We need to send a message to parents that they need to start fighting this campaign as well and not leave it up to the teachers and teachers' unions.  Parents need to say this is not good enough.  We are giving our kids a lesser chance than someone two or three years before them.  Many parents are involved but there is a greater role for them to play.</p></speech>

We all know this.  I am grateful to the bodies for the submissions.  I used them in my party's Private Member's motion in the D&aacute;il a number of weeks ago.  It was extremely useful.  All the answers are there.  I would like the witnesses' response on this.  Mr. Brian Mooney outlined the problem in <i>The Irish Times</i>last September.  He said there are no plans to rectify this situation.  He also said nobody seems to be willing to take responsibility.  That is the truth.  Nobody in the Irish State education administration seems to take this problem seriously.  We had an interim report from the Teaching Council on teacher supply in 2015.  A final report landed on the desk of the then Minister, Deputy O'Sullivan, at the end of 2015.  After much pressure by me and others, it was published last year.  It is scandalous.  There was meant to be a forum on teacher supply in May this year.  It was brought forward because of the pressure we applied in the D&aacute;il a few weeks ago.  However, that does not show any seriousness about this.</p><p>We are sacrificing the education of our children because nobody is taking responsibility for this.  We are sending children into classes with no teacher.  We are sending students into teacher training at high cost with no guarantee of a job at the end.  The whole system is a mess.  Will any of the witnesses tell me who, other than the Minister for Education and Skills, has any responsibility for this?  This has to end.  If this committee does not end this crisis, put forward solutions and make the decision-makers take this seriously, then we have failed in our role.  They have to take this seriously.  That is why I am speaking like I am today.  It is unusual for me.  I do not speak like this normally.  However, this is such a crisis that a message has to get home to the powers that be that this has to be sorted out.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulconry cut straight to the chase, if he does not mind me saying that.  The word "crisis" has jumped out at me from all contributions.  It is disappointing it has got to this point.  When did the red light start flashing on this issue?  How long have the witnesses been knocking on the Department's door highlighting there was a problem coming down the track?</p> <p>  It is especially sickening and sad that, as someone mentioned in the contributions, it is our children, and our most vulnerable children at that, who are losing out.  That is unforgivable of the Department.  It is not fair on the teachers and all those who work in the school environment either.  Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc mentioned the idea of a working group or forum to look into this issue.  We have a problem here and we need a two track approach to try to solve that problem.  One is a forum to look at the entire teaching profession, where it is or is not going and all the issues surrounding that in respect of recruitment, retention, pay and conditions, early retirement etc.  The other approach needs immediate action, not tomorrow or next week but today.  I would like to know what three issues the witnesses would like the Minister to address immediately.</p> <p>  Have we any data on how many teachers are working aboard?  I know many people are going out to Dubai and other locations.  I spoke to a father yesterday who told me his daughter has been out there the past two years.  She is now looking to stay a third year.  Her week starts on a Sunday and finishes on a Friday.  Her accommodation is paid, all utility bills are paid, she gets great holidays and all of her salary is tax free.  If she does additional courses, she gets additional remuneration for that.  That is what we are competing with.  Have we any data in respect of how many teachers are out there and are there any ideas about what package we could put together to attract those people back?  I will have other questions but I will wait for the contributions of the front row.</p></speech>

I was a post-primary teacher for 20 years and am a former member of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI.  In my experience as a teacher I have worked side by side in the classroom with teachers who received unequal pay for the work they did.  That was not right.  It will remain an uphill battle for Government to recruit or retain teachers when that fundamental injustice is being done to young teachers.</p><p>The entire teaching profession has been devalued in recent years.  Where we were once a nation proud of our education system, we are now educating children to force them to emigrate.  Why would they want to teach in those conditions?  Why would anyone want to teach side by side with someone like me who has been there for 20 years and get treated differently?  New teachers come in full of new ideas, new initiatives and energy, and willing to do all of the extracurricular activities and more because they are new.  What is happening in our education system is appalling.</p><p>What are the witnesses' opinions on the Minister's brainwave to incentivise certain subjects, as reported in <i>The Irish Times </i>in early January of this year?  That is further inequality within teaching when we are trying to address shortages of teachers due to inequality.  What are the professional opinions of the witnesses on that?  On the subject of retired teachers coming back into the classroom, are they Garda vetted?  As a member of the Teaching Council, I was asked three years ago to get Garda vetted because I was not initially when I qualified.  I had no problem doing that.  It is what is done.  Are the retired teachers Garda vetted?  What safety is there for our children?</p><p>In respect of the post-primary oral exams, do we know if principals have been forced to say &quot;no&quot; to teachers looking for experience as an oral examiner?  It helps a teacher to be an oral examiner.  I would say it is crucial and every teacher should do it once to help their students prepare for the junior or leaving certificate.  Have principals agreed to release teachers and are they just dreading that oral exam fortnight?  Have students been surveyed on the impact of teacher shortages on them?</p><p>In regard to the whole-school evaluation in management, leadership and learning, WSE-MLL, perhaps we should be suggesting to the inspectors it is time they added to those questionnaires that go out to parents and students as well as the three-day intensive inspection of teaching practices.  What impact do teacher shortages and the lack of supply have on the education of students and what impact is it having on schools?  Maybe that is a question that should be on the whole-school evaluation if we are going to be talking about quality education.</p><p>If we gave feedback to the Minister it might make him act on it.</p><p> Should a different salary scale apply in Dublin and possibly other cities?  I know many recently qualified teachers in both primary and secondary schools.  They have completed their first year and have got a permanent job in year two.  They are saying, "That's it.  I'm out of here because I have no quality of life.  I'll have to leave my permanent job."  The decision is whether to leave the country or to go to a different part of the country, but they have to throw away a permanent job.  Should something be done there?  I would be interested to hear the witnesses' different opinions on that.</p></speech>

I have a few questions, including one for Mr. &Oacute; hAinif&eacute;in, which I might ask now because I might not be here when he makes his presentation.</p> <p>  We acknowledge the problems related to shortages, substitutes etc.  However, 5,000 full-time jobs have been created in the past two years.  Is this adding to the problem in that people are in permanent jobs?  Does that mean they are not available for substitute teaching?  I am involved in a school and we found that some people we approached to come as substitutes had been offered jobs.  I believe there has been an increase of approximately 8,900 in permanent jobs since 2012.</p> <p>  I was on the ETB in Limerick with Mr. &Oacute; hAinif&eacute;in and I know has a great interest in Irish.  On the expansion of Irish, how can we encourage Irish to be taught in the schools?  I ask him to comment on the standard of Irish teaching.  I will pick up the reply later.

Dar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; ceisteanna &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de a bheidh ag teacht an&iacute;os ar ball.  Deputy Catherine Martin touched on the issue of Garda vetting.  I know that in some cases exasperated principals have to turn to bringing in somebody who does not have a full qualification for teaching.  What is the issue regarding Garda vetting in that kind of scenario if somebody is being brought in with some other qualification?  What types of qualifications are taken on board in that scenario?  Is it a case of just trying to find anybody in the community who might be able to cover and mind a class for a day?  Is that what happens and how often does it happen?</p> <p>  Over the years I have spoken to people teaching with the ETBs on contracts of indefinite duration.  There seems to be a practice of not giving people enough hours to make them permanent.  They find it very frustrating and it is driving them out of the profession.  I am not sure if that is the witnesses' experience, but it has certainly been raised with me.</p> <p>  For those with limited hours particularly at second level who are asked to travel between schools, little consideration is given to the time spent on the road travelling between schools.</p> <p>  I concur with many of the other points made and will not rehearse them.  We have talked about our teachers going abroad, but obviously there are teachers coming here from other countries.  Is there an issue with recognition of teaching qualifications of teachers from other countries who may be working in other types of work who could possibly teach here?  I know some of them may not yet be fluent in Irish, but some of them may well be.</p></speech>

We do not need to look back very far.  A pilot programme of supply panels for primary schools was established in the 1990s.  It basically allocated a teacher for a number of other teachers who were working.  I think the figure was about 35 or 38.  For every 35 teachers there was a supply teacher and they were placed on panels.  The panels were administered locally by a principal in a particular school and everybody knew that principal was in charge of the supply panel.  A school with a vacancy for a casual substitute for up to about three weeks would ring up that principal seeking a substitute and the principal dispatched the substitute to go to the school.</p> <p>  There were two things about it.  At the time we did not have the clear regulation we have now about qualified teachers.  It was a way of ensuring that qualified teachers were teaching.  That is still an issue.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh referred to trying to find whoever could possibly do it to come into the school.  We cannot have unqualified personnel coming in to babysit or mind our children; that is not sustainable from an educational point of view.  The supply panel system ensured that qualified teachers were going into schools.  It also provided security of employment for substitute teachers because they were paid the full salary for the year and were available to teach.</p> <p>  The scheme was reviewed.  I urge the members of the committee to go back and look at the Talbot report on the supply panels.  It is sometimes presented that supply panels were an expensive way to go.  While they are more expensive than just providing substitution on a day-to-day basis, the Talbot report was very clear that terminating them was not the way to go.  It recommended that they should be reviewed, reconfigured and improved to provide substitute cover.</p> <p>  Unfortunately in 2010 and 2011 those panels were simply abolished.  It was a matter of controversy here - there was a debate in the Seanad.  When did we realise it was going to be a big crisis?  It was probably in 2010 or 2011 when those supply panels were reduced.</p> <p>  Some of the issues with the supply panels related to their administration.  Things have moved on in the years since that report was compiled.  One of the issues was about how long it took for the teachers to be contacted and get out to their schools in the morning.  However, we now have social media, mobile phones, the online claims system etc.  Many of the administrative issues could be addressed through modern technology.</p> <p>  We believe we should have supply panels at primary level.  They provide security of supply of substitute teachers.  They provide security of employment for those teachers and we believe that is the way to address this problem.</p></speech>

There is a certain seriousness about this in the sense that it impacts on subject choice.  That also ties in with Deputy Catherine Martin's question about parents' concerns.  The National Parents Council Post Primary stated:</p><blockquote>Clearly the subject choice available to students around the Country is limited if teachers cannot be recruited in certain subject areas and service to students is inevitably negatively affected if serving teachers choose to leave the profession for other forms of employment.</blockquote> <p>Therefore it has an impact.  Let me talk about my subject, physics.  I might have ten periods of physics in my school.  A neighbouring school may not have a physics teacher and may have a cohort of students who wish to do the subject.  That has potential.  That was addressed in the Ward report in September 2014; it was issue 5 on the shared employment of teachers between two schools.  The report stated:</p><blockquote>I therefore recommend that a system be devised whereby teachers are permitted to split their employment between two schools in appropriate cases and that a scheme be formulated to allow for such shared employment to be put in place on a pilot basis.</blockquote> <p>I agree with Deputy Martin that the teaching profession has been devalued by having teachers on unequal pay in our classrooms.  That is impacting on the morale among the profession across the country.  Having incentives for certain subjects will create another inequality that we do not need.  Why would a teacher of physics get a grant when a teacher of history does not get one because there are more history teachers than physics teachers?  It is outrageous and wrong.  All teachers should be on equal pay.<br/><br/>I am not sure about a different salary scale for teachers in cities.  Where I work it is a travel allowance that should be considered.</p><p>I teach in Finglas.  There are teachers travelling from Navan, Newbridge, Wicklow, Dundalk and Carlingford to the city.  One could give them a city wage but why not give them a fuel wage?  It would work out the same.  It is absolutely ridiculous.</p><p> What is happening with the subject of home economics is the food companies are coming in and giving teachers a full-time job, not a few hours.  There is a better salary and greater opportunities.  Could we do something there?  In the two year PME many teachers have already completed their first year very successfully.  They are in their second year and they are taking classes.  Why not pay them?  They are doing the work.  There is nothing wrong with that.</p><p> On Deputy Thomas Byrne's comments, it looks as if there is no plan.  All we get are occasional announcements that the Department will try something such as cutting the career breaks or giving incentives in certain subject areas.  They are not solutions.  The question is whether this problem will be solved by next September.  I cannot see it being solved.  I would like it to be solved.  With regard to the notion of teachers going to Dubai, it is bigger than Dubai.  There are recruitment fairs in all our third level colleges at present and the education councils of Britain, America, Canada, Europe and the Middle East are at them.  They are all offering full-time jobs and full salaries.  That is the reality.  There is no great push to get teachers to stay.  They are the issues.</p><p> Deputy Funchion spoke about students being without a teacher.  If I were that parent I would go ballistic as well.  It is serious because a qualified teacher is required.  If somebody's son or daughter is doing the junior certificate or leaving certificate, that person would like to know that he or she is being taught by a fully qualified teacher.  As professionals, all of us would be unhappy with that.  I would not be happy going in to teach an Irish class for the very good reason that I am not competent or qualified to teach it.  I believe parents have to get on board on this because this is very much for parents as well as for teachers.  As a profession we do not want unqualified teachers teaching students in our schools.  We would have a serious concern about that.</p></speech>

This is the potential solution to the problem.  It is correct that there is an ongoing international recruitment campaign to take our teachers away from us.  We can view that as a good news story in terms of how well regarded they are internationally, which is the case.  The problem is not about career breaks and filling the fixed-term positions.  I have no evidence to show that any school has been unable to fill one of those year long fixed-term positions.  The problem is retaining our newly qualified teachers if they do not get a fixed-term position.  They are being recruited if they do not get temporary work for a year long position.  Obviously if somebody is offered a lucrative post abroad he or she will take up that position.  It is more attractive to teachers than entering into a lease agreement in one of our cities that will cost them a lot of money when they are unsure whether they will have work.</p> <p>  We know there is work for them.  It should be possible for us to work out a formula in terms of how many of these teachers we will need to serve the system on a year long basis.  At primary school level we know that a high percentage of our principals are entitled to a certain number of release days, or leadership days as I prefer to call them, in the year, so we know how many days are required for substitute cover for our principals alone.  It is possible to provide a teacher through a supply panel to five or six principals just for those days alone.  We also have facts and figures for how many teachers will be missing through maternity leave or long-term sickness leave.  I realise that having teachers on a year long contract might be more expensive than having them on the substitute rate but in terms of ensuring that we have teachers to put into every classroom, it is the solution that can work.</p></speech>

However, that is not good enough.  We are seeing an increase in the number of people who are not registered teachers making applications for vetting and two of the dioceses have complained about it.  We do not wish to be associated with that.</p></speech>

I have done it a few times now and the committee members are probably fed up with it.  However, for the benefit or people who are new to the committee, I represent boards of management of special schools and mainstream primary and post-primary schools providing education for pupils with special educational needs.  My focus will be on the special education area.  Many of the issues are the same but they are particularly serious for special schools and special education.<br/><br/>I will not rehash my submission as the members already have it.  The issues we have are short-term substitution for one, two or three days and long-term substitution for statutory leaves, which is very worrying.  We also have issues in recruiting teachers for permanent and temporary contracts.  There are no applications or no teachers for permanent contracts for a year.  That is serious.  Many of the other speakers might not be aware of that, but it is particularly acute in our sector.  The retention of teachers in special education is a concern as well.  What should be addressed in that regard is initiative planning by the powers-that-be and the restoration of posts of responsibility in special schools.  I am quite specific about that.  I will not go through all the substitution issues.  With regard to mainstream schools and the numbers for when there was no qualified substitute to be found, from Christmas to now it ranged between four and 58 days.  It was similar in special schools.  However, there is a further problem in that area because some of those schools could not get either qualified or unqualified people for those days.  That is particularly acute.<br/><br/>I detailed in my submission the short-term solutions that are found by schools.  In fact, they are not short-term and they are not solutions.  It is a grave concern that the resource teacher teaches the mainstream class, leaving those in need of greater support without that support for a period or, <i>vice versa</i>, where the mainstream teacher goes into the special class and the class is then divided.  We have a situation where, and I referred to this in the submission with regard to long-term substitution, administrative principals are endeavouring to cover classes on an almost daily basis in schools.  When do they get time to do their administrative work?  That is of grave concern to us.<br/><br/>The next issue in recruitment is securing teachers for long-term contracts.  This is not just a Dublin phenomenon.  It occurs in other places.  Some of our schools in Galway tell us they have no problem so obviously Galway is a very attractive place to live.  However, rural areas in Mayo and Sligo are finding it difficult, as is Dublin.  Some schools are not even getting an application.  Retention is a linked area and is very worrying.  It was alleviated a couple of years ago by probation being allowed to be served in special schools, and I thank the Teaching Council and others for that.  Obviously, we would have lobbied them.  However, some teachers still feel unprepared for teaching in special settings upon qualification.<br/><br/>I have suggested possible solutions.  It refers back to the substitute panel and teachers on career breaks, job-sharing teachers and retired teachers.  In my submission I refer to guaranteed placement where trainee teachers would be assigned.  I also refer to recognition of teaching qualifications from other countries and financial incentives.  The last one is the planning of initiatives and the restoration of posts of responsibility to the special education sector, because some of our schools have had severe losses even though the Department says there were restorations.</p></speech>

A number of the members of the committee raised some questions and queries that relate to the council, and I am happy to address them in the question and answer session after all the opening statements have been made.  I am joined by the chairperson of the Teaching Council, Ms Noelle Moran, who is a post-primary teacher at St. Jarlath's College in Tuam.</p> <p>  By way of background, the Teaching Council is the statutory professional standards body established to maintain and enhance professional standards in teaching and learning in Ireland.  We are responsible for promoting and regulating the profession of teaching under the Teaching Council Act.  There are almost 100,000 teachers on the register, which is the largest professional register of its kind in the country.  One of our legal functions includes advising the Minister for Education and Skills on teacher supply.</p> <p>  The council has representation from all the education stakeholders, many of whom are here today.  These include teachers, principals, school management bodies, teacher unions, parents' councils, nominees of the Minister for Education and Skills and the higher education institutions who offer programmes of initial teacher education, which all nominate members to the Teaching Council in addition to the 16 members elected by the profession itself.  We are, therefore, uniquely placed to contribute to discussions and inform decisions on teacher supply.</p> <p>  The Teaching Council has been working on teacher supply for a number of years.  At its most recent meeting earlier this year, the council discussed the matter of teacher supply and demand at some length.  This was in clear recognition of the serious challenges which schools are facing daily in securing substitute teachers at both primary and post-primary level, as well as the difficulties in filling contract posts and even permanent vacancies in certain subjects at post-primary level.</p> <p>  All stakeholders are united in their serious concern at the profound problems which have emerged and are escalating with regard to teacher supply and demand.  We are all looking for a plan of action now.  At the most recent consultation with all stakeholders, a number of issues were raised, including the need for supply panels, the resolution of pay equality, casualisation and the hours culture, and a more targeted approach by teacher education programmes to schools&rsquo; needs.  They need qualified registered teachers in classrooms.</p> <p>  We need a single body or committee to pull all the strands together into a coherent plan.  In that light, the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement of the establishment of the teacher supply steering group, which will include the Teaching Council, is a positive step forward.  It is essential that all stakeholders collaborate with the Department, the council and the Higher Education Authority to chart clear pathways to attractive and sustainable careers for teachers.</p> <p>  The report, Striking the Balance, which we produced on teacher supply in December 2015 in collaboration with the Department and the Higher Education Authority, formed the council&rsquo;s advice to the Minister.  That report has been referenced by a number of speakers and the committee this afternoon.  At a consultative forum two weeks ago, there was a resounding consensus that the recommendations of the report be implemented without delay.</p> <p>  The issues relating to teacher supply are abundantly clear.  We have many possible solutions.  We need to pull back from the crisis which threatens.  We in the council are ready to work with the Department and all stakeholders in resolving the teacher supply issue.  This will ensure that schools can recruit registered, qualified, high-calibre teachers to meet the needs of all learners.  Time is not on our side.  The solutions to the problem are there.  Let us work together on their implementation.</p></speech>

I had a lovely presentation but there are lines through everything because everyone has said everything already.  I will therefore paraphrase it.  Following a survey we conducted, last month we made a written submission on the issues we are facing in the education and training board, ETB, sector.  We welcome the opportunity to engage the committee again today, however.  We also would welcome the opportunity to work with the Teaching Council, the higher education institutions, the teachers' unions and other management bodies to devise and construct policies that will address the issue in the short term and, more importantly, in the long term.  Short-term solutions alone are not really satisfactory.</p> <p>  While ETBs are patrons of 12 primary schools, we have more than 170 post-primary schools.</p><p>The issue at primary level is substitution.  Long-term contracts are an issue at post-primary level because of the specialised subjects.  When we submitted the paper to the committee in January, we had gathered data over two different periods and the same thing stands.  There are issues with teachers of Irish, home economics, mathematics, particularly for higher level in the leaving certificate, French, Spanish, German, chemistry, physics, special education and guidance counselling.  As my colleague, Mr. D&oacute;nal &Oacute; hAinif&eacute;in, said, it is further compounded with Gaelchol&aacute;iste and Gaelscoileanna in Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht areas.  We welcome the Striking the Balance teacher supply report which was published in 2015, and is now almost three years old, as an inaugural attempt to address the issue of teacher supply.  However, it has to be acknowledged that it falls short on the issues in the post-primary sector.  We need to move on the post-primary sector urgently.  The recommendation to allocate resources to facilitate the report's implementation is fully supported by ETBI.  We will readily work in partnership to progress a solution to this crisis.</p><p> On recommendation No. 3 of the report, about gathering relevant data, much work has been done by various management bodies which would certainly act as a platform from which further work could be launched.  It is time, and even beyond time, to progress this.  It is a crisis.  As part of the submission in January, we outlined some solutions that could be explored to address the issue.  I will not continue to highlight the issue of pay and better contracts because all my colleagues have said this already.  It is crucial that the unequal pay and situation with better contracts is addressed.  It is unsustainable for us to ask teachers to take up contracts for three or four hours in the week and, at the same time, live in the current climate with the cost of living, buying a house, renting a house, buying a car, etc.  As a Corkwoman, I would not agree that those working in Dublin should get a grant but I agree with my colleague that there are issues everywhere, even in rural areas.  In County Cork, from Schull to Bantry to the north of Cork, there are huge distances to travel.</p><p> It is time to be more strategic in our planning.  When measures are identified to meet a particular need or solve a particular issue, consideration needs to be given to the long-term impact of such measures.  In particular, I am talking about such things as promotional opportunities and the moratorium on promotional opportunities in 2010.  It was a solution at the time because of the financial crisis.  However, the impact that has had on the teaching career cannot be underestimated.  Teachers have been going in and until recently, with the publication of the circular letter 03/18, there was no opportunity to be promoted within the school sector.  That has had a huge impact on teachers' careers and the profession overall.  The impact of moving guidance counsel allocation out of the ex quota position and into quota has an impact on guidance counselling and causes a lack of it.  Why would teachers pay for a course, give up their time outside of school hours and end up with a lack of security with regard to being able to use that course?</p><p> While ETBI understands the economic crisis was an issue, more strategic consideration needs to be given to measurements for the future.  I will address two more matters which are very close to my heart.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned home economics.  It is important to increase the number of home economics teachers but training should not be at just one college.  We need to look at establishing a second college.  The positioning of one college on the west coast is not really suitable for people travelling from the south west or south east of the country.  These people are being attracted into industry, an issue which was raised already.</p><p> I compliment the Teaching Council on the development of Festival of Education in Learning and Teaching Excellence, F&Eacute;ILTE, to celebrate all that is good in teaching and the sharing of best practice.  We could mirror that by promoting teaching as a career of choice, all that is good in teaching and what can be achieved in teaching.  It is an opportunity where all stakeholders could come together and promote teaching as a career choice.</p></speech>

Will anybody enlighten me?  I know when Brian Mooney wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i>, it prompted Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc to respond.  I do not know if that means that the Teaching Council is responsible for this.  I am not sure that it is but it certainly has a role.  It prompted Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc to respond at the time to say that everything was going fine.  I will be putting this forward as a recommendation, which is beside the point in a way.  Why was the report on teaching supply suppressed within the Department?  I know nobody here can answer that question but somebody sat on this report for a year and a half and, laughably, the recommendations are all out of date anyway because they talk about doing something in October 2016 or implementing something for the 2017 to 2018 year.  Somebody sat on this and the committee should endeavour to find out who sat on it and why they did so when a problem was clearly identified and has continued to be identified.  Following from the answers to this problem that the witnesses are putting forward, we need to find out why someone sat on this report and ignored it.  We need to emphasise how seriously we, and the education stakeholders, take this and the dire need for somebody, somewhere in the Department of Education and Skills to take responsibility, sort this out and do something.</p><p>Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc cannot be blamed for this steering group that was only set up a few weeks ago.  It was due to be set up a year and a half ago according to the Striking the Balance report but it was not.  Some political pressure was put on but the children in the classroom and the lack of teachers to teach them did not seem to be enough pressure on the Department.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc know why this steering group was not set up until a few weeks ago?  Why was the meeting of the steering group, which was to be held in May, brought forward to now?  Why was it decided to only schedule it for May initially?  I raised the matter of this specific report in the D&aacute;il a year ago.  I am sure other people were raising the issue of the lack of teachers and the substitute crisis in primary level, but I raised this twice in priority questions.  I need answers to that.  T&aacute; m&eacute; an-bhuartha faoi na gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;.

Measaim gur fhadhb an-mh&oacute;r &iacute; sin.</p><p>We need answers to these questions.  Ms Breda Corr has raised serious questions on special education.  I hope somebody is listening to this in the Department of Education and Skills.  As one of my colleagues said, we need to get the officials and the Minister in here as soon as possible.  They need to know that we are taking this seriously and that everybody else seems to know the answers to the questions collectively.  We know what to do.  The witnesses have all told us what to do.  Somebody, somewhere needs to distil those answers and say that we will bring it in.  I do not think anybody would argue with the list that Fianna F&aacute;il put forward in the D&aacute;il motion, which were all the witnesses' ideas, really.  Nobody would argue with them.  We did not include one or two of the more contentious ones for the sake of avoiding hassle, so that we could get something done.  There have been forums after stakeholders after meetings.  When will we sort it out and value the teaching profession, as Ms Russell said, and celebrate it?</p></speech>

How many of those 100,000 are teaching in schools today?  For those who have left and wish to come back, I know the one dread in a teacher's life is if he or she has missed the deadline to renew his or her registration.  It is quite laborious.  Thankfully, it never happened to me but I saw what teachers had to fill out, the transcripts, etc.  Would there be any sort of leeway, if a teacher was on sick leave or wanted to come back having emigrated, to make it easier so that the teacher would not have to face the incredible amount of documentation that has to be gathered if he or she is considering returning to the teaching profession in Ireland?  I forgot to ask Mr. Paul Byrne a question on jobsharing.  Teachers feel frustration about it and it might be a disincentive to staying.</p><p>When teachers apply for job-sharing and it is granted by the school, often it is so that they can spend time with their children or some other personal reason.  They might say that they need perhaps three afternoons off so that they can pick up their child after work.  School A has no problem with allowing for it in the timetable but school B will say that the teacher is on every afternoon for the year.  The principal says the timetable threw it up and that it was outside his or her control.  Is there a standardised system that could be given to principals and deputy principals?  I know some teachers who are considering leaving the profession or taking early retirement because their request was not granted and they perceive an injustice as other schools seem to be able to handle it no problem.</p><p> Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas as an gcur i l&aacute;thair faoin nGaeilge inniu.

I get the sense that there has been an increase and that it has been a means to an end.  This is possibly the case in the ETBs, in particular, where they have had to do it because of the means available.  Therefore, many teachers have fewer than 18 hours and find themselves in a precarious situation.  Do the facts stack up in that regard?  Has there been an increase in the number of teachers in those situations?</p> <p>  Aonta&iacute;m go hioml&aacute;n leis an Uasal &Oacute; hAinif&eacute;in maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaelscola&iacute;ochta.  &Oacute; thaobh shol&aacute;thar m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus na pain&eacute;al reatha at&aacute; ann, feiceann muid go bhfuil fadhb ansin agus go bhfuil scoileanna teoranta &oacute; thaobh glacadh le daoine &oacute; na pain&eacute;al at&aacute; ann i l&aacute;thair na huaire.

This is primarily a primary level solution.  As I said already, I will speak on the national development plan.  In the education section of the plan, there is reference to demographic growth.  We all know that this has been significant in recent years and that it will continue.  It is estimated that there will be an extra 1 million people in Ireland during the timeframe of the plan.  Further, the Department of Education and Skills has a section that deals with demographic planning etc.  As Senator Byrne said before she left, there has been an increase in the actual number of teaching positions.  This will have to continue if we are to keep the pupil-teacher ratios as they are or improve them as time goes on.</p> <p>  If we are to have a supply panel as well, we clearly need more teachers in addition to the extra numbers we need to meet demographic growth.  It is probably an issue for the Department of Education and Skills rather than anyone here but we need to quantify the numbers in some way and go about finding solutions.  We have all been talking about various solutions in terms of pay, bringing people back, and raining more teachers etc.  I do not know if anyone has an answer to it but we need to focus on trying to quantifying in some way how one would set up supply teacher panels.</p> <p>  If Mr. &Oacute; hAinif&eacute;in does not mind, I will put the next question in English.  Will he expand on the difficulty of getting people who can teach the subjects as well as speak the language in post-primary Gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;?</p></speech>

I apologise to Mr. Paul Byrne who had his hand up but I did not see it.  I am glad Deputy Martin asked a question of him because I would have gone back to him anyway.  Further, if anyone has any further comments to make in writing, please send them to the clerk and they will be circulated to the committee.  We will be having another hearing on this issue and cannot make recommendations until we have finished it but we are interested in hearing further from the witnesses.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their written submissions, opening statements and clear and practical recommendations.  That is essential because there is a short-term problem and a long-term problem.  There is no doubt that the figures speak for themselves and, without a shadow of a doubt, we have reached crisis stage at this point in time.  Although we will have another meeting, I suggest that we write to the Department in the meantime and ask why there was a delay in the implementation of the report.  We will also ask the Minister and his officials to attend our next meeting.  At the end of the day, the buck stops with the Minister and those in his Department and we must be able to ask the Minister the hard questions.  We will discuss that further at another time.</p> <p>  It is shocking to think that the country spends so much money training our teachers and ensuring they get a top class education and then more or less encourage them to go abroad to take up positions.  I recently met a young couple who had been teaching in a secondary school in my town of Newbridge.  They went abroad last September purely to try to make money to be able to buy a house.  They came home at Christmas time to get married and have now gone back.  We are exporting our brightest young people.  Both of those are fantastic teachers.  I have seen them in the classroom setting and know the extra gifts they brought to their school community.  We, the Department and the Minister have to deal with this.  Young people cannot be blamed for going away to raise money.  Given the problems with pay parity, escalating rent costs and how lucky people are to be able to get a mortgage, it is very difficult for them and their situations must be dealt with.  Everyone has mentioned the pay equity issue, which is hugely important, and the witnesses' evidence speaks volumes.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin raised the issue of teachers who want to come back from abroad re-registering with the Teaching Council.  I am aware of new teachers who had been offered roles but had problems completing their registration and could not take up the positions as a result.  It seemed to be a big problem for those who were coming to me and I have no doubt other people experienced the same situation.  Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc might address the issue.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Byrne.</p></speech>

One aspect is job-sharing itself, where two teachers will be offered 11 hours each.  Second, if a combination of subjects is advertised, for example, Irish and English or Irish and history, but no one applies for it, it may be necessary due to the shortage of teachers to advertise two shorter-hour jobs in order to fill the positions.  It must be remembered that it is necessary to put a qualified teacher in the subject area in front of classes.  That said, it is in our interest to bring teachers from, say, 16 hours up to as close to 22 hours as possible, and few, if any, finish up without the full 22 hours for many weeks of the year.</p><p>Sometimes the allocation from the Department is 0.5 of a teacher, which equates to 11 hours.  Therefore, there is no conscious effort to keep teachers on short hours.  We are trying to do our best to bring them as close as possible to 22 hours.  When a contract of indefinite duration becomes available, if a teacher is on 18 hours, he or she is automatically brought up to 22.  If he or she is on 12 hours or above, he or she will be brought up to 18.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Catherine Martin's question about timetabling and job sharing arrangements, realistically the timetable serves students and the school first.  When the timetable has been devised, what happens is that if one can make a change to accommodate a teacher, one will make it, but the priority is to look after the students first.</p><p> On fewer teachers coming through the system, while schools have advertised for qualified teachers, they cannot recruit them.  They then employ young graduates who teach as unqualified teachers for four days a week.  I know from speaking to these teachers that the reason they have not proceeded to take the two-year postgraduate diploma in education course is they cannot afford to take it because of the fees charged and the cost of accommodation for two years.  Instead, they will teach as unqualified teachers, either in Ireland or abroad, to get the money to obtain their postgraduate qualifications.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Martin stated incentivising teachers to teach in certain subject areas would lead to the creation of inequality.  We are at crisis point and finding it impossible to recruit Irish teachers.  God help the poor gaelscoileanna which cannot find teachers to teach different subjects through Irish.  The teaching of the Irish language has to be incentivised and one can do so in a number of ways.  The fees for the first year of the postgraduate course could be paid for students to entice them to take it; in the second year they could be employed for up to 12 hours and paid properly.  That might get over the problem of their not being able to afford to take the course.</p><p> There is no teacher in any school who has not been vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

We have identified where the crunch areas are by using the statistics.  However, what has not been factored in is that when the professional development time was introduced for the new junior cycle programme and the number of teaching hours went from 22 hours to 21 hours and 20 minutes, it actually took the guts of 700 teachers to fill the time gap.  For example, if one has 33 teachers and reduces teaching time by 40 minutes, it means that an extra teacher has to be found.  Given that there are 738 schools in the country, that means another 700 teachers have to be recruited.</p> <p>  Senator Robbie Gallagher raised the very interesting question of what we could do.  I know that on a daily basis I am spending more and more time in searching for and employing substitute teachers.  There are a couple of things that could be done.  The State Examinations Commission requires schools to release teachers to conduct examinations in music, home economics and oral language subjects.  The practical and oral examinations are centred in one time period of the year.  I think Deputy Catherine Martin asked if any teacher's request for leave to conduct the practical examinations had been refused.  It is happening because a school does not have a suitable substitute available.  How can a principal release a teacher to work for the State Examinations Commission without having a suitable substitute in place, especially in the subject area in which students will be examined.  This issue could be addressed in a number of ways.  The State Examinations Commission could stagger examinations over the space of two years or especially in the year of the leaving certificate examinations where home economics teachers are not required at the same time as music, geography, Irish and German teachers.  Realistically, not all schools are willing and capable of releasing teachers.  Another suggestion is to move parts of the examinations to the mid-term break or Easter holiday period.  That might have an opposite effect, in that teachers might opt not to conduct the practical examinations and would have to be incentivised more.  The students would not lose a week's tuition time when their teacher became an examiner or for two to three days when their teacher was an advising examiner.  </p> <p>  I worked as an examiner for the State Examinations Commission for a number of years.  The marking conferences used to be held on a Saturday until they were moved to a Friday.  Two issues arise.  If a teacher is to act as an examiner, he or she must obtain permission from the principal.  If examinations were held during holiday time, permission would not need to be sought.  Schools are much quieter places in which to conduct examinations when one does not have the full 650 students in them as only approximately 250 students will be participating in the examinations.  That issue needs to be investigated.   </p> <p>  Circular 0006/2014 from the Department of Education and Skills prevents principals from paying fully qualified teachers for engaging in supervision and substituting duties over and above 43 hours.  This is crippling us.  There was an opt-out under the supervision and substitution scheme, whereby teachers were allowed to opt out of supervision and substituting duties in the school.  In my school 20 out of the 40 teachers will engage in supervision and substituting duties.  By April each year, some of the teachers will have completed the 43 hours, but they are quite prepared to continue to engage in corridor supervision duties for absent colleagues.  However, the facility to pay them for doing so has been removed, although the money is actually available in the school.  There would be no additional cost to the Department of Education and Skills, but section 24 of the circular prevents us from paying the teachers in question.  It would help to alleviate the problem.  If one line was removed from the circular, it would remove a great deal of stress from principals and deputy principals throughout the system.  </p> <p>  Deputy Kathleen Funchion asked about a class being left without an Irish teacher.  One may have an Irish teacher among the staff, but if he or she has completed the 43 hours, one cannot ask him or her to do any more.  However, if principals had the ability to pay a teacher who had completed his or her 43 hours to substitute for another in the short-term, it would allow them time to recruit somebody else.</p></speech>

The boards and schools were hard pushed to hold teachers in all sectors.  We do the best we can in the contracts we offer to teachers.  We give them as many hours as we possibly can.  We must remembers that both schools and the education and training boards, of behalf of which I am speaking, are governed by the circular letter which is directed by the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 in the allocation of fixed term contracts.  We have to work within the governance framework.  We are governed equally by the teacher allocation framework.  We are not permitted to work outside our teacher allocation.  That is equally important.  What cannot be lost sight of in all of this is that students' needs must dictate.  The level of student demand for particular subjects is what dictates the need for teachers in particular areas and the hours made available to them.  It is a bigger pot than just saying we are not meeting the number of hours required.  It would be disappointing to think any school in the ETB sector was purposely keeping down the number of hours available so as to avoid a situation where a teacher would be given a contract of indefinite duration, CID.  I do not think that is the case.</p> <p>  I think it was Senator Robbie Gallagher who asked what were the three issues the delegates would like the Minister to address.  Without putting too much thought into them, what came to mind first was pay equalisation, which I think is key.  The second was support in the upskilling of teachers in terms of time, pay and grants.</p><p>Support has to be available to incentivise them to become involved in upskilling and I do not mean upskilling in terms of a master's degree or career progression.  I am talking about upskilling in terms of content, pedagogy, their initial subject area or others akin to it.  We need to raise the profile of teaching in recognition of the work teachers do.  I have been out of teaching since 2003, but I am tired of picking up newspapers and seeing teachers get a battering, even though they are doing absolutely amazing work to implement the constant raft of changes coming from the Department of Education and Skills.  I have suggested three things that could raise the profile of teaching as a career choice and ask the Minister to address them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018022000002#Q00200"><p>I want to get to a couple of queries raised in the earlier session and will do so as succinctly as possible.  There are almost 100,000 teachers on the register.  The Department has the employment statistics.  Working from memory, the chief inspector's report which was launched recently stated there were approximately 60,000 full-time equivalent teachers in the primary and post-primary system.  That figure does not include the number in the further education sector which is also covered by the register.  It does not include the number of substitute teachers either, which figure could be between 15,000 and 20,000.  It can be confirmed by the Department.  The register deals with the supply of teachers who are available to work in the system.  Working from memory, I think there are approximately 60,000 full-time equivalent teachers in the primary and post-primary system.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to the challenge in reapplying for registration.  It is worth noting that 86% of the 98,000 teachers on the register complete their renewals online.  It is a very straightforward process.  It costs &euro;65 before tax, or roughly &euro;38 after the tax credit is allowed for.  A specific provision in the Act requires anyone who falls off the register for any reason to go through the full reapplication process.  Obviously, we would have no objection if the Minister or the Department were to see fit to amend that part of the Act.  I have explained what is provided for in the Act, as it stands.  We work very closely with people outside the State.  I will come back to that query.  Retired primary teachers who have sought in recent months to get back onto the register, perhaps having originally been trained in some of the old training colleges that are now closed, might be unable to obtain transcripts.  There is an internal process to work around that problem in cases in which people simply are unable to obtain transcripts.  While we work very hard with candidates in such situations, there are basic requirements that we must meet.  The number opting to renew online - it can be done from anywhere in the world - has been increasing for some time.  Some 86% of renewals are now completed in this way.</p> <p>  Each year we process between 3,000 and 3,500 registrations of newly qualified teachers.  It is a fast-tracked process because the higher education institutions transfer the results directly to us after the summer examinations.  The process used by newly qualified teachers to apply for registration differs from that used for standard registrations.  We issue forms to newly qualified teachers in their graduating year.  We speak to all graduating students in every college across the country throughout the academic year.  The visits are ongoing.  We outline the vetting process, the character reference form and the various other forms that must be completed.  Typically, when all of the documentation has been received, including the vetting documentation, there is a turnaround period of between two and four days in the case of an Irish registration application in respect of a newly qualified teacher in a college.  We will be more than happy to look at particular queries or representations members of the committee may have received in respect of which other issues may have arisen.  We have gone to the extent of banning staff holidays in August to ensure applications will be processed as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne raised a number of concerns.  I am happy to reassure the committee that we have been taking this problem very seriously in the five-year period since 2013.  We have been working on it for quite some time.  One part of the Striking the Balance report mentions that this problem was foreseen and emphasises the need to get a handle on the data management aspect of it, for example.</p> <p>  We were asked why the consultative forum had not been brought forward sooner.  It is very much about stakeholder engagement.  Our process of engagement with stakeholders has been predicated on the notion that we do not want short-term solutions to become long-term problems.  We are aware that if we rush into it too quickly, we could create long-term problems.  When in October we flagged the May date, broadly everyone seemed to be happy with it.  I can certainly say there were no objections to it.  When we became aware of the increasingly serious nature of the problem, we announced off our own bat that we intended to bring the date forward and this was welcomed by the stakeholders.  We are keen to maintain this united front.</p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne asked where the teaching supply steering group was going.  The terms of reference are very much a matter for the Department.  We want the standing group mentioned in the report to be established, particularly from the point of view of data management.  We have had this since the Investment in Education report of 1965 which called for ongoing and proactive management of teacher supply.  We now need to bring it to a head in line with the recommendation made in our report.  The seriousness with which the issue is being treated prompted our response to Brian Mooney's column, my response in particular.  I was not suggesting everything was hunky-dory in the garden - far from it - but I was highlighting the fact that we were making progress, even if there was a lot more to be done.</p> <p>  I can give a direct answer to Deputy Thomas Byrne's question about responsibility for teacher supply.  Our two functions under the Act are to advise the Minister formally on teacher supply and to promote and regulate the profession.  We have a legitimate interest in that regard.  It is absolutely the case that ultimate responsibility in policy terms lies with the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-20a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom&aacute;s &Oacute; Ruairc" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018022000002#Q00800"><p>A question was asked about teachers who qualified outside the State.  We treat all applicants from outside the State in accordance with the terms of the EU directive which provides for mutual recognition of qualifications received in any other state in the world.  The process thereafter may require conditions to be applied to make up for certain shortfalls.  The underlying principle is to make sure anybody on the register in Ireland has had to meet the exact same standards.  Therefore, those who qualify abroad should not have to meet lower standards than those who qualify here.  It is about fairness and equity.  That has been the common refrain, rightly so.</p> <p>  We process approximately 500 applications per annum from people who qualified outside the State.  Approximately 80% are from the United Kingdom which are typically subject to a desk-bound process, which means that there is a fairly tight turnaround time.  Approximately 10% are from other countries in which English is spoken, while the other 10% are from countries in which other languages are spoken, which means that translation costs may arise.  We have engaged with the migrant teacher project which was mentioned by the Minister in his speech in January to the Irish Primary Principals Network.  We will continue that engagement to see how the process can be streamlined further.  We are conscious of the need to review the subject criteria in terms of the granularity of the requirements.  We are also conscious of the need to look at the Teaching Council's requirements in the qualifications assessment process to see whether they can be streamlined further.</p> <p>  I am happy to add a note of clarification to the clear statements we have heard about vetting.  Under the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Teaching Council Acts, every teacher on the register has to be vetted.  In 2017 we processed 40,000 vetting applications under the e-vetting system and 12,000 vetting applications under the paper-based system.</p> <p>  Senator Robbie Gallagher spoke about data and asked how many teachers were working abroad.  One of the key issues mentioned by Ms Russell and highlighted in the report, Striking the Balance, is the need to get a better handle on data across the system.  Those on the register now provide their addresses by means of self-declaration.  The system of online renewal allows a teacher who is renewing from abroad to use his or her home address with Mammy and Daddy in Dublin or wherever it might be.  We are open to conducting a survey of the register, or perhaps particular sectors of the register, to determine where people are based.  A targeted roadshow campaign, along the lines of that mentioned by Ms Russell, might be of assistance in that regard.  We know that there is an over-supply of teachers in Northern Ireland, for example.  We also know that there are Irish teachers working in Scotland and other parts of the United Kingdom, the Middle East and other jurisdictions that have been mentioned during the meeting.</p> <p>  There is a sense that we need to get the hygiene factor - things like pay equality - sorted first in order that we can approach people with a clear narrative.  I suspect that there are people abroad who want to come home.  The system needs to make it easier for them to do so.  An online portal to have a single application point would make it easier for them to apply for jobs.  When I qualified as a teacher in 1999, I photocopied an application form 60 times and sent it to the various education and training boards.  The modern technology available should make it relatively straightforward to make the process much easier for people.  There are many ways in which we can do this, for example, by facilitating Skype interviews from abroad.  We are keen to move more and more of the council's application process online.  We want to move the initial registration application process which is currently paper-based online.  We are keen to move in that direction.  </p> <p>  I hope I have dealt with most of the queries raised by the committee.  I will be happy to take more if they arise.</p></speech>

The rights of the most vulnerable pupils are now at risk.  There is a severe shortage of teachers in this area.  My biggest concern is that mainstream schools with special classes or special schools will have enrolment issues.  We cannot afford to be back here next June giving out about the lack of teachers to fill these classrooms.  Where will these pupils go at that stage?  We are working with some of the colleges on providing for meaningful placements in special schools, or in areas of special education like resource teaching and special classes, so that teachers will be prepared.  Some of the colleges are doing this themselves.  At present, teachers are probably a bit overwhelmed when they go into special classes or special schools.  That needs to be worked on.  As I said in my submission, new initiatives need to be planned.  I think Mr. Mulconry said this earlier as well - great minds and all of that.  The restoration of posts is also essential for people going forward.</p></speech>

People have spoken about the demographic bulge which is going through the education system.  I think there is a belief in some quarters that we will allow demographics to deal with the issue of the lack of substitute teachers.  The suggestion that in approximately two years time, this will not be as big a problem is not fair to vulnerable children now, or indeed to any pupil now.  I do not think it is a policy or strategy we should adopt.  My background is in strategy rather than in education.  In strategy, one looks at the biggest threats to the system.  We have a primary school system that is working, but principals are spending far too much time dealing with administration, raising funds and searching for substitute teachers.  We need a strategy for primary education that deals with this.  Every year, we have an avalanche of new initiatives coming out.  Teachers do not have the time to take them in.  The system needs to be de-stressed a little bit.  We need a strategic plan that rolls out in a way the system can absorb.  If we do not provide for such a plan, we risk the integrity of the primary school system.  If it crashes, or if we have a revolt when teachers and principals say "enough is enough", we really will have a problem.  Substitution is an example and an indicator.  We need to tackle it to take some of the pressure off the people working in the system.</p></speech>

A colleague of mine who works in a very busy primary school in a disadvantaged area that does not have DEIS status, and therefore has no home school liaison teacher, has told me she spends one third of her time dealing with social issues.  Some of those present will be familiar with the school, Scoil na Naomh Uilig, which has an ASD unit.  It is absolutely shocking.  I do not know how principals do the job they are doing, to be honest, with everything that is coming onto their plate.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Sullivan asked how many teachers it would take to set up a supply panel.  As there are approximately 36,000 whole-time equivalent teachers in the primary system, between 1,000 and 1,100 teachers would be needed to set up supply panels.  It has to be borne in mind that this is not additionality because those days are already being covered in the system through substitution.  It is not as if there is any additionality on top.  The Striking the Balance report suggests that 5,000 teachers are needed to cover all absences and that 1,000 of them are needed to cover short-term casual absences that happen from time to time.</p></speech>

I think this proposal would need careful consideration and consultation.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on what Mr. Mulconry said by pointing out that teacher supply is the issue we are facing today but - watch this space - the supply or lack of supply of principals could be the next issue we face.  As Mr. Mulconry has outlined, the lack of resources and the constant changes make it an onerous task.  We are finding that fewer and fewer people are applying for principal positions.  I think we will have to face this issue fairly soon.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulconry summed up the strategy brilliantly.  Principals are overstretched and under-resourced.  We regularly hear young teachers saying they will never become principals.  When they walk into the principal's office, they cannot see him or her because of all the paperwork.</p> <p>  Mr. Byrne mentioned that many teachers are saying "No" to oral examinations.  Much of the training for examiners happens in late January or early February.  Has a problem presented itself this year?  Will there be a crisis for those examinations this year?</p> <p>  I am curious about the guarantee that every single substitute teacher has been vetted.  I do not know how that can be guaranteed.  Is there a procedure or a process whereby a principal does not allow a retired teacher back in?</p><p>I am not saying all of this to tackle the schools.  I am just saying this could be a way to get around the Minister and encourage him to say there is an issue.  In no way am I saying anything to tackle the schools on this issue.  Is that what it will take, if the Minister feels there is not a guarantee on vetting.  I want to clarify that that is the angle I am coming from.  It is obvious that the issues of people working in an unequal system and equal pay for equal work are not a priority for the Minister.  Do we have to approach the matter from a different angle?  That is the only reason I raised the issue.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Mulconry comment on how the alleged ban on career breaks has impacted on the school boards of management?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the comment made by Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc that the Teaching Council has not heard about the standing group or steering group for teaching supply.  I want to put it on record that the establishment of such a group was the first recommendation made in the Striking the Balance report.  I am open to correction but I believe the standing group and steering group are the same thing.  The report was completed in December 2015, published in June 2017 and the Minister announced that he would implement it in January 2018.  According to Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc, the recommendation has not yet been implemented and I ask him to comment.  On the same day, the Minister told Mr. Clerkin's organisation, the IPPN, that he would ask the Teaching Council to do the following two things: review subject criteria and processes for assessing out-of-State qualifications, including further engagement with the migrant teacher project, and engage more with graduate fairs and final year students.  Has the Teaching Council received correspondence from the Minister since he spoke at the IPPN conference?</p> <p>  Last October, in a radio interview with the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, the Minister announced that he would encourage homemakers to avail of Springboard courses to encourage them to become teachers.  Have any of the groups present had an official communication from the Minister on the matter?  I suspect that the Teaching Council has not received any such communication.  A shortage of teachers is the most serious problem in the sector at present.  The Minister has said that he would tackle the problem and, therefore, I must ask my question.</p></speech>

I wish to comment on what Ms Corr said about the special education sector.  It is appalling that we have situations, particularly in mainstream schools, where resource teachers or teachers who deal with special education provision are being used for supervision or yard duty.  I mean when there is a staffing problem and other teachers are not in school.  Without a shadow of a doubt, such people are just seen as an extra resource to be deployed when something goes wrong.  I do not blame the school principals for the situation but the culture exists and I believe it is completely wrong.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc mentioned teachers from abroad and the fact that 10% of teachers do not speak English as their first language.  I want to mention the qualified teachers who live in direct provision.  I accept that we have a high standard of teaching in this country, and rightly so.  However, it would be feasible to have qualified teachers, who have been trained in other jurisdictions, teaching as substitute teachers as opposed to unqualified teachers doing the same work.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on the matter.  I propose that we commence with Mr. Byrne, Mr. &Oacute; Ruairc and Mr. Mulconry as they were asked specific questions.</p></speech>

We make every effort to facilitate that happening.  Let us say I have two or three substitute teachers who do not have Irish, but they are the only substitutes available, plus the oral Irish examination coincides with teachers going out in another subject area.  In that instance one needs substitute teachers to cover instances of illness and one also needs to have a substitute teacher for each of the subject areas where teachers wants to go out.  Let us say three teachers want to assist or supervise the oral Irish examination.  In that case one must adopt a rotational system, which means each teacher goes out one year at a time.  The problem for the SEC is that not all schools agree to release teachers to assist with oral examinations.  If every school released one teacher, for example, it would mean schools could provide cover with substitute teachers and the system would be more fair.  Also, the SEC could choose from a greater pool of examiners.  I am not sure that I have answered the question that has been asked.</p></speech>

Are there enough examiners for the oral and practical examinations this year?  Has that information been ascertained yet?  A lot of the training of examiners takes place around now, and therefore principals should know how many people have volunteered to train as an examiner.</p></speech>

In previous years teachers were called to do such work even though they had not applied to do so.  That situation has not arisen so far this year, so maybe it is not as much of a problem.  It is a matter for the SEC.  I do not know the workings of the SEC.</p></speech>

That means school employees cannot work in a school without being vetted.  Where we come into the picture is with the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act 2015, which specifically provides for our role in promoting the protection of children and vulnerable adults.  Therefore, the Teaching Council has been designated the responsible body, on behalf of the system, for vetting teachers.  The e-vetting system provides that a person gets his or her disclosure released to his or her smartphone or tablet which is a very confidential and secure manner.  That person then shows the disclosure to the school principal, which satisfies his or her needs.  One of the first cohorts that we tackled in respect of vetting, once the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act had commenced, was the substitute cohort because we understood, and we were advised by the Department, that they are vital for keeping the system going.  I have outlined the e-vetting system and how it works.  I cannot be clearer about the matter.</p> <p>  The establishment of a standing group is one of the key recommendations.  It will help to ensure that short-term solutions do not become long-term problems.  I am not entirely sure whether the standing group that we and the report had in mind is the same as a steering group.  I presume that aspect will be clarified in time.</p> <p>  In terms of a review of the subject criteria, we are already beginning to consider the matter because we are conscious that the granularity of the criterion may be a factor, given the hours involved, the culture and the casualisation of the profession that have been referred to other speakers.  We are considering, for example, the possibility of creating families of subjects, in terms of the criteria for languages and the criteria for sciences, thus making it easier for schools to deploy teachers.  We would retain the same standards of level 8 qualifications and 60 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System credits in terms of the amount of time one spends studying.  We are accelerating our work on the area.</p> <p>  The Migrant Teacher Project was mentioned, which brings me to the comments made by the Chairman.</p></speech>

In terms of the comment made about migrant teachers who live in direct provision, under the terms of an EU directive, once a person has a qualification from another state, that person is entitled to register immediately and be employed under section 30.  That person may have to fulfil a condition over a period, but he or she can seek and gain employment during that time.  Nonetheless, we are prepared to work with migrant teachers and are happy to do so to see whether there is anything else we can do to streamline the process for them.  I am happy to clarify that there are no immediate obstacles to their employment.</p> <p>  In terms of the top-up programmes area, we are crystal clear that State policy for both the Department and the Teaching Council is that we should have a fully qualified and registered teaching profession in this country.  We have that and we want to maintain same.  Top-up programmes occur where there is a shortage of teachers for certain subjects.  I would refer the matter to some of the other speakers, especially Ms Russell.  For example, science teachers who specialise in biology and physics may have to top-up their knowledge on chemistry and there may be routes through the Springboard programmes.  The need for a basic high standard in teacher education is State policy and has been for some time, particularly under the literacy and numeracy strategy and the Teaching Council's standards for teacher education.</p></speech>

We have learned a lot and gained insight into recommendations that will be very practical and useful when we conclude our stakeholder meetings.  We will be able to make very clear recommendations to the Minister.</p> <p>  I remember as a young teacher the dread of the door opening at about ten past nine and between 12 and 15 children coming in with their schoolbags because their teacher was out.  One could have a class of 36 students for the day.  It should not be about a teacher being overwhelmed but about pupils getting the best teaching.  Unfortunately everyone in the class is impacted when it becomes a matter of crowd control.  I was in a big school and whatever about a class coming in from the same stream, it was more difficult when one was dealing with a totally different age group.  I know that fear that strikes in the hearts of teachers and principals in that situation.  Hopefully, as a committee we will be able to make recommendations on that.  </p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  We will go into private session to discuss a couple of matters. </p></speech>
