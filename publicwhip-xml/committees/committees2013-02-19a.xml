    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-19a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Andy Bleasdale" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021900004#D00100"><p>I am with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  One of the main areas of work I cover is the agri-environment brief, in terms of the practicalities and the interface with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with regard to policy.  This stemmed from my PhD in botany which was completed 1995 and which looked at the effects of grazing and over-grazing on the uplands in the Twelve Bens and Maumturks in north County Galway.  After my PhD in 1995, I worked for Teagasc on contract for three years.  I prepared rural environment protection scheme, REPS, plans in Connemara, generally in commonage areas, so I have a good understanding of the issues that relate to farming, farmers and commonages.  In 1998 the Department took me on to co-ordinate the commonage framework planning process with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This examined, and was prompted by, a series of complaints made to the European Commission regarding over-grazing in Ireland.</p><p>  Ireland was encouraged to address the situation outside the REPS programme and to look at the condition of commonages in an independent way.  This survey was undertaken in partnership between ourselves and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It commenced in 1999 and ran until 2004 and 2005.  It covered a very large area of commonage in the country, approximately 440,000 hectares or 1 million acres of land.  A total of 4,500 commonage framework plans were prepared.  In the approval of those plans, we and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine worked jointly to ensure that the destocking figures set down in the plans were fair and equitable, reflected the situation on the ground and that there was no misrepresentation of either under-grazing or over-grazing.  It was a rigorous effort over a number of years.</p><p>  Subsequent to the bulk of that work being completed in 2005, the outcomes of that research were communicated to the farming community.  Farmers with commonage and sheep quota were de-stocked where that was necessary.  In many areas they were not de-stocked at all.  I will discuss that further later.  Subsequent to that national survey, we have monitored a select number of commonages to see how they are doing since the delivery of the commonage framework plans, that is, whether they are recovering, whether they are recovering quickly enough and how the over-grazed commonages have reacted since the initial commonage framework planning exercise.</p><p>  Commonages have been intimately linked with my professional life over a long number of years.  I have also been involved in the NPWS farm plan scheme, which paid farmers in commonage areas to de-stock or to manage commonages in a more appropriate way through off-wintering, housing of cattle and sheep, feeding them on the lowland and so forth, based on the needs of the individual commonages in question.  I have had a long interaction, therefore, with the farming community and farmers over a long number of years.  I emphasise that this is not some type of ivory tower research that does not understand the issues on the ground.  We have a good understanding about the needs and expectations of farmers and the challenges that face both the farming community and ourselves with regard to our obligations under the birds and habitats directives.</p><p>  I have been involved with the Burren LIFE - farming for conservation programme as well, on which I understand there was a presentation to the committee a number of weeks ago.  The NPWS administers the funding of that scheme and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine pay the moneys directly to the farmers.  Again, we are working in partnership with the excellent work being done by Brendan Dunford and his team in the Burren in County Clare.</p><p>  We are very actively involved with and supportive of any positive interactions with the farming community.</p><p>  To proceed to my presentation, members will see from the slide that we are not the competent authority for commonages but we have some responsibilities in the commonage area.  We have statutory responsibility for the birds and habitats directives and we engage in the process in that context.  The commonage framework plans were a joint exercise between ourselves and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We emphasise, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would endorse this, that if we are to deliver biodiversity in these upland areas, it can only be done in partnership and dialogue with the farming community.  I wish to underline that, because I am not sure if we have communicated that as well as we must to both the committee and the farming community.  It is our firmly held belief that this is necessary.  We believe the commonage framework plan review process is an opportunity to enter into a new phase of dialogue that does not just impose destocking and restrictions but works with the farming community in a collective way to achieve the goals for stocking levels to manage land under Pillar 1 supports, and hopefully under Pillar 2 supports, and to deliver the consequent biodiversity that is necessary in these upland areas.</p><p>  I will move quickly through some of the slides.  The committee members do not have them in the presentation, as I have just provided the text.  Some of the slides will illustrate the reality.  Members can see that a large percentage of the country has commonages, particularly in the west but also in the east, south east, north and south.  A good area of commonage, 440,000 hectares, is farmed in this country, including north County Galway, Bun Dorracha in County Mayo and the Mullaghareirks in County Cork, which is a hen harrier hotbed and also an upland landscape.  It is not always about the mountains and the bogs.  We also have semi-improved landscapes with rushy pastures and some forestry landscapes that are also part of the upland and some of which are held in commonage.  The Burren is also an upland area and has some commonage.</p><p>  There are unique challenges for the farming community in these areas.  Often, in some of these areas the farmers have tended, be it due to part-time farming, different expectations or for whatever reason, to focus on the more intensively managed parts of the farm, to the neglect of many of the upland areas.  We must engage with them to encourage and incentivise them to go back to the hills and the commonages in the years ahead.  The committee will note in the slide an upland scene in County Wicklow, which will be familiar to the Chairman.  In some of these areas we are becoming concerned that under-grazing is becoming a problem.  However, I emphasise that undergrazing is not the only problem.  There is still over-grazing in other parts of the country.  That is an important message.  It is not black and white, and in different townlands in different commonages there are different scenarios, often within the same commonage.  There can be under-grazed and over-grazed parts in the same commonage.  These upland areas are key and necessary for the management of the biodiversity we have in Ireland, such as the red grouse, the hen harrier and some of the species that depend on good water quality, for example, the freshwater pearl mussel.</p><p>  I can give the committee some statistics for commonage.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will cover some of this as well.  We have 6,700 LPIS, land plot identification system, plots of commonage in the country and approximately 15,000 herd numbers, so there are up 15,000 farmers claiming commonage.  The gross area of the commonage in 2011 was approximately 430,000 hectares.  The reference area of that commonage, when one discounts ineligible land, is approximately 410,000 hectares.  However, not all of that is being farmed.  We should seize the opportunity to address the issue of inactive farmers and dormancy through this debate, to allow farmers who are very active in some of these commonages to increase their stocking entitlement and take up some of the slack of the dormant farmers and the inactive shareholders.  If we do not seize this opportunity, it will be a missed opportunity for both biodiversity and the farming community.</p><p>  To date we have had no proper management of commonage to prevent against under-grazing and over-grazing.  We need to empower some of the farmers and leaders in the farming community to set up a system that allows them to manage the land themselves in a way that delivers biodiversity, good agricultural and environmental conditions, GAEC, and a good environment for both this and the next generation of farmers.  If we do not do that, there is a significant risk to the moneys that are paid to the commonage farmers in the year ahead.  This is not a threat, but the reality.  If land becomes under-grazed, at some point in the future, be it sooner or later, the European Commission will decide the land is not farmed, is not in GAEC and is not eligible, so moneys under single payments or Pillar 2 supports will not be paid to the farmers.  Therefore, we need farmers and we need to look at the amount of land and housing the farmer has.  Farmers who farm in commonage do not have the green land all in one parcel.</p></speech>

There might be three or four LPISs within the one commonage townland.  It could be all declared commonage but there could be four LPIS plots within it, perhaps separated by a road or a fence.</p><p>  There are still some outstanding areas to assess, 10% of the area.  The minimum and maximum figures that have been communicated in my opinion, and I think in that of the Department, are only a starting point in the conversation.  This will not be railroaded through.  We want this to be a dialogue, an open communication with the farming community.  If those numbers are wrong we need to be told so.  If they need to be adjusted that will happen.  This must be open and transparent.  We need to have an open and ongoing dialogue with the farming community about this.</p><p>  This is an opportunity to protect single farm payments and to provide for agri-environmental schemes into the future.  I am arguing for a partnership approach between the Department, the NPWS, the farming community and all the other stakeholders - the farming organisations, the Heritage Council, Birdwatch Ireland and so on, and all the representative bodies, the Golden Eagle Trust, the game councils and so on, to share our experience of how commonages should be managed and come up with a plan that will address the issues that face us.  There have been some successes.  The Burren farming for conservation programme shows that we can do this with local buy-in, a strong local presence, a partnership approach between the Department, the NPWS and the local IFA.  We can do amazing things but it does demand that dialogue and partnership.  The high nature value farmland concept is gaining traction and that is an important opportunity for upland farmers in the years ahead.  Maybe there will be supports for high nature value farmland and if that is the case they will deliver great value for that farmland if they manage the land properly.</p><p>  We understand that compromise is the key.  We cannot railroad through a solution.  It must be done through partnership and that conversation has started.  The public is willing to pay, within Ireland and across the European Community, for this biodiversity resource.  The next steps include the partnership approach.  We can test this model in some commonages.  We need to develop the appeals process in a transparent way that allows farmers to engage and tell us if we are wrong.  We need to finalise the remaining commonages.  We need to communicate the outcomes on a roadmap for the year ahead and to look for incentives through the next rural development programme.  However, we are clear in saying that maintaining the<i> status quo</i> of the commonage framework plans is not an option because we are entering into a new phase of management for these areas and we need to look at the potential for the years ahead.</p><p>  Sin mo chuidse.

I will try not to cover the same ground.  Unfortunately, I do not have any pictures; I just have slides.</p><p>  To put the subject into context, commonage land forms an important part of the farming enterprise of many farmers, particularly along the west coast.  There is a substantial risk of land abandonment as undergrazing has become more of a problem.  Undergrazing leads to an increase in ineligible land under direct aid and agri-environment schemes, and it leads to the risk of financial corrections being imposed by the European Commission.</p><p>  We have a long tradition of farming commonages in Ireland.  This area, by its nature, has always been very complex.  Issues have arisen over legal rights to claim and there have always been disputes over the grazing of commonages.  However, in the vast majority of cases, commonage shareholders have been able to work together on a co-operative basis.</p><p>  Consider our objectives.  The acronym GAEC stands for &quot;good agricultural and environmental condition&quot;, which is the way in which the land should be kept.  Where there has been undergrazing, it is a question of returning the habitat to GAEC, making it fit for farming activity and allowing farming activity to take place on the land.  The Minister has made it clear that he intends to achieve this by working with the farmers who directly manage the lands, the relevant State agencies, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the farming organisations and all other interested stakeholders.  It will not be an easy task but it is achievable.</p><p>  Let us consider the context.  We have had some details on commonages but we must ask how they fit into the single farm environment.  Each year, approximately 4.7 million hectares of eligible land are declared by applicants under direct aid and the agri-environment schemes.  Of this area, more than 330,000 hectares of commonage land is declared, representing 7% of the total.  Interestingly, of the 15,000 applicants, almost 11% applied in respect of commonages.</p><p>  The commonages are predominantly in four counties, Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  They form 71% of the total.  What is their use?  Commonage land includes both upland and lowland grazing habitats.  They are maintained mainly by the use of sheep flocks.  There are cattle grazed in these areas also.  There are some special commonages in which Kerry bog ponies are kept.  Such traditional farming methods will be catered for in the outcome of this process.</p><p>  Let us consider the aid payments being paid on commonages.  There are four.  There are two direct types of payment and some agri-environment scheme payments.  There is the single farm payment, the disadvantaged area scheme payment, the grassland sheep scheme payment and the REPS or AEOS payment.  In many cases, some of the commonages are attracting four separate payments.  The payments are funded in two ways.  Pillar 1 covers direct payment, or the single payment scheme, which is fully funded by Brussels.  Pillar 2 concerns rural development, which is partially funded by the State and also funded by the European Union.  There is a primary requirement under these schemes that lands be maintained in GAEC.  If the lands do not meet these criteria, they are not eligible for payment.  That is a problem in its own right.</p><p>  While overgrazing is an issue in some of the areas, as was mentioned, undergrazing comprises an increasingly significant issue.  There are a variety of complex reasons for the undergrazing problem, one of which was the introduction of decoupled payments.  Many farmers got rid of unprofitable stock and reduced their stocking levels.  The age profile of farmers is increasing and farming has some very old age cohorts.  The age profile of farmers on commonages is increasing.  There are low market trends, resulting in reduced livestock numbers.  The more attractive returns from off-farm employment during the Celtic tiger era meant that many of the farmers in question went out of farming and into another career.</p><p>  What is the way forward?  The only way to manage the common lands, be they upland commonages or lowland commonages, is to graze them.  Continuing with the <i>status quo</i> is not an option.  If action is not taken, the areas will continue to deteriorate, leading to more land abandonment.  If this is allowed to happen, we lose valuable resources for farming, the rural economy, biodiversity and wildlife.</p><p>  As I stated, grazing is the only method of managing the commonages.  Therefore, there is a need to keep the land compatible with the grazing plan.  GAEC will not be achieved unless the farmers who manage the lands are given a role.  They have knowledge of the best methods for their areas.  Therefore, there is a need for an agreed approach, and no other solution will work.</p><p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, working in conjunction with the Department, has established a grazing plan for more than 4,500 commonages.  There are some more plans to be completed, mainly in respect of smaller commonages.  The task facing us is to ensure that grazing levels are appropriate to the individual commonages.  We must tailor the two.  The commonage must have a compatible grazing plan with the correct number of animals.  To ensure that we achieve this objective, we need to have the input of the individual shareholders.</p><p>  The other issue is one of flexibility.  Grazing plans at the level of each commonage must allow for greater flexibility for shareholders.  It will enable the active farmers to increase their stock to cater for dormant and inactive persons.  It will be a matter for agreement between the shareholders, as has always been the case, to decide how best to reach the required stocking levels.  It may be a requirement that professional assistance or planners will be required, particularly where the commonage has been damaged by undergrazing.</p><p>  The grazing plans will have to cater for traditional methods for their areas.  Provision will have to be made for sheep and other animals such as cattle, such that the plan will be appropriate to the habitat.  An appropriate timescale must be put in place, but a plan must include incremental steps to get the land back into GAEC.  The whole concept will be output-driven in that the assessment of the plans will be based on whether the commonage is in GAEC and, where appropriate, whether progress has been achieved on getting the land into GAEC.</p><p>  What are the problems?  Apart from ensuring the grazing plan is valid, there are a number of other complications, including dormant shareholders.  In the majority of cases, these people are no longer farming.  There is also a problem where current claimants on the commonage are claiming but do not manage or farm the lands.  In addition, we must address the issue of whether these people should continue to claim payments if they are not actually performing an active role.</p><p>  There are other issues to be considered.  Many of the commonages have been significantly damaged by undergrazing, as Dr. Bleasdale mentioned.  The resulting problems include land abandonment and the spread of scrub and invasive species.  The lead-in times for plans will have to take into account the fact that the damage already done will not be addressed quickly.</p></speech>

T&aacute; cur i l&aacute;thair thar a bheith cuimsitheach d&eacute;anta ag na finn&eacute;ithe ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  Creidim nach f&eacute;idir linn an fhadhb ar fad a r&eacute;iteach inniu.  Beidh orainn teacht ar ais agus tuilleadh pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh faoi.</p><p>  The two presentations were very comprehensive and very helpful.  That said, given that so many issues were raised by them and that this issue is so complex, I do not believe we will be able to have the input I would like this committee, as the one which represents the electorate, to have into this very complex and important issue.  I will ask some specific questions but I suggest the whole committee, or a sub-group of it, be set up to pursue this issue in more detail with the Department because many questions remain unanswered.</p><p>  One of the first questions which strikes me, and which I would like to tease out in much more detail, is this LPIS.  What is an LPIS and how is it defined?  In many cases, if one destocks one commonage, sheep will move into the next one because there are no fences between the different commonages.  In fact, it is one huge area and sheep will move over the top of the mountain.  If, for example, one destocks one side of the mountain completely, the sheep will not stay on their one LPIS, they will move over to the ungrazed part.  </p><p>  That raises a second issue about which I was not quite clear from the presentation, namely, whether there are overgrazed and undergrazed areas on the one LPIS, even though the sheep have access to the whole area of land.  That, in turn, raises the very significant issue, which I am not sure has been fully teased out, of the effect of off-wintering of sheep on the nature of the actual grazing pattern itself or the effect the feeding of sheep, in particular ewe hoggets in the low fields or on the low part of the hill where the sheep know to come down to get the feed, has had on the grazing patterns of the sheep?  Does that affect the usage of the commonage and does it mean that one gets very uneven patterns of grazing which have nothing to do with absent stock numbers?  Does one get an overgrazed section and undergrazed section?  What research has been done on the effect so-called improved farming practices have had on the commonages?</p><p>  When I was in the Department, it was generally the belief that cattle had not been a major contributor to overgrazing on commonages because of the way cattle graze.  That view seems to have changed over the years and cattle were taken off the commonages for months.  Could we get more clarity on this whole issue of complementary grazing?  Cattle and sheep graze in a very different way, and horses graze in a totally different way again.  Has it really been beneficial taking cattle off or was the mixture an advantage?</p><p>  I refer to an issue I often hear as a concern to farmers and a cause of undergrazing.  Farmers will tell one that they have the same distance to travel for 20 or 30 ewes as for 120 or 130 ewes and that it is not worth keeping that number of ewes and, therefore, they are getting out of hill farming.  That is leading to undergrazing.  There is the whole issue of viable flocks.  If farmers must cover a whole townland looking for their sheep, there must be a decent number of sheep there.  </p><p>  That leads to the whole issue of dormancy and what worried me in the presentation by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There are three classes of farmers.  There are those who have dormant shares and who do not claim or use them.  There is a fair number who claim both the hill and the lowland but who do not farm the hill.  Then there are those who claim the hill and the lowland and who farm both.  If one says to the farmers who do not farm the hill that they must do so and if one has a fixed number of sheep on the commonage, they will then have to push the neighbours' numbers down to get in on the commonage to preserve their rights to get the payments from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, if one does that, one might find that one is making all other flocks totally unviable and is reducing the size of the flock which is not solving any problem.  One is not saving any money and is getting the exact same number of sheep on the commonage which one would have got if one had this tacit arrangement between the neighbours that some farmed it and others did not.  The implicit threat not to pay farmers for parts of the farm they do not graze could have a whole series of unintended consequences and adds nothing to the commonages.</p><p>  In my experience, there would have been no undergrazing of the commonages if one had not reduced all the farmers on the commonage on the basis that they were all going to farm it and, therefore, cause the undergrazing.  If the farmers farming it could have put more sheep on it to make up for all the dormant shares, they would have done so but they were not allowed.  The Department created the problem because it would not allow them to put them up and to compensate for the high level of dormancy.  I do not think we should compound the problem by reversing the engines and forcing everybody to put the sheep up on the hill because viability of flocks is a very important part of this.  </p><p>  Will the Department comment on what the National Parks and Wildlife Service said about high nature farming and the fact that Europe, in particular European taxpayers, including Irish taxpayers, are willing to pay to ensure these lands are kept in good farming condition?  Listening to the mood on the ground in urban Europe, it is very insistent that these areas are kept in good condition.  Both the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service have agreed that this cannot be done other than by actively farming these areas and they are clear that there is no such thing as a wild area unfarmed in Ireland.  These areas were in good condition before the ewe premium came in and were actively farmed for centuries.  They are not wild lands but farmed lands and if one ceases to farm them, one will get a total ecological disaster.</p><p>  That means that people who are willing to chase sheep up mountains - it is no easy job chasing sheep around a mountain - must get a return for their income.</p></speech>

Like everybody else here, I believe that collectively we have to resolve the current problem of undergrazing and overgrazing of the commonages.  The outcome of all our deliberations and conversation has to be about bringing forward a proper management plan.  That is central to the desired results.  A number of the areas identified are evident to everybody.  The deduction in decoupling is a contributing factor, as is the age profile of the farmers who share in the commonages and, crucially, the low market returns.  It is soul destroying and demoralising for people who have been active farmers for most of their lives; trying to scrape a living off the side of a hill is difficult for them.</p><p>  The witness stated that attractive returns from off-farm employment during the Celtic tiger era meant farmers could move to where they could make a sustainable living and many possibly created the dormancy that currently exists.  In identifying all of these issues, do we resort back to a form of coupling as a means of addressing the undergrazing issue.  Could part of the plan include selective burn-off?  Not far from where I grew up selective burn-off was controlled and carried out to restore the returns from the side of the hill.</p><p>  I mentioned decoupling.  Where ten or 15 people have access to commonages, many of which are dormant, and a number of people continue to be active farmers in those areas, through conversation and dialogue perhaps a negotiated arrangement could be arrived at where people could utilise the land by stocking it to the required density.  </p></speech>

There are issues that need to be addressed, which we all accept.  We are here to talk about the methodology of how we approach them in the best way possible.</p><p>  As a Deputy for Kildare South, I will be a bit local on this issue and use my local experience as a way to get more information.  The commonage of the Curragh, where farmers graze sheep, is used and owned by the Department of Defence, which controls it.  A huge number of horse trainers live on the edge of the Curragh and, naturally, horses train there.  We are the thoroughbred county and it is a key component of our economy.  A huge number of tourists and visitors come to see it and local people use it as an amenity also.  There are a number of issues at the Curragh and many things which need to be done better.  The sheep used to be taken off in the winter, which does not seem to happen much any more.  There are certain areas where scrambling bikes go and do damage.  There is a very special grass on the Curragh which needs to be protected.  There is poaching from horses, with some trainers being better than others in terms of taking care where their horses go and repairing the ground if they do damage.</p><p>  We talk about partnership, but if that is not forthcoming one ends up having to use a carrot-and-stick approach.  We talk about funding models including single farm payments, REPS and AEOS.  My concern is that if one ends up having to use a stick, the only people to hit with it are farmers.  What about those who use the commonage like the Curragh but who are not necessarily in receipt of payments and who do not have commonage entitlements?  How does one actively engage with them and bring them on board?  I saw the reference to Article 8 and Article 36 in terms of the rural development programme and trying to get more.  Is there any other revenue stream that can be accessed?  I was hugely impressed by the presentation the committee received on the Burren project.  While that was done in a small area of the Burren, is it something that can be replicated nationally?  Money is a key way to bring people with us to get the end product and results we need by funding oversight and continuous active management.  The Curragh has great potential to bring in more visitors and tourists and to play a larger role in tourism in Kildare if we get this right.  There are many benefits to getting this right, but there are also pitfalls.  My concern is that farmers may be the only ones who have to face the challenges.</p></speech>

The presentation referred to the partnership approach and the need for co-operation among various stakeholders.  How will that happen?  There is clearly a need for urgency, which has been expressed, yet we know that when stakeholders are referred to, things are going to take a long time.  With the best will in the world and even if every stakeholder is equally interested and matched in terms of enthusiasm, it takes a long time.  Clearly, there will be differences of opinions among stakeholders about how this will go on.  The presentation referred to the fact that the conversation has already started.  I would appreciate hearing a bit more about what that means and where the process is heading.</p><p>  I would like to know a bit more about the assertion that this is a real opportunity for self-regulation.  Self-regulation has not worked terribly well in certain other areas.  What is supporting that contention?  I understand the principle of self-regulation and the fact that it is often appropriate.  I am not so sure that it is here and I wonder what has brought the Department to believe it is appropriate in this context.  Is it a view shared by both relevant Departments?  Have the Departments discussed the matter?</p></speech>

I will discuss certain themes that emerged in the questions asked by members of the committee.  Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the concept of dialogue, which is important here.  We need to ensure we have proper dialogue.  This is not a one-stage process.  There are a number of stages.  Part of the process is listening to the committee and getting the views of stakeholders.  Equally, the other step is to talk to the people who farm the commonages.</p><p>  Much of the work has been done on commonages.  We have statistics on the majority of commonages, which means we have a basis for a dialogue with the farmers.  Some of the figures are considered to be contentious, which is why we must talk to people to see what the most appropriate approach is.  Members saw the maps we brought.  We have the land parcel identification system, LPIS, and have carried out a major review of commonages over time.  We are a long way down that particular road.</p><p>  The issue with regard to ownership and dormancy cannot be avoided.  We have a situation in which, in theory, we might have legal agreements between nine people only two of whom are actively farming.  The key is to ensure that active farmers are in a position to take over a commonage and run it in a way that brings it in line with GAEC.  That is the key.  I cannot ignore the issue of ownership and dormancy generally, however.</p><p>  Another theme that emerged was the prospect of a new CAP.  It appears the committee feels there should be consideration of some form of payment linked to commonages.</p></speech>

It would be about as realistic as the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow in Connemara.  The simple way to do it is through the Commission's proposal whereby one does not blame farmers for being born into bad land.  The single payment gives the EU its return on the high nature value payment.  That is the simple way of doing it.  In return for that, one must observe GAEC requirements and the greening condition.</p></speech>

Under the current system one does not get the payment under any of the schemes unless one achieves the good agricultural and environmental conditions.  The two are linked.  If an inspector goes out and looks at any land, be it commonage or otherwise, and sees that it is not in GAEC it does not attract a payment.  It is as simple as that.  That is an ongoing requirement.</p></speech>

It does not have to be uplands or commonages.  There are cases, as I am sure Mr. Evans is aware, all over the place, on what would be semi-marginal lands.  A photograph shows a tuft of rushes that looks like trees from the air and somebody has to go out and inspect it.  That may be an unusual case but there is that level of inspection.</p></speech>

It is black and white with many of these EU auditors.  We have had dozens of these audits.  They are quite clear on that.</p><p>  I wish to return to a point that Deputy Ferris made, that setting minima and maxima is a form of re-coupling.  I agree with him totally, but that is what is required - that we get the numbers correct and that we have the right stocking and grazing plot for them.  He mentioned the possibility of selective burning of land, particularly where there has been an excessive build-up of vegetation. That may be the only option to bring the commonage back to a basic condition and then bring it back to GAEC from there.  That is a possibility and might be something to be considered under a grazing management plan.</p><p>  In response to Deputy Heydon, the partnership must involve all stakeholders, whether they are in farming or otherwise.  I appreciate his points about the Curragh.  I think that covers the main points.  I will allow my colleagues to comment.</p></speech>

It covers all the direct aid schemes such as the single farm payment, the disadvantaged areas scheme and the grass and feed scheme.  It is also utilised for making area-based payments under REPS and AEOS.  The Deputy is quite right to say that it is an artificial creation.  Essentially we have 1.1 million LPIS parcels on our system, and it is possible for one farmer to have every field as a separate LPIS whereas in another case the entire farm is one LPIS parcel.  On average there are six separate fields in a LPIS parcel in Ireland.  The situation for commonages is much more complicated because in Connemara and Donegal and elsewhere, and in my own area of Kerry, there are huge tracts of commonage, and if they pass a townland boundary it is necessary to create a new LPIS parcel.  If a river flows through the middle, if there is a roadway or if forestry has been introduced, it is necessary to create a new LPIS parcel.  It is possible to have more than one LPIS parcel for the same commonage.  I note that the Senator also says it is possible to have two separate and distinct commonages and obviously there are no boundaries between them in most cases, so sheep can move.  My understanding is that in Kerry sheep tend to stay on commonages in the same area.  Traditionally they graze the same area.  Maybe sheep in Galway are slightly different.</p></speech>

The Senator spoke about under- and overgrazing in the same commonage.  My understanding is that to a certain extent that is to do with undergrazing.  The sheep will go to the same area time and again where the vegetation is there to be grazed.  That is one issue, but there are others, because the same commonages can be under- and overgrazed.</p><p>  The Senator raised the issue of GAEC across the schemes.  Since 2005, in order to benefit from any of the direct payment schemes or the agri-environment schemes, the lands on which one is paid must be eligible and must be maintained in GAEC.  That applies to REPS and the agri-environment options scheme.  The Senator also raised a point, which is the nub of the issue, about dormant and inactive people.  That will need a lot of thought, because it is a concern.  We have discussed this problem more with the farmers who farm the commonage lands than with the farming organisations, because they are the people to talk to about this.  There is an issue there but I am not sure it is as big an issue as our concern suggests because in many cases the inactive guy who is still benefiting from a payment for the common land will not put sheep back up there.  He has to buy and breed sheep to go up on the common land.  In many cases he or she would have to prepare his or her lowland for the maintenance of sheep for certain times of the year, and that involves quite expensive wiring of the land.  There are several issues to consider.  If we work in partnership with the individual farmers who are actually farming the commonages, many of these issues will be sorted out almost on a commonage-by-commonage basis.</p></speech>

The understanding of it in this meeting elaborates on that complexity.  We could spend a day or a week or a month adding to the complexities, so my answers to the questions raised will be very brief.  I cannot elaborate because each issue would require further and further elaboration.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v did not understand why we are focusing on commonages <i>per se</i> and not the full extent of the upland resource.  I fully accept that many of the privately owned upland areas have been either under- or overgrazed as well, but the problems in commonages are exacerbated by the fact that there are multiple owners of those commonages.  Therefore, it is a further complexity.  If one is dealing with one landowner one can at least have a dialogue with one person.  When one is dealing with a multiplicity of people, some of whom do not wish to speak to one, the problem becomes more entrenched and difficult to resolve.  I fully accept the Deputy's point that, driving along the road and looking in over the fence, one would not know whether an area is commonage and whether it is under- or overgrazed.  One could not assume that because it is overgrazed it is commonage.</p><p>  In respect of adjacent LPIS plots, there is and should be flexibility in the approach.  We should not deal with LPIS plots as individual items that do not interact with each other.  If it makes sense for groups or clusters of LPIS plots that are adjacent and through which sheep roam to be dealt with as a unit, that is entirely logical.  For those LPIS areas, the collective farmers should come together as a group to discuss the group management of that area.  We are not talking about plans or agreements or collective management regimes for each of the LPIS plots we have mentioned.  There could be a much smaller subset that would cover the extent of commonages about which we are concerned.</p><p>  I agree that off-wintering is a very unhealthy solution and is not generally traditional in the upland areas.  We did it because in the areas where it was being proposed the land was in such poor condition that it needed a break, and the best time to do that was over the winter.  That probably creates a whole suite of other problems as the sheep must be reintroduced to the hill and they do not range as much as they did formerly.</p></speech>

I seek to balance the argument on Common Agricultural Policy reform a little.  The stark reality is that there is land abandonment in one part of the country and land scarcity in my part of the country.  Unfortunately, people cannot get their hands on it, and I know the witnesses are hearing day in and day out about the lack of availability of land for active farmers.</p><p>  With the approximation model, I am slightly concerned that we will see many payments transferred to non-productive land.  Transfers will take place.  If there is only 63% draw-down, with 7% of total land area in commonage, that would equate to a theoretical loss of approximately 2.59% in total, or &euro;33.6 million.  I know it would be less than that, but the point is that much of the &euro;1.3 billion coming in would not be used productively, which is a major loss to the country.  If it came to the farmers that are already producing, it would certainly not be wasted.</p><p>  A second point is about grazing.  Mr. Evans may understand what I am trying to get at.  If there is a percentage draw-down of funds in commonages - there is a history of only a certain amount being drawn down - the result is-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-19a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paud Evans" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013021900012#M00300"><p>I will answer that.  There is a ceiling for all schemes but we can take the single farm payment as an example.  The net ceiling for 2012 and 2013 is &euro;1.255 billion, and that is payable on entitlements, as the Deputy knows.  There are, essentially, 4.2 million entitlements allocated to farmers and each year, 4.7 million hectares are declared.  We are fully utilising our ceiling.  We regard 100,000 hectares of commonage land as being within the total reference area but not claimed, and that has no bearing on the level of payments made under any of our schemes, and there is no loss of any EU funding under Pillar 1 or Pillar 2 because of that.</p><p>  With the 100,000 hectares, there are some dormant shareholders who may be long gone from the country or no longer farming the commonage land or claiming on it.  Some farmers deliberately do not claim their entire share of the commonage and take a view that perhaps not all the commonage is eligible.  They may be entitled to a one-tenth share of 100 hectares but they may only claim on seven or eight hectares.  The loss of the 100,000 hectares arises from individual claimants making a decision; they want to protect total payments.</p> <p>Many commonage farmers have more land than entitlements.  They do not need all of the hectares to be declared to get their full payments.</p></speech>

If all the hill farmers were to make claims in respect of all of their hectarage, that would increase the total number of hectares and push money into the commonage areas.  In other words, under-declaring is causing the money in the fixed pool to seep out of the commonage areas and into the rest of the country.  If every one of the commonage farmers and people with commonage entitlements made claims in respect of their land, that would reduce somewhat the payments received by everyone else in the country.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

Each year, just 130,000 hectares are declared as eligible lands from which the applicants do not benefit for single farm payment purposes.  Many of the people in those cases benefit from the disadvantaged areas, rural environment protection or agri-environment options schemes.  They are making claims under the direct payment schemes or the agri-environment options scheme.  Most of the land in Ireland is declared by people who receive the single farm payment.  That will not be an issue for us.  I must inform Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that I cannot look into a crystal ball to see what kind of regime we will have.  It is possible that one of the solutions that could be implemented in Ireland will involve farmers bringing a set percentage of their current payment into the new regime.  That would depend on the level the ceiling is at, on the final outcome of the greening process and on whether the payment is separate or attached to direct aid.  That would not bring extra funds to commonage areas in the west of Ireland, in particular; it would dilute the unit value of the entitlements of the individual farmers.  It depends on the type of system.</p></speech>

We excluded lakes, trees, houses, etc.  I think we reduced the entire area by 20,000 hectares.  By virtue of a provision in the EU regulation, we were entitled to recalculate any applicant where the reduced area of land would have been sufficient for him or her to get fully paid during the reference period.  I estimate that approximately 98% of all farmers met that requirement.  We were able to reduce the number of entitlements and increase their value.  Even though we took some areas from the commonage, the vast majority of them got fully paid.</p></speech>

When rocks were being taken out of land parcels on the basis of aerial maps, I dealt with a case in which half of a 1,000-acre hill was taken out.  I am not sure what that is in hectares, but it was reduced by half.  When the farmers in question appealed that decision, the ground was walked again.  It was decided that a great deal of grass was growing between the rocks, which is true, and a good two thirds of the half that had been taken out was restored.  Farmers were hedging their bets against this because they had no way of calculating how much rock was in the mountain.  It is hard to tell when one looks up at the top of a mountain.  They were hedging their bets right from the beginning because they were trying to out-think what the Department might do.  That approach was well-founded because the Department did what I have mentioned.</p></speech>

The officials have said that grazing is the answer.  I have come across an obstacle that is discouraging people from taking land in higher grazing areas.  I refer to upland areas that are tied by appurtenant areas to lowland areas.  I have come across the case of a chap who was taking one of these areas for many years.  It was news to me that one cannot take one without taking the other, even though I have dealt with many of these issues.  That sends out the unfortunate signal that one should stay well away from taking upland grazing because one could put one's entire single farm payment in jeopardy.  There is such demand for grazing in my part of the country that people are prepared to travel.  These appurtenant areas are among the flexibility issues that need to be sorted out.  No farmer sets out to have his or her entire single farm payment taken away.  Perhaps some clarification is needed with regard to all the lands that have appurtenant areas.  That would allow for more flexibility.  There is also a need for flexibility in relation to people with cattle who are prepared to travel.  Farming is changing.  Higher areas can be grazed very quickly by many cattle.  One could send them in to do it.  The cattle would not necessarily have to be owned by the people who are living there.  I think it should be looked at in that way.</p><p>  I would also like to refer to land parcel information systems.  There are no boundaries in commonage areas.  There are issues with the use of land parcel information systems as part of normal farming routines.  Difficulties can arise, especially if a great deal of the land in question is rented, when there is an apparent need for a boundary.  I have often swapped land with people.  When we were growing beet a few years ago, I swapped land with people - they took some of my land for beet and I took some of their land.  The boundary was often a tramline.  There was never any intention to defraud any scheme, high up or low down.  It was always done properly.  If some type of accommodation is to be reached with regard to upland areas, the same accommodation should be reached with regard to lowland areas.  It is affecting people's living.</p><p>  I agree with the witness who said it is not all about sheep numbers.  One of the biggest issues in tillage farming is compaction.  Soil science is very important in this context.  Believe it or not, compaction can become a large issue when large levels of stock like sheep are on ground that is not free-draining.  It needs to be taken into account on such lands.</p><p>  I wonder whether map-farming is common in commonages.  If so, what are those maps making this year?  Perhaps the officials do not have an answer in this respect.  I know the Department is doing its best to stamp out this practice, which is certainly very common.  It is a scourge.  People who are dormant are still claiming the single farm payment.</p></speech>

I have worked with all of them in the past on the commonage issue.  While we have moved a good distance since, as they rightly said, there are still a number of commonages which are over-grazed and others that are under-grazed.  The problem still persists and something has to be done, rightly so.  It is very important that we bring everybody on board, in particular farmers, because we must have agreement before we can enforce anything.</p><p>  When we talk about enforcement, the question we start to ask ourselves is who receives the payment, particularly where there are dormant shares and older farmers are not prepared to farm land.  Will the younger farmer who farms the land and perhaps stocks it with the agreement of those not able to do it be the one who receives the payment?  We have to go down that road.</p><p>  There is the suggestion that very large tracts of commonage should be fenced where sheep tend to wander.  Where there are small numbers of sheep, if areas were fenced off, it would be possible to contain them and the farmer would not have to travel as far to prevent stock from getting lost, which is a big problem on commonages in that animals wander and get lost in the hills.</p><p>  With regard to the Pillar 2 schemes such as the REPS, the AEOS which is replacing the REPS, the disadvantaged areas scheme, the sheep grassland scheme and the sheep discussion group scheme, if all of these schemes were included together in one package, it would make it really worthwhile and encourage farmers to get involved.</p><p>  We have touched on the issue of whether sheep stay in one area or wander.  A survey was undertaken by Teagasc on a farm in County Mayo where the monitors attached to sheep proved that, starting early in the morning, they would travel some 15 miles in a day but that they would always return to the one spot at evening time.</p><p>  I often tell the story of local people managing the commonage.  There is a large commonage in my area which local people were well able to manage during the 1960s before the Department of Agriculture became involved.  I dread to think what would happen today if this was attempted because people simply would not agree to it. However, local people always came together and it was our job once a month to gather up all of the stock on the commonage to count them.  If a farmer was found to be abusing his or her position, he or she was fined.  That worked very well, although it might be more difficult to put such a system in place today.  </p><p>  I hope some of these ideas will prove useful.</p></speech>

These meetings are important, as has been said by many speakers.  This is a burning issue, particularly so prior to Christmas when it was leaked that a lot of the work had been done, that agreement had been reached within the Department and the NPWS and that letters were to issue to farmers.  I know this was met with a gust from the farming organisations, farmers and the committee.  While I am not sure if the letters that were due to issue were printed, I would like to have some understanding of what exactly was happening at the time.  I have great respect for the Department and the NPWS which do excellent work in our national parks, SACs and SPAs.  Nonetheless, I would like to find out who was driving the agenda.  The presentations have outlined the needs highlighted concerning the under-grazing of commonages and it was said, possibly by Mr. Evans, that consultation had taken place with farmers.  I am not aware of consultations with farmers with commonage lands in my constituency and would like to clarify which farmers were consulted on this issue.  I know the farming organisations issued many statements in November and early December stating they had not been fully consulted; therefore, some clarification would be in order.</p><p>  On the overall approach adopted by the Department and in the policy document, Food Harvest 2020, to which we all subscribe and which feeds into the issue of tackling the world food crisis which is very evident in the scientific reports, there is a need to balance the ecology against the funding and transfers we receive from the European taxpayer every year under the Common Agricultural Policy.  There is a need to protect the environment, including commonage lands, flora and fauna.  Balanced with this, however, there is a need to allow farmers living in these areas to engage in as active a farming enterprise as they can.</p><p>  In Donegal, for example, there were very severe gorse fires across the county in May 2011.  I was one of the volunteers who helped to put out the gorse fires and saw at first-hand the dangers posed to the local community.  Some houses were almost lost.  If one spoke to any of the farmers at the time, there was widespread acceptance that the difficulty had been caused by under-grazing on the hills and that the reason for this under-grazing was related to the regulations and stipulations imposed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the NPWS.  To be fair to him, the then Minister of State, the late Deputy Shane McEntee, visited County Donegal shortly after the fires had started.  I remember speaking to him and know that he acknowledged there was an issue that needed to be addressed in regard to under-grazing on the hills and-or the need to provide for controlled burning.</p><p>  I do not subscribe to the view that the farmer is totally to blame for under-grazing.  Farmers were farming in restricted circumstances and not in a position to go into certain areas or increase their stocking rates because they were highly dependent on the commonage lands available to them.</p></speech>

I am not a member of the committee but I have a significant interest in this area as I come from Connemara in west Galway.  I was a REPS planner in my previous life, mainly in east Galway and latterly in Connemara and various other places.  I prepared many REPS plans, so I have some experience in this area.</p><p>  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill regarding the issue that came to the fore before Christmas.  There was concern among farmers regarding what was happening and information appearing in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> that culminated in the production of the minimum and maximum figures.  There is general agreement that collective responsibility would be hugely problematic, not for all commonages but certainly for some of them.  A commonage may contain only four guys who get on well and will sit down around a table, thrash something out and get agreement.  However, there can be significant numbers of people in commonages and collective responsibility would be impossible to work out.  Commonages are some of the most complex areas one could find.  Dr. Bleasdale came up with a figure of 410,000 hectares for a reference area, while the Department has a figure of 330,000 hectares, so there is a difference of 80,000 hectares.  I do not know if there are issues with dormancy, but there is a discrepancy in the figures.</p><p>  Lead-in times were mentioned.  Irrespective of what is coming, is it safe to say that there will be no impact on payments in 2013 and that nothing will be decided?  That is of concern.  I agree with some speakers on the whole commonage approach.  I have used this simple example before.  There are ten shareholders on a commonage, three of whom are dormant, four inactive and three active, and the total number of sheep allowed on the commonage is 300.  If the three farmers each have 100 sheep, using the whole-commonage approach, the commonage is being grazed and looked after.  Based on what the Commission should be looking at, it would say that the commonage is being managed correctly by the shareholders.  The three active farmers would be concerned that suddenly the number of sheep would be divided by ten and they would get 30 sheep instead of 100.  Some of the inactive farmers have no interest in going back on the hills and the question arises as to what one does with the dormant shares.  Some of the inactive farmers are elderly and are not in a position to be walking hills due to conditions such as arthritis or high blood pressure.  There is a range of factors, because there are more farmers over 85 than there are under 35.  These issues are hugely complex.  I believe in the whole-commonage approach.  If the commonage is being managed correctly, the question of who is doing what should be irrelevant.  I would like to see the delegation convince the Commission of this.  Dr. Bleasdale used the example of south Connemara, which he said was in GAEC, while the situation is not as good in north Connemara.  If south Connemara is doing things correctly, why delve into it and try to solve something that is not a problem when one could end up causing a problem by doing so?  If it is in GAEC then, obviously, somebody is doing something right.  The farmers who are not grazing are contributing to GAEC, as are those who are grazing.  Overall, the commonage is in GAEC so all the individual farmers are in GAEC.  </p><p>  In respect of dormancy, I would imagine there are legal implications in terms of somebody having shares somewhere on a folio.  It might be in their grandfather's name, or the owner might be long gone or might not know it exists.  What are the legal implications where those people have not farmed for years or decades or since the LPIS system came into operation?  I support the view that the slack be taken up by active farmers.</p><p>  Traditional stock is of concern.  I am not sure if the suggestions came from the delegation, but the newspapers mentioned animals such as Kerry cows and Dexter cattle, which are not available in huge numbers and would in large part not be of interest to many farmers.</p></speech>

I will try to run with the themes contained in members' contributions.  In that context, Deputy Kyne posed an interesting question with regard to a commonage with 300 sheep which is being used by three farmers but in respect of which there are ten shareholders.  Which is the most important aspect?  Is it that three farmers with 100 sheep each are actively working the commonage?  Should we insist that the ten farmers should each have 30 sheep on it?  I would say that the three farmers with 100 sheep each should continue to work the commonage and that it should be maintained in GAEC.  The key point is that a whole-of-commonage approach is the most important thing in the context of what we achieve here.  We must ensure that we put in place practical solutions that help us to solve the problem.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill referred to the minimum and maximum figures.  I accept that they were contentious at the time but they provide a starting point.  The consultation process is ongoing.  The problem is that there are four specific dangers which will arise if we do not do this right.  The first of these is the damage that would be done to the reputation of this country if we lost the commonages.  The second is the loss of payments to farmers.  If the latter are not doing what they are supposed to be doing, they will lose their payments.  The third is the possibility that the Commission could either restart proceedings against this country or put in place massive disallowances against the Government for not enforcing the rules.  The fourth is the loss of biodiversity, recreational areas, etc., as a result of the fact that the commonages would simply become overgrown.  Those are the dangers and that is why we must get matters right.  I am not putting a timescale on this because we are still involved in the consultation process and we want to discuss this matter with everyone.</p><p>  In the gorse fires which occurred in 2011, we lost 1,500 ha of forest alone.  We learned a great deal from what occurred in 2011 and it was a hard way to learn.  If we have a burning policy, it must be managed in such a way that the appalling damage that occurred in 2011 will not be repeated.</p><p>  Senator Comiskey referred to overgrazing and undergrazing.  The agreements must reflect the realities that exist.  That is the only way to proceed.  If overgrazing is the problem, then animals should be removed from the commonage.  Undergrazing is increasingly becoming a problem.  We have lost 2 million sheep.  This means that 2 million lawn-mowers have disappeared during the past few years.  There were once over 5 million sheep in the national herd, whereas now there are around 3.5 million.  Overgrazing is a problem in some areas but undergrazing is increasingly becoming a more major problem.</p><p>  Deputy Barry referred to map acres.  There is no tolerance for map acres from my Department's point of view.  We have dealt with a number of cases in which people have had more entitlements than land and where they submitted bogus claims in respect of land that was not in GAEC or that was virtually mountainous.  A number of cases went to the appeals office recently and those involved lost their entire payments.  We have a zero-tolerance attitude to cases involving map acres.</p><p>  The question of how to deal with dormancy is continually being discussed.  As stated earlier, this cannot be avoided and we must come up with some way to deal with it.  The issue that arises is whether those who are active will step up to the plate and assist us.  The difficulty is that there are commonages in respect of which there are nine or ten shares but where there are only three farmers remaining.  There must be some way of dealing with that issue.</p><p>  A percentage of the future CAP payment will be devoted to coupling.  There are a series of competing interests - whether it is suckler cows or whatever - in this regard.  I am not sure, therefore, whether coupling is the solution.</p><p>  Those are some of my preliminary thoughts on the points raised.  I will now ask Mr. Evans and Dr. Bleasdale to offer their opinions.</p></speech>

We spoke about these previously in the context of what farmers either declare or do not declare.  The figures provided by Dr. Bleasdale relate to the total reference area.  The latter is the total eligible area as we see it and this amounts to approximately 430,000 ha.  The figure of 300,000 ha represents the total area claimed by farmers in 2012.  As stated earlier, some farmers do not claim their entire share.  Other reasons for the difference between the two figures include dormant shareholders.</p><p>  Dormancy is an issue that continues to arise.  It is going to crop up more and more in both the committee's discussions and in our consultation process.  There may be other solutions other than paying someone to leave part of a commonage unfarmed.  There may be other solutions at which we must look.  There are legal issues with regard to how commonage can be claimed.  Claimants will have their own views on this.  This is not official policy, but it is possible that those who are using commonages at present might be able to lease or rent more of the land involved from dormant shareholders in order to obtain higher payments.  If this were to happen, it would also ensure that the relevant commonage would be fully utilised, grazed properly and kept in GAEC.  This is an approach to which consideration could be given.  However, I am not sure whether this would be legal or would meet the requirements under the relevant EU regulations.</p></speech>

In any event we are as fully aware of the situation in County Donegal as we are in other parts of the country.</p><p>  On the possibility of making commonage a region - in reality the implementation of the new CAP reform will be very complex because of the elements on convergence, flat-rate payments and the requirements for land measurement to participate in greening.  The implementation will be difficult for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and for farmers as well.  I am not sure that making commonage lands a separate region would be the answer to the problems of the farmers that are dealing with it.</p><p>  I will now respond to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's question on data.  Dr. Andy Bleasdale and Mr. Kevin Smyth outlined the background to the data on the minimum and maximum.  The initial push for this came from farmers with commonages who were hindered by the destocking plans and wanted to expand.  The Department launched AEOS 3 in the autumn of 2012 and under it there was a requirement for farmers with commonage lands to submit details of the stock they intended to put on the commonage lands.  These were the drivers at the time.  It has now been made clear that this will not be implemented until we fully consult with all parties involved.  The urgency of this issue relates to the European Commission rather than any internal driver.  In my view it is important to put the bones of a long-term plan in place, which must be for a long duration to work, but it can be tweaked as we go along.  The first steps of the plan is the consultation process.  Unless there is a comprehensive and complete process that involves everybody in the consultation process, in my view the plan will not work.  The urgency is to get the consultation process under way and eventually to start putting the bones of a plan in place.</p></speech>

As other speakers have said earlier, commonages are difficult.  The position is that people have been claiming them all along and they were not aware of it being an appurtenance.  The situation has evolved.  When area aid was introduced, 150,000 applications came in with maps of commonage.  Nobody was in a position to drill down deeply into who owned commonage and who did not and why they were claiming it.  In a great many situations, one person claiming the commonage would send in a map for all the other shareholders and that is how it got into the system.  In the past few years, as part of the EU audits that incorporated commonages, we had to try to create a database and bring our systems more up to date so that we can stand over the information on who is entitled to claim a share of the commonage and who is not.  Most of the commonage land in the country is registered in undivided shares that one can rent and they do not have to travel with the parent holding.</p><p>  Where the commonage is an appurtenance it means that it legally cannot be detached from the greenland or the lowland to which it is an appurtenant.  Essentially in simple terms, it is not legal to say in respect of an appurtenance,&quot;I have this grazing right and I will give it to another person for X amount.&quot;  Historically how it evolved down through the Land Commission was the appurtenance went with a specific piece of land and if one is not farming that land one is not entitled to the grazing right.  In the context of trying to return to the way things were done historically and keeping the land well maintained in the way they were farmed years ago, the question of anybody detaching a grazing right in the past such as 150 years ago, would not have happened.  As Senator Michael Comiskey said, every year the farmers would meet up and decide how they would graze the commonage.  In addition, one can have grazing rights that are appurtenance as things called sums, collops and can be calculated <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the total amount of green land one has so they are not like other normally undivided commonage.  We cannot be seen to be going against the legal position that is enshrined in land law.  In addition, the Commission will be back to us on the issue of commonages.  Although the Commission has not gone into the registered ownership, of who is claiming what and if the person is so entitled, it will do so some day.  The answer is that it does not appear that one can detach an appurtenance from the green land to which it attaches on a folio.  However, perhaps somewhere in a Commission regulation there may be something that contradicts this so that if one is farming the land one is entitled to claim it.</p></speech>

Perhaps the issue of an appurtenance needs to be examined.  The reality is that a farmer will lose all his or her payment, which is not the basis of doing business.</p></speech>

The person did not go out to break the law and there was no intention to break the rules but obviously his claim did not conform with the rules.  The person is now in a very difficult situation.

If one is trying to reach agreement on commonages, and one cannot reach an agreement, one of the people who does not want to agree could be going down the route of saying that person is entitled to claim.  They do not have the green land, they are renting an appurtenance which is not a legal interest.  It works both ways.</p></speech>

Mr. Paud Evans responded to a question on the pressure to a considerable extent but we have a monitoring committee called the SAC monitoring committee which is between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and all the farming organisations including ICSA as well as IFA, ICMSA and so on.</p><p>  During the past couple of years sorting out the commonage plans has been a major issue and in particular allowing restocking, on which we were keen because of the undergrazing issue.  In that context and recognising that collective responsibility is difficult, the mantra has been freedom to farm and that does suggest to some extent that where one can do it, collective responsibility would be a good way to go but we recognise that is not particularly simple in the large commonages.</p><p>  To return to the issue of fencing in respect of sorting out overgrazing issues, our experience is that adding fencing to the hill makes for additional new lines as obviously the sheep will walk the fence and one starts to run into new problems.  There is a temptation to hold large number of animals at certain times.  It might solve one problem but very often it creates a new problem elsewhere.</p></speech>

The problem has not gone away and there is a whole set of different problems.  To some extent, I rue the day I got involved, but in another perverse way I would like to see the issue through to a solution.  This is within our grasp if we can work well together and much better than was the case in the past.  There is that opportunity.  This is not idle talk; we welcome dialogue because that is the only way to secure a material effect on the ground.</p><p>  We need to separate the list of legacy issues relating to the commonage framework plans.  It comes back to the question of who is driving the agenda.  It often came from farmers themselves who wanted to be more active on commonages than they were allowed to be.  They approached us with a view to having the commonage framework plan replaced, but it was a question of what would replace it.  We cannot allow a free-for-all.  As we do not want to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, there has to be a new reality, a new vision, a new partnership that will allow us to plan for better management of the uplands, while protecting payments as best as possible.</p><p>  Reference was made to the compensation culture.  I do not like the word, &quot;compensation&quot; and Senator Michael Comiskey made the first reference to it.  These are payments for deliverables, whether they are ecosystem goods and services or sheep production when there is a market for it.  It has to be couched in that language because the compensation culture has to be done away with.  Farmers are farming.  They farm in productive areas to deliver produce and in more extensive areas deliver biodiverse goods and services, both of which should be valued and paid for.  We need to do away with the language we tend to use - me included - such as compensation.  It should be payment for services.  This would make it a more positive product and the farmer feel valued.  He or she is not being restricted but rather encouraged to do something positive.</p><p>  Senator Michael Comiskey referred to commonages being overgrazed.  We need to remember that that is still the case.  We must not lose sight of the bigger issue when dealing with what we consider to be a bigger problem of undergrazing.  Overgrazing is still happening and we need to address that issue.  We are not reinventing the wheel in terms of collective management.  In our grandparents' time they managed to hammer out solutions and come to agreements, self-regulate and self-determine.  It is not easy to turn back the clock, but where that can be progressed, it should be done.  I do not think the liaison committees offer the ideal solution; equally, I do not think the collective model is ideal, when it is a case of forcing all farmers on a commonage to sit around a table and stare across at people to whom they have not spoken for 30 years.  If there was professional support from a planner or facilitator, he or she would engage with each individual and acquire from him or her the knowledge he or she wishes to impart through the process.  The facilitator would pull that information together to plan for sustainable management of commonages in the years ahead.</p></speech>

I suggest that, as we have had two and a half hours of very constructive engagement, we end the discussion at this point.  The delegates have had a flavour of the level of interest, engagement and knowledge around the table among members.  There is genuine interest in this topic.  Dr. Bleasdale has suggested there is a need to develop a practical plan to deal with commonage issues to find a lasting solution.  Dialogue is the only way a practical solution will be achieved and economics is a key element of it.  Over-grazing occurred because of the coupled system.  The making of headage payments meant that it was better economically to have more sheep.  Likewise, economics is playing a part in having the opposite effect, having regard to vegetation management plans which encompass burning and other actions such as the cutting back of rhododendrons.  We need to develop the bones of a plan to establish principles.  Collective responsibility will not be the solution in cases in which one party plays truant.  We need to establish how we can deal with the issue of dormancy and with those who will not co-operate, while ensuring each commonage is in good condition.  It will boil down to carrying out a series of laborious and extensive individual plans and concentration on the fewer than 20% of commonages which are not in good condition, either as a result of overgrazing or undergrazing.  It will be a case of starting with these commonages and leaving the ones in good condition until last.</p><p>  I appreciate that Deputies &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Se&aacute;n Kyne both have a great interest in this matter.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne is in attendance.  Where I come from there are issues to do with a vegetation management plan.  In other areas in counties Donegal and Kerry and Connemara there are large national parks and significant interaction between the State and individual grazers.  It may be possible to establish a sub-committee to engage with both the Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service as part of a consultation process.  The committee has something to offer the process.  Other stakeholders will also be attending the committee.</p><p>  I again thank the delegates for their attendance.  I also thank the members who have stuck with this issue.  I hope everyone has had an opportunity to express his or her views.</p></speech>

As Mr. O'Sullivan pointed out, the area is moving so quickly that we need to update it.  The committee has agreed that we would keep all the proposals under review and constantly challenge them and make sure they are implemented or acted upon and responded to.  The Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills appeared before the committee before Christmas to discuss the issue.  In particular, we raised the issue of the technology visa, which the delegation has been championing and pushing for, with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  His comments indicated he had moved further on with regard to introducing such an measure and he is going through the process.  I agree that it is slow but it is important and something to which we are committed.  As Mr. O'Sullivan noted, it is about bringing excellent skills to this country that will in turn feed out into and develop further jobs in that area.  Mr. O'Sullivan outlined it very well in the submission he gave the committee.</p><p>  Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned the quality of our graduates but he did not expand on it.  Could he expand on it?  It is something of which we are very conscious.  We asked that the issue of students dropping out of third level be examined.  The third-level sector is examining that.  Is Mr. O'Sullivan happy with the liaison with the third-level sector?  Is there enough dialogue?  Our report found that there needs to be more communication.</p></speech>

The quality of Irish graduates from technological universities was unparalleled in the 1980s and 1990s.  They had a fantastic reputation as some of the best and brightest who chose these fields of study.  That trend changed dramatically.  The committee's report pointed out that Ireland is now 26th out of EU countries - I am not sure the total number of countries.</p></speech>

That is not a great start.  If we at primary and secondary levels are not producing the quality we need to have at third level, that is a fundamental we need to address.  Many people are doing things in that area.  I am trying to help out in some areas such as introducing the Khan Academy to Ireland.  Irish universities have an opportunity to respond to the needs of the jobs market but it is really a question of where parents and society are directing children to study.</p><p>  There are a number of issues here that are too broad for me to address.  We need to be selective and recognise that these most talented positions are in the top 5% of our graduates rather than at a lower cut-off level.  Two or three years ago, one could get into Trinity College by being in the top third of one's high school graduating class if one was applying for engineering.  That is not selective enough.  The top design engineers will be much more talented than those who are slightly above the high school average.  We should be looking to get really super-talented people to apply for this and we will only do so if they have the background in the mathematical skills in which we are sorely lacking.

There was a series of actions within that, one of which directly addressed the situation described by Senator Clune.  This was the foresight group.  It is a good beginning and brings industry and academic leaders together to discuss what relationship is required to deliver courses that respond to companies' needs in the medium to long term.  That is highly populated with leaders from the technology sector.</p><p>  On the other side of that and reflecting what Mr. O'Sullivan said about image and careers within the sector, over the past 18 months we have seen quite a shift in the perception of the technology sector.  It is now seen not just as a very strong sector for jobs but a very strong sector for a good career.  We see that in CAO application rates, which have increased from between 20% to 60% in particular colleges.  We are moving in the right direction with regard to creating a larger pool of graduates available to the sector and with regard to quality as well.  Certainly the foresight group will be a powerful vehicle to influence change.  </p></speech>

We are talking about the very top talent - the people who will mentor the people coming out of colleges in three years.  To get those guys, we need a really predictable process and that is what this scheme we have seen presented to us by the Department in draft form will move us towards.</p></speech>

There will be no announcement of projects that have had to be passed privately by companies.  It impacts in two ways.  It impacts in respect of jobs gained by other jurisdictions that we would otherwise have gained.  Those jobs still go somewhere.  Most importantly, it concerns the reputation of Ireland.  If a company passes up a project, it is less likely to be looked on favourably again when a project comes up, so certainly the impact relates to jobs and reputation.</p></speech>

There is a need to provide the relevant courses in schools and get children excited about them.  I am the parent of a number of primary schoolchildren and when I meet other mothers and fathers in the schoolyard, I discover that they are all excited about technology.  They talk about encouraging their children to take an interest in technology and join CoderDojo while still in primary school as opposed to waiting until they go to secondary school.  There is a demand on the parents side, but there are still issues on the education side in putting ICT in place in schools.  I do not refer to kids sitting in front of computers and playing games but to actually becoming involved in development, programming and other interesting things which will stimulate their minds.  If we could do this in the education sector, it would be great.</p><p>  On the tech industry side, we need to bring on board those people who are going to develop these graduates when they emerge from colleges in three to four years time.  I built businesses in the 1980s and 1990s and we brought in <i>emigr&eacute;s</i> from Philips, Siemens, AT&amp;amp;T and other companies across the globe.  We built a tremendous tech industry in the 1990s by bringing on board Irish people who had travelled abroad and obtained six, seven or eight years' experience and building businesses around them.  The people concerned remained in Ireland and it is not possible to attract any others like them.  As a result, we must bring in people from abroad who possess the type of top-tier skills around which we can build businesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-19a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean O'Sullivan" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013021900006#F00300"><p>If given the opportunity to opt for one of the two - in his own book Mr. Cunningham cheated in this regard - I would probably choose education.  We could do a number of things.  For example, the Khan Academy involves self-paced instruction and inverting the classroom.  These approaches can work at a secondary level and encourage the brightest minds to apply themselves in focusing on what our society truly needs.  We need more of the nation-building types of individuals who can create jobs.  Many people do not realise that the top talent from Irish institutions is going into law and medicine which are very noble professions but they relate to service economies.  That is very limited because one is not scaling the number of jobs one is creating for society.  If an engineer is creative and bright, he or she can develop a company or an industry which can create hundreds of jobs, whereas a doctor may service a couple of patients each day.  Our society needs to produce people to fill these roles.</p><p>  We in Ireland have a tendency to say, "Let us give something to this, that or other university and it will develop specialists in a certain area."  I do not believe that is necessarily the best way to operate.  I would create one MIT-like institution in Ireland which all of the very top talent would attend.  Everyone who graduated would know that he or she was competing among the very best in the country.  This would ensure we would not lower the skill or talent level in each of the universities.</p><p>  Another action I would take would be to bring to an end the overly specialised disciplines.  I invented the term "cloud computing".  I do not know if members are familiar with it.  Irish institutions now offer degrees in cloud computing, which is nuts.  They also offer degrees in other super-specialised areas.  It is not that these are not important specialties relating to important industries.  Elsewhere in the world, however, people obtain degrees in electrical engineering or computer science and they may specialise in or concentrate on a particular aspect.  Here we offer esoteric degrees which will not prepare someone for his or her entire career.  Rather, they will only prepare someone for the next five years and this is only if one truly believes the degree is in such a specialised area.  There were no cloud computing systems ten years ago, but software was available.  We must be concerned about this over-specialisation.  Much of it is the result of the way the points system for the leaving certificate works.  All of this would need to be adjusted.</p><p>  That is my take on the matter.  I do not have all the answers because I just run a business.  Since the Chairman asked me to indulge my fantasy, however, I took the opportunity to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-19a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Donnery" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013021900006#F00400"><p>My colleagues' companies have all the big solutions.  In the context of recruitment, there is a worldwide war going on in attracting talent.  As Mr. Cunningham stated, when a person from Russia or elsewhere applies for a job in Ireland, he or she is also probably applying for jobs in ten other countries.  We have a small window of opportunity in attracting these individuals and if we do not grab them as quickly as possible, we lose them.  There was a work authorisation programme in Ireland up to 2009.  A former Minister, Mary Harney, got rid of the programme, which created huge difficulties at the time.  We had not actually lost any IT jobs at that point, but we were losing them in other areas.  The programme in question allowed us to bring people into Ireland in approximately two weeks.  At present, it takes two weeks just to get someone into the country in order that he or she might attend an interview.  If the person is from Azerbaijan or some other country where there is no Irish consulate, we must make an application through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and via another country's consulate in getting him or her to Ireland.  As a result, the interview process is delayed.  In addition, the process relating to green card applications takes six to eight weeks to complete.</p><p>  I accept that we have been hammering on about this matter for a long period.  However, the position is becoming serious, not just for Apple and other major companies but also for small indigenous Irish companies which are really suffering.  The process is having a knock-on effect on wages in this country because people who are here are receiving seven or eight offers when they seek employment elsewhere.  Salaries are increasing and the smaller indigenous Irish companies that are creating great products and in which those emerging from our universities with specialist skills will seek positions are unable to compete.  There is a need to expedite matters and make this an open country in order that we can attract both companies and the relevant specialists required to fill particular roles.</p><p>  We have been involved in discussions with successive Ministers for the past four to five years on this matter.  Let us consider an example.  Pramerica Systems Ireland Limited in County Donegal has been in operation since 1999.  It started out with ten staff and now has 900.  It built its workforce on the back of the work authorisation programme.  Top-level staff were brought in from Singapore, Russia, the United States, etc., and the company grew its teams around them.  It now takes on graduates from Irish universities each year.  There is no reason we cannot be winners on the worldwide stage.</p></speech>

We need generalists who are able to be problem solvers and extremely talented across a range of areas.  The job one obtains when one graduates from college will not be the same five years later.  It will be slightly different.  One might perhaps be managing something differently or the job may be broader in nature.  One's career changes.  Our careers should be broad but with specialisation, where necessary.  The focus of the leaving certificate system seems to be that we should create niche degrees which will attract more highly qualified students.  We should have more selective and wide open colleges for different quality candidates.</p></speech>

They referred to subjects.  We all know maths is really important.  Is science as important as used to be the case and should it be a core subject on the junior and leaving certificate syllabuses?  I accept that we do not have enough graduates, that there is a high level of unemployment and that we need to try to deal with these issues together.  It is important, however, that when we emerge from the current phase there will still be people with IT skills coming to Ireland, particularly as they bring with them diversity, etc.  I heard Mr. O'Sullivan speak on this topic previously - it might have been in the context of Silicon Valley - and perhaps he might enlighten us further on it.  In this regard, I refer particularly to the assertion that if we attract 10,000 jobs from abroad, it will lead to the creation of 100,000 jobs locally.</p></speech>

As Mr. O'Sullivan said, we are looking for thinkers, people we can mould and who have a broad set of skills.  In the case of medicine, one does not begin with studying to become a dermatologist or an orthopaedic surgeon; rather, one spends six years in general medicine and then proceeds to specialisation.  It is no different in industry with regard to engineering or computer science.  We can mould people with a broad initial education.</p></speech>

The performance of girls in the STEM subjects exceeds that of boys, particularly in all-girls' schools, which is ironic.  They are not offered higher level maths, even though they are probably the best at it.  This is a serious loss to the workforce because they account for 50% of the potential workforce.</p></speech>

There is more of a drive by parents who want their children to have a future in the technology sector.  I suggest it is very difficult to find higher level physics courses in all-girls' schools.  Higher level maths may be offered, but the students may not receive enough encouragement to study it.  If there are not enough students willing to study it, the school will not provide a class that year.  Parents are beginning to push for these subjects and we need schools to be incentivised.  The policy of offering extra bonus points for maths has been very successful, as shown in the CAO applications.  We need to continue this policy.</p></speech>

Chemistry and biology are also important and I do not discount them.  It is a case of allowing second-level students to participate in a process where they learn to think in order that they will go to university with their minds open to thinking for themselves.  They can then progress from college into the industry where that thinking will be used.  The great thing about maths and physics is not so much the specific knowledge one learns but rather the fact that one must solve problems, think about systems and the way things work.  That is what we want in our industries.  Software and programming, knowing Java, for example, are fundamental, but it is also vital to understand a complicated system, whether it be text messaging, how a gas system works, for example, and applying this knowledge to software.  We need to have people who can think about problems in a lateral fashion and apply software methods to solve them.</p></speech>

There is an expression, "Women hold up half the sky".  Unfortunately, when it comes to programming positions, there may be one out of ten who is actually in the field.  Supposedly 25% of women are working in technical areas, but this includes medicine and other fields which are not the software and high tech areas.  We would really like to see greater participation by women.  It is noticeable in some design areas in which several women are heading up companies, but we would like to see more.  Women are not carrying half the burden in technology jobs, which is not because they are not good at it.  The challenge for society is to encourage more women to work in an area which can develop their creativity.</p></speech>

During the dot.com era the level of female participation was not at 50%, but many more were involved.  The uptake is not as good now.  There are many theories, one being the tech area is perceived as being too macho, or that boys are more familiar with computer games and PlayStation which are very much male-oriented.  This may have turned off many girls from moving into the tech area.  I agree with the point that honours maths is available in girls' schools but physics and applied maths are not available.  This is due to lack of demand and it becomes self-fulfilling.</p></speech>

I thought we were moving in the other direction.  I understood our education system was too broad, yet Mr. O'Sullivan argues that a general or broad educational base is needed.  Mr. Cunningham has explained it very well that a medical student does not decide to be a dermatologist first but rather must study to be a doctor for five or six years before engaging in specialisation.</p></speech>

We are doing work that requires brilliant minds, creative minds and creative problem solving.  Most of the software industry is like that, in fact.  Perhaps Mr. Sweetman could speak on this question also.  Sometimes there is a tendency among recruiters to say a person needs to have a certain skill such as JavaScript, or they need to have HTML5 or whatever.  However, most of the time those skills can be learned in a matter of two or three months, enough to be good at it.  I knew 19 computer programming languages by the time I was 19 years of age.  If one is good enough at something it is not difficult to pick up a different set of similar skills.  Employers such as those I mentioned might as well be saying "I would like to hire a mechanic who uses only wrenches."  That does not work; one must have the ability to use blowtorches, wrenches and other tools.  As an industry we do not need totally hyper-focused people; we need problem solvers.  It is a contrast.  I do not know if my colleague can explain it better.</p></speech>

Also, we can be over-critical.  Our concern is about courses that are very narrow.  By training I am an electronic engineer.  Ninety-nine percent of what I learned in college - specific technical things - I have never deployed in industry, but 100% of the reasoning I learned was applicable to what I did.  I did very little software at college but went straight into a software job.  That is what we are looking for in a growing economy.  Employers are willing to train people - that is what we do.  We mould people into what we want them to be.</p></speech>

Mr. Cunningham said employers are willing to train people.  How engaged are employers across the board for all the different levels?  The witnesses are specifically talking about the high-level end, but there are many other jobs along the way.  I know employers want to do it, but are they doing it or are they restricted?  Is there anything we can do as a committee to ensure there is more engagement with employers in training people and in course development?  Even though we have had many of the third level institutes appear before the committee, I get the impression that there is still a breakdown in course development and in targeting the right people.  Is there an issue with the public and private sectors working together in terms of colleges and courses?  Is there a need to focus more fusion there?  Is the organisation not involved enough, or does Mr. Sweetman consider it is beginning to happen, as he may see it more clearly?  If not, we may need to give a bit of a push as well.</p><p>  In regard to career guidance, does the industry or the organisation itself engage with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors?  Is the issue being pushed enough at school level?  Nearly every day when we knock on doors or engage with people, parents ask along which route they should direct their children.  Where is their future?  Where are their jobs?  Parents want more direction and more help.  I do not know how we can do it, but they need to hear from the organisation.  The questions we are asked every time we go to somebody's house are "What do we get our children to do?  What is their future?  What courses and what subjects should they pursue?".  We are asked that all the time.  Parents want to do the right thing and are interested but the message does not appear to be getting through.  Perhaps the issue is career guidance.  I do not know at what stage it goes wrong.</p></speech>

What we are seeing is that people are not really engaged.  We have started talking to children in schools and so on, and I am involved a little at local level.  It is about getting people to do what they love when they are 15, 16, 17 or 19 years of age.  One of the problems in Ireland over the years has been changing fashions - if construction is the fashion today, people go into the construction sector.  The same applies to law and medicine.  Funnily enough, IT was fashionable back in 1998 and 1999, but then there was the dot-com bust, and nobody did IT for three years.  Now there is a three- to four-year gap during which not enough people pursued IT degrees.  It is a case of getting people to do what they love doing, or to do a general degree in an area in which they are interested and then specialise in year four or when they start working with an employer.  There is much specialisation earlier on, which does not help, as many students drop out in first and second year.  They may be interested in the general subject they are studying but not the specialisations.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for the offer to help.  That is something on which the committee could be strong.  The great advantage is that much has already been done.  There are a number of programmes and initiatives out there and we need to focus on picking the ones that are working effectively.  On the issue of engagement with the industry, universities and institutes of technology, I can point the committee to strong examples of programmes that receive Government support.  To cut a long story short, I would encourage more support for these programmes.  The two examples are the following.  A very powerful conversion programme, a master's in applied software technology, is being developed by Ericsson in conjunction with the ICT Ireland Skillnet, through Skillnets Ltd. funding, which is under the auspices of the Government.  In the first cohort, Ericsson has been able to take 50 people off the live register, put them through an intensive master's programme and guarantee them jobs as strong software developers within Ericsson.  That first programme was very successful, and now there is a cohort of 100 people.  There is no reason this programme cannot be replicated across many of the other large employer-based ICT companies.  The attractive aspect of the programme is that on successful completion the graduates are guaranteed a job, but also, these are anchor jobs, which secure the footprint of Ericsson in Ireland.  That can be replicated.  The way the programme was developed was that individuals from Ericsson worked directly on what they wanted to see within the programme.  It turned out that a level 9 master's degree was what was required.  That went out to tender, and Athlone IT is delivering the programme.  Fundamental to that was the Government programme through Skillnets Ltd.</p><p>  To show that we are not talking just about high-level skills, VMware and a group of companies in Ballincollig, Cork, pooled together through another Skillnets programme - the Irish Software Association Skillnet - when seeking to fill entry-level positions.  It was looking for two aspects in terms of entry into the programme: a person's attitude, and his or her ability to use a computer in a very basic sense.  Out of that it got many programming specialists, some within its cloud computing services - about 100 people.  That was a specific programme developed with local educational institutions and also directly with companies.  In terms of assistance, I would certainly recommend that programmes such as Skillnets be encouraged to continue and that funding be supported.  Another development is the 760 conversion programmes that were recently launched by the Government.  They are very strong because they are working with industry and academic institutions in trying to develop as best they can what the industry needs and trying to align this with work placement.</p><p>  What is important about Skillnets is not just that there is funding but that the programmes being developed are often the first of their kind.  They are industry-led and have not existed before.  For example, a project management diploma being taught by DIT, which was developed through a Skillnet, is actually the first of its kind in Europe.  Not only does that bode well for those going through the course; it also gives Ireland a strong reputation for tackling the needs that are important to companies.  </p><p>  With regard to career guidance, there have been some very strong initiatives, and continued support for them would be good.  Through industry groups such as IBEC we host career guidance conferences once a year and go through the key topics and the key career options for students.</p></speech>

We will engage with the Minister and with the efforts of the witnesses and everybody else, we might see some action with the action plan for jobs.  This version will continue the efforts of last year.  There are many issues on which we can engage with the witnesses on a more regular basis and we will focus on this area as a committee.  We will engage with the witnesses again during the year if that is okay.  I thank them for coming today.  We will be meeting the Minister next week to discuss the action plan for jobs.</p></speech>
