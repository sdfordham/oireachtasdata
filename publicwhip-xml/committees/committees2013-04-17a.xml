We note this issue is one of the topics for debate under the Presidency of the European Council, given the need for modern languages in today's multicultural economy.  It is also an issue tabled to the agenda by members as something we need to address.  I welcome Ms Breda Naughton and Ms Anne O'Mahony, qualifications, curriculum and assessment policy unit, Ms Gr&aacute;inne Morrissey, higher education division, and Mr. Paul Caffrey, inspectorate.  I draw their attention the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise them that their opening statements and any documents submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>  I now invite Ms Naughton to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda Naughton" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013041700003#C00300"><p>We are pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the joint committee today on the provision of languages in the Irish education system, particularly in the context of the EU and multilingualism.  The joint committee will have received our executive summary, which I will read through and may add to.  I am accompanied today by Ms Ann O'Mahony, who works with me in the qualifications, curriculum and assessment section, Mr. Paul Caffrey from the inspectorate, who is also a specialist in the languages area, and Ms Gr&aacute;inne Morrissey from the higher education division.</p><p>  At primary level, the focus is on the acquisition of the two national languages, English and Irish.  Beyond primary level, the focus expands to include not only English and Irish but other languages, which I will elaborate on later.  As the purpose of today's discussion is multilingualism in an EU context, I will start with that issue.  It is more than 12 years since the Barcelona European Council meeting identified language competencies as an essential component of a competitive knowledge-based economy.  The EU has advocated that education systems seek to promote competency in the mother tongue plus two foreign languages from an early age.  In Ireland, Irish and English are national languages and both are taught at primary and second level.  Accordingly, while the vast majority of students in Ireland study three languages at second level, only the third language is counted in this European indicator of foreign languages.  Ten years on from the Barcelona European Council, the Commission's communication, Rethinking Education: Investing in Skills for Better Socioeconomic Outcomes, published last November, again emphasised the importance of language learning, particularly for jobs and mobility.</p><p>  The latest edition of the Eurobarometer special report on Europeans' foreign language competencies and attitudes to foreign languages, which was published last June, showed that Ireland had registered a notable increase since the previous report in 2006 in the number of respondents who indicated they could speak at least one or two foreign languages well enough to hold a conversation.  While we are dealing with languages in the context of the EU, it is important also to note that such an approach is promoted by the Council of Europe, which advocates plurilingualism.</p><p>  I will now deal with the national language strategy.  Last year, a report by the expert group on future skills needs, Key Skills for Enterprise to Trade Internationally, recommended the development of a national language strategy with a five to ten-year horizon.</p> <p>In 2011 the Government published the national literacy and numeracy strategy to strengthen the development of English and Irish.  This is in line with the 20-year strategy for Irish and the Gaeltacht Act 2012.  An integrated language curriculum which will focus on the transfer of skills between both languages at primary level is being developed by the NCCA.  It is currently concentrating on junior classes at primary level, up to second class.  This approach will provide a strong foundation for learning other languages and is based on research that includes three reports published last year by the NCCA.</p><p> Post-primary education builds on the foundation established at primary level by offering not only English and Irish but also a range of foreign languages.  French, German, Spanish and Italian are currently offered at junior cycle, while Russian, Japanese and Arabic are also available at leaving certificate level.  In recognition of the number of EU citizens in this country, it is also possible to take leaving certificate examinations in other native languages.  Last October the Minister launched the new framework for the junior cycle, which will support schools in fostering practical language learning skills.  The framework will give all students the opportunity to study at least one language in addition to Irish and English.  Revised syllabuses of modern foreign languages are scheduled for implementation in 2016.  The new revised syllabus for English will be implemented from 2014 and the new syllabus in Irish from 2015.  </p><p> A transition year module in Chinese was launched last year, having already been piloted by over 20 schools.  For many years Japanese has been offered in a number of transition year programmes, resulting in an uptake of Japanese to leaving certificate level by 239 students in 2012.  In 2012 over 30,000 students sat a European language for the leaving certificate, including 26,000 in French, 6,700 in German, 4,000 in Spanish and 700 in Polish, with smaller numbers taking other languages such as Italian, Japanese and Russian and Arabic.  Students in the LCVP and the applied leaving certificate are also required to study a modern language.  The post-primary languages initiative is broadening its remit to provide support for all teachers of modern foreign languages through the provision of materials on its website.  It offers support to schools who wish to introduce Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Russian. </p><p> Students in higher education have access to a wide range of foreign language courses at third level that can be taken as core subjects or in combination with a range of other disciplines across business, the arts, the humanities and the sciences.  Language programmes are also an important part of further education provision across both full-time and part-time courses.  A number of language programmes have also been selected for funding through the Springboard skills initiative, which was launched in May 2011.  Preliminary data from HEA research on the provision of foreign languages indicates that some 9,000 third level students are studying a foreign language.  The EU&rsquo;s Erasmus initiative has played a key role in enhancing the language proficiency of Irish graduates.  Some 28,000 Irish students have benefited from this programme over the past 25 years.  Irish participation in Erasmus has risen significantly in recent years, including an 18% increase last year, which was the fourth highest growth rate in Europe. </p><p> However, despite the significant level of language provision delivered by the education system, it is evident that less than a third of school leavers elect to develop their language competences further in higher education and far fewer graduates opt to pursue careers using their language skills.  While the education system can make provision for language, it is for wider society, including enterprise and communities, to highlight the advantages that studying languages can bring and attract more students into this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013041700004#D00200"><p>I welcome Ms Naughton and her colleagues from the Department of Education and Skills.  She outlined the current policies for improving the language capacity of students and the wider population.  Significant issues have arisen recently in regard to the foreign language capacity required for some of the jobs that have been attracted to this country.  PayPal received particular attention when it publicised the lack of capacity in this country to fill the roles it had created.  We have to ensure our education system allows people to become proficient in languages which can benefit them in terms of getting jobs.  I note that the recent Eurobarometer survey found that the figures had improved compared to 2006.  I ask for more detail regarding how they have improved, the current figures and where they leave us in comparison to our European counterparts.</p><p>  In regard to the potential for junior certificate reform to develop language capacity among students at second level, what are the plans in this regard?  Students currently study foreign languages for the junior certificate.  How will the proposed changes assist in developing their language capacity further?</p><p>  The modern languages in primary schools initiative was introduced on a pilot basis in 1998 but was discontinued by the Minister last year.  The initiative was shown to have an impact in terms of increasing uptake and interest in modern languages in participating schools.  It was a short-sighted approach by the Minister to cut rather than expand an apparently effective initiative.  Just 4% of primary school students have an opportunity to study a modern language.  In many cases it is only at secondary level that students first engage with a foreign language.  Evidence suggests that the younger a student engages with a modern language, the greater the capacity and the gr&aacute; that will develop.</p><p>  A considerable amount of time is devoted to Irish at primary level.  It is well documented that the results are not as good as they could be.  Is the Department considering any initiatives for improving outcomes given the amount of time dedicated to Irish?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013041700004#D00300"><p>Deputy McConalogue spoke about the modern language initiative.  I agree with him that it was a retrograde step to discontinue it in December 2011.  I can only speak from my own experience as a student of modern languages and other members may have differing opinions as teachers.</p> <p>I do not believe we do enough at primary level to prepare students to study modern languages.  For instance, I studied French in secondary school.  The way it was taught and the way I learned it was to achieve a grade in my leaving certificate, not to obtain a language skill which I would use beyond post-primary education.  We need to move away from this unhelpful approach.  As the delegation pointed out, there is a significant level of language provision at second level but less than a third opt to pursue it in higher education.  Maybe this is because the way it is being taught and learned in schools.  I did enough in post-primary education to obtain an A in French.  Six months after that I probably could not even have a conversation in French.  We need to examine the approach to teaching languages and we may get greater results in people obtaining languages.</p><p> The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is examining an integrated language curriculum for primary schools.  Will the Department give us more details on this and explain how it will help develop language skills?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1051" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013041700005#E00200"><p>I thank the officials for their presentation.  What are their views on the modern languages in primary schools initiative?  I felt this programme was progressive and helped children pick up languages at an age when they soak up much, so to speak.  Has the Department data on how many people use the languages they learned in second level and in third level in their working lives?  Has there been any progress in rolling out language courses for BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - countries and other emerging markets?  Does the Department have any data on how many students are taking up, for example, Portuguese or Russian?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/994" speakername="Jim Daly" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013041700005#E00300"><p>I welcome the delegation from the Department.  The teaching of languages is an area of considerable interest to many and I welcome the opportunity to shine a light on it at the committee.  There is a prevailing attitude to the teaching of French in our secondary schools.  Does the Department review this approach?  Why are we not teaching more German?  Have we reviewed the approach to the teaching of languages from the BRICS countries and other emerging markets.  Up to 30% of students study languages at third level.  How does Ireland compare to other EU member states and other countries for language uptake at third level?</p><p>  There was some debate during the general election about the compulsory teaching of Irish in schools.  Has the Department a view on compulsory Irish for the leaving certificate?  I feel very strongly about this.  From my experience of teaching, I believe compulsory Irish is its own worst enemy and does not help the teaching of the language.  People should be allowed to do it themselves by their own choice.</p><p>  The other bugbear of mine is the teaching of Irish.  It has been a significant challenge to the State over time and to those teaching it.  My four children were fluent in a second language before they went to school because their mother had a second language.  From listening to it in the home, they picked it up quickly and became fluent speakers.  It is a bugbear for me then that children spend 16 years in school but come out illiterate in Irish.  I believed one of the problems was teaching people to read in the language.  While I accept teaching methods have progressed, every language should be learned through speaking first and then reading and spelling can come afterwards.  What is the Department&rsquo;s view on the teaching of Irish in primary schools and lower-stream classes?  Will the officials also elaborate on the teaching of Chinese in schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda Naughton" time="13:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013041700005#E00400"><p>Deputy McConalogue asked how the junior cycle reform will assist language capacity in the schools.  In the new junior cycle we have set down statements of learning which describe what the students should know, understand and value at the end of their junior cycle.  Two of these statements are that they would be able to communicate in the school&rsquo;s first language, be it English or Irish, and have a level of proficiency in another language, appropriate to their particular ability.  All children will study English and Irish but they will also have an opportunity to study a foreign language.  That could be either as a full subject or a new short course of 100 hours.</p><p>  The NCCA is preparing a short course in Chinese.  Before, the first opportunity students had to learn the language was through a transition year module.  From 2014, they will have an opportunity to study it through a short course.  Schools can also develop short courses.  This would be helpful to those schools with a high proportion of migrants.  For example, we now have 700 young people doing Polish for the leaving certificate.  A school may offer short courses in languages where there is a demand for them.</p><p>  Deputy Jonathan O&rsquo;Brien referred to learning a language at school just to get the grade.  I know he is a bit younger than me but when I was in school it was all about learning theorems, geometry and poems by heart for the grade too.  We did not have a clue.  I remember going to Brussels airport with my parents.  They were delighted with me when I asked where to get a taxi in French.  However, when the man replied, I had not a clue what he was saying.  Today, there is a greater approach to learning a language orally and using it in real-life situations.  With the new junior cycle, the assessment emphasis will be changed.  It will be an assessment for learning that happened throughout the students experience in the three years.</p> <p>They will have opportunities to talk to teachers and to their peers and to understand what they are learning, rather than being dependent on waiting until the end of third year to have a grade allocated.  This is how the new junior cycle framework will provide a different emphasis from that it does currently in the context of languages.</p><p> I also want to speak about Irish.  The national literacy and numeracy strategy was published in 2011 and it set out policy with regard to languages at primary level. The 2009 PISA results indicated we had gone right down on the scale with regard to literary and numeracy, but there was also evidence that Irish students were not doing well in those areas.  We felt that if we got the foundation right there, this would then enable young people to learn other languages when they enter post-primary level.  Therefore, it was Government policy that decided this was the way to go.  However we must be mindful of policy on Irish and the Department of Education and Skills must report every few months to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on what we are doing about Irish in the context of the 20 year strategy and the Gaeltacht Act, which requires that Gaeltacht areas and service towns that look after Gaeltacht areas ensure there is appropriate provision for Irish.</p><p> I agree there are some concerns with regard to the teaching of Irish.  The committee is probably aware that from next year, new teachers will be required to spend two years doing their higher diploma and primary teachers will have to spend four years doing their degrees.  There is also consultation taking place currently with the Teaching Council with regard to the level of Irish and maths students should have to enable them enter teacher education.  Also, student teachers will be expected to spend two weeks each year in the Gaeltacht, rather than one period of three weeks.  This is being done in the hope that if we demand a higher level of Irish at entry and if we provide a greater opportunity to be involved in the Gaeltacht, these young teachers will have a greater understanding of the language, the culture and the Irish ethos.</p><p> There is also talk of a short literature course in Irish because in the new curricula there will be more emphasis on oral and aural ability.  Some young people in Irish medium schools and the Gaeltacht may have a greater proficiency in Irish and perhaps schools will provide a short course on literature in order to keep those groups interested in Irish.  This is being considered and may be possible through the new junior cycle framework.  </p><p> Perhaps Mr. Caffrey will speak now about teaching teachers and learning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Caffrey" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013041700006#F00200"><p>I was interested to hear Deputy O'Brien's comment on the learning of French.  In a newspaper recently a parent asked how it is that a person who gets a B at higher level French cannot go into a shop and ask for a loaf of bread.  The parent finished by saying that instead of taking down lists of French verbs and writing postcards to imaginary pen-friends, pupils should spend their time in class speaking and chatting in French and trying out their skills.  I hope schools harness new technologies, such as Skype, in imaginative ways to expose students to the real business of language expression and communication rather than the current business of getting through the leaving certificate exam.</p><p>  As an inspector, I am aware of the challenge there is in moving from the traditional style, which in the worst case scenario is based on teaching through English, with a heavy, grammar-translation approach.  However, we also see very exciting things happening in terms of communicative language teaching and the move is in that direction and technology is helping.  I was in a school in west Dublin last year where I saw a fifth year second level group Skype colleagues in an exchange school in the north of Italy.  This is happening.  The post primary languages initiative has, through its website, made some very good video clips available to encourage teachers to teach more through the target language.  There is also a Facebook page promoting this.  There is a move in that direction.</p><p>  It is important to point out that assessment can sometimes be the tail that wags the dog.  The oral examination at junior certificate level is optional currently and most schools do not do it.  This is detrimental in terms of discouraging a truly communicative teaching approach.  However, this is changing and some schools are offering a junior certificate oral, prioritising an oral exam.  The situation is similar with regard to Irish and now 40% of the marks go to the leaving certificate oral exam.  Both teachers and students would say there has been a definite shift in emphasis towards a more communicative style of teaching.  When inspectors are in classrooms, this is one of the key factors they consider, at both primary and post-primary level.  They are looking to see whether the style of teaching is communicative and whether material is being taught through the target language.</p><p>  Students must also have the real opportunity to use the language.  Learning a language is not like being given a body of knowledge to be retained.  It is more like learning to drive a car or play a sport.  Often students do not get the opportunity to practise and it can be difficult in a big class to create real communicative opportunities.  A movement called content and language integrated learning, CLIL, simply means teaching another subject through Irish, French or whatever.  This used to happen to a significant extent, particularly in primary schools in the past when subjects like music, art or history were taught through Irish.  The same could be done through French or another foreign language if we had teachers who were graduates in a language and another subject.  Transition year provides a possibility for this.  Unless students are given opportunities to use the language in a communicative way, either through technology, group work in class or through using the language for everyday communication outside of the language class, the pull of simply being satisfied with being able to tick the boxes and do the right things in the exam is huge.</p><p>  Unless there are opportunities to practice, there is no language development.  That is the reason many of us here for example, who had very good levels of Irish, French or whatever leaving school, would find it difficult to conduct the business of this committee through that language.  That is simply because we are out of practice.  </p></speech>

The current barometer is the third in the series.  The first was in 2001, the second in 2006 and the current one was conducted in 2012.  The key findings of the survey reveal that Europeans have a very positive attitude towards multilingualism.  Almost all Europeans, 98%, think that mastering a foreign language is useful for their children's future and 88% see it as useful for themselves.  Almost three quarters, 72%, agree with the EU objective that everybody should learn at least two foreign languages.  Some 77% think that improvement in language skills should be a policy priority and 67% see English as one of the two most useful languages for themselves.  Among the others most frequently cited as useful are: German, 17%; French, 16%; Spanish, 14%; and Chinese, 6%.</p><p>  With regard to some of the other figures, countries showing the most noticeable increase in the proportion of respondents saying they can speak at least one foreign language well enough to hold a conversation compared to data from the 2006 survey are: Austria, up 16 percentage points to 78%; Finland, up six percentage points to 75%; and Ireland, up six percentage points to 40%.  Very few countries show a notable increase in the proportion of respondents able to speak at least two foreign languages, with the most marked being Italy, up six percentage points to 22% and Ireland, up five percentage points to 18%.  I wonder whether immigrant populations play a role in this, but it is certainly a positive finding.  That said, there are also negative findings.  Countries where respondents are least likely to be able to speak any foreign language are Hungary, 65%, Italy, 62%, the UK and Portugal, 61% and Ireland, 60%.   It is certainly not all a rosy picture.</p><p>  While on the issue of the Eurobarometer survey, Deputy Griffin asked what people were doing with the languages they acquired at second and third level.  This survey address that.  Page 54 contains a list of what people do with their languages, including, holidays abroad and watching films or television.  For Irish people, some 46% use their languages for holidays abroad, 26% for watching films and television and 14% for the Internet.</p> <p>Interestingly, it was found that 24% of respondents used foreign languages for work conversations, either face to face or over the telephone.  I will not go through all of the activities mentioned in the survey.  Apparently, 10% of Irish people - or at least of those who responded to the survey - use foreign languages in reading at work.  All of the data are contained on page 54 of the survey.  I can send a link to the committee, if that would be helpful.</p><p> I wish to move on from the Eurobarometer survey to the modern languages in primary schools initiative.  As members are aware, the decision to end the initiative was taken in the context of the challenging budgetary environment we are facing.  There are no plans to revisit this decision.  When the initiative was introduced, it was not applied to all schools.  At a time when we are trying to fit so many activities into the curriculum, it is clear that curriculum overload was an issue.  In addition, there were problems with the replicability of the model across the system.  It was not systemic; it was an initiative.  Difficulties were identified and it was decided to end the modern languages in primary schools initiative.</p><p> I would like to conclude by picking up on something Ms Naughton said.  The idea of the integrated language curriculum is to focus on English and Irish as languages.  When I was in school, Irish did not feel like a language; it felt like something else.  The aim of the new integrated language curriculum at primary level is to underline that English and Irish are languages with points of comparison and that skills can be transferred between them.  The idea of the new curriculum is to help children to become aware of these skills explicitly.  If primary school pupils develop the ability to transfer skills between the two languages offered in the primary system, Irish and English, they can transfer that ability at post-primary level and use it to acquire other languages.  By making it explicit that Irish and English are languages with certain features in common, it is hoped to allow students to appreciate how languages work and apply that knowledge when they are learning other languages at post-primary level.</p></speech>

A wide range of languages are available across the higher education sector.  There is no indication that capacity constraints would hinder us in increasing provision if demand were to increase.  We can also develop targeted responses to particular enterprise and foreign language skills needs through initiatives such as Springboard.  If we increase provision in the absence of increased demand, we will not address any skills gap.  We provided almost 130 places on foreign language courses under Springboard in 2012.  They were to be provided through seven programmes, but three of the programmes were not ultimately offered because there was insufficient demand for them from students.</p><p>  Deputy Jim Daly also asked about the number of people studying languages at third level.  We know that the number studying a foreign language as a single subject increased by approximately 13% between 2007 and 2010.  The HEA's data returns do not capture those students who study languages as part of a degree in which it is not the main subject.  The HEA is undertaking research to address this by trying to quantify the full extent of language provision across the higher education sector.  Preliminary data from this exercise indicate that approximately 9,000 students are studying a foreign language as a core subject or module as part of their degrees.  The increasing modularisation of higher education programmes will provide more opportunities for students to take languages as part of other degrees.</p></speech>

Young people can work as language assistants in other countries.  The son of one of my friends is in France preparing to become a language assistant.  The European Union is making a great effort to provide additional funding.  Funds have been increased by 70% to try to get more young people to spend part of their time in third level education in another country.  I will ask Mr. Caffrey to speak about the teaching of German.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Caffrey" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013041700007#G00500"><p>The subject was heavily promoted in the late 1980s and early 1990s when German was perceived to be very important.  I do not have details of the initiatives brought forward to promote it, but I can give the committee some statistics.  In 2001 some 16.5% of all leaving certificate candidates sat a German paper.  The equivalent figure for French at the time was 60%.  French has traditionally been the dominant foreign language, primarily for historical reasons.  After German reached the 16% level in 2001, it reduced to 15% in 2006 and 12% last year.  French has witnessed a greater decline, in terms of the percentage of the total cohort taking it.  Spanish and Italian have seen increases.  Some German cultural institutions - the Goethe-Institut, the German Embassy and some German businesses - have launched a campaign to promote German as a language offering opportunities in second level education.  They have produced a CD-ROM and a website, etc.  Based on my experience of visiting schools, my feeling is that German, like other lesser taught languages, has had to fight its corner to some extent.  It is rarely the default foreign language in a school.  If German is still offered in a school, despite the pressure it faces as a subject, it is probably because it is well taught.  I have seen some excellent teaching of German in schools.  I appreciate the commitment of the Goethe-Institut and other bodies.</p><p>  The languages offered in a school depend on the existing capacity within the school.  A school cannot offer a language unless there is a teacher in it with the qualification and the ability to teach it.  A far-seeing principal or board of management might decide to diversify the school's offering.  A school that has traditionally taught French may decide to teach another language.  The post-primary languages initiative helped many schools to introduce Spanish, Japanese, Russian or Italian.  A certain degree of foresight is needed if a school is to take the initiative in this regard.  It is difficult to judge these matters so far in advance.  It should really be a matter for national policy.  Each individual school chooses what to offer from the curriculum, which is a type of menu.  This approach, whereby schools are given a high level of autonomy in deciding what to offer, is not going to change.  The only way it could change would be if we decided we needed a certain capacity in certain languages.  The BRICS countries have been mentioned in this regard.  The only way the Department could ensure such a change of approach was implemented would be to provide <i>ex quota</i> teachers for these subjects and that is not going to happen in the current climate.</p></speech>

It is an area in which we are very active.  We are examining the development of the curriculum at primary level.  We are dealing with junior infants, senior infants, first class and second class.  The curriculums are mirror images of each other.  That makes it easier or more probable that teachers will be able to deal with and support one language alongside another.  That is happening and materials are being prepared.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is very involved in consultations about what is being done at various stages.  The English curriculum is also being reviewed.  That will go out for consultation very shortly.  When the Irish curriculum is reviewed next year, that will go out for consultation also.  A background paper which will go out for consultation is being prepared.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is trying to work on a consultative basis.  It publishes material relating to each area in which it is working on its website and people can respond to it.  That is what is being done at primary level.  At post-primary level, the English and Irish junior cycle curriculums are being examined.  Modern languages will be examined in 2016 and the short Chinese course should be ready for September 2014.  Some consideration has been given to the senior cycle language programmes, but they are having to wait in line in the context of the significant amount of work being done in priority areas of the junior cycle programme such as literacy, numeracy, English and Irish.  There is a great deal of reviewing.  The aim is to ensure languages are not taught in an insular way - those teaching various languages should be aware of each other.</p> <p>The other thing happening is that, because of the literacy and numeracy strategy, we are trying to get across the message to teachers that they are all literacy or numeracy teachers.  For example, if one was dealing with a particular topic in, say, English, one would reinforce that by doing it in Irish also, so the children see the connection between each of the particular subjects.  That is particularly easy at primary level because it is usually the same teacher for each subject.  There is a lot of work going on in languages at the moment.  Perhaps Ms O'Mahony will deal with the issue of compulsory Irish.</p></speech>

For example, it is looking at Japanese and Russian.  I wanted to put that in the mix as well.</p><p>  Deputy Jim Daly said he was against compulsory Irish.  I would suggest he is perhaps a bit of an outlier in the Irish language movement.  This is something that has been under consideration in the sense that it was mentioned in the programme for Government.  As Mr. Caffrey mentioned, there is the new 40% oral Irish examination in the leaving certificate and the NCCA will be reviewing its impact in schools next year.</p></speech>

It would be better to wait rather than presume what the results will be.</p><p>  I and another colleague have to go to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht regularly and defend what is happening in the whole area of Irish.

We are perhaps moving away from that type of teaching and learning to a more communicative model.  There is no doubt that the more one interacts with the language on a daily basis, the easier it is to pick it up and maintain.  I have young children who watch television programmes such as "Dora the Explorer" and "Handy Manny", and they are picking up bits and pieces of Spanish just from watching television and interacting.  It is probably the way to go.  If we are serious about teaching languages that are going to be used beyond education in the workforce, we have to change the way we are teaching and learning them.</p></speech>

That absolutely washed over me and it did not matter if I said it hundreds of times, I could never get the tenses.  I found that stopped me from learning languages and I now cannot speak any language but English.</p></speech>

I saw a first-year class which I thought was unduly heavy in terms of grammatical input so I told the teacher when talking outside in the lobby that there would be plenty of time for that.  The children's English grammar is muddled but nobody cares because they know exactly what the children want to say and they are making themselves understood.  There is a time later on when the grammar and the rules are introduced in the context of communication.  That is the direction in which we are trying to move things, with some success.  We see quite a range, from very good communicative teaching, where the lesson from beginning to end is conducted in Spanish, Irish, French and so on, to the other extreme, where there is an imbalance of grammar at an unduly early stage, with students copying down lists of words and so on.  That is changing, however, and we are certainly encouraging the change.</p><p>  The new media are helping in this regard and I encourage committee members to look the website <i>languagesinitiative.ie</i>, which is the website of the post-primary languages initiative.  It gives good examples and is a place where students and teachers are interacting, sharing source materials and so on.  It is a move that is happening, although it is certainly taking time. </p><p>  I believe the new junior cycle framework will help a lot because there will be more of an emphasis on learning outcomes and &quot;can do&quot; statements.  This means, for example, that the student knows at the beginning of the year that, by Christmas, he or she will be able to do certain communicative things in the language, such as ask someone their name, be able to spell and so on.  There will also be greater emphasis on assessment for learning so, rather than waiting for a written exam at the end of three years and focusing on that, there will be a continuous assessment of all the language skills, with a prioritising of oral language.  That is certainly the way we are moving and I am seeing that change happening in schools.  A change of that magnitude takes time but I believe it is happening and I see very good examples of it happening.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to change a mindset.  We all remember how we were taught languages and we all know what way we now want to go.  I am genuinely very impressed by the amount of work happening in both in the NCCA and the Department and the move towards a modern approach to languages.  There is clearly a big move afoot.  I can see in my own children that how they are being taught and how they do their homework is very different.  I commend the witnesses for that.</p></speech>

It is the quality of learning that is key for young people.  When I was in school, we did not dare open our mouths, whereas in class now it is very much a dialogue between the teacher and the young people, and between the young people and their peers.  That dialogue allows them to interact and to learn so much better than if they are just sitting there, learning by rote and spitting it all back.</p></speech>

My children go to all-Irish schools, where it is not just that the language is being taught, but that they are communicating in it every day, even in the hallways, during PE and so on.  It is an active language within that environment and it stays with them beyond education.</p></speech>

We have dealt with spoken languages, but have the witnesses any information on Latin?  I am one of the very few people in the country to have studied Latin at second level - I think the serial number on my junior certificate exam paper was 00005, and there were probably 20 people in the country taking it at the time.  Are there any students taking Latin at leaving certificate and how low are the numbers?  We have said the emphasis needs to be on oral learning, but there are a certain percentage of students who are linguistically interested, and Latin gives a good foundation for those students.  For the purists, it is a subject that many would like to have an opportunity to study and I am fearful it will be lost in the future.  What is the position in regard to Latin?</p></speech>

The numbers are small and the demand would predominantly be for us to ensure we have more of the BRICS country languages, the European languages and so on.  However, Latin is still available and I will send the figures for the last few years to the Deputy.</p></speech>

Not only is it being taught; it is also being inspected.  When I did my leaving certificate, it was Latin or Latin.  Again, that was the NUI, for which it was a matriculation requirement at the time.  That was seen to be inappropriate so then an avalanche of French came in.  The problem is curriculum space.  With the new junior certificate programme the possibility is there for short courses, while transition year also provides a possibility.  I know one school in Dublin where all first year students take Latin and some continue with it.  A student in my niece's class is studying Latin for the leaving certificate this year.  It is certainly there, but the numbers are small, for an understandable reason.  Not everyone will appreciate that, but I certainly do.  Again, the flexibility offered by the new junior cycle framework will provide space for short courses in particular.</p><p> We come back to the question of teacher supply, which means long-term planning.  How many teachers in the system can teach Latin?  There is a wonderful programme in the UK called Minimus, which one can check on the Internet.  It is a Latin programme for primary school students.  The idea is that they learn much about languages, culture and European heritage through study.  Minimus is a little mouse character.</p></speech>

That is precisely the point.  It is a very important language in terms of preparing one to learn more languages and learn about cultures.  Perhaps it could be looked at to see if there could be a revival or at least if it could be made as available as widely as possible.</p></speech>

We understand that the committee has received a lot of requests to speak from interested parties on the subject of the climate action and low carbon development Bill, so we are grateful for the opportunity to contribute an international perspective to the committee's ongoing work. We spent the last two days in Dublin Castle at the Hunger, Nutrition and Climate Justice conference hosted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice.  It was a remarkable event in many ways, not least because of the participation of so many organisations from communities around the globe who are dealing with and adapting to the impacts of climate change.  Three of those partners are with us today to share with the committee their experience of the impacts of a changing climate and the committee will hear from them shortly.  I was fortunate to have been a participant as well.  By way of some opening remarks, I would like to share with the committee three observations from the conference.  The first is the urgency of the issue.  Hearing first-hand accounts of failing crops brought about by prolonged drought or torrential rain washing away soils and seeds was a reminder to all of us there that climate change is happening and is causing devastation for millions of people around the world.  It is challenging the very existence of communities dependent on the land for their existence, is disproportionately affecting women and children and is threatening to set back by years the development gains made by developing countries over the last two decades.  As former US Vice President Al Gore remarked at the conference, opening the newspaper or hearing the news these days is like taking a nature walk through the Book of Revelation.  Yesterday, we heard from my colleague, Mr. Mithika Mwenda, that 36 Kenyans had lost their lives in floods across the country.  It was all the more moving and telling that many of these places that were suffering from flooding traditionally suffer from droughts.  Now it is floods that are taking the lives of people.  Rachel Kyte, a vice president at the World Bank, described at the conference how in some parts of the globe, extreme weather events that used to happen once every 100 years are now happening  as often as every five or six years. Crucially, the time between these extreme weather events is insufficient for communities to recover.  They are being hit with a fresh weather event before they have had time to get back on their feet, setting their development back two or three years at a time and undermining all the good work that has been done up to that point.</p><p>  The second observation I made was the incredible innovation, intelligence and resilience that communities, villages and individuals are continuing to show in the face of these stark challenges.  A focus of the conference was to record and exchange the adaptation experience of partners in different situations.  There was a complete global reach from the Arctic circle down to the Pacific islands and we heard some hugely impressive accounts from people who have responded and changed the way they have worked the land to adapt to a changing climate.  Of course, none of that innovation will mean anything if the planet continues on its current emissions pathway, which, at the moment, will bring us to a 6-degree warming by the end of the century.  All the development gains and all the creative responses to climate change are in danger of being washed away by flooding and storms or blown away in a massive dust bowl.</p><p>  This brings me to my third observation.  While there was a wealth of discussion and a rich exchange of views between policy makers and communities at the coalface about ways of adapting to the changing climate and challenges with regard to food security and nutrition, there was less, indeed very little, discussion about the bigger issues - or the elephant in the room, as I heard it being referred to on more than one occasion.  The elephant in the room was, and is, the role and responsibility of industrialised countries to address climate change.  It is a fact that industrialised countries need to dramatically reduce their emissions in line with what the science tells us if we are to have any chance of keeping below a 2&deg;C rise.  Even a 2&deg;C rise will have massive implications for many developing countries.  I know some of our partner organisations believe 2&deg;C is too high and that the figure needs to be 1.5&deg;C or below.  The other elephant in the room was that rich countries have yet to honour their commitments made under the UNFCCC to provide new money - and by "new", we do not mean aid money repackaged and recycled as climate money.  Countries need that money to help them adapt to climate change and scale up local adaptation projects.  It is, as was mentioned by some of the participants, a question of justice.  It was the actions of the countries of the industrialised north that caused climate change, and they and we bear an historical responsibility for creating climate change that needs to be acknowledged and acted on.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in his brief appearance at the conference, acknowledged as much when he noted that it is those who did least to create climate change who are suffering the worst consequences.  It is not the first time I have heard the Minister say that and it is an important reality and worth repeating.  Action on climate change is a question of justice. </p><p>  This brings us to the context of this meeting, the climate action and low carbon development Bill.  The question is whether we can view the Bill in its current format as being a meaningful contribution to addressing some of that historical injustice and whether it will provide reassurance to people such as my colleagues here today that countries such as Ireland, which is steeped in a history of global solidarity and the promotion of international development, are playing their part in tackling runaway climate change.  Christian Aid, Tr&oacute;caire and Oxfam, which are partners of the organisations represented here today, share the view that the climate Bill in its current form does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the situation that we as a global community, but particularly those in developing countries, are faced with.  In particular, we feel that the absence of any targets from the heads of Bill betrays a lack of urgency and ambition on the part of the Government towards the climate crisis and undermines our international claims to be a leading voice in addressing the hunger, nutrition and climate change nexus.  The fact that we will be adhering to EU targets is a missed opportunity on the part of the Government for Ireland to plot its own ambitious path towards a low-carbon future and to provide certainty about Government policy and a clear pathway for emissions reductions, as the programme for Government puts it.  The Bill as it stands gives no such certainty for the future and for those businesses and individuals wishing to invest in the green economy.</p> <p> At this point I will hand over to my colleagues, who will provide far more eloquent and articulate first-hand accounts of what living at the thin end of the climate change wedge is like.  They will tell us what climate justice means to them.  I wish the committee well as it continues on the process of consultation on the Bill.  I hope that the contributions today will provide a useful international dimension to the committee's deliberations.  Climate change, like many of the problems that challenge societies today, is a global challenge which demands that the domestic policies we adopt in our country are at the very least mindful of the potential consequences that these actions may be having on other countries.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to be here.  I studied in Ireland some time ago and I feel as though I have a special connection with Ireland.  I have returned to Kimmage Manor.</p><p>  I will talk specifically about the impact of climate change on pastoralism.  Pastoralism is a livelihood system which is entirely dependent on land-based resources.  There are three main pillars which maintain and sustain pastoralism.  The first pillar is the availability of pasture, which is crucial.  Mobility is another pillar in the maintenance of pastoralism, because it is necessary to move from one place in order to sustain pastoralism.  Water is also essential in order to sustain our livelihoods.  In the dry land of east Africa we have been experiencing extreme weather conditions.  This has led to frequent droughts, which in turn leads to massive loss of livestock.  For example, I am from the Ngorongoro area of east Africa.  In my district, more than 200,000 livestock were lost in 2009 and 2010.  This has led to extreme poverty and great numbers of people have fled their homes because of poverty.  This is a result of climate change.  For example, Ngorongoro division is also a very popular conservation area because it is a tourism destination.  There are between 70,000 and 136,000 pastoralists living there.  This means it is difficult to sustain the pastoralist life.  The children and women have suffered and died from starvation in great numbers.  The young people have migrated all over Tanzania and even to Kenya because of famine and starvation.  The only employment they can get is as security guards, because most of them are not educated.  This is a significant consequence of the impact of climate change on our livelihoods.  This also has to do with the appropriation of pastoralist land for conservation and farming purposes, which has reduced the grazing pattern.  Water has been very scarce in east Africa because of climate change.  The weather conditions are not predictable and they have changed over time.  The people do not know when to farm or when to plant, nor where to graze the livestock.  There has been frequent movement of pastoralists to other areas and an increase in conflict over resources between farmers and pastoralists.  Climate change is a man-made reality.</p><p>  I wish to describe a brief case study from my own village.  When I was growing up in the Loliondo area, all sorts of traditional fruits were available to us to eat while herding our livestock.  There were beehives and plenty of water sources in the area.  Now the situation has changed completely.  The bees are no longer there, while some species of tree have mostly disappeared and those remaining no longer bear fruit.  The seasons are no longer understandable or predictable, even for the plants.  The main diet of the pastoralists has changed and has been reduced to a little milk and very stiff porridge.  The pastoralists' diet used to be mainly milk and meat but now it is cornflour and tea.  When a family has no money it is difficult to feed the children.  Milk is scarce because the cattle are spending long periods searching for water and pasture.  When the rain comes and some milk is available, my family and our neighbours must sell some of the milk to raise money to supply the basic needs of the family.  The source of our staple food is the shops and grain.  When one has no money, one has no food.  Many families are going through a similar situation all over the Ngorongoro district and the situation is worsening.  When members of a family are poorly fed they tend to spend more time sitting and waiting for medical attention because there is a high incidence of disease along with much physical suffering.  Many families are being separated, and women are virtual widows.  There is a high level of migration from rural areas to the towns, with young people in particular going to look for employment.  Disease, fatigue and poor diet are common problems.  During the drought period the village women have to walk nine hours to fetch water and sometimes the water is not available when they reach the water source.  The men have migrated completely in an effort to find work in order to support their families.  The situation is completely unbearable and this is all the result of climate change.  There is much malnutrition, disease and uncertainty in the pastoralist community as a result of climate change.</p><p>  Traditionally the Masai have their own ways of coping with drought.  One of the best ways is through mobility.  Nowadays, mobility is not possible because the grazing land has been reduced.  Cows and goats are concentrated in a small area and this also causes significant problems of land degradation.  Another Masai coping strategy is the sharing of resources.  This has sustained the livelihoods of pastoralists.  Any little amount of food is shared with the rest of the family.  This has become a problem because climate change is significantly reducing the number of livestock.  These are a few examples of how the food sources of pastoralists are affected.</p><p>  Developing countries have been affected by something we have not caused.  Ireland should take responsibility for a reduction in climate change by setting an example.  This can be done by deciding on specific targets to reduce emissions of carbon gases into the atmosphere.  The Irish Government should ensure such targets are legally binding.</p> <p>We request the committee to take this seriously and set an example.  We are very happy because we were told in the workshop that Ireland would hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the next six months.  We request that Ireland set an example.  We know Ireland has a long history of famine which was overcome by the collective effort of the Irish people.</p></speech>

When I was invited to speak to this committee, I reflected on a number of personalities who have changed this world.  One of them really struck my imagination, namely, Robert Baden-Powell, a Briton and the founding father of the scouting movement.  He died and was buried in Kenya, from where I come.  When he realised he was dying, he told his followers that if they tried to leave this world a little better than it was when they found it, when their time came, they would die with a feeling that they had achieved their best.  As I reflected on that today, I watched the television.  Today is a big day in Ireland and the UK as the former British Prime Minister is being buried.  Opinion is divided on the legacy she has left.  Some people, who are demonstrating, have said her legacy is not positive while others have said she has left a positive one.  It depends on where one stands.  I asked myself what legacy we will leave in the context of climate change, which has both divided the world and brought it together.</p><p>  We have come from Africa, where climate change is a real issue.  We do not need scientists to tell us things are changing in Africa.  I refer to a recent report by the UN.  In sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of people are farmers, crop yields are expected to fall by 20% due to climate change.  Some 60% to 65% of arable land is already affected by degradation and drought and it is expected to decline further, resulting in serious food shortages, intensifying hunger and malnutrition.  That was highlighted in the meeting hosted by the Mary Robinson Foundation.  </p><p>  We are seeing climate change in Africa, as my colleague mentioned.  The habitats of 40% of species may be destroyed altogether.  That means animals such as elephants and porcupines face extinction.  Rainfall is predicted to decline by 10% by 2050 and by 2025, 480 million people in Africa could be living in water-stressed areas.  An estimated 30% of Africa's coastal infrastructure will be lost to rising seas by 2080.  These are realities which we are seeing as we speak.  </p><p>  All of us, north and south, are seeing the intensity of climate change.  What is different, as we are hit by climate change calamities, is that people in Ireland, the United States and other industrialised countries have the capacity to absorb the impacts, but what about Africa?  A couple of months ago, we saw the swift response to Hurricane Sandy, although many people suffered and we really sympathise with them.  One can imagine what would happen if such a big event happened in Africa.  There would be no capacity to respond to it and only the international community would respond.  It would be really different from what happened in the United States.  </p><p>  Climate change is affecting us, but in different ways.  It is like the <i>Titanic</i> in 1912.  Those who were weak and were on the lower decks drowned almost immediately.  We know of only one woman in this group who survived.  However, most of those who were strong and were on the upper decks eventually drowned.  This is the same problem.  When addressing climate change, we must remember it will affect all of us eventually, so we need to look at in that way.  Africa is the lower deck, but none of us will be spared.  That is what brings us to the action we are taking.  </p><p>  There is much inertia at global level.  The global community, particularly industrialised countries, have taken comfort from what science says.  We would like to see more ambitious action being taken.  We have led civil campaigns in the United States.  The sense we are getting from our colleagues in Christian Aid and elsewhere is that the political and business classes have more influence on the laws to address climate change, and they do not want their businesses to be destabilised.  However, we will eventually sink like the <i>Titanic</i>.  We must look at things from that perspective and at the laws which will protect the health of the planet while at the same time addressing the challenge we face, namely, the survival of humanity.</p></speech>

I feel quite humbled to have an opportunity to visit parliaments around the world.  I shall commence by almost echoing what my colleagues have said about the impact of climate change on African countries.  I do not need to reiterate their comments because they clearly stated what we are going through.</p> <p>I emphasise that climate change not only is a threat to the achievement of sustainable development and poverty reduction but has the capacity to affect achievement of the millennium development goals.  This is more evident in the African continent because the climate badly affects communities.  While we take one step towards achieving the millennium development goals we go back two steps because of erosion by climate change.  It is not something we are taking for granted; it is something that is making us lead our life, because we do not know what will happen next to Africa.  We realise that mitigating climate change requires the sustainable participation of stakeholders - that is, the Government, civil society and the private sector.  This is the only way everybody will have an opportunity to develop an initiative that will reduce the vulnerability of communities to climate change.  If the three stakeholders do not work together, one may go ahead and take actions that are not favourable to either of the others.  It is very important that we work together with our governments, the private sector and the farming communities in order that in advance of any planning we put the sentiments and the actions together.</p><p> Political goodwill is critical as far as the response to climate change is concerned because it strengthens and prepares the country for action towards mitigation of and opposition to climate change.  We know very well from our country and, I think, also in Ireland that the politicians are the lawmakers.  As the laws will lead to actions to mitigate climate change, it is important to ensure political goodwill.  The politicians are elected to their positions by their communities and the communities also determine the next group of politicians.  It is good that there is a payback through the introduction of policies that will reduce the vulnerabilities likely to be brought about by climate change.  We Africans look upon Ireland as being one of the industrialised countries that is assisting in mitigating climate change.  The action that Ireland takes will determine the life or survival of the African community.  It is indicative of the responsibility Ireland has towards supporting the African continent.  Therefore, we look at the actions that come from Europe, particularly those which have the human face and compassion to consider the sustainability of the continent in general.   When I speak about climate change I think of the impact on women in the African continent.  When we see what is happening in developed countries such as Ireland we feel as if our problems are already solved.  We pray that Ireland does what we are expecting of it.  </p><p> We are happy to learn that Ireland proposes to establish environmental regulations which will, in the long term, be applied in implementing the country's investment plan.  When we are considering the investment plan in Ireland, those plans are not just meant for the Irish people; they will also have an impact on the African continent, directly or indirectly.  I would like the legislation to have an impact on other countries in the developing world.  This will only be realised if we are sensitive to the plight of countries such as Kenya and other areas of the African continent.  It is clear that the private sector plays a significant role in tackling the impact of climate change by supporting green economic growth.  This is what should inform the legislation as it makes provision for commitments to emissions reduction.  However, it is more important to see a human face while making commitments to emissions reduction.  Business is important, but we need to give it a human face, because the consumers of the products are in the African continent.  If we do good business but do not have consumers then the products will be on the shelves and will not be consumed.  It is important to consider the lives and welfare of the consumers who will consume the products of business.</p><p> The climate change Bill considers the risks and opportunities to provide for innovative and effective ways of addressing climate issues<b></b>in a manner that will result in a climate that is resilient and will secure the future of Ireland and of the African continent.  That goes without saying.  Ireland has tried to save the developing world while also saving itself.  It may not affect us in the short term but in the long term it will spill over to the whole globe.</p><p> Historical gas emissions and projections for how they can change by 2030 will create renewed hope in Africa and the world.  Based on what it is and where we are heading, it will determine the existence of the African world and inform us whether there is a commitment to mitigation, in which case it will give us hope that all will be well and that we shall continue to engage and live in these continents.</p><p> Politicians in Ireland have an obligation to leave a legacy.  The best legacy they can leave is that there is food to save human life, because that will translate to generations.  From Kenya we avail of the opportunity to appeal to the members of this committee to pass the legislation that will create a good legacy in order that we and our children's children can continue to enjoy what they have done.</p></speech>

We can see the effects of climate change in Ireland but it has a greater impact in Africa given that it is prone to drought and other weather extremes.  We have not escaped it here.  In respect of the climate change Bill, Ms Maanda Ngoitiko mentioned the importance of including firm targets which should be legally enforceable.  It is obvious that the delegation considers that important.  I too appreciate the importance of firm targets and, in fact, introduced a climate change Bill which provides for targets.  Within the European Union, Ireland must reach a certain target by 2050.  It is important to have five-year targets, or five-year carbon budgets, as they are called, as we have a different government every four or five years and various governments may not meet those targets.</p> <p>If one does not do that, one runs into what is called a "carbon cliff", or a series of such cliffs from here to 2050.  What are the delegation's views on that?  There appears to be an idea that the State can leave it to each sector to come up with its own proposals and that we will, hopefully, hit the targets.  That cannot happen.  We must set clear targets for each sector.  Allowing each sector to set its own targets makes it more of a wish list.</p><p> Ireland is a relatively small island, but is a huge food producer.  Harvest 2020 sets a target to increase the amount of food being produced by 50% between 2011 and 2020.  A very significant proportion of carbon emissions in the State are from agricultural activity.  It catches us in a pincer movement.  On the one hand, we must increase our food production to satisfy international demand while on the other we must reduce carbon emissions.  On the plus side, most of the emissions come from grazing cattle as opposed to indoor feeding or the transportation of food over long distances.  We have a particular issue due to our agricultural sector, which needs to be quantified accurately.  We must get the balance right.  While producing large amounts of food, we must quantify accurately the mitigation factors in forestry and open grassland.  One of delegates may wish to offer a view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.75" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013041700009#H00200"><p>I welcome the delegation to Ireland and to the committee.  They have had a very active few days to debate the issue of climate change and its impact.  I welcome the fact that they are coming here to provide an international perspective on how they are affected.  As an Irish parliamentarian, I would like to give my perspective to them.</p><p>  This is a significant food producing country which has many natural resources that it does not fully exploit currently.  That brings its own challenges in terms of reducing our carbon footprint and reaching targets set by the EU or through our own climate change legislation, the debate on which continues.  We are a responsible State which is interested in assisting other countries, which our track record of assistance to countries that have been in trouble in the past proves.  The delegation mentioned first-hand accounts of drought while other countries have experienced flooding.  I saw on the news some contributors to the conference explain how the ice caps are melting.  All of these points must be listened to carefully.  The problem I have - and I will be straight with the delegation, which must hear an Irish perspective - is agriculture.  We must produce food.  We contribute enormously to food security and must find sustainable ways to produce food which do not produce an excessive carbon footprint.  Progress has been made in Ireland with the reduction in emissions per litre of milk by 13% in the last 20 years.  We have a very sustainable, grass-based agriculture system which results in high methane production, which contributes a great deal to our carbon footprint.  We have a dilemma as to whether we set targets to cut the amount of methane produced by reducing the national herd.  Cutting the number of cows and beef cattle will automatically have a detrimental effect not only on the economy of which the agriculture sector is a main driver and contributor to recovery from recession, but also on food production and food security.</p><p>  I am being very honest in pointing out that this is the dilemma for Irish politicians.  We must try to bring stakeholders with us to ensure that they adapt, innovate and formulate new agricultural practices which allow them to continue to produce food at a sustainable rate while also reducing carbon emissions.  I suspect that is the reason national targets are not being set.  We must bring stakeholders with us.  Many environmentalists and NGOs say in the context of renewable energy that we must reduce carbon emissions by improving renewable energy technologies, but when major renewable projects are proposed - as with the large-scale wind energy projects in the midlands - some of the same environmentalists oppose them.  While we want to increase renewable energy sources to reduce our carbon footprint, we have a conflict also.  I have a problem with that.  As a nation, we must decide whether we are going to reduce our carbon emissions.  If so, we must be serious about how we achieve that.</p><p>  In other areas, we are making progress.  In low carbon electricity generation, a generation station in Great Island, which was dependent on oil and which was producing 240 MW of power, is being converted to a 460 MW generating station based on gas, which is far more sustainable and will decarbonise electricity generation in the State.  I want to assist and to reduce our carbon footprint.  We are a very small country and must protect those sectors that are driving our economy and contributing to food security.  I do not say this out of personal business interest as I am not a farmer.  We must move forward sustainably while bringing stakeholders with us.  By simply setting targets, we could put all of that in jeopardy and find ourselves in a far worse position than the one we are in.</p></speech>

I had the privilege of being at Dublin Castle for part of the conference and would have liked to have spent a great deal more time there.  Certainly, I picked up on the key points.  We will have the opportunity to view the sections I missed at a later stage.</p><p>  We referred at the beginning of the session to the heads of the Bill on climate change.  The heads of the climate action and low carbon development Bill are being brought through the committee and we will report to the Minister after taking evidence from various sectors.  I am the first to accept that there are flaws in the Bill, which this process will be helpful to consider and tease out.  There are also very positive elements in the proposed legislation which have not been touched on.  Even as it stands, the proposals will put us in the top three member states in terms of the provisions being made.  They cover the targets we have accepted for 2020 and will automatically embed any future international agreements to which we sign up.  They also ensure that there will be an annual report to the D&aacute;il on progress being made by the Government to achieve international targets on climate change.  The other key element is the independent committee which will provide independent commentary on whether Ireland is achieving its targets.</p><p>  I do not mean to put anyone on the spot but I am anxious to hear specifics.  When people talk about targets, to which elements of those targets are they referring?  The previous Administration attempted to bring a Bill through and got caught up in a legal quagmire.  It started to mention targets but said they would not be judicial but aspirational.  The heads of the proposed Bill have taken the aspirational element out and created solid targets and annual reporting procedures to the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>If the delegates have read the Bill in detail, I would be interested in hearing solid proposals for these targets and changes and if there are weaknesses in the Bill, how we could strengthen it.  That would be a very good starting point.  This is the first group to appear before the committee to give evidence on the heads of the Bill.</p><p> The issue is complicated.  While we can produce food in Ireland because our agriculture is grass-based, other countries which can produce higher quantities have a more detrimental effect on the climate.  That is how I see the international aspect of this issue.  There are areas where certain foods can be produced in a climate-beneficial way.  Ireland is more suited to producing milk and beef than the rest of Europe where this is done in a closed system, whereby animals are housed.  We need to work out what the balance should be.  It is interesting to hear about the African experience.</p><p> I recently read a book about Bobby Kennedy.  When he returned from Africa in the 1960s, he made a speech in the Senate in which he said the industrialised world was dieting to control obesity - that has not changed - while Africa suffers hunger and starvation.  The problem of food security has not been addressed in the past 50 years because we still face starvation in certain areas.  That has to be an element of the work on climate change.</p></speech>

The discussion the world over - this is the topic of our discussions - is on how to move on from emissions reduction.  There is a particular debate on low-carbon development pathways and how to do this is a dilemma.  It is indisputable that the current model of development is unsustainable.  Our proposal is that there are ways to do this.  We need to start avoiding profligate lifestyles and to pursue agriculture in such a way that we reduce emissions.  The citizens of a country need to discuss how to do this.  The Bill provides a very good opportunity for discussion, but in its current form, it is weak.  We need to learn from Scotland which has a very ambitious law.  It is important to look at it and see how it is being put into practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maanda Ngoitiko" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013041700010#J00300"><p>It is always a big challenge to find a balance.  What we need to do is to create a win-win.  It is true that there is starvation in Africa and that it is increasing, but that is linked with injustice, lack of equity in the distribution of resources, a lack of environmental awareness, and the accumulation of resources and economic growth.  The challenge is how to create a balance without compromising economic growth, while reducing emissions and creating a situation where people would not suffer as a result of what we were doing.</p><p>  One question was: should Ireland set a five year target in the Bill?  This is important and maybe the targets can be adopted by each Government when it takes office.  The targets could be set for five or ten years.  Ireland has shown that in the past ten years it has reduced emissions by over 13%.  If it could reduce them by 30%, that would be progress.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.81" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cecilia Kibe Muthoni" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2013041700010#J00400"><p>I will just make a comment.  First, I appreciate that Ireland has made some moves to bring about production systems that will reduce carbon emissions.  If I am not wrong, there was some resistance from NGOs.  It is not possible, however, to reduce carbon emissions without taking some risks.  Carbon emissions reduction is all about risks and opportunities.  It is good that legislators are taking up the challenge of sensitising stakeholders, particularly the farming community, in order that whatever systems they come up with or recommend in their discussions will be environmentally friendly.  If there are some risks, we should have a plan to mitigate them.  One that has come out clearly is that, like us, the Government feels the need to cut down on emissions.  What is lacking is public participation.  In Kenya we drafted a climate change Bill in a particular way, but we made one small mistake - we did not have enough public participation.  The Bill, however, was technically sound.  It was applauded by parliamentarians and passed, but the public participation was lacking.  The point is that the public - the private sector, the farming community, everybody - will live with the Bill.  I would like to see the Irish Government provide an opportunity for further consultation with the farming community and traders.  It will then come up with something that will be very acceptable.  Whatever is included in the Bill will affect those who support it, but they will be ready to comply with the legislation because it originates from them.</p></speech>

This is probably one of the most important discussions any country can and will have because we are all bound by this.  As Sorley McCaughey said, quoting Baden Powell, if we can leave this world a little better than it was when we came into it, that should be our aim.  I hope, as politicians, we have that aim too.  All politicians have it at heart.  They would not be in politics otherwise because for everything one gets out of politics, one must put an awful lot back in.  That is definitely my aim and I hope we will be able to do this with the climate change measures we are taking.  Setting targets is one way to do this, with making sure they are legally binding, a matter which will be up for discussion at this committee.  Deputy Coffey has pointed out that there are ways to do things.</p> <p>Doing A may have a knock-on effect on B.  There must be a better way than the old way, however.  </p><p> In Ireland we are at present having a debate on renewable energy as a replacement for fossil fuel.  One of the major greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide produced from fossil fuels which the people of the country consume.  We must get acceptance for wind and other forms of energy.  There are always naysayers when new projects are proposed.  Education plays a role in this regard.  It is important that we outline in detail the measures and their impacts on the country and reducing fossil fuel consumption.  Targets are valuable but other measures can also be implemented to help us reach these targets.  </p><p> Agriculture is an important aspect of our community.  How do we change the farming way of life?  Farmers are increasing production, which will mean increased production of methane and nitrous oxide.  We cannot stop cows from producing methane but the scientific community could help us to find ways of reducing their output.  All of us have committed to reaching the targets agreed under the Kyoto protocol but we are now aiming to go beyond these targets and lead by example in the six months of our Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  We should put our heads together to play our part in this committee and strengthen global action on the outer horizon.  Ireland may be a small country but even a small country can make a difference.  What will make a big difference, however, is strengthening action on the global stage.  It is great to set targets in Ireland but what about America, China and India?  We have to bring the globe with us.</p><p> I am playing a small part in these efforts in that I was sent to Europe by this committee for discussions on renewable energy.  I am helping to organise a conference in Dublin Castle on 20 and 21 June on renewable and sustainable energy.  We need to debate these issues.  MEPs from all over Europe will be attending that conference.  Producers and investors need certainty if they are to continue investing in wind energy.  We will investigate the approach being taken in Scotland on wave energy because we do not want that country to steal the rug from under our feet.  We want to be at the races when it comes to renewable energy.</p><p> I am the spokesperson on these matters in the Seanad - it is still there - and we consider legislation and our amendments are sometimes accepted.  All of us will play our part to bring about change.  It is easy as a politician to say we are going to do this, that or the other.</p></speech>

We may be able to meet our targets but other measures must also be considered.  Targets are probably a good idea but I will have to consider them further.  I want to see the impact of targets.  I do not want them to put the country's farmers out of business.  It is bad enough as it is.</p></speech>

They have crystalised for me the fact that we are coming from very different places.  Their focus is on keeping their people alive, while ours is on trying to keep our businesses going.  They have been clear and articulate in their arguments and it is important that we take cognisance of them.  Approximately 800 million people around the world are struggling to put food and water on their tables.  That is appalling.  Even though we are a small country we have to play our part in the European Union's efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  The bigger players present a challenge, as other speakers have noted, but if we are steadfast we will lead by example.  The various sectors have become more open to the argument that they will benefit in the long term from investing in this area.  I refer to the agriculture, transport and energy sectors, all of which face significant challenges in doing their jobs more efficiently.</p><p>  Education of our young people through, for example, the green schools programme has been very effective.  If each of us makes a difference we will experience the benefits.</p></speech>

We need a collective will to act within the five continents.  The crux of the matter is bigger industrial nations such as America.  It is very difficult to bring those people on board.

I am joined here today by my colleagues Mick Stewart and Linda Murphy.  I will commence by giving some background information on the legislation governing charges imposed by banks and other financial institutions.</p><p>  The Central Bank acknowledges that increases in bank charges at any time are unwelcome for consumers, and particularly at a time when many households and small businesses are struggling to make ends meet, with decreasing income and increasing costs.  The job of the Central Bank under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 is to ensure that the right balance is struck by credit institutions in recovering the cost of providing services while ensuring the charges they impose on personal and small business account holders are reasonable and appropriate.  I will provide an outline of the key elements of the Act and, importantly, how the Central Bank performs its duties under the Act.</p><p>   Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 came into effect in May 1996.  All charges being imposed by credit institutions at that time "stood notified".  The Central Bank assumed responsibility for section 149 in 2003.  Under this section, credit institutions, prescribed credit institutions and bureaux de change must make a submission to the Central Bank of Ireland if they wish to introduce any new customer charges or increase any existing customer charges in respect of certain services, such as making and receiving payments, providing and granting credit and maintaining and administering transaction accounts.  The Act requires the Central Bank, when assessing such submissions, to have regard to the promotion of fair competition, the effect on customers, the statement of commercial justification provided by the institutions and the passing on of costs to its customers.  We either reject the proposal, accept the proposal but at lower levels than requested by the firm, or approve the proposal in full.  While the term charge includes penalty or surcharge interest, the Act specifically excludes rates of interest and any charge, cost or expense levied by a third party and passed on by a credit institution to customers.</p><p>  This framework for approval of charges requires the Central Bank to take into account the impact on customers as well as the commercial justification for imposing such charges.  Clearly, all firms aim to recover the cost of providing financial services either directly or indirectly from their customers.  The extent and nature of those charges will reflect the individual strategy of each firm.  Our role is to strike the right balance between the interests of the firms and their customers. </p><p>  Each submission received by the Central Bank is subject to rigorous consideration according to the criteria set out in legislation and the contents of that particular submission.  Each submission includes information such as historic and forecasted profit and loss data and projected changes to customer usage.  The extent of the proposed charges or increases is considered and a peer analysis of charges is carried out to help ensure that the promotion of fair competition in the market is taken into account.  When looking at proposed charges, analysis of the impact of the proposition on customers and groups of customers is carried out.  Section 149 extends to both personal and business customers, so the potential impact on groups of customers, such as small businesses, is considered as part of our process.  As part of the assessment process for personal current accounts, the effect on the customer is assessed using, amongst other analyses, our customer profiles.  We have developed four customer profiles, each representing different usage patterns in terms of volumes and types of transaction - for example, electronic versus manual - and differing occurrences of out-of-order charges.  The Central Bank then decides whether to approve, partially approve or reject the proposed charges.  It sets out the maximum level of each charge in a letter of direction.</p><p>  It is worth noting that a bank may choose, for commercial or competitive reasons, not to apply charges for which it already has approval or which "stood approved" for a period of time, and subsequently apply such charges at a time of its own discretion.  In this regard, these concessions are not subject to a section 149 submission - that is, a bank may choose to apply waivers or discounts of charges or may impose charges at lower than approved levels and subsequently increase these charges.  The Central Bank has no power to approve or reject such revisions.  Any proposed changes to charges or qualifying criteria must be published in advance.</p><p>  The European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 and the consumer protection code 2012 contain certain requirements relating to the information to be provided on charges to ensure that the customer is aware in advance of the amount of a charge for the provision of certain services.</p><p>  Submissions received from a number of banks in the latter half of 2012 and in 2013 reflect the first general increase in current account charges since the Central Bank took responsibility for section 149.  Prior to that, the main providers of current accounts were using the approvals as "stood notified" in 1996.  Recent trends have also shown that banks are moving away from the provision of traditional banking channels towards electronic, online and contact-less services.  As part of this, banks have been seeking to create price differentials between manual and automated transactions.  According to the information we have received, there is a significant cost difference to the banks in providing manual and automated transactions and this cost difference has led banks to seek to impose different charges depending on transaction types. </p><p>  Regarding mortgage arrears charges, section 149 also covers charges relating to the provision of credit.  As part of the Central Bank&rsquo;s overall response to the growing mortgage arrears problem, in 2010 we carried out a review of charges imposed by mortgage lenders on borrowers in arrears.  At the end of 2010, the Central Bank issued letters of direction to all lenders directing them to refrain from imposing any surcharge interest or any charge arising on a mortgage account in arrears covered by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</p><p>  The Central Bank has an almost unique role with regard to bank charges.  We believe we have a robust process in place, including the use of customer profiles, to determine the appropriate levels of increase in charges.  The Central Bank will continue to perform its role under section 149 of the Act in such a way as to ensure an appropriate balance is struck between the need to ensure such charges are reasonable for the consumer and the need for firms to recover their costs for providing such services.</p></speech>

ISME has just under 9,000 members across the country, all of whom are owner-managers of small and medium businesses.</p><p>  I am not going to dwell on statistics or comparisons as I am quite sure the Central Bank is more than capable of covering those areas, but will mention the low-lights of the history of the banks in the Irish economy.  Let me start with the collapse of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which probably cost us around &euro;200 million.  Then there was the DIRT debacle, in which the banks made the largest settlement of &euro;90 million.  In July 2004, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, issued a report on the overcharging of 80,000 customers on foreign exchange transactions, which is related to today's discussion on bank charges.  At the time the bank said the cost of refunds would be somewhere in the region of &euro;14 million, but it ended up at &euro;50 million.  In October 2004, a report found that Irish banks were making nearly three times as much profit per customer as their European counterparts and in the process they were ripping off SMEs.  The study found that AIB and Bank of Ireland were each earning in the region of &euro;341 per year per customer, as against &euro;123 per year per customer across Europe.  A study published by the Competition Authority in September 2005 found that SMEs were suffering disproportionately in comparison to big business.  That has always been the case in the context of lending rates and charges in Ireland.  In 2008 there was a major problem, with the banks giving blatant untruths with regard to recapitalisation and the blanket guarantee.  In 2010, we had more untruths, mentioned by the chairman of NAMA when it was taking over what were supposedly performing loans, which proved to be completely overestimated by the banks.  </p><p>  I will not dwell on these, but I want to mention the charge by the UK Competition Commission, back in 2001, of cartel-like practices by certain Irish banks and their subsidiaries.  The commission concluded that a complex monopoly situation existed and identified Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland as participants in the restriction and distortion of price competition for small and medium businesses.  That study identified that small and medium businesses were suffering disproportionately in comparison to big business.  That is no major surprise to us.  It was further confirmed in 2003 by the chief executive officer of a bank in Ireland who went on record stating that a cartel was in operation in Ireland and that Irish banks were overcharging their customers.</p><p>  My role today is to warn members about the banks - as if they need warning, when the Minister for Finance has said that one cannot believe what bankers say.  I will warn members about the actions of banks and inform them of the dire straits in which the owners of small and medium businesses find themselves due to the economic downturn, brought about partly by the same banks.  I will plead on behalf of members that small and medium businesses be guaranteed fair play in bank charges as we struggle to get the economy back on its feet.  In the current climate, do members think that increases in bank charges of up to 250% can be justified?  The banking market is highly concentrated.  Back in 2003 it was mentioned that it was one of the most concentrated banking systems in the world, and since then we have lost a number of banks.  The two main banks account for 80% of SME lending, and when Ulster Bank is added, those three banks account for 96% of total lending to the SME market.  Basic economics indicate that where there is more competition in banking, margins and profits tend to be lower, so obviously the opposite happens in Ireland, as we know.  Where the market is highly concentrated it is also recognised that banks will find it is not in their interest to compete vigorously.</p><p>  Banks make their money in two ways: through interest margins and service charges.  To counteract the effect on margins of the general drop in interest rates, albeit not for small businesses, banks have introduced a range of charges for other services that were previously cross-subsidised by lending margins.  The rescued banks are scurrying around at the moment looking to see where they can increase income.  Anyone going into a bank to renegotiate loans or have an overdraft reviewed is likely to have the interest rate increased, be subject to higher charges on his or her account, or probably both.  Loan arrangement fees are also going to be reintroduced.  With the recent branch closures in AIB and National Irish Bank, we have reached a point at which there are cost penalties when one puts a foot inside the door of the bank.  One of ISME members said in passing that in his local branch of AIB in Carrick-on-Shannon they have replaced a cashier with a bunch of flowers and a third clerk with a machine that takes cash and cheques but not coins, with the result that the waiting time is now an hour.  They have one clerk behind the counter, one or two clerks on the floor circulating and chatting to customers in the queue, and another clerk sitting behind what is loosely called a customer service desk.  He would love to have a queue in his business but he would not have them waiting an hour for service.  When he raised the matter with the staff, their response is that this is new bank policy.  That is what we can come to expect from the banks.</p><p>  As Mr. Sheridan has mentioned, bank charges in Ireland are regulated in accordance with the Consumer Credit Act 1995.  The current raft of bank charges are now astronomical.  We had to listen to a spokesperson from the Irish Banking Federation recently saying that the banks are returning to more realistic pricing.  It is a pity they were not more realistic when they were lending in the past 15 years.  Such pricing reflects the underlying costs and risks of the products and services they provide, according to the IBF, and meets the requirement to return to profitability.  He then continued, quite smarmily, to tell us that a consideration-----</p></speech>

The increases in charges by Bank of Ireland for foreign exchange range from 29% to a high of 250%, while the cost of electronic funds transfer has increased by 23%.  At a time when businesses are doing their best to embrace e-business, we believe the banks are not helping the situation.  Increases in business online charges range from 42% to 250%, whereas those for paper transactions have risen by 33% to 97%.  The increases for business online transactions are much higher.  AIB is increasing its cash handling fees by a whopping 165%.  It has dropped the secondary and primary rates of 17 cent per &euro;100 and has adopted a standard rate of 45 cent per &euro;100.  It is not the first time we have experienced such increases by the banks.  The last time we had increases of this level was when the euro was being introduced in 1999 and fixed rates were being set across the euro currency zone.  As consumers we expected major benefits, but those did not materialise.  Instead, the bank ratcheted up commission from an average of &pound;3.50 to as high as &pound;45.  It is a matter of regret that the banks managed to pull the wool over the eyes of the director of the Office of Consumer Affairs at the time, who passed these increases.  It was due to the strong intervention by ISME to highlight the massive disparity in commissions to which the Office of Consumer Affairs had agreed that the banks then reduced their charges somewhat.</p> <p>At the time the European Commission was not exactly impressed.</p></speech>

Perhaps he might summarise his points.  We have plenty of time for a discussion on the matter.  I would like to see some interaction between committee members and delegates, as opposed to long speeches.</p></speech>

Costs are increasing against a backdrop of branch closures, reduced branch services and under-trained staff.  The attitude of bank management is "take it or leave it".  At a time when small and medium-sized businesses are struggling to make ends meet, we cannot afford increases of the magnitude suggested.  As I said, we are looking at increases of between 23% and 250%.  I urge the committee to call on the Financial Regulator to rescind its decision to allow new bank charges to be introduced.  The regulator should instruct the banks to revert to their previous rates.  I accept that some of the rates were already in place and are, therefore, not up for discussion with the regulator.  The banks have removed the lower rates and retained the top ones.  That is the way they are working.</p></speech>

There will be plenty of time after the first round of questions for further questions to be asked.  </p><p>  Everybody wants the banks to operate a sustainable business model.  We also want a healthy level of competition in the market.  Any outside observer following the committee's proceedings will want to know what is happening and what will happen in the future to make things better.  </p><p>  I would like to put my first question to the officials from the Central Bank.  From the perspective of small and medium-sized enterprises, some 77% of banking in the State is carried out in AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In earlier correspondence Mr. Fielding spoke about a duopoly and made the point that the market here was very restrained.  What level of oversight does the Central Bank have in this regard?  Some 77% of the country's small businesses do their business with two banks that have been capitalised by the State, are trying to operate independently again and looking at charges as a means of increasing their profit lines on their balance sheets.</p></speech>

The committee does not need me to tell it that the market is very concentrated.  Obviously, we are aware of this when we assess whether to approve bank charges.  We are conscious that the banking market is not properly competitive.  If it was, I am not sure section 149 would be needed.  One of the benefits of that section is that it provides for an element of control over the extent of the charges that can be introduced by the bigger players.  In the past couple of years the Competition Authority considered the section 149 issue as part of its examination of the level of competition in the market.  My understanding is that it concluded there was no rationale for the removal of the section.  The facts mentioned by the Chairman explain why it should remain in place.  We would all like competitors to come in, compete and make the market more competitive.  I think there are plans to try to encourage this.  I am not sure that the rules governing bank charges prevent competitors from coming in.  However, I understand it has been proposed that new entrants would not be subject to the section 149 provisions for a period of time.  That might be done to encourage them to come into the market.</p></speech>

Has it developed proposals that would encourage other financial houses and institutions to come into the Irish market?  Is there a level of oversight of the two banks in question with regard to the charges they are planning to introduce?</p></speech>

That applies to AIB and Bank of Ireland.  We are particularly cognisant of their dominant position when we assess the charges they propose.  </p><p>  The Chairman has also asked what we are doing to encourage more institutions to come into the wider market.  It is important that we have a stable market that is prudentially well regulated.  We are doing this, in addition to protecting consumers.  We are fulfilling our broad role in terms of proper regulation, financial stability and consumer protection.  That should lead to people looking at our market and deciding they would like to get into it.  Unfortunately, we cannot force them to do so.</p></speech>

Many of the businesses in question are struggling.  We will discuss issues such as credit availability later.  According to a report in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Bank of Ireland has proposed to increase the 6.5% rate charged on each transaction to 8.5% later this year.  That would have a massive impact on businesses.  Mr. Fielding referred to the concerns of other business agencies, particularly those in the retail sector that deposit a great deal of cash and coins on a daily basis, about the proposal to increase the 0.17% charge imposed on every &euro;100 in cash lodged.  If this proposal is accepted, businesses will have to pay 45 cent for every &euro;100 they lodge.  This would represent a whopping 165% increase and add &euro;15,000 per annum to the operating costs of an average retailer that deposits an average sum of money every day.  Given that this would be unsustainable, what is the Central Bank doing about it?</p></speech>

First, I emphasise that we do not have the power to go back.  If they stand notified from 1996, they stand notified today.  There is no power to review them.  Second, taking a wider perspective on the charge, I remind the committee that we look at what others are charging and the impact of the extent of the increase in real terms, as well as in percentage terms.</p></speech>

If this was being done by a bank with a 25% share of the market, companies could decide to move to a different bank.  Most companies are locked into their existing financial institutions.  Overdraft agreements and other factors mean they cannot simply transfer their accounts.  Does the Government need to make a recommendation to the Central Bank?  If there has been a ruling since 1996, should the Central Bank issue a policy or an indication note to the Government on the issue?</p></speech>

I wish to make it clear that when it comes to charges, the big participants are not out of line with the smaller players in the market.  AIB which has been mentioned has charges that are broadly in line with what every other institution is charging.  If we had to consider the matter afresh, we would follow the criteria set out in the legislation.  I cannot say what decision we would come to in such circumstances because it is a theoretical question.  However, we would follow the criteria.</p></speech>

I mention an interesting and surprising observation made that afternoon.  One of ISME's recent quarterly reviews mentioned the difficulties being experienced by small and medium-sized enterprises in accessing credit.  The view of the Credit Review Office is that the demand for credit among such enterprises is not as high as the media might be reporting.</p> <p>The priority of many SMEs is not access to credit but paring down debt and adapting their business model accordingly.  Are there any comments on that issue?</p></speech>

From the point of view of seeking credit from the banks our figures show that demand has remained steady at 36%, 37% and 38% per quarter.  That would be a norm during what we would regard as the better times.  We have been doing quarterly surveys since 1993.  In the better times there was a similar demand for credit in the region of 37% and 38%.  That has not changed.  I agree with Mr. Trethowan that probably a year ago the demand dropped for a five or six month period to about 25% but currently it is in the 35% bracket.</p></speech>

There are businesses which are seeking credit in order to expand and they are being refused despite the assurances from the banks that they are giving nine out of ten loans being sought.  We read in the report on Sunday last where the clarification to the ACC in the US was that the nine out of ten loans referred to fully completed formal applications, not "do not come near me for the moment, Mark, because you will not get a loan at the door of the bank or over the telephone".  They are not counted.</p></speech>

I came across an issue on the<i> Askaboutmoney.com</i> website that looks at people's engagement with financial institutions and so forth.  This would be a question for the Central Bank.  One of the persons who put a notice on it referred to free banking on opening his or her account initially.  Then the bank changed its position and introduced charges and put notices to that effect in the newspapers.  People were invited to the bank and, as Mr. Fielding said earlier, one gets a bunch of flowers on entering.  The whole system is automated and one might see one person when entering or leaving the bank.  That is obviously a cost reduction exercise on the part of the bank.  There has also been a presentation to show that if people move online, their banking costs will reduce or may be free, if I can use that term loosely.  The issue I picked up on the <i>Askaboutmoney.com</i> website was that when the banks changed their charges they put notices to that effect in the newspapers.  While it may be reasonable not to require a bank to write to all its customers advising of every change in charges - everyone here gets spam e-mails from financial institutions about one's account logon etc. - when dramatic changes are made which actually reduce what might be described as &quot;free&quot; banking, should they be required to engage with their customers in some context or other to inform them of a fee which was not in place previously?</p></speech>

We require customers to be notified in advance of any increases in charges.  For example, in the case of small businesses the banks generally give ten or 14 days advance notice and before the actual charge is made they are notified before the charge is taken out of the account.  The challenge for retail banks is the large number of customers and whether they notify them individually or publicly.  What they have been doing today is notifying them publicly of the changes in the charges.  There are requirements in the code and under the payment services regulations.  There is much useful information on the National Consumer Agency website on the actual charges being imposed.  On the issue of advance notice, to date we have said one must publicise these increases in charges.</p></speech>

Online banking is a website operated by Bank of Ireland, AIB, Permanent TSB and so on.  When I log on to my online banking page there is a section on the homepage of my account that tells me that the bank, the AIB in my case, intends to change the following costs in the coming period or that it has changed the costs on a particular date.  I am made aware of that as an interfacing customer and not required to read a newspaper or listen to a radio advertisement as it is on my online account.  Would that not be a better way of doing it?</p></speech>

I put it to Mr. Sheridan that the providence of the hikes in charges and fees is irrelevant to the people who have to endure these increases.  I appreciate that he said some of these relate back to the charges that stood notified in 1996.  Perhaps I will take him up on that issue.  How many increases would the Central Bank have approved in, say, 2012-13?  In AIB there was the 165% increase in the handling cost for dealing with notes.  Does that increase date back to 1996?</p></speech>

Following on from a point made by Mr. Fielding that does not appear to be reflected in the charges.  Recently I was looking at a personal customer's set of fees from one of the pillar banks.  I do not believe there was any difference between the per item charge for a cheque and a per item charge for an electronic transaction.</p> <p>If there is such a cost differential, should that not be reflected in the charge paid by the customer?  I do not believe it is.</p></speech>

Some of them have already gone into that space and others are planning to do so.  Therefore, the charges associated with manual transactions are likely to increase, while charges for electronic transactions will either stay where they are or reduce.  These changes are in train in a number of banks.  I am not sure which bank the Deputy is talking about, but he is likely see more of this in the future.  On the previous point, we have also seen a trend where banks have come to us seeking increases in charges in order to recover costs rather than through the different channels they use.</p></speech>

Mr. Sheridan said in his statement the banks are not obliged to charge the levels approved.  Is the Permanent TSB type of initiative one the Central Bank would welcome, one where banks would offer inducements to customers in the context of fees?  Would it like to see other banks follow suit?</p></speech>

Has ISME looked at how we compare with other countries in terms of the banking fees charged to SMEs?  Is there any real competition?  If an SME that has a good record with its bank wants to move, there are only a small number of potential banks to which it can move.  Is that happening and, if so, are SMEs getting more favourable terms with the bank to which they are moving?  Is it a case that the banks do not want to hear about this?</p></speech>

AIB intends raising the charge to 45 cent per &euro;100, but Barclays quotes a figure of 75 pence.  However, it says this should not be taken as gospel.  That is the red line figure, but individual banks will reduce that and we have seen a figure as low as 20 pence.  Lloyds quotes a figure of 89 pence per &pound;100, but that can be negotiated down and in many cases we have seen it at less than 15 pence.  I do not have figures for across the EU, but I suppose it is something we should do.</p><p>  With regard to transferring or switching from one bank to another, to be honest, one is as bad as the other.  It is galling that we see notices being issued that banks are increasing these fees, but the note at the bottom of AIB's notice advises customers that they should be aware they have the right to close their account and move it to another bank.  I am afraid this is not a great help to small businesses.</p></speech>

Are we getting that balance right at this point in time?</p></speech>

This is a challenge and what we have tried to do is move away from focusing purely on the inputs into the process, namely, the information that the banks give us in terms of the costs associated with providing the services.  This is a key element, but we have moved to looking at the outcome and the impact on personal customers.  In 2011, we published some research we conducted and we also published four different profiles of typical usage of current accounts.  We assess any new notification in respect of increasing charges on current accounts in the context of the impact it has on those profiles.  This is only one element of what we do.</p><p>  Based on this, we get the costs associated with running a current account.  These range from &euro;100 to &euro;300.  In the circumstances where it costs up to &euro;300, the profile we used includes circumstances where the customer incurs quite a number of out of order charges and surcharge interest on unapproved overdrafts and the like.  We have noticed these types of charges push up the annual cost and that when we approve these charges, they have a big impact on people who are struggling.  Therefore, we have tried to keep those charges at a reasonable level.  In order to know whether we are doing that, we have looked at what happens in Northern Ireland and the UK and what they charge or are allowed to charge.  Our charges are quite a bit lower than what is allowed in the UK in that respect.</p></speech>

Obviously, the banks are free to submit new applications to the Central Bank at any time and it must adjudicate on those based on the Act.

It strikes me that the banks have a kind of lucky dip of bank charges available to them since 1996.  They can dip in or out of that well.  This is a very abstract area for ordinary people, but it is not so abstract for people in business who are being hit with referral charges, unpaid fees charges and this, that and the other, putting their overdraft over the limit and requiring them to spend hours on the phone talking to their banks in order to survive.  This is the reality.  We appear to be talking about the banks at length.</p> <p>I would much prefer to be talking about SMEs and personal customers.  The banks have cost us &euro;64 billion to date and I know from having heard the banks before this committee that they have learnt absolutely nothing.</p><p> Will Mr. Sheridan explain how these charges came about in 1996?  Are they underpinned by legislation?  I would like to hear the context and to know how many there were.  I was not aware of this.  Am I correct in saying that the banks at the moment have a lucky dip of charges from which they can choose, without having to get any approval from the Central Bank, and which they can then impose on customers?</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Sheridan to provide us with the information we have looked for so that we can probe this further.</p><p>  I was involved with SMEs for many years when I was in practice.  Excessive charges were applied to overdrafts and in many cases there was an accumulation of unpaid charges and surcharges.  The SME sector generates jobs and they must be given the supports.  The banks have this lucky-dip bag for the past 17 years.  They dip into it at will without any reference to the Central Bank.  This defies logic in my view, and it should not have been allowed to continue.</p></speech>

The banks themselves then decide whether to apply that to all customers.  They may decide to exempt certain people.  For example, a number of banks are still exempting people over the age of 60, or students.  That is their decision; the Central Bank does not impose it upon them.  We use profiles when assessing the bank charges.  One of the profiles is a person who is using the banks in a traditional way and is relying upon them in the traditional way.  We take that into account and we try to ensure that the proposed increase is limited for that type of customer.  We also need to balance this with the banks' need to recover the costs.  In terms of the criteria and applying the criteria of minimum amounts in the account, that is essentially the banks' decision.  Obviously it has implications for customers as to whether they are really getting free banking in that scenario - in a sense they are not.  That is another way of imposing the charge.</p></speech>

I have a letter which was received by a constituent from AIB.  It details the increases from a rate of 17 cent secondary rate and 25 cent primary rate, to 45 cent per &euro;100, with effect from 1 July 2013.  Mr. Fielding said that these letters stated that the customer had a right to choose whether to close the account.</p><p>  I ask if we should make comparisons with the charges further afield than in the UK to see how they stack up.  I note Mr. Fielding's comments that the asking price from some of the British banks may be higher but in practice they charge a much lower rate.  This is a concern.  Small businesses handle a lot of cash and the charges are an issue.  The person who received this letter from AIB is one of those people.  He is concerned about the implications for his business.  There will be a certain increase in costs for those businesses.  It seems like the banks are coming after them one more time.  The banks were bailed out after the failure of the regulators and the Central Bank but they are coming back after the small businesses with this charge.  The banks loan out the money they take in as deposits.  They are making money out of lending.</p><p>  The talk in recent months is about getting more capital for the banks.  Surely this is a disincentive for people who will then avoid the banks.  I am one of those people who try to stay away from the banks as much as possible.  In fact, if I could stay away from them altogether I would be happy to do so.</p> <p>They are now actively disincentivising people from going into banks.  I ask Mr. Sheridan to address those two issues, because the sending of those notices to people running small and big businesses, who handle a great deal of cash, is providing a disincentive to go to the bank.</p></speech>

In terms of whether it is a reasonable charge in the context of the change in 1996, what we concluded is that it still looks reasonable to us because every other institution is already charging along those lines.  I appreciate that it will have a big impact on some firms - we have received submissions on this - but we have to take into account the criteria set out under the Act rather than purely looking at it from one side or the other.</p><p>  In terms of what is driving this, it was mentioned earlier that the banks' ability to recover and become profitable again is limited in terms of where they can go to do that.  The net interest margin is one matter that falls outside section 149.  Bank charges and fees is another area.  The rationale for seeking these increases is being put forward.  That is what they are trying to do - to recover the costs so they can become profitable.  The good thing about section 149 is that it is only one element of a framework that we have to take into account.  We have to take into account the impact on customers as well.</p><p>  To a large extent the banks are relying upon existing customers to try to recover more costs.  It is having an impact upon those customers.  We have to acknowledge that.  What we are trying to do with this is to strike the right balance, as I said in my opening statement.</p></speech>

I am aware of loans that were given to people who did not have any hope of ever repaying them in this lifetime or even in their children's lifetime.  Joe and Mary Citizen are now paying that bill also, because it has been decided to get this through under section 149.  The level of anger and hostility towards the banks cannot be underestimated.  What are Mr. Fielding's views on comparisons with other European countries?  What are his views on the general increase in handling charges?  Have comparisons been made with other European countries, including England, Scotland and Wales?</p></speech>

There has not been any comparison recently.  As I said, it is something we will consider and will probably do through our umbrella group.</p></speech>

It was mentioned earlier that when people walk into banks they are faced with automated machines.  I am aware of a situation in which somebody walked into the bank and used one of these machines but did not get a receipt for the money lodged, and nor could they get the money back out of the machine.  They went in to make a lodgement but it took about half an hour to get a member of staff to deal with it, and another to get the money out of the machine.  The person runs a small business around the corner from the bank and is what is referred to as a sole trader, which meant the business was closed for an hour and a half while the bank staff fiddled around with the machine.  I highlight that, because we must cater for cash customers.</p><p>  The advent of plastic cards was a means of enslavement.  They are handy, but they are a means of enslavement.  One effect of their introduction is that the value of money has been lost.  When I started working, and for a long time after that, I was paid in cash.  I am not advocating that we go back to paying people in cash but one had X amount of money in one's pocket.  One knew how much one needed for the rest of the week and how much to put away for car insurance, a house loan or whatever.  We all know the problem with plastic cards.  People were borrowing on one against another, and it has turned out to be a means of enslavement.  There are customers, particularly elderly people, who want to continue using cash.  I believe strongly that their right to trade and have a service through cash should be upheld.</p><p>  One of my concerns is that elderly people have told me they are reluctant to go into the bank because if they cannot operate the machines, they will leave.  We have seen instances in which money is kept in biscuit tins and under mattresses, and horrific circumstances in which elderly people have been robbed, tied up and assaulted.</p></speech>

We cannot leave people behind in that regard.  We cannot become a cashless society.  We need to use less cash but we must cater for those who still use cash, particularly those vulnerable groups, perhaps by maintaining a branch network.  If there was no branch network, could we work through post offices and so on?  For the younger age groups the drive is towards more electronic means, but I share the Deputy's concerns.</p></speech>

It appears that some of the banking institutions apply a regime whereby if the cashflow of a business or individual does not meet the withdrawal of a standing order, he or she is penalised for missing the standing order payment.  In the event that the standing order is put back in place, a surcharge or penalty is applied to the customer, who therefore gets hit with a double whammy.  Is that identified as being two different surcharges, and do the witnesses believe it is appropriate for banking institutions to do that?</p></speech>

It is inequitable.</p><p>  I imagine we would not all be up to speed on the cost of clearing a cheque, using an ATM, having a credit card, and having direct debits and standing orders run out of a current account.  If someone walks into a supermarket he or she can see displayed how much it will cost to purchase an item or conduct a transaction.  That is the case with every other transaction.  When one walks into a bank, however, that is not apparent.  I find that in general - people might contradict this - consumers are not aware of what their bank transactions are costing them.  We all get statements from banks but they do not detail the fees we are being charged.  The other side of the bank statement should detail cheque or ATM transaction costs.</p> <p>That is consumer protection.  More important, when one walks into the bank, as most of us still do, it should be stated in black and white that it might be more beneficial to one's self or one's business to conduct fewer transactions in certain ways and more in others.  It could be a case of making electronic payments rather than writing cheques.  I am concerned about the lack of knowledge.  The banks would serve people far better if they displayed costs in a transparent manner.</p></speech>

In every branch, there should be brochures available.  The information should also be on the banks' websites.  Information should be readily available to all customers, be they SMEs or individuals.</p><p>  With regard to statements, certain banks state before they apply the fees what they will be.  Thus, one has time to query them before one's account is affected.  The National Consumer Agency publishes the fees and charges.  There are many ways in which one can find out the fees and charges associated with their accounts.</p></speech>

As a former banker, I am quite aware of what is really meant in this regard.  The Irish banks must have an enormous number of current accounts containing sums above the threshold.  Obviously, they are able to attract interest on these by putting them on the inter-bank market nightly.  They make profits on the back of them.  There is no mechanism that I am aware of in any of the banks dictating that one cannot go below the threshold.  Without our knowledge, many of us go below the threshold and are charged the full fees and surcharges thereafter.  That is not an appropriate way to conduct business, especially when there are ATMs, etc.  If the banks want people to have a certain amount of money in their accounts, they should protect the money in the accounts and make the process of withdrawal to a point below the threshold more difficult than simply going to an ATM.  I would like to see a parameter put in place.  The banks are making a fortune on this.  They are putting the money on deposit in the inter-bank markets and making a profit on it.  I am not talking about accounts with &euro;3,000.  Most accounts contain considerably more.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. Sheridan.  We seem to be hearing that the wider economy, particularly SMEs and ordinary citizens, is being screwed yet again by the same banks that screwed the public finances because of their requirement for a bailout.  They are screwing mortgage holders with threats of repossession and are refusing to give them write-downs on unsustainable loans.  They are screwing the SME sector by not lending to it and are also screwing that sector and citizens by imposing more charges, essentially to recover their losses.  Mr. Sheridan seems to be saying there is nothing the Central Bank can do about it because the banks pretty much have a free hand to do what they are doing because of legislation passed in 1996.  Is it the case that there is nothing the Central Bank can do to prevent the banks from increasing charges significantly up to the allowed ceilings in a range of areas because of what was done in 1996?</p></speech>

The current processes in that regard are evident.  The position has obtained since 1996 and we have gone through quite a number of iterations.  With regard to what has happened in the interim, I am not here to defend the banks but to present what has actually happened.  We have tried to put a handle on it by examining the profiles of various customers and the typical cost to the consumer of a current account.  Irrespective of whether one agrees or disagrees, costs associated with personal current accounts range from approximately &euro;120 to &euro;200.</p> <p>I would not like people to be alarmed that we have allowed vast increases in charges over that period.  That is not the case.  The Deputy is right in the sense that there is the potential for banks to increase some charges up to a level that was previously notified in 1996 but it is limited.  Banks are sending notifications in respect of increasing charges, transaction charges in the main, which will either be reduced or go above what they have previously been approved to do.  That is the focus of our attention.</p></speech>

The testimony we have heard from Mr. Fielding is that this is not a small matter or a matter that is being exaggerated.  There have been increases of between 29% and 250% in foreign exchange charges.  Nobody could describe that as small.  There has been an increase of 23% in electronic funds transfer charges.  It was suggested that transaction charges are going up from 6.5% to 8%.  At a time when particularly small and medium enterprises and ordinary citizens can least afford to absorb increases, we are looking at what are pretty dramatic increases by any standards.  Mr. Sheridan is effectively telling us that his hands are effectively tied because of legislation introduced in 1996.  Does he not consider that a very serious matter for the economy?</p></speech>

When we assess each notification, we take into account the impact on customers as well as the commercial justification.  I agree that any increase is not welcomed but we do not have the luxury of saying we cannot allow any increase.  That is not what the legislation provides for.  We must consider the reason why the increase is being sought.  We tried to do that by looking in particular at the impact on personal customers.  That is where we have used the profiles to help us discover the outcome.</p><p>  One can agree or disagree but the impact of charges on individual consumers is the need for a couple of hundred euro per annum to operate an account.  That is in circumstances where we put information that the person is struggling and it is going out of all the charges and surcharge interest into the model.</p></speech>

In a situation where 1.6 million people have less than &euro;50 left per month after they have paid for essentials, &euro;100 or &euro;200 per year or an increase of around that level of charges is very significant.  It is the difference between people being able to manage and not being able to do so.  We are not exaggerating in expressing concern about it.  This is the time when people can least afford it.  The same is true when small and medium enterprises are literally hanging on for dear life in many cases.</p><p>  Deputy Spring referred to the anomaly whereby transaction charges via ATM, which one would expect to be considerably lower than over-the-counter charges, are not lower because, yet again, the banks are profiteering.  They are not passing on the reduction in costs from which they gain an advantage by cutting staff numbers and closing branches, thereby reducing the quality of service to customers.  They are not passing that advantage on in terms of lower charges for the use of ATMs.  Does Mr. Sheridan agree that this seems to be the obvious explanation?</p></speech>

One area on which they are focusing is what they will do about charges and fees.  We have a role under section 149 and it must take that into account and the impact on customers.  In respect of the costs associated with providing the different channels, asking why banks have not differentiated up to now is a fair point.  That is the move the banks are making now in terms of focusing on the service and how it is provided, the costs associated with that and recovering those costs.  I will not speak on behalf of the banks in respect of what they are doing and their particular strategies.  We focus on what our role is to try to deliver on that.</p></speech>

There seems to be a suggestion that we are possibly exaggerating the potential impact of this on small and medium enterprises.  How serious a problem is increased bank charges for small and medium enterprises among the many problems they face, be they lack of lending from banks, contracted demand and all the other things impacting on this sector?</p></speech>

The smallest increase in Bank of Ireland charges is 23%.  It beggars belief.  I listen to all this talk about how we must make the banks profitable and that we will do so by screwing the customer but I do not hear enough about what the banks are doing to cut their costs, for example, cutting the big pensions paid to people we are paying to get rid of.  In a small business, one must do both sides.  One must see if one can eke an extra penny or twopence when one is getting one's sales but one is also cutting damn hard at the other end.  That does not seem to be happening.</p><p>  We know online transactions are less costly for the banks but when I look at the increases they are looking for, I see that all of the online charges have increased from the lowest at 42% up to 250%.  These are for online transactions.  If I look at the increases for paper transactions, I can see that they go from 33% to 97%.  Even those charges are less than charges for online transactions.  What the banks are doing is getting ready for online transactions so none of us will go to the bank to do our transactions.  We will be online but we will be paying more.</p></speech>

There was quite a bit of discontent when many employers, particularly the State, moved to paying people through their banks precisely because people guessed that the banks would take advantage of that and use it as an opportunity to gouge people with charges.  Does Mr. Fielding think paying people in cash or at least giving them that option rather than having to go through the banks might be something to consider?</p></speech>

Overall, I would rather see it being paid through the banks.  The fact that banks may be abusing their dominant position should not mean that we should go back to paying in cash.  It should mean that committees like this put a stop to the gouging in which the banks are engaged.</p></speech>

He alluded to the fact that there had been an exponential increase in costs in the online banking system while the traditional form of banking, which is being eradicated, has had less significant increases in charges.  Is that not a way of saying that the banks will make far more profits out of far less onerous ways of conducting business?</p> <p>Have the banks compared the costs incurred in online transactions and the expense for businesses and individuals of conducting business online?</p></speech>

However, even if we can rely on their justifications, we will still consider the outcome in terms of the charges imposed and their impact on the customer.  To some extent, therefore, they are part of the process but in terms of how reliable they may be, we do not rely solely on them.</p></speech>

Clearly there is a sunken cost in getting the online facilities up and running but that has been done and dusted.  I believe the increases they are currently seeking are in order to prepare themselves for super profits.  That is what they have always been able to get in the past and they are trying to return to that situation.</p></speech>

It is like studying the etymology of Mr. Sheridan's position.  The banks are still bust and his colleague, Ms Fiona Muldoon, has stated that 50% of SMEs' &euro;50 billion worth of exposure to the banks is distressed, impaired or non-performing based on the original terms of the credit financing.</p><p>  The word "consumer" is unfortunate because the customers of the banks are either lenders or borrowers.  They are not consumers in the sense of going into a supermarket or department store.  As the bankers say, it is about relationships and trust.  A mortgage is based on a 25 year period of trust with streams of money being advanced up front by the lender and coming back with interest attached.  The income on the streams of money coming back to the banks is sticky.  It is not renegotiable unless the fundamental terms of the relationship have altered and the bank has an opportunity to change the rate.  We now know that parts of the banks' balance sheets, if considered as a big sector of industry, are income sticky and the other bits, such as the plastic cards and current accounts, offer opportunities to go into fourth, fifth or supercharge gear for income.  That is the territory in which we are currently moving.</p><p>  The trouble is that 150,000 bank customers in the sticky income part are in deep distress.  Some of them are so depressed or fearful that they are taking their own lives.  That position arose only because the banking sector accepted a wall of credit from other institutions in addition to the credit they got from the normal depositors in the system.  This wave of extra money came, greedily, from abroad to bolster their balance sheets and the banks' management and boards topped it up further with short-term money from money markets to lend long.  To do this over six years, with average loan to deposit ratios of 150%, is utterly dangerous from a financial engineering point of view.  With that credit expansion, asset prices rose terribly and normal people, households and businesses had no option in this turbocharged credit expansion and asset bubble but to borrow on the terms offered by the banking sector and allowed by the Irish regulator and the international euro system regulator.  The international counter-party appraisers, that is, the funds which invested in the banks also allowed this to happen.  </p><p>  When the bubble burst after six years, prices collapsed but loans did not.  The establishment and the law are on the side of the lenders.  We are now worrying about the epidermal or skin level of consumers' lives, that is, the charges they pay on bringing money to and from the banks and credit cards, which have increased by 23%, but the internal organs of the people and their businesses are deeply damaged by negative equity of up to &euro;250,000 in some cases where loans totalled anywhere between &euro;750,000 and &euro;800,000.  The banks funded those debts at not less than 75% even for those which were being relatively prudential.  If they offered a loan of 100%, they funded the entire asset bubble price.  If they funded the entire asset bubble price, why should they not be funding 100% of the negative equity outcome?  That would give the consumers about whom we are now worrying the confidence and the justified and unassailable right not to be pushed around, talked down to or made to feel deferential with the discussions that are beginning to take place with the banks for the purpose of restructuring or writing off the impossible elements of the loans with which they are burdened.  That is important for every borrower in that situation to understand.  They need not be ashamed.  The banks should be ashamed about negative equity after six years of a turbocharged credit and asset bubble.</p></speech>

They should announce it in print, on radio and television so that the customers of the banks can take note of it.  They should not feel deferential or pushed around when they are negotiating honestly and openly on what they are capable of repaying from their existing incomes and revenues.</p><p>  In respect of the charges that have increased by 23%, the banks annual accounts report their income, including gross profit.  Their gross profit is net income on the interest they receive minus the interest they pay out.  Do these charges fall within that net interest income?  If they do, I would like to know the amounts.  If, for example, 50% of the net income comes from charges what sort of behind-the-curtains accounting is being done for this 23% uplift?</p> <p>For six years the industry and every bank had loans to deposits of 150%, were not engaged in fraction reserving and were endangering the deposits of their customers, which was evidenced by the deposits outflow of &euro;42 billion in six months in 2009 from the six Irish institutions.  This illustrates their dereliction from their professional duties.  The eurosystem should sit up and pay attention also.  They are creditors to our banks and should be participating in their recapitalisation, which is inevitable.  One wonders if the reason Mr. Elderfield has indicated his intention to leave his position only three years into his contract is he suspects that further capitalisation of the banks will be required.  The PCAR of March 2010 fell short.  I met Mr. Elderfield in his office to tell him so, which was prior to my getting involved in politics.  It fell short again in March 2011, at which time I asked my colleagues in government not to proceed with the recapitalisation of the banks from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  I said at that time that this should be done by creditor participation from the eurosystem and that Europeans should appreciate that what was done, in lending ELA and ECB money to our six banks to redeem in full not less than &euro;75 billion of bondholders, was wrong.  </p><p> I apologise but I must leave soon to attend another meeting.</p></speech>

These meetings can often be bruising encounters.  I had to leave the meeting earlier to speak in the D&aacute;il but I have read Mr. Fielding's presentation.</p><p>  In Mr. Sheridan's view, is the right legislation, tools and capacity in place?  The McKinsey study carried out in the 1990s looked at European banking.  It concluded that Irish banks were the most profitable, if not in the world, in Europe.  In his remarks, Mr. Fielding cited a report from October 2004 by the Wall Street financiers which indicated that Irish banks were making three times the profit of other European banks.  A European Commission report from 1997 concluded that there was cartel activity operating in the Irish banks.  We obviously have a long and regrettable history of Irish banking activity in this country over the past few decades.  Various reports from multiple sources, all of which are credible, suggest that Irish banks make more money from Irish citizens and businesses than do other banks in comparable countries and that this has been the case for a long time, including in the mid-1990s.  According to the European Commission it was going on in the late 1990s and according to the Wall Street financiers it was going on in the 2000s.  </p><p>  I appreciate that Mr. Fielding's job is, as set out in his opening remarks, to find the right balance.  Another phrase used by him in his opening remarks is that "charges should be reasonable and appropriate".  If one compares what Irish consumers, citizens and businesses are being charged relative to consumers, citizens and businesses in other countries, charges are not reasonable and appropriate.  One of two things would appear to be wrong.  Either the legislation is insufficient and the delegations, their teams, the Regulator and Governor do not have sufficient authority from the Oireachtas to achieve real competitiveness as benchmarked against other countries or they do have that authority but are not using it properly.  Something is wrong if Irish citizens, consumers and businesses have been consistently over at least two decades charged several times more than the European average.  Perhaps the delegates would give their view on whether they believe they have the legislative tools and capacity necessary and, if they do, why this consistent trend continued over several decades.</p></speech>

There are additional controls here that are not in place in most other countries.  Whether that is good or bad depends very much on where one is standing.</p></speech>

A European Commission study in 2009 looked specifically at bank charges rather than bank profitability.  Ireland ranked mid-table in that study.  I accept that relates back to 2009 and should perhaps be revisited.  However, that is a fair point in terms of how we determine whether it is reasonable.  In 2011, we looked at the charges imposed in Northern Ireland and England.  We found that while it is a different model, out of order charges here are significantly lower than in the UK and, in terms of transaction charges, we are broadly in line although a number of banks in the UK still offer transaction fee free banking.  However, behind that are additional charges should an account go out of line.  On that basis, we believe it is reasonable enough.  We are fully conscious of the state of the economy and that the impact of this on customers at this particular time is severe.  Any type of increase is not welcomed.</p><p>  The legislative framework has been looked at.  It is useful at this time when the market is so concentrated.  In the absence of real competition it is probably needed.  If competition improves it may have no role to play.  However, we are probably some time away from there being real competition in the market?  </p></speech>

Perhaps I will restate my question.  There is unambiguous evidence that Irish customers are being overcharged, be it through interest rates or charges.  This is the only way the banks here can be more profitable than banks anywhere else.  If we accept that Irish customers are being overcharged there must be a reason for it.  Either the regulatory capacity is not good enough or the legislation is not good enough.  Something must be going wrong if Irish customers are being charged three times more than the European average.  Does Mr. Sheridan accept that Irish customers have consistently over the past number of decades been charged several times the European average?  If so, why is that happening?</p></speech>

We have been performing this role since 2003.  Prior to that this role was performed by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  As I indicated earlier charges vary from &euro;100 to &euro;200 per annum, depending on how one uses one's account.  I am not saying that amounts to overcharging.  Whether banks have been charging appropriately in terms of the service they provide is a different issue.  The Deputy also asked how the banks will recover.  The avenues open to them are limited and include the net interest margin which is not subject to section 149, which is a much bigger issue and will have a much bigger impact on their balance sheets than will consumer charges.</p></speech>

Mr. Sheridan does not accept that Irish consumers are being charged more, either through interest or charges.  It is all the same to consumers in that either way cash is going out of their accounts.

I thank Mr. Fielding for his presentation.</p><p>  The director stated in his presentation:<blockquote>At the end of 2010, the Central Bank issued letters of direction to all lenders directing them to refrain from imposing any surcharge interest or any charge arising on a mortgage account in arrears covered by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.</blockquote>Will the director please clarify what is meant by &quot;letters of direction&quot; and their bank status?</p><p>  I also want the director to comment on the following circumstances.  Let us say somebody faced with a financial difficulty after 2010 approached his or her bank and opted for an interest only arrangement on a residential property.  What if the interest only arrangement was based on the bank's margins and on the cost of funding increasing?  Then when he or she sought a six-month extension of the arrangement it was proposed to increase the margin again.  Does the director consider such increases to be in breach of the letters of direction?</p></speech>

In practice, that is possible.  My concern with what the Deputy has said is whether the bank can demonstrate that it is making the mortgage more sustainable.  That is what a bank is meant to do.

Based on what the Deputy has said, it strikes me as a little odd that a bank would up its rate unless there are other circumstances involved.</p></speech>

The debate has rightly concentrated a lot on transaction costs but I shall continue to deal with the mortgage issue.  One of the significant charges that customers have faced in recent years was for payment protection insurance.  I would like to rationalise the Central Bank's approach to dealing with individual banks who sold payment protection insurance.  I understand, and please correct me if I am wrong, that the remedy for mis-selling was to refund the premiums paid rather than oblige a bank to stand over its offer of insurance cover for somebody who thought, in good faith, that he or she had cover.  Why was the approach excessively deferential to the interests of the bank rather than mortgage holders?</p></speech>

I wish to comment on an area that I have touched on previously with the Central Bank, namely, the complexity of financial products being sold now and the different legal framework that exists for insurance-based products as opposed to financial products.  In recent times a group of well-informed and well-advised purchasers of a particular financial product sold by ACC Bank were in a position to beat the clock regarding the Statute of Limitations when pursuing the bank for mis-selling of a financial product.  A substantial number of other investors were not so lucky and are statute barred from pursing the bank.  At present, financial products may not fall under the remit of existing insurance-based legislation.  Is there a need to change the law from applying the Statute of Limitations to financial products in order to protect consumers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Sheridan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013041700015#P02700"><p>No.  The Deputy made a good point.  From our perspective, the Statute of Limitations is less of an issue.  It is more of an issue in the context of a person's right to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman which has a six-year rule.  I think the Deputy is implying that in the insurance sector scenarios he outlined, there are more long-term products.  Therefore, a consumer may be less likely to become aware of an issue during the six-year period and run out of time.  Slightly different provisions apply, for example, when approaching the Pensions Ombudsman for pension-type products.  The provision relates to the period when one becomes aware of an issue and does not purely rely on when a consumer bought a product.  From my perspective, the provision works well and is better than simply having a black and white six-year rule dating from when a consumer bought a product.</p></speech>

Individual cases may or may not have been eligible.  However, redress was made available to investors who had signed up for a legal case earlier, but other investors cannot avail of it because they are statute barred.</p></speech>

From our perspective, we would ask if the code applied to the sale.  If so, a consumer would have the right under our consumer protection code to lodge a complaint with the institution.  That right applies irrespective of when a consumer bought his or her product provided that the code was in place at the time.</p><p>  We see more of a problem around the right to complain to the Ombudsman.  The Statute of Limitations issue is not something in which the Central Bank plays a role or is involved with.  The question is whether there is a gap in financial services rather than examining the Statute of Limitations.</p></speech>

Perhaps those people had better legal advice and stronger financial resources to pursue a legal case.  The poor performance of the product came to the attention of some investors too late in the day.  Such matters should come under the remit of consumer protection.</p> <p>The issue of redress for all who purchased it should concern the Central Bank and Mr. Sheridan.</p></speech>

Mr. Fielding is aware of the following example.  A subcontractor on a State contract worked for a main contractor with ongoing financial difficulty but who was, ultimately, paid by the State.  He had to open up a new bank account in a separate bank to guarantee he could pay his subcontractors.  His fear was that if he put the sum into his main bank, it would be gobbled up in respect of liabilities in other areas.  There are high profile cases of State contracts, particularly in education, where schools have been picketed because subcontractors were not paid.  Is there any role for the Central Bank of Ireland in respect of subcontractors having their rights protected?  Can these issues be addressed in respect of ongoing contracts, whether State or otherwise, to guarantee payment to subcontractors who have carried out work and are due to be paid by the main contractor, who will not see the funds if the payment goes to his main bank account because of other liabilities?</p></speech>

We have tried to do something for the personal consumer in respect of the banks' right of set-off in respect of money in different accounts.  When people go into arrears, they must be notified of the potential of this happening.  People are notified when opening accounts but it is not relevant at that time.  When people are struggling and going into arrears, they must be reminded of the bank's right.  Beyond that, I do not see a role for us.</p></speech>

The banks get very upset over contractors lodging money into another bank account but they are trying to protect subcontractors, which is something we back.  Legislation going through the Houses is being dragged back.  Members know more than me about why that is.  I would like to see it in place.  It goes back to the issue of prompt payments, where small businesses are being crucified.  It has nothing to do with banks in this case.  It concerns the abuse of a dominant position by larger businesses who will not pay on time.  It is a major issue, the third most contentious issue small businesses are dealing with on top of economic uncertainty.</p></speech>

I refer to the upcoming implementation of the single euro payments area, SEPA.  This is a standardised electronic payments system across 32 associated countries of the SEPA region.  The purpose is to allow transactions on a major contract by a company that may have people working in Britain or other countries.  I was in Turkey last week, where Project Management Group in Cork has opened up a new office, and such a company may make payments to workers there.  The intention is that the system will reduce business operation costs with regard to payments.  My understanding is that the system is without charge.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I refer to charging and the general operation of banks.  In France, if one offers a &euro;50 note at the local cafe or grocery shop, people look at you as if you have two heads.  ATMs, or drink links as they are called, issue denominations of &euro;5 or &euro;10 whereas the standard procedure here seems to be &euro;50 or &euro;20.  Is there not a strong argument that we need to examine the possibility of having money released in particular denominations?  It is a particular problem for people on low incomes and those in receipt of social welfare payments.  If one has &euro;19.99, the money is unavailable through the ATM system.  It is a significant amount of money for someone in receipt of social welfare.  Payment may not come through until the Thursday and after 6 p.m. on Wednesday the person cannot get access to &euro;20, which amounts to one tenth of the social welfare payment.  Has consideration been given to this issue by the Central Bank?  What response has the Central Bank received from the banks?</p></speech>

There is a workstream on it and it refers to the earlier point about the move to less cash.  The question is whether we can deal with everyone's situation and one of the implications is the situation described by the Chairman.  Work is being done to trial whether banks, in the context of the wider strategy, can deliver what the Chairman suggests, such as lower denominations in ATMs.  That must be done in association with a move away from cash, but when one really needs the cash, one should be able to access it.</p></speech>

We do not want a situation where &euro;20 gets gobbled up on transactions involving &euro;5 or &euro;10.  Surely there must be a system of adaptation with regard to the existing system.</p></speech>

We go through a process based on their commercial justification.  We then also assess, by looking at the outcome, the impact on customers, the actual increase associated with the charge, whether it is in line and the implications for particular classes of customers.

My point is that it is clear there is a major problem.  The banks are clearly using the old provisions to bring in charges.  The issue is the differential in margins.  I suspect that the banks are doing a hybrid based on the charges that require approval from the Central Bank.  They appear to get a high rate of approval from the Central Bank.  Then they are mixing that with charges that apply under the old legislation, which they do not have to flag to the Central Bank.  This is probably the first time that the customer has become aware of this situation.  I have been around for a reasonable length of time but this is the first time I have become aware of this situation.  Is what I have said correct?</p></speech>

I am looking for details of what has happened since 1996, or before then if the Central Bank can go back further than 1996.  What percentage of charges falls into each category?  What are the amounts in question?  We need to get a flavour of what has been happening in the hidden world of bank charges over recent years.  The committee has a duty to make inquiries of this nature.</p></speech>

The market is not working at the moment.  People are stuck in negative equity.  They cannot move because they have tracker mortgages.  All sorts of new reasons are preventing people from moving.  Distressed borrowers and distressed businesses are stuck with banks they cannot get away from.  In a healthy banking market, they would be able to move and take their business elsewhere.  The same banks are able to increase charges unilaterally.  We all know that is putting businesses out of operation and causing huge distress.  I would be in favour of looking at the legislation to make sure Mr. Sheridan and his team have the tools they need.  I am not convinced that we have provided those tools.</p><p>  I wish to reflect briefly on an aspect of this matter before asking a question about the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  We must establish whether the charging structure or environment is reasonable and appropriate.  Obviously, there is no right answer.  It is a judgment call.  It would be incredibly useful to know where we stand by comparison with the rest of the OECD countries.  If we are in the bottom quarter in terms of charges to businesses and citizens, that is great, reasonable and appropriate.  If we are in the top 10% or 15% along with the UK, that is neither reasonable nor appropriate.  I wonder if it might be possible to get some kind of comparative analysis.  I would be astounded if it has not already been done.  Perhaps an official from the Central Bank can send something on to us.  I would be much more comforted by the Central Bank's judgment call if I could see that we are in the mid-range of OECD countries in this regard.  Is that possible?  It is obvious that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is a huge issue.  I am very concerned about the proposed changes.  Is Mr. Sheridan involved in that process?</p></speech>

I appreciate that Mr. Sheridan is not here to talk about it.  I do not want to give the impression that I am trying to ambush him on it.  The question I am asking is specifically linked to charges.  I have made a submission because I am deeply concerned about what the proposed changes will do to citizens in this country.  I guess that is for another day.  The Central Bank acted correctly and admirably in 2010 when it instructed the banks not to impose surcharges on mortgages in arrears if the borrowers in question came under the protection of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  That was welcome.  It was a great move.  The proposed revisions open up numerous new avenues for banks to get borrowers away from the protections of the code of conduct.  When a borrower is designated as non-co-operating, he or she will no longer enjoy the protection of the code of conduct.  The proposed changes open up numerous ways for the bank to make such a designation - ways which were not available to the banks in the past.  Is the Central Bank concerned that its admirable 2010 instruction to banks not to keep ratcheting up the charges on distressed borrowers in arrears will no longer apply and such practices will happen again?  The revised proposals make it much easier for banks to get borrowers out of the process and away from the protections of the code of conduct.  Therefore, they will enable the banks to start stacking up the charges again.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that we are trying to make the categorisation of co-operating and non-co-operating lenders and borrowers clearer.  We are trying to protect those who are not co-operating before they are too far gone.  They need to be notified in advance that they are to be deemed as non-co-operating, advised of what they need to do to be designated as co-operating and made aware of the implications of all eventualities.  The Deputy is right when he suggests that the potential exists for non-co-operating borrowers who have not made a strategic decision not to co-operate to be affected by this.  We need to look at that very carefully to make sure it does not happen.  Basically, I am saying we will consider what the Deputy has said.</p></speech>

The revised proposals allow the bank to determine whether one is co-operating.  If one wants to appeal, one has to appeal to the bank.  As far as I am aware, consumers or citizens cannot appeal to the Central Bank.  The banks have not necessarily acted in the interests of the country in the last while.  Some of them, at least, may continue to act in that way.  If a bank decides that one has not replied to it within a timeframe it deems appropriate, it can decide that one is not co-operating.  If one wants to appeal that, one will have to appeal it to the bank.  We can guess what the answer will be in those circumstances.  If the bank decides one is not responding to its timescales in a way it deems appropriate - with no oversight from the Central Bank and no independent appeal - it will be able to classify one as non-co-operating.  The bank will be able to remove the statutory provisions given to one by the Oireachtas and the Central Bank.  It will then be able to start hitting one with lots of charges on one's arrears.  I suggest that it will be much easier for the banks to act in this manner under the new proposals.  I suggest that some of them, based on our interactions with them in here, will do whatever they can to get more money in.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to have a discussion with Ms Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera, executive director of Freedom and Roam Uganda, on the position of LGBTI people in Uganda.  I am delighted to welcome her.  I met her briefly earlier.  She is accompanied by Mr. Colm O'Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, and Ms Aisling Seely of Amnesty International Ireland.</p><p>  In our work programme for the year the joint committee selected a number of priority areas, particularly the area of promotion of human rights and equality in terms of gender, sexual orientation, religion and ethnicity.  There has been increased awareness and significant progress in many countries, including Ireland, in human rights issues and in respect of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people.  However, progress has been slower in many other countries.  In Uganda a growing culture of homophobia and intolerance has had negative consequences for the gay rights community there.  The anti-homosexuality Bill which is awaiting consideration in the Ugandan Parliament provides, among other things, for the death penalty in cases of aggravated homosexuality.  It is against this background that Ms Kasha Jacqueline Nabasgesera will address the committee.  She is executive director of Freedom and Roam Uganda, an NGO which seeks to empower gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex people and jointly advocate for respect, protection and fundamental rights in Uganda.  </p><p>  Before commencing, I advise that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera to address the committee.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the platform it has given me.  I do not usually get such a platform back home.  I am happy to speak about the anti-homosexuality Bill that is currently pending in the Parliament of Uganda, but I also want to speak about the realities of the LGBTI community in my country.  We are facing a media witch-hunt.  The media are continuing, with impunity, to expose LGBTI people's addresses, names and pictures.  A week ago one of my staff members was outed and beaten on the streets in broad daylight and nobody, not even the authorities, could protect her.  We have issues with protests that are still continuing.  Yesterday, a hundred metres from the grave of my late friend, David Kato, who was murdered two years ago in his house, there was a protest to launch the campaign against homosexuality in Uganda.  They called on all people in the community and around the village not to accept anything to do with homosexuality.   They attacked the mother of the late David Kato, who is a very old woman and is sick in hospital.  We continue to face challenges in the health sector.  We are not included in the national HIV-AIDS policies.  There was a case in which one of our colleagues was recommended to a referral hospital and, on his recommendation, it was stated that he was a homosexual and HIV-positive.  He was refused treatment and lived in the corridors of the hospital without any help.</p> <p> We also have issues concerning censorship of our meetings.  Some of our meetings have been broken down and we face harassment and illegal arrest.  I myself was arrested in August last year with other members.  We were arrested having been found having a gay pride meeting in a public park and were imprisoned for approximately four hours.  Thank God, we had just met Mrs. Hilary Clinton who called the authorities and told them to release us.  Recently, two of our young youth co-ordinators were arrested and kept in prison for four days without charge.  When we tried to establish the charges against them from the police, they refused to state the charges.  However, in the police station these workers were harassed and sexually abused.  We also have a case of a transgender woman who has been arrested over 32 times.  Every time she has been arrested she comes out sick because she has been sexually abused and beaten by other prisoners.  Therefore, there is a lot going on.</p><p> The responsibility for what is going on comes back to the government, because it does not hold the perpetrators accountable.  The media continue to act as they have been doing.  Two weeks ago a radio station started up and its main purpose is to discuss homosexuality and incite harassment and violence.  They are doing this with impunity because the government is doing nothing to stop them.  Gay pornography is being shown in church to incite harassment, but the government does not hold these people accountable.  There is a lot of harassment because of the proposed anti-homosexuality Bill, which has a lot of support from all Christian denominations and politicians.  This issue is the only one to unite the opposition and the ruling party in the country.</p><p> It is very depressing not knowing one will wake up alive another day or not knowing when one leaves one's house whether one will be able to come back to it.  Many people incite violence against us and abuse us on the streets.  They threaten us and say all kinds of things and warn us that they are waiting for the Bill to be passed and become law.  I and my office have been attacked.  People threw bricks at my office and sent me letters saying they would burn the office building down.  Just yesterday, someone was in front of my house preaching against me trying to remove me from my house.  This was not the first time this happened.  This man did this previously for three full weeks and called on people to come and join him in casting demons away from their village.  It is a challenge for us in the community knowing we are not protected by the law.</p></speech>

Human rights organisations, health service providers and women's rights organisations have come together and are standing in solidarity with us and have condemned the Bill.  The Uganda Human Rights Commission has also come out openly and condemned the Bill.  At the same time, the donor countries have come out and threatened to cut aid, but we have made it clear that is not going down well in our community because we are being scapegoated on account of that.  We have made it very clear that we do not want aid to Uganda to be cut because even the LGBT community benefits from the aid.  We have been advising our donor countries and partners there should be clear guidelines on policies between donor countries and Uganda so that if there is discrimination against certain groups and they are not getting the services they should be getting, some of the aid will be channelled to civil societies dealing directly with these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700003#B00800"><p>I welcome our guests.  What we have heard from Ms Nabagesera is frightening and alarming.  The briefing papers we received from Freedom and Roam, Uganda and from Amnesty International painted a similar picture.  Ms Nabagesera's contribution highlights for us the serious concern the international community should have in regard to this issue.</p><p>  The question asked by the Chairman is important.  We have had a very strong relationship with Uganda through the Irish Aid programme over the past number of years, and substantial amounts of Irish taxpayers' money have been transferred to different programmes there.  We have been told and assured by the Department of Foreign Affairs that those funds have been put to good use and that there are good outcomes in regard to school completion and the development of much needed health services.  Has Ms Nabagesera had the opportunity to speak in other parliamentary fora throughout Europe?  What can we do to help apart from raise these issues through our Department of Foreign Affairs and the T&aacute;naiste our Minister?  I presume it would be worthwhile for Ms Nabagesera to speak to similar parliamentary committees in other member states of the European Union and through the Foreign Affairs Committee of the European Parliament.  </p><p>  The issues Ms Nabagesera has highlighted for us must be promulgated and people must learn about the desperate environment in which she works, of intimidation, censorship and harassment, and about the proposed legislation to institutionalise discrimination.  This scenario is a concern and relevant parliamentary fora must be made aware of it.</p></speech>

In Britain there have been protests around the plans to deport Ugandan nationals with a public profile as LGBT activists.  What are Ms Nabagesera's views on what deportation might mean for those people?  Ireland has close diplomatic relations with Uganda and it is one of the biggest recipients of Irish Aid.  How best can the Irish Government challenge the proposed Bill?  Amnesty International says we should not withdraw donor aid for Uganda.  Should the Government be acting quietly and privately on this issue or should it be speaking out publicly on the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.477" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700003#B01000"><p>I have had a chance to speak to parliamentarians in Sweden and Italy and in January this year we had a meeting in Amsterdam where the Intergroup supporting LGBT rights of the European Parliament organised a discussion of the LGBT toolkit and how it can be used in our countries and how we can use it to force our governments to implement changes.  We also have workers in Uganda who are LGBT.  This meeting went well.  We have also been advising politicians, members of parliament, the international community and governments that during the universal periodic review, Uganda accepted three recommendations to protect LGBT persons and to investigate violence and abuse of LGBT persons.  However, this has not been implemented since March last year.  Therefore, we are working through our diplomatic missions to lobby and try to see how aid can be tied to the policies that were accepted by Uganda.  We are using these small avenues to get our international diplomatic missions to try to push the country towards upholding the commitments made during the universal periodic review.</p><p>  I have not had the opportunity to speak with many parliaments around the world.</p> <p>It is something that we are working on to say that we can get allies from the international community to really try to put pressure on our government.  So far the pressure has worked internationally.  People are speaking out openly.  The Prime Ministers of Canada and the UK, and President Obama, have spoken out well and the government at home feels that it is being pressurised and forced to take something that is a Western import but it also helped us because it realised that the world is watching and that it is a foreign policy issue.  The President came out openly and advised the Members of Parliament to go slowly on the homosexuality Bill.  The only problem we have now is that Members of Parliament are pushing for the Bill to go through.  They say the President is being bribed and pressurised and that they will go ahead and pass the Bill because they do not need the donor aid.  They have found oil and can work with that.  That is why the Bill is moving up and down on the order paper.  It is popular with the people of Uganda but there is also a lot of international pressure on the government and that is why they are trying to find a way to get rid of the Bill but also save face.</p><p> Deportation is another issue.  All the people who face deportation in the UK are exposed in the media and that means at home they are being watched and exposed as well as outed in the media, which puts their lives at risk when they come home.  Last month upon my arrival at the airport my passport and my laptop were confiscated for a week by immigration officers to prevent me from travelling out again.  That is how I missed my previous appointment to meet Amnesty International in the US because we use these avenues to build solidarity and networks for support.  It is dangerous for those who are exposed in the newspapers to come home.  There was a case in which a lesbian was deported last month and two weeks later she was found dead in Uganda.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700004#C00200"><p>It is an honour to be in the presence of Ms Nabagesera because we revere her for her extraordinary courage.  None of us in this country who have been involved in easier aspects of this trouble have had to confront anything like the brutality, the viciousness and violence that happens in Uganda.  I was also honoured to meet David Kato at a meeting of Front Line Defenders in Dublin Castle and I had no idea that within a matter of months he would be so savagely murdered.  It is very important that Ms Nabagesera is here and that people here who may have different views on this issue should hear what it is like because it is so clearly a fundamental human rights issue.</p><p>  The briefing was helpful but only 10% of it was relevant to the gay issue.  The others had some marginal relevance but they displayed a remarkable degree of corruption within the Government of Uganda which is a difficulty that must be examined.  It was very interesting and useful that Ms Nabagesera was able to tell us that, as I suspected, it would be counterproductive to have used sanctions and so on because people would then be punished again.</p><p>  I would like to ask about a couple of issues that might be helpful and which our committee might consider.  In the list of aid that we give &euro;500,000 goes to male advocacy.  I assume that is for violence against women but I wonder if we could earmark some for this very specific area.  Would that be useful or would that also expose gay people to antagonism?  Looking at it from outside I think that could be helpful but I might be quite wrong.</p><p>  Could Ms Nabagesera signal to us the names of some of the leading members, starting with herself and David Kato's bereaved, elderly and sick mother?  Having been interested for a very long time in human rights I have found when I travel or even at a meeting such as this that if one signals directly to the diplomatic representatives here and asks them to transmit to their capital that as a people, a Government and a committee on foreign affairs we are taking a specific interest in the welfare of these people it may serve to protect them.  If Ms Nabagesera feels that would be useful perhaps she could supply us with an appropriate list.  We cannot protect the whole gay population but it would be helpful if key people could be protected.</p><p>  I want to know about the type of pressure we could apply.  I say with great sorrow as a practising and believing Christian that it seems to me that the Christian churches are almost entirely responsible for this appalling mess and it is a disgrace.  That is the European inheritance.  That is what they imported, not homosexuality, which exists throughout the mammalian kingdom.  We have an interesting situation here where the Papal Nuncio is the doyen of the diplomatic corps and it might be possible for us to write a polite letter asking that the hierarchy in Uganda make it very clear that this is not consonant with Christianity at all.  I would be happy to write privately to the Archbishop of Canterbury who I imagine would be surprised to learn of my existence but as an Anglican I think we should lean on him and on the Archbishop of Dublin as well.</p><p>  I do not wish to take up too much of Ms Nabagesera's time but I would like to know if any of these measures would be helpful or if any are completely out of order.  Why not try to get something done at the Inter-Parliamentary Union?  It deals with journalists' standards.  There are also the International Press Association and the NUJ.  The newspapers have taken this up because the sensationalist events earn money for them, particularly when churches show pornography.  It might be possible to explore those avenues.  I will be interested to know if any of these suggestions would be counter-productive or if any of them would be good and if so could Ms Nabagesera facilitate us?</p></speech>

I agree in general with Senator Norris.  There are several points we need to establish in respect of discrimination and discriminatory legislation.  Discrimination is one thing but discriminatory legislation is another matter because it carries the imprimatur and approval of society.  That is a very dangerous thing, particularly in the so-called enlightened world in which we now live.  It is important that we create a clear impression throughout the international community that discriminatory legislation is unacceptable.  Violation of human rights is unacceptable.  I recognise that we are not encouraged to impose conditions on aid and I understand all the reasons for that, nonetheless we need to make it clear that insofar as aid is concerned we need the societies to which the donation is directed to recognise that we do not propose to support in any way, shape or form, discrimination or the violation of human rights.  To what extent we have to pursue that remains with us.  All the countries to which we donate aid should recognise that we are not here for the taking.  We should not be expected to donate indefinitely if there are blatant violations of human rights and disregard of international norms in human rights.  I strongly support Deputy Norris' points in that regard and I suggest that perhaps as a committee we liaise with our colleagues in relevant similar committees throughout the EU with a view to mobilising opinion throughout the Union to this effect.</p></speech>

We have been discussing with donor countries the need to put policies in place and guidelines on how the aid should reach the communities to which it is directed.  Some have made this very clear.  The German and Swedish Governments have come out very clearly on this but we have not yet heard it from other governments.  We have told them that if the government does not have clear policies on how this aid should reach the communities our government will continue to discriminate and to leave out a group of people.  It said openly in 2008 that it did not have funds to include men who have sex with men in the HIV-AIDS policies yet we know that Uganda receives a lot of donor aid to fight HIV and AIDS.</p> <p>It would be very much appreciated if this committee were to discuss this issue with other committees in the European Union.</p></speech>

Suggestions that aid might be cut - I acknowledge no member here has suggested that - in opposition to this Bill will only increase the vulnerability of that community.  The view is that everything that happens in Uganda at the moment, every single political development, is the fault of the gays; it is that extreme.</p><p>  We had a very positive meeting this morning with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Irish Aid to discuss Ireland's aid programme.  Kasha Nabagesera made it clear at the meeting that neither she nor the LGBTI activists in Uganda were asking for aid to be cut.  As members of general Ugandan society, they are also dependent on some of the services and initiatives provided through that aid programme.  However, they would support a targeting of some aid to support civil society in Uganda. </p><p>  Approximately 39 organisations joined forces with Kasha and her colleagues in opposition to the Bill.  Those 39 organisations - many of which are human rights organisations - have now been blacklisted by the government and signalled for closure.  There is a very heavy suppression of any organisation that speaks out in favour of LGBTI rights generally.</p><p>  I refer to two issues with regard to the legislation.  Homosexuality is already a criminal offence in Uganda.  It is noteworthy for us in Ireland and particularly for those such as Senator Norris who managed to secure the repeal of that legislation that Uganda operates under the same post-colonial laws as did Ireland until 1993.  It is exactly the same legislation.  What is different about the current legislation is not just the threat of the death penalty but also the focus on suppressing freedom of expression.</p><p>  The promotion of homosexuality is forbidden.  Any reference to homosexuality in the public sphere must be negative; it must be an attack.  The rhetoric is increasingly violent.  Anyone who seeks to defend or push back on that rhetoric is accused of promoting homosexuality.  The narrative put out by the evangelical churches who are behind the legislation,  also by the media and supporters of the Bill and many politicians, is that LGBTI activists are actively recruiting children to homosexuality; that this is the focus of their efforts; that they are seeking, for instance, to destroy the traditional African family.  That community is being particularly scapegoated for the most extreme and bizarre things in Uganda - a situation that is somewhat familiar to us in this country.  It is very important that the rhetoric is calm and reasoned.</p><p>  This is the reason we suggest that the committee might wish to consider the three recommendations from Uganda's recent UN universal periodic review.  Uganda accepted three recommendations which all refer directly to the need to investigate and prosecute those guilty of violent attacks on members of the LGBTI community.  One of the recommendations also referenced stopping discrimination of LGBTI people in Uganda.  If Ireland worked to support the Ugandan state by means of its diplomatic influence in order to help it to deliver on the accepted recommendations of the UN profiles, this would be a way to begin that dialogue.  I ask Ireland to consider discussions with the Ugandan Government in an effort to create an environment in which an appropriate public debate or discourse on these issues would be more possible.  That is a longer-term piece of work but is one that needs to begin.</p></speech>

I know Africa reasonably well, having lived there for four years.  My question to Kasha is, why Uganda?  Is there something going on in Uganda that has caused the targeting of homosexuals?  I agree with Colm O'Gorman and other speakers that our response must take into account the sensitivities of the Prime Minister, the President and the Government of Uganda with regard to western influences on these issues.  I am trying to decide whom we should target.  Colm O'Gorman referred to evangelical churches.  In parts of Africa, homosexuality is deemed to be not the norm.  However, who is stirring the flames in Uganda?  The reaction seems to be disproportionate to anything else we hear from the rest of Africa.  Is it political populism?  Have the evangelical churches something to do with it?  Is it the Muslim community in the northern region?  Capital cities are usually more open-minded than rural areas.  I do not know if there is a difference in emphasis among the citizenry of Kampala as the capital city as against a tribal community or the Muslim community.</p><p>  Historically we have reason to be very scared of people who advocate this type of anti-gay philosophy.  It happened in Rwanda when certain priests got hold of the airwaves and there was resultant savagery between Tutsi and Hutu.  What is happening in Uganda and who should be regarded as the enemy who is promoting this horrendous legislation?  They are parliamentarians but their populism must be a response to other pressures coming up the line.  Does this make sense to the witnesses?</p></speech>

I hope they will enjoy some rest and relaxation here for the few days.  It must be a welcome break from the stress and dangers under which they live in Uganda.  I know they are working very hard but at least they are away from the physical danger of being taken in by the police.</p><p>  We are told that the President of Uganda, privately, does not agree with the Bill.  I ask if that gives the witnesses hope considering he is a powerful person.  Particularly frightening is the extent of the opposition.  There does not appear to be anyone.  The human rights organisations which were supportive have been blacklisted so they are also in a very difficult situation.</p><p>  I agree with Colm O'Gorman about aid.  However, there needs to be a human rights approach to aid otherwise I do not know what is its purpose.  The point about Irish Aid targeting particular groups such as LGBTI groups might be a means of indicating that the Irish Government and Irish Aid will not support discrimination in society.  </p><p>  This committee is planning a visit to Uganda.  Perhaps if the committee delegation asked specifically to meet the LGBTI group or a similar group, that might be a means of indicating our support and our positive engagement with the kind of work carried out by such groups.</p><p>  Wearing my AWEPA hat, Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, and following from Deputy Eric Byrne's remarks, I ask about support from the African Union and other African countries who are not as discriminatory as Uganda in this matter.  I advise the witnesses to take heart from what has happened in this country even though it took quite a long time and much progress has been made on the issue.  I acknowledge, however, that the situation in Uganda is far more serious and dangerous than was the case in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700005#D00500"><p>On the question about why this is happening in Uganda, it is not just happening only in Uganda.  We make our stories heard; we put our stories out there.  That is why everyone knows about Uganda.  Other countries are also going through the same, including our neighbours in Kenya.  Even South Africa, which has the most progressive constitution in the world, has the highest number of hate crimes and murders in Africa.  The reason it happens in Uganda is because Uganda is a very Christian country, from the first family down to the most lowly family in the country.</p> <p>They have many allies and friends around the world, some of whom are very powerful.  They are called the family in the United States and have exported their fundamental religious views and agenda to Uganda because they are against homosexuality.  They sent to Uganda their priests who held a conference over three days in which they preached the anti-gay agenda.  Our members of Parliament attended that conference at which they were advised that our law was very weak.  They advised parents attending the public seminars that homosexuals would recruit their children and that they were sick.  That created anger among the general public in Uganda.  People who previously did not have an objection to homosexuality were told all these lies and Members of Parliament, religious people, teachers, students and even young people are now protesting on the streets.  There are many protests in the country.  Children are being taught in school that homosexuals should not be tolerated, that homosexuality is a sin, that it is against nature and our traditions.  A range of people in the country are involved in this.</p><p> We want to show the world that we cannot allow this hatred to be imported into the country.  The evangelicals who preach this hatred have been coming to Uganda for the past four years and we are now suing them in the Massachusetts courts to show the world that this is unacceptable.  They cannot leave their country where their agenda failed and take it to a poor nation.  They took advantage of a poor country and are putting a great deal of money into these campaigns, which are happening every day.  As I said, the latest was on Easter Sunday.  They have continued to send people to Uganda from the United States who in their commentaries refer to homosexuality as being a sickness.  It is coming from every angle in the country.  We had a debate on the issue with medical students and one would expect medical people to debate the issue using science and to listen to the argument, but instead they were using the Koran and the Bible to debate it and were calling for homosexuals to be put to death.</p><p> This issue is uniting everyone in Uganda.  It is the only issues which is bringing the opposition and the ruling party together.  It is the only issue which is bringing Muslims, Catholics, Anglicans and evangelicals together.  There is a religious task force to campaign against homosexuality.  There is an east African task force to fight it.  All of these organisations are being led by Ugandans and a range of people are involved.  If the Bill is passed, it will call on parents, teachers, friends, landlords, brothers and sisters to report suspected homosexuals.  They are saying they want to encourage a tradition of the family, but instead they will break up families.  A range of issues are involved, but there is a great deal of hatred towards homosexuals.  </p><p> The problem is that we are being silenced in people hearing our stories.  Only the anti-gay groups are given time on the airways.  When radio station hosts tried to interview us, they were fined.  Radio hosts have been suspended for having us on their programmes.  As a result, people are only hearing stories from one side.  They are not hearing from the victims.  This is terrible because when one wakes up, every channel one tunes in to is broadcasting anti-gay messages.  If one goes to church, the message is anti-gay.  If one goes to hospital and is identified, one is surrounded.  It is becoming unbearable, which is the reason we are losing many members of our movement.  Many people are leaving the country.  In the past eight months six activists have left.  That makes the community smaller and weaker because people are afraid.  Many have gone back into the closet because of the media witch-hunt taking place every day.  People from among the religious leaders have stood up openly to support us.  A bishop has stated openly that we do not need to condemn homosexuals but rather bring them together.  He was excommunicated and even denied a pension.  </p><p> The Government is closing down all of the places where we gather for our meetings.  We are suing it, but every time the lawyer who is defending us in court is shown on television, his children cannot attend school that day because other children bully them and say their father is a homosexual.  The situation is becoming unbearable.  Even the powerful people who want to support us risk being stigmatised in public.  People are using the gay issue as a political ladder.  They only have to tell their constituents that they will protect their children by supporting the Bill in parliament and the people vote for them.</p><p> The President has come out openly and admitted that there have always been people who are homosexual.  He has said they were never persecuted or harassed in the past, but that if they have begun recruiting and encouraging children to be homosexual, we must stop them.  He is being ill-advised by the people around him, which is a challenge for us.  We hope that if we tell him our stories, he will listen to us.  He is not homophobic, but we must separate the executive from the parliament.  The Members of Parliament are willing to pass the Bill.  It is a Private Members' Bill from a ruling party and, therefore, benefits from the President's party, but he has no say in the matter.  If the Bill is passed into law and given to him for signature and he vetoes it, parliament can override him and pass it into law.  That presents a major challenge.</p><p> We tried to lobby the members of the Interparliamentary Union who came to Uganda to engage in dialogue with our Members of Parliament.  Most of them told us that it did not go well.  They produced a declaration during the meeting, but it was turned down by the government.  The Speaker of the parliament refused to meet the group that had come to discuss the Bill.  It is a challenge that Members of Parliament believe what they are being told by people from the West.  </p><p> Mention was made of the violence witnessed.  We work with some organisations run by women who are facing a challenge because the government is trying to close down organisations that work with people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, LGBT.  It has introduced a Bill to provide for the annual registration of non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  If they talk openly about LGBT issues, they may not be registered subsequently because the government will see them as a promoter of homosexuality.  This presents another major challenge.</p></speech>

I thank her for her sobering update on what life is like for the LGBT community in Uganda.  I am a member of the LGBT community in Ireland and can recall what it was like in this country before decriminalisistation.  It was thanks to people like Senator David Norris that our lives improved immeasurably.  We have now achieved many of the rights we had set out to achieve all those years ago.  It was a long but ultimately successful struggle.  I recognise that the position is very different in Uganda, but it is important that we stand together in solidarity with the delegates.  Issues remain to be dealt with in some European countries.  Issues also remain in terms of the way some countries bordering Europe treat LGBT people.  That is something we have not got right on this side of the world.</p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about the position in South Africa which was a trailblazer in its day in terms of LGBT rights.  How much pressure is it putting on countries such as Uganda, Malawi and others?  How much pressure is being exerted from within the African Union to try to effect real change?  </p><p>  I again thank Senator Jim Walsh for allowing me to contribute.</p></speech>

She has painted a challenging picture for us of what is happening to the homosexual and lesbian community in Uganda.  I ask for clarity on some of the issues raised.  </p><p>  The measures included in the Bill appear draconian.  Two of the provisions were outlined in the briefing document we received from the Department, one of which was related to the death penalty in the case of aggravated homosexuality.  This was highlighted as one of two very controversial and extreme elements.</p> <p>What is meant by "aggravated homosexuality"?</p><p> Consider the sentence of three years' imprisonment for the failure to disclose the identity of gay persons, which obviously affects family members, medical practitioners, etc.  What is the current law?  The proposed Bill is a Private Members' Bill.  The note we received states the Ugandan Government would say that in a democracy such a Bill is on the table and can be moved.</p><p> The real issue is the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  What efforts are being made in that regard in Uganda?  Once that is achieved, the other issues are more or less resolved.  I sympathise with Ms Nabagesera when she talks about outside influence.  In Africa, unfortunately, many battles of the kind in question are taking place.  There are American groups trying to promulgate their views on abortion and to make acceptance of these views a condition for the granting of aid there.  That is an appalling breach of human rights.  Issues certainly arise in connection with the principle to which the delegation referred.</p><p> President Museveni is generally regarded as having generated an improvement in human rights in Uganda.  He has said to Government officials here that his Government would not be supporting the Private Members' Bill.  To what extent does Ms Nabagesera take comfort from that?  As with many Private Members' Bills we have here, if they are not embraced by the Government, they do not go very far.</p></speech>

"Aggravated" means that one does something repeatedly.  Basically, most of us would be put to death.</p><p>  On the question on the three year sentence, the current law is that any person caught having carnal knowledge against the order of nature faces life in prison.  It is believed that life in prison is a very weak law and that is why the death penalty is proposed.  People have been prosecuted.</p></speech>

According to the research, eight people have been charged under the law.  Many people have been arrested and have not been charged with sodomy, which is the usual charge, but with disorder, for example.  It is another law that is used to disguise why one is being arrested.  There have been cases in which people have been arrested because they have been blackmailed.  The police extorted a lot of things from them because they are homosexuals.  The police have refused to outline the charges; they just lock up and release the suspects.  The police have failed to tell us why they arrested the individuals in the first instance.</p><p>  There was a reference to media censorship being such that we cannot even go out and share our stories.  When we do so, we are told we are promoting an illegal practice.  That is why we want to start the process of decriminalisation.  It will not cover all our problems but at least give us avenues to do our work without being called criminals.</p><p>  Consider President Museveni's comment that he and his Government do not support the Bill.  It is great because if the country and people pushing for the legislation hear the President is not supportive of it, it carries a lot of weight.  However, the President called together his ruling party and advised it that it should go slow on the issue.  Its members walked out on him in protest because they say he is being bribed and is bending to pressure.  However, as I said, even if the President refuses to sign the Bill, or if he vetoes the Bill if it is supported in the Parliament, the Parliament can overpower him because it is a Private Members' Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Gorman" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700007#F00500"><p>It is important to recognise that the political and public discourse being created as a result of the Bill, in and of itself, is the key threat.  It is very unsettling and disheartening at times to hear Ms Nabagesera speak of the Ugandan committee's wish that the Bill would just pass on the grounds that the activists would know how to deal with it and have strategies.  At the same time, we hear very clearly that their view is that if the Bill is passed, many people will be killed.  While physical attacks are happening and members of the community are beaten badly, people are told repeatedly to wait until the Bill is passed, at which time the problem will really be solved.  People are waiting for the Bill.  It is not just that the Bill carries the death sentence.  It is that it is seen by very many as a licence to openly kill, with impunity, members of the LGBT community.</p><p>  On Senator Norris's suggestion that there might be engagement with officials from the Roman Catholic Church, the majority church in Uganda, I had it pointed out to me recently that the Catholic Church has come out against the Bill in Uganda.  I will give the statement to Senator Norris if he wants to see it.  The statement from the Catholic bishops' conference of Uganda starts with the line, "We, the Catholic Bishops of Uganda, appreciate and applaud the Government's effort to protect the traditional family and its values."  It states homosexuals are in need of repentance, conversion and rehabilitation.  It expresses concern that the Bill does not allow for that to happen.  Specifically, according the church, the criminalisation of people who have knowledge of homosexuals creates a difficulty for priests, teachers, etc., who might assist them in repentance and conversion on that basis.  Thankfully, the statement points out that the death penalty is a significant issue, and it has particular difficulty with it.  However, the statement ends thus: "Additionally, in our view the proposed Bill is not necessary considering that acts of sodomy are already condemned under section 145 of the penal code."  It asserts the legislation is unnecessary because there is already a sentence of life imprisonment in place under Ugandan law.  In the interest of trying to influence key influencers, that statement is possibly a route of potential influence.  I hope church leaders, particularly leaders of the Roman Catholic Church, will be able to influence the kinds of statements being made in Uganda.  The Ugandan bishops' statement is not a rejection of the legislation but a statement of support for its intent and design and a reaffirmation of criminalisation.  The route I suggest could be useful.</p></speech>

I wish to add to what it is proposed be written to Archbishop Brown, the papal nuncio.  The committee should engage with the Irish bishops' conference on the issue.  Having listened to Mr. O'Gorman's remarks and having heard the Ugandan bishops' letter, I believe the latter is appalling.  I say this as a Christian and practising Catholic.</p><p>  Today puts life into perspective.  New Zealand passed a gay marriage Bill, becoming the 13th country to have done so.</p> <p>Last Sunday, a plurality of the Irish Constitutional Convention passed a motion regarding civil marriage in our country.  This was a tremendous affirmation and ending of discrimination and intolerance.  Yet we come back to today where we are given a testimony by a fantastic person of the life and lack of basic rights of people who are born gay.  Let us not forget that the allies of gay people are also condemned and treated as second-class citizens.</p><p> My first question is in the context of the mental health of gay people and suicide.  I suppose Ms Nabagesera can never give us the proper figure but have we any idea of the number of people who have either left Uganda to seek asylum elsewhere because of their treatment or committed suicide?</p><p> The briefing we have places heavy emphasis on the fact that the President is opposed to this.  I am disappointed that the IPU conference in Uganda, which I attended in the past in Geneva, did not and was not able to broker a motion sending out a strong possible signal of its unhappiness with what is happening and its belief that it should not be tolerated in any shape or form.</p><p> I commend Ms Nabagesera and her friends and colleagues.  No matter how much they think they are not being listened to, I know straight and gay people within our society and Parliament who are appalled and very supportive of what they are doing.  We will do whatever work we can to help fight this injustice.  There must be a continual promulgation of the lack of basic rights for everybody involved.  I congratulate Ms Nabagesera on her great work.  She should not feel she is alone because she is not.</p></speech>

As someone who, along with Senator David Norris, was one of the strongest supporters in the Seanad of decriminalising homosexuality - I was spokesperson for justice in the Seanad at the time - I have read much about the situation in Uganda.  However, it is a different matter to hear it face to face from someone who has had experience of it.  One can read much about these things but it is only when one meets somebody who is able to articulate it that one is able to appreciate fully the difficulties experienced.</p><p>  Ms Nabagesera mentioned that Germany and Sweden made positive moves in respect of this.  Could she give us a brief outline of what those moves are and their impact?  My impression after discussing the matter here is that we want to do many things but there is a negative attached to every one of them.  One is treading on eggshells in respect of how we can handle this individually or collectively.  Can she tell us why she complimented Sweden and Germany on what they are doing?</p></speech>

I listened very carefully to what she said and she answered every possible question, so I will not ask her another one.  I echo what my colleague said earlier.  Having listened to everything, I am as perplexed and depressed as can be because I still do not know what is driving this - the why, where and what.  Usually, there is an explanation for hate campaigns.  It may be inexplicable but there is an explanation.  It might be rooted in politics or economics.  That does not seem to be the case here.  There are opportunities in Uganda with the discovery of oil, and the economy should bring people up to middle income standards.  It does not seem to have anything to do with politics as the President is popular and keeps getting re-elected.  Yet Ms Nabagesera says it is an uniting force.  I do not understand this urge to unite.  What is driving this fear that people feel they must unite in this way?</p><p>  What is really depressing is that Ms Nabagesera comes here as part of a campaign, yet it is being recommended that we tread so softly and raise this issue in such a subtle and oblique way as to make it almost meaningless.  She spoke about the church and I agree that this is a way of doing it.  It certainly behoves the church not only to speak out against the Bill but to speak out against the church in Uganda.  It is depressing to listen to all of this and then be told to be very careful in what we say when clearly the urge we all have is to say something very strongly.</p></speech>

We have seen that in the past.  We told our allies and governments to condemn publicly the Bill in Uganda and to have protests around the world, and then realised that it was causing a backlash for us at home.  It caused more attacks.  Many people lost their jobs because people thought they were being bought by the West and that the West was imposing this issue on them.  People believe we are being bought to be homosexuals and to promote homosexuality.  We realised that the more it is out in the public arena, the greater the backlash.  When governments say they are cutting aid because of corruption, people think it is just a disguise and that they are cutting aid because of homosexuals, and then people start attacking us.  A large brick was thrown through the window of a colleague of mine at the time Uganda refunded aid to Ireland.  A neighbour had lost a child in hospital because there was no medication.  All the anger was directed at my colleague who is a homosexual.  They said there was no medicine because of us and that was why the aid was withdrawn.</p><p>  Quiet diplomacy is working well because we are telling our allies to lobby governments quietly in order that people do not attack us.  Every single situation and problem in Uganda is regarded as being caused by homosexuals.  Following the bombings in Uganda at the time of the World Cup final, there was a big headline in the media that "homo-terrorists" did it.  It is causing a considerable backlash, which is why we are saying that action should be taken quietly.  Legislators should not feel they are being told what to do in public.  That is what happened with the Speaker of Parliament when she was confronted openly by the Canadian Member of Parliament.  She promised to give Ugandans the Bill as a Christmas present because she wanted to show that she is in control and has the power.  We prefer quiet diplomacy and one-on-one engagements.</p><p>  In respect of the issue of suicide, due to this harassment, discrimination and everything going on in the community, people are getting fed up with their lives.  They are telling students to name suspected homosexuals.  The name of one young girl appeared on everyone's list in a school.  They assembled the entire school, called her parents and caned her in front of everyone.  She felt humiliated, went back to the dormitory, got a bottle of pills and killed herself.  It was all over the radio.  Everyone was calling in to say that it was good that they had got rid of a homosexual.  People were jubilant because this thing had happened.  No government official condemned it and the school and parents were never held accountable.  So suicide is present.</p><p>  Kenyans came to Uganda because they saw that there was an active and vibrant movement there but when they arrived, the suffering was heaped on them.  A recent case involved an activist from Kenya who died in Uganda.  He decided to come to Uganda because he thought the movement was strong.  He committed suicide.  We had to transport his body because his parents refused to come for him.  They said it was shameful.  There is much that is creating fear in Uganda because it is the powerful who have the audience to promote their agenda to.  They are telling people it is against our culture.</p> <p>This is supposed to be against our religion and a part of western culture.  People are fearful because they are being told that homosexuals will bring about the destruction of the country, like the Bible story of Sodom and Gomorrah, and they will do whatever it takes to protect themselves.</p><p> South Africa is not playing a leading role in the continent.  Three months after the legislation was introduced, South Africa appointed a homophobic ambassador to Uganda.  This individual had been taken to court in South Africa for making homophobic statements to the media.  We tried to lobby the South African Government to persuade it that it should not send a homophobic person to a country that is trying to prosecute homosexuals but it refused to listen even though our allies in South Africa protested and tried to tell their Government that Uganda is in a difficult situation.  The Coalition of African Lesbians tried to apply for observer status in the African Commission on Human and People's Rights but the application was refused on the basis that it was not a human rights issue.  We asked the South African Government for help on the grounds that our organisation was registered with it and, as such, was legitimate, but we have not received any assistance.</p></speech>

Much of our work involves mobilising people to effect change.  There will be times when it is important to make public statements, but this is not one of them.  This is a time when careful considered diplomacy is required because people need to influence and support a different kind of decision making by political leaders in Uganda.  There are indications that such an approach is beginning to work.  It is a matter for diplomats and parliamentarians to work out how they can engage with their counterparts in those countries, but Ireland has a particular story to tell as a post-colonial State that has gone through a 30 year process of major change followed by limited change and then rapid change over the past ten years.  It may be useful to point out in informal conversations with African parliamentarians that the world did not come to an end for Ireland despite all the predictions about the impact of the changes we underwent in recent years.  The world did not even come to an end last Monday morning.</p><p>  There are opportunities for ongoing engagement and dialogue.  For example, the human rights commission in Uganda, which has not been especially helpful, shifted its position significantly after engaging with human rights commissions from other countries and building its own capacity.  Targeted support for LGBT activist organisations in Uganda is also important.  The only way that the voice of this community can emerge is if it has the resources to tell its stories by publishing booklets and organising campaigns that allow it be visible in a positive and healthy way.  This takes tremendous courage on the part of Ms Nabagesera and her colleagues, and we need to think about how to support them.</p><p>  We must also understand what is happening in Uganda in the context of a broader human rights crisis.  Sadly, this is not unique to Uganda.  We see moves to enact discriminatory laws across Africa and the same issues have arisen in Russia and parts of the Balkan states.  We must challenge these developments.  Even in the context of the successful negotiation of the arms trade treaty, there was opposition to mentions of gender because it was recognised that it also involved sexual orientation and gender identity.  The association of Islamic states, the Holy See and others opposed advances in protections under human rights law on the basis of gender, particularly in the area of sexual orientation and gender identity.  This is something that we must be watchful for as a State.  I suggest that members may be able to do something as parliamentarians by helping to strengthen international human rights provision in general to ensure sexual orientation and gender identity are recognised as grounds on which discrimination should not be permitted.  These are tangible initiatives we can take to make a dramatic impact in the longer term.</p></speech>

We take a great interest in this area and, as I noted earlier, we will be visiting Uganda later this year.  We will certainly meet members of the LGBT group and will bring careful and considered diplomacy to bear on the issue.  We will also attempt to meet the human rights commission and parliamentarians.  Regardless of where we travel in Africa it is important to meet parliamentarians because they offer a very different perspective from that of governmental officials.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.512" nospeaker="true" time="16:00:00" ><p>The following motion was moved by Senator Jim Walsh on 6 March 2013:
That the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade &ndash;- noting that the Russian lawyer, Mr. Sergei Magnitsky, died on 16 November 2009 at the age of 37, after being systematically denied medical care and beaten by riot guards with rubber batons in a Russian pre-trial detention centre, after he uncovered and exposed a major corruption scandal in Russia; and
- noting the passage in December 2012 of the U.S. Magnitsky Law, the European Parliament Report into establishing common visa restrictions for Russian officials involved in the Mr. Sergei Magnitsky case, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly resolution and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Written Declaration, all calling for visa sanctions for the perpetrators of this crime;
- calls on the Government to impose an Irish Magnitsky Law which would:- publicly list the names,
- deny visas into Ireland, and
- freeze any assets found in Ireland,of Russian government officials and others who -- were responsible for the false arrest, torture and death of Mr. Sergei Magnitsky,
- perpetrated or financially benefited from the crimes that Mr. Sergei Magnitsky uncovered and exposed, and-or
- participated in the cover up of those responsible for those crimes;- calls for the Irish Magnitsky law to be imposed against all other gross human rights violators;
- calls on the Government to use its Presidency of the Council of the European Union to impose EU-wide visa sanctions as called for by the European Parliament.</p></speech>

After his death, he was prosecuted for tax evasion charges.  Senator Walsh moved this motion at our last meeting and following a discussion, we agreed to invite the Russian ambassador to discuss the case with the committee and request an updated briefing note from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Russian ambassador has provided a statement on the Russian position but he has not responded to the invitation to meet the committee.  The update note from the Department has been circulated to members.  Nos. 925 and 926 on the correspondence list are updates from Mr. Mark Sabah, who works with Mr. William Browder, and are also relevant.  An amendment has been submitted by Deputy Durkan on the Magnitsky case.  I propose that Senator Walsh speak on his motion, followed by Deputy Durkan.</p></speech>

We heard about the situation from Mr. William Browder of Hermitage Capital Management.  Motions have been passed at OECD and Council of Europe level which condemn what happened, call for the perpetrators to be pursued and for the imposition of sanctions on them.  The motion specifically calls on the Government to impose Magnitsky law, which would publicly list the names of those involved, deny them visas into Ireland and freeze any assets found in Ireland belonging to those responsible.  </p><p> Yesterday, the USA published a list containing the names of 18 people who will be banned from entering that country, four of whom are judges.  This shows that the rule of law and the separation of powers are non-existent in Russia.  Those who have been to Russia and interacted with civil society there will be aware of the deep dissatisfaction among citizens there about this situation.  I understand from newspaper reports that the resources of the state have been sequestered by a small number of oligarchs who have close association with the Kremlin and the authorities therein.  </p><p> This is a stark and fundamental issue of human rights.  The amendment which Deputy Durkan will propose is very much in line with what the Polish Parliament did in 2010.  However, the situation has moved on significantly since then.  This is an opportunity for us to make our voices heard.  It is interesting that the reply from the Russian embassy includes a note of warning to us that our approach would not enrich bilateral Russian-Irish relations and could have negative influence on the negotiations on the adoption agreement.  It also refers to their depriving US citizens the right to adopt Russian children.  </p><p> I do not have anything further to add based on the information we have received.  The question for the committee on this fundamental issue of human rights is: "Do we stand four square behind it or not?"</p></speech>

Many of us were hugely impressed by Mr. Browder's presentation.  We decided to go a particular route, namely, that the Chairman would initiate discussions with the Russian embassy and ambassador to ensure the committee was balanced in addressing the issue.  I understand the Chairman subsequently met with the ambassador and that the joint committee has received correspondence from him.  The final paragraph of that correspondence is, to say the least, disappointing.  With respect to the ambassador, it appears to threaten that if we take this human rights issue as seriously as intended, it will have ramifications for Russian-Irish adoptions.</p><p>  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, spoke yesterday in the D&aacute;il about the progress being made in relation to Vietnamese and Russian adoptions.  The ambassador has added an extra dimension to this debate, which dimension I do not like.  The ambassador has effectively stated that our debate of this issue may have ramifications for the near completed Russian-Irish adoption process.  I believe we should take his sentiments seriously.  As stated by previous speakers, we must be diplomatic in how we address that which we have initiated by way of the Magnitsky issue and the threat from the embassy that we may be jeopardising the Russian-Irish adoption process.</p><p>  Somewhere in the correspondence on this issue reference is made to the European Union having debated and discussed this issue.  It would be no harm if the joint committee made contact with the relevant European committee which heard from speakers from the Duma on the issue.  I would like to know the outcome of those discussions before we run off on our own seeking to introduce legislation which probably will never happen given the process of enacting legislation in this country.</p><p>  I believe we should be diplomatic in our approach on this issue.  It is an important human rights issue which should not be dropped but kept alive.  However, we must balance this against the human rights of Irish citizens on the verge of adopting a child, which is important to them and their lives.  I beg caution from my colleagues, with a view to progressing this in a diplomatic way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700010#J00500"><p>I agree with Deputy Byrne.  I initially indicated a reluctance to support Senator Walsh's motion on the basis of the need to adopt as diplomatic an attitude as possible to this issue, notwithstanding the issues concerned.  I do so on the basis that one can achieve much through the diplomatic process.  I am not sure I agree with what has been said about the separation of powers in Russia, although  I am not familiar with the Russian constitution in that regard.  However, it is not our Constitution or jurisdiction.  While the situation that has developed may appear extraordinary to us, and it is, that is a different situation.</p><p>  The amendment states: '</p><p>      delete all words after &ldquo;Foreign Affairs and Trade&rdquo; and insert - <blockquote>-noting the tragic and untimely death in undisclosed and mysterious circumstances on 16th November 2009 of Mr Sergei Magnitsky, then aged 37;<br />-the passage of resultant legislation in other jurisdictions;... </blockquote>This has been already referenced in the motion proposed by Senator Walsh.  It continues:<blockquote>&quot;-the discussions in the European Parliament, the OSCE and the Council of Europe arising therefrom; <br />-calls on the Government to &ndash;-liaise with the Russian authorities with a view to seeking reassurance in relation to compliance with international human rights legislation;...&quot;</blockquote>This effectively means that there must be clarification that human rights principles are and have been adhered to and, if not, why not?  It continues:<blockquote>&quot;-ensure that any issues arising are fully investigated and a report provided for perusal by the international community;.....&quot;</blockquote>My reason for inserting that is to illustrate to the Russian authorities that this issue is for discussion internationally, whether or not they or we like it.  It has already been discussed in international fora and is a suitable subject for such discussion.  We cannot and will not condone human rights abuses of any nature.  We need to do everything possible in this regard.  The Russian authorities would not like us to in any way abuse the human rights entitlements of a Russian citizen in this jurisdiction.<br />The amendment continues:<blockquote>&quot;and<br />-calls on the Government to use its Presidency of the Council of the European Union to highlight its concern and that of the international community at the issues surrounding Mr. Magnitsky's death and the reiteration of its resolve to ensure a full and final report into the circumstances of the case.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></p> <p>That encompasses in different language the sentiments expressed by Senator Walsh in a way that is likely to provoke.  To a lesser extent, it calls on those to whom it is addressed to make a disclosure in the public arena on what happened.  The matter is not going to go away and we are not postponing it.  We are not in any way reducing the impact of what is involved or being dismissive.  It is important, particularly when dealing with a major power, to adopt a slightly different attitude because it would have the same effect, if not better.</p></speech>

I have expressed my concern about the proposal and asked for a response to be sought from the Russian ambassador.  Like other colleagues, I am surprised by his response.  It did not help the debate today.  If there are threats then we must step back from them.</p><p>  I second the proposal made by Deputy Durkan.  I examined the original proposal again which used strong language.  However, I do not have the information and accept, at face value, the claims made by the campaign.  I do not know that the call to impose an Irish Magnitsky law against all other gross human rights violators will happen.  I do not think that it will because such a provision would create many problems.  There are people involved in gross human rights violations all around the world.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan's proposal is more measured but it will not result in a lot of action.  It will probably not satisfy the people campaigning against the dreadful things that have happened to Mr. Magnitsky and the people that worked for him.  The proposal is more measured and that is why I lend it my support.  If the Deputy so desires, I can second his proposal.</p></speech>

I also signed Senator Walsh's motion.  I thought that its wording was a bit strong but I was prepared to go along with it.  I had heard a number of presentations at the Council of Europe so I knew about the situation before it was raised here.</p><p>  The letter is totally unhelpful.  The views of the committee should be made known to the ambassador but I do not want to create a diplomatic incident.  Sending a threatening letter to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade was less than helpful.  I want that sentiment conveyed to him in a way that will not create World War III.  The point must be made that the letter threatened inter-country adoptions.  I know about the issue because I am involved with a number of people who seek to adopt from Russia and I know how long they have had to wait.  Anything that would put a spanner in the works in regard to that process would be dreadful.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan's proposal must go further.  He used the term "seeking reassurance" but it could mean anything.  That provision will not give us the answers we seek and the same applies to the phrase "that any issues arising are fully investigated".  We know the issues and we know the issues we support are being investigated.  I shall step back from the latter issue but Deputy Durkan's proposal needs to be a little stronger.</p></speech>

His letter has been enormously effective because we now have a much diluted amendment that seeks very little specific action.</p><p>  I have no difficulty with Deputy O'Sullivan's comments.  I do not feel proprietorial about the matter.  I amended the motion in accordance with the wishes of some people to include the point made by Deputy Crowe, that was to make it applicable to all human rights violators.  Perhaps it was Deputy Eric Byrne who made the request.  </p></speech>

I do not mind what the wording is as long as something is added.  It might be a request to stop the posthumous trial.  A list of people must be produced.  Ultimately, if we do not take that route then we will be endorsing a situation where people can be murdered, their funds sequestered for personal advantage in Russia and then lodged abroad.  That is happening.  The recent debate on Cyprus, for example, clearly showed what is happening in Russia.  It showed the large sums of Russian money that are lodged in banks in Cyprus.  The same happens all over Europe and probably in America.  We need stronger wording in the amendment.  I have no difficulty supporting the amendment as long as it is meaty.  If not, then I shall put the amendment to a vote to act as a litmus test of the committee's commitment to human rights.  I do not take that stance lightly.</p></speech>

I regard the original motion as overly aggressive, condemnatory, conclusive and similar to the way in which a judge comes to a conclusion in court.  We are not in that format, we are not in session as a court and we do not have that authority.  It is a matter for the Russian authorities to respond to the motion and it will have the same effect through using different language.  By seeking reassurance, we are saying we want to know exactly what happened and how it is the authorities propose to answer.  That is what the motion means without spelling out that we will condemn Russian authorities for atrocities.  Approaching matters in that fashion will get us nowhere and will achieve nothing.  The purpose of the exercise is to achieve results.</p><p> I have no difficulty postponing the discussion to next week but, regardless of who is accused of abuse, we should take the best approach to achieve the maximum results from our point of view.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to meet members and update them on discussions at the Foreign Affairs Council in recent months.  As ever, the Council has a busy agenda and we dealt with a wide range of issues at our meetings in January, February and March.  We will be considering some of these again when we meet in Luxembourg next Monday.</p><p>  During the past couple of years, the issue which has undoubtedly received the closest and most sustained attention from the Council has been the political transformations in the Middle East and north Africa linked to the Arab spring.<b></b>While the crisis in Syria has understandably taken up much of our time, the Council has also addressed other issues in the region.  At our January meeting, for example, we conducted an important stock take in relation to the overall EU strategy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the process of transition which is under way in many Arab societies.</p><p>  A little over two years on from the popular uprisings which first took hold in Tunisia and Egypt in early 2011, any reasonable assessment must conclude that the process of change we are witnessing has been largely positive in its consequences for the region.  Of course, there have been many challenges and setbacks, with the conflict in Syria clearly presenting a major threat to peace and stability in the region.  However, this should not be allowed to overshadow the very real and positive changes we have seen, such as the holding of democratic elections in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen, effectively for the first time in most cases.</p><p>  The EU, for its part, is committed to upholding key values, such as respect for human rights and the rule of law, in the efforts it is making to provide support and partnership to the countries undergoing transition.</p> <p>The Middle East peace process was considered in some detail at both the January and February Councils.  Ministers reviewed developments following the appointment of Mr. John Kerry as US Secretary of State and the Israeli elections held on 22 January.  Injecting urgently needed momentum into the peace process and promoting the beginning of substantive negotiations between the two sides is a major priority for Ireland and the European Union as a whole.  In the three meetings I have had so far with the US Secretary of State I have strongly encouraged him in his efforts to get peace talks relaunched and promote confidence-building measures on both sides, particularly on the part of the new Israeli Government.  We must not ignore the continuing threats to the viability of the two-state solution and the increasingly narrow window of opportunity to make progress.  The Council urgently needs to review progress, if any, since the strong conclusions it adopted last May on the peace process and key viability issues such as settlements, area C and the continuing blockade of Gaza.  I hope it will be possible for such a review to take place next month at the May Council.</p></speech>

The political and security situation in Iraq is a cause for serious concern, with growing signs of sectarian tension and high levels of violence.  The April Council will adopt conclusions urging greater efforts at dialogue and cross-community co-operation on the part of all parties in Iraq and also supporting increased political dialogue between the EU and Iraq.</p><p>  High Representative Ashton is likely to brief us at next week's meeting on the most recent round of negotiations between the E3+3 and Iran, which took place in Almaty in Kazakhstan on 5 and 6 April.  The overall level of progress made on this issue so far has been disappointing.  Substantial differences remain between the E3+3 and Iran over the steps the Iranians must take to address our very serious concerns about the country's nuclear programme.  No date has yet been set for the next round of talks.  The reality is that the window for making progress is closing rapidly as the presidential elections in Iran, scheduled for June, draw ever nearer.</p><p>  As I indicated earlier, the horrendous situation in Syria has dominated the Council's proceedings in recent months.  It has been discussed at our three meetings so far this year as well as at the informal Foreign Affairs Ministers meeting that I co-hosted at Dublin Castle last month.</p> <p>Next Monday's Council will give us an opportunity to review developments since the Dublin meeting and continue our reflection on how the European Union can most effectively contribute to promoting a political settlement.  The scale of the humanitarian crisis raging in Syria and across the neighbouring region was brought home vividly to me when I visited a Syrian refugee camp on the Turkish-Syrian border during my visit to Turkey last week.  Over 70,000 people have died, more than 1.3 million are now refugees and over 4 million in Syria need humanitarian assistance.</p><p> Ireland and the European Union have been to the fore in responding to this major humanitarian crisis.  I was pleased to announce last week that Ireland was providing a further &euro;1 million in assistance for the International Committee of the Red Cross and UNHCR operations in Turkey.  This brings our total aid in the past year to &euro;8.15 million.  The generous and humane manner in which Syria's neighbours, particularly Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq, have dealt with the huge outflow of refugees from Syria must be acknowledged repeatedly.  The crisis is imposing major strain on hard-pressed resources and the ability of these countries to cope.  It underlines the urgent need for progress in ending the violence and putting some form of political process in place to set Syria on the path to political transition.</p><p> The European Union wants to promote the earliest possible political settlement in Syria.  All member states strongly support the efforts of the joint special representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, to find a political path forward based on the communiqu&eacute; agreed in Geneva last June.  Further violence would add to the misery and suffering in Syria and increase the real danger, emphasised by Mr. Brahimi when the Council met him last month, that Syria could collapse and possibly become a failed state in a highly volatile region.  Discussions are continuing at Council level on how the European Union can most effectively promote a political solution and use its considerable influence in that direction.  In February we renewed the full range of EU sanctions in place against the Assad regime in Syria for a period of three months.  A further decision on their renewal will be taken at the May Council.</p><p> I have made clear on a number of occasions that Ireland does not favour any action which could contribute to greater militarisation of the conflict.  This will continue to be our position.  There can be little doubt about the growing influence of extremist groups on the ground in Syria.  It is in all of our interests that the capacity in Syria for armed violence should not be augmented.  Instead, we should work to promote the earliest possible end to the conflict and the initiation of a political transition.  The UN Security Council can play a decisive role in supporting Mr. Brahimi's efforts and promoting a political settlement.  Accordingly, I urge all Council members to exercise responsibility and leadership by adopting a strong new resolution that will address issues such as a comprehensive arms embargo and the need for accountability.   Ireland firmly supports the efforts of the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, to investigate comprehensively any possible use of chemical weapons in Syria.</p><p> The threat that the conflict in Syria poses to overall regional stability and security is abundantly clear.  Lebanon has been hugely affected by the influx of some 300,000 Syrian refugees and outbursts of related violence in northern Lebanon.  Next week the Council is likely to review developments in that country following the resignation of the former Prime Minister, Najib Mikati, and the appointment of a new Prime Minister, Tammam Salam.  We must ensure Lebanon which has suffered for too long from being in Syria's shadow can avoid being drawn directly into the conflict.</p><p> Mali has been a high priority on the Council's agenda since the crisis there began in March 2012.  It was the subject of an extraordinary meeting on 17 January.  It was also discussed at the scheduled meetings in January, February and March and at the informal meetings of EU Development and Defence Ministers held in Dublin in February.  The response of the international community to the crisis has been strong and unified.  The European Union has played a significant role in addressing the political, security, developmental and economic aspects of the crisis.  It has been working to support the efforts of Mali's leaders and its people, in close co-ordination with regional partners and within the framework set out in a number of UN Security Council resolutions.  A political transition roadmap, including a timetable for elections and a process of national reconciliation, is now in place.  Our priority is to see the commitments made by the Malian parties fully implemented in order that Mali can return to peace and democracy quickly.  If this is to happen, the security situation must be stabilised.  This is being addressed through a combination of UN-backed international military interventions.  The Malian armed forces, supported by an African-led mission, AFISMA, are at the heart of this effort.  The European Union has established a training mission to train the Malian army in areas such as human rights and international humanitarian law.  Ireland is contributing eight personnel to that effort.  The European Union is also providing support for AFISMA.  The European Union decided during this quarter to resume development co-operation with Mali on a gradual basis to support the transition process, preparations for elections and the restoration of essential services.  The European Union's comprehensive approach spans the various transnational issues across the Sahel region.  It also features a strong response to the humanitarian needs of the people of Mali and neighbouring regions and emphasises the need to protect human rights.</p><p> Somalia is another African country that has been the subject of regular Council discussion.  The case of Somalia shows us how dangerous it can be when a state fails, as Somalia did in the early 1990s.  Such failure can threaten peace and security in the region and the wider world, for example, by facilitating the growth and spread of terrorism, piracy and criminality.  More positively, recent progress in Somalia shows that co-ordinated and comprehensive support and engagement from the international community, led in this case by the United Nations and the African Union and supported by the European Union and its member states, can help to end conflict, confront terrorism, criminality and human rights abuses and restore functioning governance institutions and service delivery.</p><p> After 20 years of anarchy and lawlessness, Somalia now has a unified national government, a President, a parliament and the basic structures of a state administration.  The European Union has been a significant actor in helping to make this happen through a holistic and comprehensive approach which, as we are seeing in Mali, encompasses the full range of EU instruments.  This includes the EU training mission for the Somalian army which has a significant Irish contingent and is commanded by an Irish officer, Brigadier General Gerard Ahern.  The situation in Somalia remains fragile.  There are real threats from the Al-Shabaab militia, including from terrorism originating outside Somalia.  Many Somalian people are still in refugee camps and many more continue to live in unstable and conflict affected areas, particularly in the south of the country.  Piracy remains a major challenge.  Significant political challenges also remain.  The rule of law and acceptable standards of human rights protection are far from being fully assured.  A huge amount of work will be needed if Somalia is to become a functioning democracy.</p><p> Russia was the subject of a brief discussion at the January Council when the EU High Representative, Catherine Ashton, reported on the outcome of the EU-Russia summit held in Brussels on 20 and 21 December 2012.  The summit saw positive developments in a number of areas, including technical and research co-operation and commitments on the Russian side to re-examine sensitive trade concerns.  Less progress was achieved on the new agreement, energy issues, human rights and the situation in Syria.  At the March Council Ministers engaged in a comprehensive discussion of the European Union's strategic relationship with Russia ahead of the discussion at that month's European Council.  There was a shared understanding among Ministers on the need to fashion a stronger and more coherent approach to Russia to the benefit of both sides.</p><p> It was suggested at the March Council that the relationship with Russia should be neither complacent nor adversarial, given that the European Union is Russia's largest trading partner and Russia is the European Union's largest energy supplier.  We work as partners in international forums in the pursuit of peace and security, including on Iran, Afghanistan, counter-terrorism and the Middle East peace process.  The relationship is built on a complex institutional framework that enables both sides to engage in regular political dialogue.  Russia is the only partner with which the European Union holds a summit in each Presidency.  Co-operation has been further enhanced by the partnership for modernisation process which addresses economic and social issues, as well as the rule of law.  As in any important relationship, there are issues where our interests and the values that define these interests differ.  In March Ministers discussed how best to communicate to Russia in a frank and constructive manner our concerns about worrying developments in respect of political pluralism and human rights in that country.</p><p> The eastern neighbourhood policy will be discussed at next Monday's Council.  Specifically, the progress made in the eastern partnership negotiations since the discussion in February will be reviewed.</p> <p>The purpose of the eastern partnership is to provide a coherent framework for co-operation with the six European neighbourhood policy countries of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.  In practical terms the eastern partnership means the conclusion of association agreements, AA, and free trade agreements, DCFTA, with each of the Eastern neighbourhood countries.</p><p> We had a comprehensive discussion in January on EU-US relations in the wake of President Obama's re-election and in particular on the priorities the EU should take forward with the new Administration.  In this context, the proposed EU-US free trade agreement was identified as a key priority for 2013.  I am pleased to report that significant progress has already been achieved with the decision of 13 February last by EU and US leaders to launch negotiations in the coming months.  Last month, the European Commission agreed a draft negotiating mandate which is currently being considered by member states and on which we aim to reach agreement by the time of the June (Trade) FAC before the end of Ireland's Presidency.  In this regard, both the Taoiseach and I took the opportunity during our recent visit to Washington DC for St. Patrick's Day to reiterate the Government's commitment, as EU Presidency, to work for approval of the negotiating mandate before the end of our Presidency.</p><p> Burma-Myanmar has undergone an important and long-awaited transformation in the past 18 months or so.  My EU partners and I have been very encouraged by the manner in which the situation has greatly improved and Ireland has always remained ready to respond positively to genuine progress towards democratisation and respect for human rights.  We do, however, recognise the need to encourage further reforms and address certain ongoing issues such as the status and welfare of the Rohingya and achieving a ceasefire in Kachin or in relation to political prisoners.</p><p> At the Foreign Affairs Council in April last year, my EU colleagues and I decided to suspend all sanctions, bar the arms embargo and the embargo on equipment which might be used for internal repression, against Burma.  This decision was the result of protracted and complex negotiations. This suspension applies until 30 April 2013 and, therefore, we need to decide a further way forward at the forthcoming Foreign Affairs Council.  It is proposed that the restrictive measures are not renewed after 30 April 2013, with the exception of the arms embargo and the embargo on equipment which might be used for internal repression.  Ireland agrees with this proposal.</p><p> In recent months, I am pleased to announce that Ireland has accredited its first ambassador to Burma-Myanmar - our ambassador based in Hanoi presented his credentials to President Thein Sein on 28 January.  It is expected that the Burma-Myanmar ambassador in London will present credentials to President Higgins later this year.  We look forward to working towards developing good foundations for our bilateral relationship with Burma-Myanmar in a balanced way which addresses the need to foster trade and development links.</p><p> At the March Council, High Representative Ashton updated us on preparations for the EU Japan summit that had been scheduled to take place in Tokyo on 25 March.  We also had a short discussion on the content of the draft joint statement.  While the envisaged summit in Tokyo subsequently had to be postponed, it was agreed that the trade negotiations would commence this week.</p><p> Last July the European Commission asked the Council for a mandate to negotiate a free trade agreement, FTA, which it estimates has the potential to boost the economy of the EU by about 0.8% of gross domestic product.  Ireland welcomes the opening of these negotiations. The aim of the free trade agreement would be a comprehensive agreement in goods, services and investment eliminating tariffs, non-tariff barriers and covering other trade-related issues, such as public procurement, regulatory issues, competition and sustainable development. The Trade Foreign Affairs Council in November 2012 agreed a negotiating mandate for the EU Commission to allow the formal opening of negotiations of an EU-Japan free trade agreement. Allied to these negotiations is that of a framework agreement, sometimes called a comprehensive agreement, which would deal with political dialogue and political co-operation as well as co-operation on regional and global matters.</p><p> Next Monday's Foreign Affairs Council meeting will consider the foreign policy dimension of the EU's energy policy, following on from a discussion last July and taking account of the energy security dimension to the High Representative's role.  Issues relating to energy sources and supply routes will be a continuing factor in the EU's foreign and security policy so long as global energy demand continues to increase and supply continues to be concentrated in regions afflicted by political instability.  The increase in tensions relating to access to the Strait of Hormuz earlier this year and the more recent targeting of the Amenas gas field in Algeria by Islamic militants, bear testimony to this.</p><p> I expect the discussion on Monday to focus specifically on issues relating to the Southern Gas Corridor, a strategic project to open a new gas supply route from the Caspian Sea area to the EU.  This area holds the largest concentration of conventional gas resources, and could create an alternative to Russia gas imports to the EU.  As a small peripheral European energy market it is of crucial importance for Ireland that the EU has a strong and co-ordinated policy on energy which safeguards supplies for all member states.</p><p> While not on the agenda of Monday's Foreign Affairs Council, it is my intention to bring to the attention of EU Foreign Ministers the important messages which emerged from this week's conference on hunger, nutrition and climate justice, which I hosted together with Mary Robinson.  The Conference brought together representatives of communities facing the realities of rising food prices, failed crops and under-nutrition with global leaders, policy makers and scientists.  We must ensure that our future policy approaches are firmly rooted in the reality of lives and in objective evidence of what has worked and what has not.</p><p> I would be happy to address any questions the committee might have.</p></speech>

He has a very comprehensive agenda for the meeting in Luxembourg on Monday.  I am delighted he is bringing to the meeting the proposals agreed at the conference on hunger, nutrition and climate change.  I also want to be associated with the humanitarian assistance given by Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq.  Turkey has an important role to play in the region as the Minister saw for himself last week.  It is good that it has re-established diplomatic relations with Israel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.565" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700017#R00300"><p>I also welcome the T&aacute;naiste's very comprehensive statement.  In regard to his concluding remarks, I welcome the fact that the conference on hunger, nutrition and climate change was successful and commend the Department and the Mary Robinson Foundation on their initiative in hosting the conference.  We all welcome communiqu&eacute;s and declarations.  It is the follow-up and the action, needed by so many international powers of major countries, that is vital.</p><p>  In regard to World Trade Organization talks, trade is part of the Minister's brief.  I note that the European Commissioner for trade is Commissioner de Gucht.   Does the need to conclude a plenary level WTO agreement feature in the Council of Foreign Ministers in view of the fact that it is important for the developing countries and from a development co-operation point of view?  We had the opportunity during Question Time on Holy Thursday to deal with most of the issues covered.  </p><p>  I wish to reflect on the situation in Syria.  Some 70,000 lives have been lost and there are a million refugees.  It is a desperate situation that needs the utmost consideration and whatever can be done must be done.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has provided additional humanitarian aid.  One of the concerns expressed by some of the groups who take a particular interest in that region is that the aid will not reach the people most in need.  There have been allegations that the humanitarian aid has been going in disproportionate measures to supporters of the Assad regime.  That is an important issue that should be dealt with and we need to get a message out that humanitarian aid provided by the taxpayer and the international community is reaching the people most in need and is not being abused by the supporters of one particular regime.   Russia's role continues to remain crucial.  Is there any sense of amelioration in its attitude?  The Minister made a statement here which I welcome that: "Ireland does not favour any actions which could contribute to greater militarisation in the conflict."  It is important to keep reiterating that particular view and policy of the Government and, hopefully, of the European Union also.</p><p>  In regard to the Middle East peace process, I am pleased there has been a greater engagement by the US since President Obama's re-election.</p> <p>Secretary of State, John Kerry, has visited the region three times since his recent appointment to his position.  The European Union must continue to reiterate the need for genuine negotiations on a two-state solution and the involvement of the United States and the European Union in these negotiations is crucial.  In the meetings with the Secretary of State, did he give the T&aacute;naiste any indication of hope for advancing the process?  It might not be possible for him to do that at this early stage, but I am sure that because of his long-standing interest in foreign relations and his long-standing work in Congress he gave some indication of his view. </p><p> With regard to EU-US relations and the proposed trade deal, we would welcome that.  However, from the point of view of Ireland and the European Union, some vital areas need to be protected.  I refer in particular to some of our food products, particularly beef. </p><p> I understand European Union enlargement is an issue that will be discussed at the next Foreign Affairs Council.  An issue I raised previously has been brought to my attention again by some interest groups who are advocates for Bosnia.  A message that has come across forcefully to me in correspondence and through phone calls is that Ireland should advocate that the European Union conduct a reassessment of its approach in Bosnia.  These people state that the current strategy is not working, but I do not have the knowledge to say how accurate is their assessment or whether this view is common in other member states.  One of the phrases in common use in statements from the T&aacute;naiste and Department over the years concerns the importance of "local ownership".  Representations made to me indicate that all significant power in Bosnia is concentrated among six political party leaders and it has been suggested these people are not accountable to their citizens.  Is there any sense there is a need for a reassessment of European Union policy for that region?  We are aware of the disastrous situation that pertained there in the 1990s and that political progress has not been made.  This view comes across strongly from people and groups with a particular interest in that region.  If it is not possible for the T&aacute;naiste to give a comprehensive response on this today, will he return to the committee at some stage and outline his views and those of the Departments on any emerging trends in the European Union in this regard?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700018#S00300"><p>I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in the negotiations and discussions to come.  He faces a difficult task with regard to the areas he must cover and I wish him well.  He began his speech by referring to the Middle East, the Palestinian situation in particular, and spoke about injecting urgently needed momentum into the peace process and discussions relating to it.  A position was adopted at a Council meeting 12 months ago in the context of settlement goods and strong conclusions were reached.  Now, 12 months later there have been announcements relating to a further escalation of settlement colonies.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe it is time to return to the issue of the settlement goods and a potential ban on those goods?  Is it possible that would bring about political momentum and raise awareness?  What specific steps will Ireland take to build on the call for an EU-wide ban on settlement goods and how will it progress action at the May Foreign Affairs Council meeting?</p><p>  With regard to Syria, the T&aacute;naiste mentioned he went through some of the refugee camps in neighbouring countries.  We are aware that prior to conflict breaking out in Syria, these countries had more than 1 million refugees from Iraq, Palestinian refugees and others.  These populations now face a new phase of difficulties.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the use of chemical weapons and expressed concern that it is possible they will be used.  Did the use of rape in the Syrian and other conflicts arise in discussions and will that issue be addressed?  In the case of Syria in particular, rape continues to be used by both sides and seems to be an almost institutionalised method used to break prisoners.  I presume this was part of the T&aacute;naiste's discussion with refugees.  What can Ireland do with regard to this?  We can certainly condemn the use of rape, but are there any active measures we can take on it?</p><p> The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the Irish Aid hunger-nutrition-climate justice conference.  What specific actions can the Government take to follow up on its recommendations?  The T&aacute;naiste said he will raise the issue, but what specific recommendations will he put to the meeting in response to the challenges outlined by President Higgins in his opening address, which focused on the detrimental impact of large scale land acquisitions, biofuel production and speculation in food commodities?</p><p> The T&aacute;naiste also spoke about the sectarian element that keeps breaking out in many areas of conflict.  Many of the countries in question are moving from secular societies towards fundamentalism.  Is there any policy with regard to support for those groups looking for change?  Have we a view on that?  What I would like to see emerging in many of these areas is a secular society where people are not discriminated against because of their religion, their gender, their sexual orientation or the colour of their skin.  Will this issue ever be discussed on the agenda of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in Europe?</p><p>  With regard to the multiannual financial framework, MFF, negotiations to ensure that member states renew their commitment to 0.7% of GNI in aid, how will these commitments be met?  What matters will be raised in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700018#S00400"><p>There is enough material in those questions for another long speech, but I will try to be brief.  I thank Deputies Smith and Crowe for their compliments regarding the hunger-nutrition-climate justice conference and they both asked what we will do to carry forward on that.  This was a very different conference because we designed it so there would be participation by people from grassroots level in developing countries like Malawi and we could bring together smallholders and people working on farms - some 80% of which were headed by women - and we linked together the themes of climate justice, hunger and nutrition.</p><p>  We can talk about these issues at international conferences which are based on expert reports and scientific research, but this conference was an opportunity to talk about these issues through the lens and eyes of people experiencing the issues directly in their daily lives and that was the strength of the conference.  The responsibility Ireland has taken on as a country arising from the conference is that we will take the messages from that conference to the international community.  I will take those messages next Monday to the Foreign Affairs Council.  We are also working with the United Kingdom and a number of agencies to put together a nutrition summit in London.</p> <p>In June we will take the issue there.  We are involved in a meeting with the United States and with Concern in Washington which will feed into the G8 summit, due to take place in Fermanagh in June.  We are also going to use what we learned at that conference to influence our approach to the review of the millennium development goals.  A high-level event will take place at the United Nations General Assembly in September on that review.  Ireland has responsibility for this at the moment and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, is chairing the group of EU development ministers preparing for the review.  This is highly significant because over 50% of all the development aid money in the world comes from the EU so its role in regard to development aid and how it is directed and the things that are addressed is very important.  That is how we intend to continue that work.</p><p> Deputy Smith asked about the Foreign Affairs Council and trade.  There is a trade formation of the Foreign Affairs Council, which is attended by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and separately, there is a development formation of the Foreign Affairs Council, which the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, attends.  There is very close co-operation between the two in respect of trade issues as they affect developing countries.</p><p> In response to Deputy Smith's comments, when I was in Geneva recently I discussed with the head of the Red Cross some of the practical difficulties in getting aid through to the people who need it in Syria.  We work with several NGOs, one of which is GOAL, whose current head is the former Minister, Barry Andrews.  He was in Syria recently and I spoke with him after his visit.  It is doing a lot of work in that regard and we talked about some of the difficulties faced by the organisation.  I had the opportunity when I was in Turkey of discussing that issue with the foreign Minister and the people I met there.  We continue to maintain discussions with Russia in respect of its approach to Syria.  It is encouraging that President Putin has spoken recently about a willingness to suspend all arms sales to Syria, and bilaterally and through the European Union we are continuing to maintain dialogue with Russia on this issue.</p><p> On the Middle East peace process, there is once again a window of opportunity.  The American elections are over and there is a new government in Israel.  I have had three discussions with the American Secretary of State, John Kerry, about this and I am greatly encouraged by his willingness to make a renewed effort and initiative in the Middle East peace process.  It is important to say that we do not want to create false expectations in respect of what may happen.  There have been many false dawns with regard to peace talks in the Middle East and some of those who have participated in them will say that for 20 years there have been talks happening or about to happen, yet nothing happens.  The Secretary of State has a very realistic approach to what may or may not be achieved.  The important point is that he and President Obama have been willing to engage in this.  In Turkey last week I spoke with the Turkish foreign minister, Mr. Davutoğlu, who had also just met the Secretary of State to discuss his next visit to the Middle East.  The European Union, through the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, has been very much involved in this.  There is renewed effort on the part of the European Union, the United States, Turkey and other interested countries - the Quartet - to make progress in the Middle East.  It is important that we are realistic about it and that, while the effort is made, false hopes are not created.</p><p> In respect of the EU-US trade deal, we have to get agreement on the negotiating mandate and we hope that will happen at the trade formation of the Foreign Affairs Council in June.  Nobody is under any illusion about the difficulty of concluding an agreement when we get into the detail on a sectoral basis and the regulations on both sides of the Atlantic.  There is a very important ambition here and we know there is huge potential to expand the economies of the European Union and the United States in respect of that trade deal.  One of the issues I discussed in Turkey was the customs union agreement between Turkey and the EU.  It is important to include that dimension of the transatlantic arrangement in the discussions.</p><p> Ireland supports Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU perspective and we welcome the fact that this was reaffirmed in the December 2012 Council conclusions on enlargement.  It is, however, important to remember that enlargement is a conditional process.  Prospective EU members must implement the reforms and meet the criteria required.  There can be no exemptions or special conditions for any country.  The Bosnian Government and political leaders must make real and sustained progress in order to realise the country's EU perspective.  What is required is clearly laid out in the December Council conclusions and in the June 2012 roadmap agreed by the Commission and Bosnia and Herzegovina's leaders.  Unfortunately, the timetable for implementing the roadmap has slipped.  &Scaron;tefan F&uuml;le, the Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, was in Bosnia and Herzegovina last week to underline to their institutional and political leaders how urgent it is to implement the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Sejdić and Finci.  He had originally planned to hold a meeting of the high level dialogue on EU accession but cancelled this due to lack of progress on implementation of the Sejdić and Finci ruling.  This lack of progress is frustrating.  While we will do everything in our power to encourage movement on the path to EU integration, this is ultimately a matter for the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The EU can encourage Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue their efforts on reform but it cannot impose a solution.  I note that the EU is due to review its policy on Bosnia and Herzegovina in September of this year with a view to examining what further progress can be made.</p><p> I spoke about some of the issues Deputy Crowe mentioned, particularly Syria and the climate justice conference, in my earlier contributions.</p></speech>

I know that he welcomed the opportunity to visit Turkey last week and to enhance trade and cultural relations with Turkey.  He has acknowledged the important role that Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq are playing in the Syrian crisis and in accommodating refugees from Syria.  I thank those countries too.  I recently visited Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, which was an eye-opening experience.  The Turkish Government and people daily demonstrate their generosity and humanity in providing support to their Syrian neighbours caught up in the conflict.</p><p>  The Minister referred to issues around settlements, Area C and the Gaza blockade and the very strong Foreign Affairs Council statement on those issues last May.  That was 12 months ago, yet we are still in a state of suspended animation in regard to the process.</p> <p>The Minister has indicated he is hopeful there is a window of opportunity emerging, given that the elections in Israel and the US are completed.  I note he has engaged comprehensively with the Secretary of State, John Kerry, in regard to the Middle East peace process.  Time is of the essence and it is not on our side.  There is an opportunity which will only happen once in a generation to deal comprehensively with some of the issues.  There is a necessity for the United States to be involved and to provide an initiative.  Will the Minister agree there is also an opportunity, as the European external action service evolves, for the European Union to play a much stronger enhanced role in moving the process forward?  We have a moral and ethical responsibility to engage as best and as forcefully as we can.  </p><p> I refer to Deputy Crowe's remarks about settlement produce which is an issue of concern to the committee.  The Minister has stated his position with regard to settlement produce.  What are the prospects for an Irish ban on settlement produce or an EU-wide ban?  There is conflicting legal advice on the capacity of individual states and the European Union to operate such a ban.  However, it is the firm view of this committee that it would send a very strong signal to Israel about the position being taken by the Irish people and by this committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.574" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700020#U00200"><p>I will not go back over some of the points raised by other speakers.  I was able to attend the conference in Dublin Castle for most of the two days.  The speech given by President Michael D. Higgins on Monday morning set the tone for the conference.  It was a most powerful and passionate speech on inequality.  He did not mince his words as to where the fault lies.  The big powers must be taken on board if we are to address the issue of equality and inequality.</p><p>  The conference heard from local community voices such as those of fishermen, farmers, pastoralists and women.  They are amazing people considering what they are dealing with in their countries.  Their desire for and achievement of empowerment is very powerful.  The other message at the conference was that without the political will, no amount of empowerment will achieve anything.  It was notable to hear from speakers from all the global organisations, including former US Vice President, Al Gore, that Ireland is held in great respect.  </p><p>  I accept what the Minister says about overseas development aid but we cannot give with one hand and take away with the other.  I refer to his commitment to a 5% cap on bio-fuels.  This needs to be taken on board right across Europe because otherwise we are undermining what happened at that conference yesterday.  The President's speech was also very forceful about the small number of companies that control certain commodities such as food and confectionery.  I mentioned the tax issue previously and I know positive moves are being made.  I hope these will go further.  If the conference is to have any meaning, we have to be very proactive in what we want from it.</p><p>  Earlier today the committee had a very disturbing presentation from a member of the lesbian and gay community in Uganda.  The presentation highlighted the need for careful and considered diplomacy.  Ireland is good at such diplomacy.  I ask if we can promote this careful and considered diplomacy with regard to gay rights in Uganda.  The committee recently had a presentation from a group from the Democratic Republic of Congo.  It was frightening to hear about the increase in incidences of rape of young girls and women and also of young boys and young men.  Can these issues be raised by means of careful and considered diplomacy with government leaders in those countries?  The armies in those countries are involved in these crimes of rape.  It could be because the soldiers are not being paid.  In my view, there are plenty of dots to be joined up.</p><p>  The Minister referred to the positive aspects of the Arab Spring but there are very disturbing accounts coming from those countries of the disimprovement in the status of women.  Instead of access to education and employment and the right to go where they please, the situation for women is worse since the Arab Spring.  I would not like us to lose sight of that reality.</p><p>  I refer to the positive moves with regard to Cuba.  A US delegation recently visited the country.  The delegation made the point that the US does not wish to deal with a one-party state but it is very happy to trade with Vietnam which is also a one-party state.  I do not see why the policy cannot be applied to Cuba.  I ask if Ireland can play a supportive role with regard to Cuba.  The Labour Party supported it in the past.</p></speech>

I have about five questions but I will try to hit the nail on the head and stop the waffle.  The Minister mentioned the Arab Spring, the wonderful revolutions in the Arab world.  Is he conscious of the reputed difficulties being experienced by the Coptic Christians in Egypt?  I refer to US Secretary of State, John Kerry's visit to the Holy Land and to Israel.  We have met with Arab Christian leaders of the Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox religions.  They were very unimpressed by the Secretary of State's presence in Israel, in so far as they were of the view that he was reinforcing the concept of the Jewish State.  As Arab Christians, they feel terribly under threat and their populations are being squeezed out.  They believe they are deemed to be second-class citizens in the Jewish state.  Is the Minister aware of the concerns of the Coptic Christians?</p><p>  The Gaza strip is currently controlled by Hamas which is imposing an Islamic form of education including the segregation of boys and girls at a certain age.  This is being done in the interest of establishing the cultural rights of those who believe in Islam.  The Jews are creating a Jewish State, an Islamic region is being created in the Gaza strip and the Christians - Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox - are feeling very squeezed out.  </p><p>  The Minister's comments about Russia are very interesting.  He said that less progress was achieved on the new agreement centred around energy and human rights:<blockquote>  However, as in any important relationship, there are issues where our interests, and indeed the values that define those interests, differ, and in March, Ministers discussed how best to communicate to Russia, in a frank and constructive manner, its concerns about worrying developments in respect of political pluralism and human rights within the country.</blockquote> This morning the committee was addressing the Magnitsky case.  We asked for an opinion from the Russian ambassador.  I will read the a portion of the response we received from him:  <blockquote>Unfortunately, the group of parliamentarians who initiated consideration of questions concerning the Magnitsky Act at the Irish Parliament took for a basis only naked assertions by the person who committed a number of economic crimes in the territory of the Russian Federation.  This approach certainly will not enrich bilateral Russian-Irish relations and can have negative influence on the negotiations on the adoption agreement between Russia and Ireland being progressed.  </blockquote></p> <p>When we discuss a human rights issue like the Magnitsky case we are not attacking Russia <i>per se</i>.  We are dealing with a human rights issue.  It might be appropriate for the witnesses to convey to the Russians that, as parliamentarians, we take an interest in human rights issues across the globe.</p><p> The conference on hunger, nutrition and climate justice was important.  I attended most of it and renewed contacts with many people from around the world, including people from Afghanistan, a woman from Niger whose interest is in the pastoralists, cattle people travelling across Niger, Nepalese from the villages in the middle of the jungle, and Mongolians who almost got lost on the way to the Cliffs of Moher but arrived back safely.  I renewed contact also with Masai tribespeople whom I knew when I lived in Africa, and the pastoralists who are very concerned about their rights in terms of moving cattle across land owned either by the state or game reserves.</p><p> In terms of where we go from here, it was a remarkably successful conference.  Everyone who attended was in awe of the work being done both by the T&aacute;naiste's Ministry and Mary Robinson.  Many of the debates were on where we go from here and the issue of the millennium goals, which will expire in 2015.  We are examining the European development budget and the question of the United Nations starting a new round of development goals.  I congratulate the witnesses on their intention to bring to the attention of the foreign ministers the important messages that emerged from the conference.  They are now doing what the pastoralists and the advocates for the hungry and the poor wanted raised through the various political tiers.  I thank them for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.578" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Senator David Norris" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013041700021#V00200"><p>I am pleased to welcome the T&aacute;naiste and to congratulate him on a number of successes, including the hunger, nutrition and climate justice conference.  I have a question on that.  I was not able to attend the conference - I was abroad - but I am very interested in it.  Was the issue of population raised at the conference, because it underlies everything?  People are notoriously shy about raising it, partly because religious leaders of various kinds seem to want to assert the dominant right to breed more members for their various creeds.  The world population is the single most dramatic change in my lifetime, and it underlies all these issues.  When I was in Trinity it was 3 billion.  By the time I will have croaked it, it will probably be 9 billion.  That is a threefold increase in one short human lifetime.  The planet cannot sustain it.  It is no wonder there are water shortages, tensions over other resources and so on.  Regardless of what way people massage the issue, the planet cannot support that number of people.</p><p>  I am delighted when I hear of a decline in the population in Europe and North America, the advanced countries, because we are the ones that do the most damage and are the most greedy for resources.  That is not an anti-sub-Saharan Africa position; it is much better when the numbers go down.  Was there any prominent mention of that, because the UN global population report never once in my experience ever mentioned that?  Female genital mutilation, the education of local tribal people and civilians caught up in conflict are very important issues, but they do not mention population, and it is so important.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe has reminded me about the situation in Syria where there are more than 1 million refugees.  The report to us speaks passionately about that.  Apparently, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has replied to a parliamentary question submitted by Deputy Crowe to the effect that we will resettle 30 Syrian refugees in Ireland in 2013.  Are the witnesses aware of the progress that has been made in that matter?</p><p>  Coming from the climate conference it is a great tribute to the former President, Mary Robinson, that she has been appointed to this significant position with regard to the Great Lakes region, including the Congo in particular.  Can the T&aacute;naiste give any indication as to the degree of support we will be able to give her there, because it is very important?  This committee, and the Seanad, have passed resolutions on violence, particularly sexual violence, in areas like the Congo.</p><p>  I am glad the issue of Uganda was raised.  It was an impressive report from a young woman who has been threatened.  She was a friend of David Kato of Front Line Defenders who some of us met in Dublin Castle.  He was subsequently murdered at the instigation of the media and the Christian churches in that country.  I know there is a problem in Britain at the moment, which was referred to by Deputy Crowe also, but I remember dealing with a number of cases, for example, where under the former Administration, not the T&aacute;naiste's Government, people were sent back to Iran by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on the basis that they could hide their sexuality.  People were returned to Iraq and Nigeria or other such countries on the basis that if they chose the right part of the country, they could survive reasonably well.  I would hate to think this would happen here.  Are there any such cases?  What is the status here and what would be the Government's attitude, because it is crystal clear that people are being murdered in Uganda as a result of their sexual orientation?  I commend the T&aacute;naiste on the brave work he has done in this area and I encourage him to continue it.</p><p>  There might be a possibility, since the Papal Nuncio is the doyen of the parliamentary-----</p></speech>

In that case I will leave it.  I am glad the Chairman reminded me of that but the T&aacute;naiste might not erase what I said from his memory.</p><p>  The United States is a great ally and so on.  I have great feelings of warmth towards the United States but it is a very hybrid place, particularly in the view of what constitutes human rights.  It has been disappointing to see the Obama Administration not living up to the claims that were made by it beforehand.  In particular, what does the T&aacute;naiste think about the complete suspension of the right to trial by the United States in its foreign adventures, particularly the use of drone attacks?  Will any attempt be made by the European Union, Ireland or another country to indicate that the assassination of groups of people in the hopes of hitting somebody who is associated with al-Qaeda or those sort of people is not-----</p></speech>

That is what we are told.  That is the reason we are all mixed up together.  This is a very important point and I ask the T&aacute;naiste if there is comfort in Europe at the idea that people can be taken out by a decision in a basement in the White House on a Tuesday morning or whenever, and it does not matter if they are women or children.</p><p>  My final question is on Palestine, Israel and the questioning of labelling.  The T&aacute;naiste explained his difficulties previously and I think he indicated that he might be able to consider the question of labelling.  Has there been any advance in that regard?</p></speech>

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and compliment him on the positive stand he and our ambassador to the UN took regarding the arms trade treaty.  I very much welcome his commitment to the ratification of that treaty.  In terms of much of what is contained in his report, there are implications for the arms trade treaty <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> conflict areas and people being persecuted.</p><p>  In his address the T&aacute;naiste spoke about Tunisia, Egypt, the Middle East in general and the positive effects of the Arab Spring.  Deputy Byrne alluded to the Coptic Christians in Egypt, and we have seen that on our television screens.</p> <p>Right across those countries, many religious minorities have been persecuted or killed.  Many have had to flee their countries.  I do not get a sense that this ranks as high on our priority list as the gay issue.  It should because it represents a very significant breach of human rights.  Religious freedom and freedom of conscience comprise one of the fundamental human rights issues.  I do not get any sense that this is being accorded the priority it should be accorded.  I agree with Senator Norris.  We talked about Uganda today.  Members of this committee were concerned about the manner in which homosexuals are being treated there but I would like to see the same emphasis on small minority Christian communities that have been living in the Middle East for over 2,000 years.</p><p> I wish to raise the issue of Syria, particularly the need to have a negotiated agreement there.  Deputy Nash raised the question of Lebanon, which is badly affected.  We saw at first hand the circumstances there.  I am appalled by the manner in which refugees from Syria are being disadvantaged in Lebanon and by the strain this is putting on the whole Lebanese structure.  It has the potential to cause instability, which the T&aacute;naiste recognises.  The message we got from the people is that a negotiated settlement is the way to go; otherwise there will be protracted conflict within Syria, which will have a fallout effect in neighbouring countries, and particularly for Palestinians, a persecuted minority in the area.</p><p> I very much welcome the fact that the T&aacute;naiste is encouraging the US Secretary of State John Kerry to try to do something more constructive than has been done in recent years by the United States in Israel.  As rightly stated, there is a window of opportunity, but it is narrowing, as identified.  Many people we meet are concerned about the potential for a two-state solution given what is happening.  We have supported the right of the Palestinians to their homeland.  We had religious leaders in Leinster House last week and we met them informally.  One of the issues they identified was the need for progress to be made.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan was beside me at the informal meeting.  The leaders showed maps of Palestinian lands in the years 1948, 1967 and today.  The area has been whittled down to very little.  I respect fully that there is a need in a negotiated settlement to recognise the rights of Israel to have secure borders and to have its citizens protected.  However, the latter should not continue to be an excuse for the taking of no action.</p><p> Deputy Byrne raised the Sergei Magnitsky case.  At EU level, what is happening with regard to that case?  It seems there is a very serious and fundamental breach of human rights.  Much of what happened in resect of the case is of concern to civil society in Russia.  Magnitsky was a lawyer.  We talk a lot at meetings of this committee-----</p></speech>

Is it up for discussion as part of the bilateral discussions with Russia?  This is very pertinent given our interest in the case.</p><p>  The final issue I wish to raise concerns Iraq and Iran.  At a dinner three years ago at which Mr. Dick Cheney was present, I had the opportunity to raise the Iraq-Iran situation.  Mr. Cheney conceded that Iran was a bigger threat than Iraq.  The intervention by the United States and the United Kingdom in Iraq was strongly criticised by many Members in these Houses.  The states that intervened now have a responsibility not to leave Iraq as the basket case it seems to be turning into.  Many Members present, including some of my colleagues, predicted this would happen.  I ask that this be pursued at EU level because there is an absolute responsibility on the United States and the United Kingdom to ensure Iraq is left in at least no worse a condition than it was in when they entered or, if possible, a better condition.</p></speech>

We are having discussions with the European Parliament and Commission.  I was in Brussels last week and there was an informal meeting with representatives of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, under the Irish Presidency, on the MFF.  We intend to have further discussion at the meeting of the General Affairs Council next week and a further round of discussions with both the Parliament and Commission.</p><p>  There are major issues we have to overcome, including the Parliament's approach to the MFF itself.  Also of concern is the 2013 budget.  The budget proposed for development assistance represents an increase on the previous allocation.  The figure is not as high as originally proposed by the Commission but, given that the Union, as an institution, and the member states allocate over 50% of all development aid in the world, it is very high.  We are working on this and it is a great priority for us.  There will be a lot of work.  I will be happy to report further on it, probably to the Joint Committee on European Affairs or this one.</p><p>  Tackling the issues of rape in conflict, violence against women and girls, and gender-based violence is a long-standing priority for Ireland.  Rape is a terrible violation of human rights.  The issue is raised regularly by us at multilateral fora and directly with states.  We provide direct support for tackling the issue through Irish Aid.</p><p>  The issue of settlements and settlement produce was raised by Deputy Crowe and a number of others.  I wrote to this committee last November setting out in detail my view on settlement goods.  I support the view that place-of-origin labelling should not allow settlement goods to be misrepresented as coming from Israel or as being Palestinian, as the case may be.  My Department has carried informal advice on these lines on its website for some years.  I am considering how formal voluntary guidelines might be issued.  Ideally it would be at EU level.  There is work taking place on this.  With a group of colleagues, I recently wrote to Baroness Ashton to welcome her initiative in proposing to produce EU labelling guidelines and to encourage her in that regard.  She has written to member states setting out proposals in regard to guidelines that could be applied at EU level.  I am involved in consultation with other Departments on how we might address this.  Progress is being made on it.</p> <p> Deputy Crowe asked about the referral of Syria to the International Criminal Court.  We have asked the UN Security Council to refer the issue of Syria to the ICC and inform the court to carry out an investigation.  We want to put down a strong marker that there will have to be accountability for the slaughter in Syria and the huge abuse of human rights there.  I jointly wrote an article with the foreign Ministers of Austria, Denmark and Slovenia pressing for this and it was carried widely in the international media.</p><p> On the issue of the May conclusions on the Middle East peace process, the Foreign Affairs Council intends to discuss that process at the May Council meeting.  It will review what has happened since the conclusions were drawn up last year.  I have been urging this for some time.  It has been Ireland's view, which I have consistently argued for at the Foreign Affairs Council, that the EU should be taking a leading role on the Middle East peace process.  The EU is in a position to do that and we are less dependent on the electoral cycle than, for example, the United States.  The US Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry, and I had quite a long discussion about ways in which the EU and US can co-operate in the approach we are taking to the Middle East peace process.  We can have a more active role by the EU and a more co-ordinated role with the US.  As we all know, however, it is a problem that has been intractable for a long time.  The important things are the commitment and the political will, which I know exists, to try to address it in a serious and consistent way.</p><p> A number of Deputies raised the issue of the rights of gay people, with particular reference to Uganda.  The debate on LGBTI rights remains polarised at international level.  In some countries, the rights of LGBTI persons are met with outright opposition, in some cases with absolute disdain, sometimes on cultural and religious grounds.  Ireland has played its part in promoting those rights.</p><p> In June 2011, the UN Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 1719 on human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity.  That was an historic achievement and the first time the UN had voted to state explicitly that the protection afforded by human rights law applied also to LGBTI persons.  Although Ireland was not a member of the Human Rights Council at that time, we were engaged in drafting the resolution and co-sponsoring it.</p><p> As part of our EU Presidency we are working to develop new EU guidelines on the rights of LGBTI persons.  These guidelines will guide the work of the EU and its member states internationally to promote the rights of LGBTI persons.  Our embassies overseas are also active in supporting the work with human rights defenders who are active on the issue.  We have also made it a priority for our work on the Human Rights Council.</p><p> Specifically with regard to Uganda, when I was there last year, I discussed this matter with the Ugandan Government and directly with President Museveni.  I understand that legislation is proposed but it is what we would call Private Members' legislation.  At that stage it seemed to be stalled somewhat in the parliamentary process but it is something on which we are keeping an active eye.</p><p> Senator Walsh raised the issue of religious freedom and freedom of belief in that context.  Ireland has made, and continues to make, freedom of religion and belief a priority issue.  In March this year, the EU proposed a successful resolution on freedom of religion and belief at the UN Human Rights Council and Ireland actively supported that.  The resolution renewed the mandate of the UN's special rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief.  The EU is also working on new guidelines on freedom of religion and belief to guide efforts internationally.</p><p> In respect of our own national position, during our chairmanship of the OSCE last year, we paid particular attention to the issue of freedom of religion and belief.  In both our candidacy for the UN Human Rights Council and our work therein, it is a priority for us.  In that context, the issue of Coptic Christians and other minority religions in Arab countries is one of great concern.  As Deputy Crowe said, we are looking at a situation where the secular approach to governance in some of those countries is being diminished.  This matter has been discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council.</p><p> In addition, there are a number of issues which we need to examine as tests on this dimension.  One is the issue of freedom of religion and belief, and the treatment of minority religions.  The second is the position of women in those societies.  According to reports we are getting from some countries, while progress is being made on holding elections and related issues of democratisation, there are worrying developments concerning the position of women in those societies.  That will be a litmus test for how those societies develop.</p><p> Some members of this committee had a meeting with Ms Kasha Jacqueline Nabagesera, to which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred.  Officials from my own Department met with Ms Nabagesera in Iveagh House this morning, along with Mr. Colm O'Gorman and his colleagues from Amnesty International.  They had a very useful exchange.  Ms Nabagesera and her colleagues also support the approach that the Government and our embassy in Kampala have been taking on the issue.</p><p> Deputy Eric Byrne raised the issue of Palestinian Christians.  I know that the Chairman of the joint committee, Deputy Pat Breen, met a delegation of Christian leaders from Palestine last Monday.  The Middle East unit of my Department also had a long and interesting discussion with them.  The central message we took from that meeting was that Palestinian Christians are suffering from the same occupation policies as the wider Palestinian community.  They include pressure on individuals and communities as well as a lack of economic opportunity.  These are issues on which Ireland has strongly focused and I am conscious of their impact on Christians.</p><p> The Magnitsky case was raised by Deputy Byrne and other members of the joint committee.  I do not want to comment on communications between the committee and our ambassadors, because that is really a matter for the committee and the embassies concerned.</p> <p>However, I can tell members that I did raise the case of Sergei Magnitsky at the Foreign Affairs Council and have argued that this is an issue that should remain on the agenda at the highest political level in the European Union's relationship with Russia, including the summit with Russia, which takes place during every Presidency.  The decision last month by the investigative committee of the Russian Federation to close the criminal investigation into his death is highly regrettable.  I share of the strongly-worded concerns which were expressed by Catherine Ashton on this issue and I call on the Russian authorities to reopen the investigation.  I find ghoulish the posthumous trial of Mr. Magnitsky that has been taking place in Moscow.  I believe this issue should remain an important element in the European Union's relationship with Russia.</p><p> On the issue of Syrian refugees to Ireland that was raised by Senator Norris, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has had discussions with his German counterpart about this issue.  Germany and in particular, my colleague the foreign minister, Mr. Westerwelle, have been particularly active in encouraging European Union member states to accept Syrian refugees.  Clearly, this is a matter for the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and his Department and the Senator has the reply to the parliamentary question to which he has referred.</p><p> On the issue of Iraq raised by Senator Walsh and a number of colleagues, it would indeed be a tragedy were the genuine progress made by Iraq to be lost.  It is hugely important for that region that there is a stable Iraq.  I believe there is a need for a more high-level dialogue on the part of the European Union with the Iraqi Government and Prime Minister Maliki.  For all its current problems, Iraq has come a long way since 2003.  As for what the European Union is doing to assist Iraq, since 2003 more than &euro;1 billion of aid has been provided by the European Union to Iraq.  Last year, the European Union's relations with Iraq were formalised in a partnership and co-operation agreement and as I noted earlier, I expect it is an issue we will be addressing at the Foreign Affairs Council next week.  While I believe I have covered most of the points, members should let me know if-----</p></speech>

As Senator Norris himself has made the point, by 2050 the population of the world will have grown to approximately 9 billion people, which constitutes a tripling of the world population if one frames its within one's own lifetime.  At a practical level and where the issue was relevant to our conference, it is estimated that it will require an increase of approximately 60% in agricultural production and food production to feed that population by 2050.</p></speech>

On the other hand, it also is estimated that the effects of climate change will wipe out one quarter of the world's agricultural produce over the same period.  Consequently, it is pretty clear that the issues of population, climate and of course hunger and nutrition are highly interconnected.  This is the reason we decided to pull them together.  Our intention now is to carry that forward and to shape European policy in the first instance and to shape the review of the millennium development goals.</p></speech>

I also thank the officials for the support they provided to the joint committee during the preparations for the recent interparliamentary conference on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, and the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP.</p><p>  In the absence of any other business, before I conclude the meeting the joint committee probably should send a letter to the charg&eacute; d'affaires at the United States Embassy, Mr. John Hennessey-Niland, to express members' sympathy in the wake of the recent Boston bombings.  That is important in the context of the horrible attacks that killed three people and injured 140 people.  I am sure the joint committee will agree to do that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Before proceeding with business I remind members and those in the Gallery that mobile phones should be switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in committee rooms.  The purpose of today's meeting is to consider the proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the terms of the agreement between the European Community and the Republic of South African and the framework agreements between the European Union, the Republic of Korea and the Republic of Indonesia.  The D&aacute;il ordered the referral of this proposal to the select committee on 28 March and under the terms of the order, the committee must complete its consideration and send a message to that effect to the D&aacute;il not later than 23 April.  The committee will consider the proposal but not make any decision with regard to it.  On behalf of the select committee I again welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and I propose that we now hear opening remarks from him before discussing the proposal as a single item.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.607" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2013041700002#A00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the three motions referred to the committee for consideration.  The motions seek D&aacute;il approval of the terms of EU international agreements with South Africa, the Republic of Korea and Indonesia.  As members of the committee will be aware, the three agreements in question involve mixed competence.  This means that some of the areas covered by the agreements, such as economic co-operation and trade relations, fall within the exclusive competence of the European Union, while others, such as justice and home affairs, remain within the competence of member states.  For this reason, each EU member state is a party to these agreements and they can only formally enter into force after they have been ratified by all member states and endorsed by the European Parliament.  In Ireland's case, the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is required prior to ratification whenever the terms of the agreement involve the possibility of a charge on public funds.  As it can take a considerable length of time before ratification procedures are completed in all 27 member states, arrangements are usually made for some aspects of the agreements to be applied on a provisional basis pending their formal entry into force at a later date.</p><p>  These new agreements with South Korea and Indonesia and the updating of the existing agreement with South Africa clearly signal the EU's intent to become a more effective global player.  Partnership and co-operation agreements with the Philippines and Vietnam have recently been signed and one with Mongolia is awaiting signature.  Negotiations on far-reaching agreements with Canada and Singapore are almost completed while trade talks are about to begin with Japan.  In addition, the EU is moving towards the opening of negotiations with the US on a landmark transatlantic trade and investment partnership.</p><p>  We can see that under the Lisbon treaty the EU has developed real instruments of foreign policy.  The framework and the tools are now in place to enable the Union to more effectively defend its values, promote its interests and be more present in the world.  Three years on from their creation, there is a fuller appreciation of the benefits of having a permanent President of the European Council, a High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and a European External Action Service.  We are seeing greater coherence in the Union's external actions and more clarity in its interaction with its global partners.  This is important because in our globalised world the relationships that Europe builds with its key partners will determine its future prosperity.  I am aware that the committee has taken a strong interest in the human rights clauses in EU international agreements and I welcome this.</p><p>  I also wish to assure the committee that human rights concerns are fully integrated into the EU's approach to external relations. The purpose of agreements with partner countries such as those before us today is not just to increase trade and improve prosperity.  They also provide a framework for the EU to promote the principles and values on which the Union was founded, which are democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.  Since 1995, the EU has implemented a policy of systematically including an "essential element" clause into all framework agreements with third countries, stipulating that respect for human rights and democratic principles forms the basis for the agreement.  The essential elements clause provides the legal basis for positive measures, such as human rights dialogues, as well as for negative measures in case of serious violations of human rights.</p><p>  I would like now to introduce the EU-Indonesia partnership and co-operation agreement to the committee for approval.  This agreement was signed in 2009 and, as of now, it has been ratified by 24 member states.  It was the first such agreement to be concluded by the EU with a country which is a member of ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations.  The completion of negotiations with Indonesia demonstrated the EU's desire to strengthen its links with the region and it has paved the way for negotiations with a number of other ASEAN members, such as Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p><p>  The partnership and co-operation agreement will allow the EU to strengthen political dialogue and co-operation with Indonesia.  It will also provide the framework for closer co-operation in a wide range of policy fields, including trade and investment, environment, energy, education, science and technology, migration and counter-terrorism.  In addition, a new EU-Indonesia human rights dialogue was launched in 2009, which has resulted in intensified exchanges on human rights issues of mutual interest.  The agreement has also allowed for further development of intercultural exchange and engagement with moderate Islamic groups.  It has reinforced the EU's development co-operation programme in Indonesia, which supports, among other areas, democratisation; good governance; poverty reduction, including education; improvement of the trade and investment climate; tackling environmental problems; and promoting ASEAN co-operation.</p><p>  How does this agreement affect Ireland?  Currently, Ireland's relationship with Indonesia remains underdeveloped.  Our bilateral relations are maintained on a secondary accreditation basis from Singapore, with Indonesia's ambassador in London accredited to Ireland.  My Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, recently visited Indonesia as part of an overall trade-focused trip to south-east Asia over the St. Patrick's day period.  He was the first Irish Minister to visit Indonesia in over a decade.</p><p>  Indonesia represents a wealth of opportunity for Ireland.  With a population of 250 million it is the world's fourth most populous country.  Its GDP in 2012 was &euro;685 billion, making it the world's 16th-largest economy.  It has recorded economic growth rates of over 6% per annum for the past three years and it is predicted that by 2020 it will be the world's sixth or seventh-largest economy.  Trade with Indonesia is growing, albeit from a low base.  In 2012, Ireland's total merchandise trade with Indonesia was valued at &euro;162 million, an increase of 15% over 2011.  Total trade in services is also rising from &euro;141 million in 2010 to &euro;204 million in 2011.  There is considerable potential to increase trade and investment flows between Ireland and Indonesia from their current low levels.  There are also opportunities in services, including education and tourism.  This agreement provides part of the framework necessary for Ireland to take our relationship with Indonesia to the next level.</p><p>  I will turn now to the EU-South Korea framework agreement.  This agreement was signed in 2010 and to date it has been ratified by 20 member states.  The framework agreement was signed at the same time the EU upgraded its relationship with South Korea to that of strategic partnership.  This strategic partnership is underpinned by two agreements - the EU-South Korea free trade agreement, which is the first such agreement to be signed by the EU with an Asian country and which came into effect on 1 July 2011, and this framework agreement.  The framework agreement promotes economic growth and sustainable development through co-operation in a broad range of fields, including business co-operation, competition policy, science and technology, education, agriculture and the environment.  It also provides for strengthening co-operation in migration and combating organised crime and illicit drugs.</p><p>  The framework agreement with South Korea will allow the EU to engage with this important partner to addresses a wide range of areas of mutual international concern, such as non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, human rights, co-operation in the fight against terrorism, climate change, energy security and development assistance.  The EU-Korea relationship is probably the most developed in terms of political and economic relations compared to other EU relationships in the region.  South Korea is and will remain in the future a major player in the global information and communications technology field, despite growing regional competition.</p><p>  In what way will this agreement affect Ireland?  Ireland's relationship with South Korea is firmly rooted in the economic sphere.  Our embassy in Seoul was opened in 1989, with a strong focus on building economic relations, and that focus remains today.  My Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, recently completed a visit to South Korea, where a key objective was to seek out new trade openings.  The entry into force of the new EU- South Korea free trade agreement offers scope for Ireland to generate new and significant export opportunities.  From information technology sectors to education to the food and beverage industry, South Korea represents a market in which Ireland is well positioned to do business.</p> <p>Trade with South Korea is steady but we can always do more.  Total merchandise trade between Ireland and South Korea in 2012 was valued at &euro;689 million, exports were valued at &euro;356 million and imports at &euro;333 million.  While this represents a small increase in overall trade year-on-year, of more significance is the fact that exports to South Korea increased by &euro;56 million, or 18%, in 2012.  As with Indonesia, considerable potential exists to further increase trade and investment flows between Ireland and South Korea from their current levels.  There are also opportunities in the services sector that we will pursue, especially in education and tourism.  This agreement provides part of the framework which has taken the EU-Korea relationship to the next level.  Ireland can also use this framework to take our bilateral relationship to new heights.</p><p> I will deal now with South Africa.  Relations have flourished since the birth of democracy in South Africa in 1994 and it is one of the EU's key partners in Africa and globally.  The agreement with South Africa signed on 11 September 2009, which we are discussing today, amends the agreement on trade, development and co-operation which the EU signed with South Africa in 1999 and which came into effect in May 2004.  The 1999 agreement, known as the TDCA, provides the legal basis for close relations on trade, development, economic co-operation and political dialogue.  EU-South Africa relations were further consolidated with the establishment of a strategic partnership in 2007 which provided for enhanced political and policy dialogues and co-operation, as well as an overarching structure including annual summits and ministerial-level meetings.</p><p> The duration of the basic TDCA is unspecified but provision was made for its revision within five years.  This agreement is the first such revision and it was completed five years after the TDCA came into force.  It comprises four Articles.  Article 1 outlines the amendments made to the original TDCA.  Articles 2 to 4 are general technical provisions dealing with the languages in which the agreement is drawn up, approval procedures and subsequent entry into force.</p><p> I will now briefly outline the main amendments made to the original TDCA as set out in Article 1.  Articles 1(3) to (7) provide for greater and deeper co-operation in the areas of information and communications technology, energy, mining and minerals, and transport, and add maritime transport as a new area of co-operation.  Articles 1(9) to (20) update development co-operation arrangements bringing a clearer, more efficient and joint approach, reflecting new international commitments such as the millennium development goals agreed in 2000, and making some technical amendments.  Articles 1(21) to (24) provide for deeper co-operation on science and technology, and on social issues, as well as reflecting work in international fora and updating and clarifying the language on environment and cultural co-operation.  Article 1(25) aims at greater co-operation on addressing illicit drugs.</p><p> Co-operation on disarmament and non-proliferation is introduced via Articles 1(1), (2) and (27).  Article 1(27) introduces seven other new Articles into the agreement dealing with the following: co-operation in the areas of combating terrorism, money laundering and the financing of terrorism; combating organised crime; illicit trade in and excessive accumulation of small arms and light weapons; prevention of mercenary activities; strengthening co-operation with the International Criminal Court; and co-operation on migration.  Article 1(28) deals with the efficient provision of financial assistance via EU development and international co-operation budgets.</p><p> In summary, the amending agreement signed in 2009 updates and makes technical improvements to the original agreement with South Africa, while also deepening and expanding co-operation across a range of areas of political importance as well as justice and home affairs.  It forms part of the strong foundations for ongoing positive EU relations with South Africa.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.  I am happy to recommend these three agreements for approval.  They will broaden and deepen the EU's relationship with Indonesia, South Korea and South Africa on the basis of shared values and interests.  They will help to raise the profile and visibility of Europe in the countries in question and in the Asia and southern Africa regions.  This, in turn, will open up greater opportunities for Ireland to forge stronger political, commercial and trade links with, in the case of South Africa, a regional economic power and, in the case of Indonesia and South Korea, two countries in a region that is expected to drive global economic growth in the coming decade.  I would encourage the committee to recommend to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that the proposed motions be approved, so that Ireland is in a position to notify the Council of the completion of its ratification procedures.</p><p> I am happy to take questions at this point.</p></speech>

We have seen the importance of resident embassies in South Africa and Seoul, where trade is growing steadily, while as the T&aacute;naiste said, Indonesia represents a wealth of opportunity for Ireland.  Are there any plans to open an embassy in Jakarta?  The Indonesian ambassador from London has visited and his Government would support our opening an embassy in Jakarta and Indonesia opening an embassy in Dublin.</p></speech>

I am currently looking at what we need to do in terms of our representation abroad to better promote trade and investment opportunities.

We are formalising agreements that have been in place for some years and I welcome that progress.  It helps to deepen and expand co-operation.</p><p>  South Africa has a population in excess of 50 million, while there are 250 million people in Indonesia.  I do not know the population of South Korea but it has the 15th largest economy in the world.  That demonstrates the need for Europe to have up-to-date agreements with those trading blocs.  I am glad that in each of the agreements, aspects related to democracy, human rights, climate change and the rule of law, things we take for granted, are included.  It is vital that the European Union is a force to ensure best governance and human rights protection in countries where we are involved in trade.</p><p>  In view of the conference earlier this week, every trade agreement Europe is finalising or reviewing should take account of climate change and environmental issues.  Food security is a huge issue.  I am not as despondent as some about the huge challenges globally arising from the world's population increasing from 7 billion to in excess of 9 billion by 2050.  When we think of the technological competence available today, competence that could not have been envisaged a few decades ago, and we consider the issue Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan regularly highlights here and in the D&aacute;il, the huge untapped resources across the world, we can benefit from the huge technological advances to ensure we have proper access to unused resources, particularly when it comes to food production.  It is incumbent on Europe, as a major trading bloc, to keep the stamp of food security, environmental issues and climate change to the fore in all agreements.  That has been happening in recent years but we cannot underline the message too often. </p><p>  I welcome these developments and the deepening of economic trade links with countries that have grown in affluence, albeit very unfairly spread in South Africa.</p> <p>The economies of South Korea and Indonesia have been growing strongly and I hope that the vast majority of the population is benefiting by that growth.  The committee will be aware of the considerable advances in education and in the ICT area, and the high skills level of the work force, for example, in South Korea.  It is important that Ireland has up-to-date trade agreements with those, to some extent, newly-emerging economies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.613" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2013041700004#C00200"><p>I have two queries.  Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether an agreement, once ratified by Ireland, comes into force in advance of all of the EU countries ratifying it or remains in abeyance until everybody has ratified it?</p><p>  The Chairman raised the issue of Indonesia.  I am interested in that country.  When I visited two years ago, there was the sense of a country really emerging, with an emerging middle class.  They have the growth in their population under control to some extent.  It is a large young population looking for middle-class trade.  It offers significant opportunities for Ireland.  In terms of opening an embassy, I wonder is it jumping the gun in advance of some kind of a trade agreement or should we circumvent that.  Everybody talks about getting into China.  There must be easier ways to develop trade than getting into China because everybody seems to be focusing on that.  Certainly, Indonesia gave me the impression of a county that was ready to start trading with the rest of the world and where incomes were getting to the stage where they wanted all that the West had to offer and were more than willing to buy them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.614" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2013041700004#C00300"><p>Is the Minister confident that the essential elements clause in all framework agreements is strong enough on human rights and the democratic principles, and if there was a legal case, would it be strong enough?</p><p>  I would make one other point about money laundering.  Money laundering is conducted not only to finance terrorism.  It is profit-driven by certain companies.  It is also part of the corruption in certain countries.  Will the agreement be strong enough to tackle the other aspects of money laundering?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.615" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2013041700004#C00400"><p>We all would agree that the opening of an embassy brings benefits, not only in goodwill but in trade and ever other way.  The concern relates to some agreements, not necessarily the ones here before us today but some that have been made in the past, such as free-trade agreements with countries with whose human rights record one would have difficulties, and a number of them jump to mind straightaway in that regard.  The Minister wished to assure the committee that human rights concerns are fully integrated in the EU's approach to external relations, but there are those who would argue, for example, in the free-trade agreements with Israel and Colombia where there are difficulties still on-going, which comes first given that human rights is linked-in with this.  Once it is agreed, is it signed up for good or does it include a clause by which the Minister can step back from it in 12 months stating we are not happy with the progress on human rights and fundamental freedoms?  Is there such a process?</p><p>  The Minister spoke of the agreement allowing us to engage in a number of areas.  He spoke of South Korea and stated it allows us to engage in non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, etc.  Are we encouraging agreements in that regard?  There would be nothing stopping the EU or any other organisation conducting discussions on those issues without an agreement in place.  Maybe I am reading it wrongly; it is the first time I have seen it.</p><p>  There are some other areas of concern.  Deputy Mitchell stated she would kick me under the table if I asked any more, but I am concerned about the linkage with trade.  There is a responsibility with trade relating to the opening up.  It is seen as giving the <i>imprimatur</i> to many of these regimes and I presume there is concern among many about countries with whom we trade and with whom we open relations.</p></speech>

The Minister should get on with it.  It is a great idea to establish these three trading links.</p><p>  To follow through on Deputy Mitchell's point, is ratification by all 27 required in order for Ireland to start engaging?  If we sign off here today, and in the D&aacute;il next week, can the Government immediately enter into negotiations with these three trading partners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.617" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOS2013041700004#C00600"><p>First, on the populations covered, there are approximately 250 million people in Indonesia, 50 million in South Africa and 50 million in South Korea.  The three agreements between them involve 350 million people and are quite significant.</p><p>  In reply to Deputy Smith, the agreements provide for co-operation in the area of climate change.  It is already built into them.</p><p>  In response to Deputies Mitchell and Eric Byrne, the ratification of all member states is required for the agreements to come into force.  One should bear in mind that these are EU agreements with the countries concerned.  Of course, Ireland has separate bilateral relations and there is a trade relationship.  These agreements provide a framework for the trade and investment relationship and then a wider framework including the essential elements which deal with such matters as human rights.</p><p>  The most significant of those essential elements is what they do positively because they provide for a discussion and dialogue between the European Union and countries concerned, for example, on human rights issues.  Of course, it is true that we all are free at any time to raise such issues bilaterally with countries and the European Union is free to do so, but doing it in a structured way which involves the whole trade relationship adds much greater clout to the discussion.</p><p>  The European Union requires the inclusion of political clauses in agreements with third countries as a way of ensuring that the values and political principles of the European Union and its member states are upheld.  The agreements with Korea and Indonesia contain two political clauses - one on human rights, democracy and the rule of law committing all parties to the implementation of their human rights responsibilities and the other on disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction requiring the parties to co-operate and contribute to countering the proliferation of such weapons.  The original agreement with South Africa contained a human rights clause while the revised agreement we are discussing today has added disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The human rights clause is an essential element of the agreement.  That means that the concessions which are contained in the agreement may be unilaterally suspended in the event of violation by any of the signatory countries.</p><p>  On the monitoring of the human rights situation in the countries concerned, one of the key ways that the EU monitors the human rights situations in countries is through its delegations on the ground which work in close collaboration with the bilateral member state missions.  The European Union maintains an open and frank dialogue on human rights with the representatives of countries with which it concludes co-operation agreements.  In the case of Indonesia and South Africa, human rights are the subject of a dedicated dialogue with the respective Governments.  These dialogues are forward looking and constructive and focus on concrete co-operation in the protection and promotion of human rights in the countries in question.  At a multilateral level, the European Union actively engages with partner countries, including at the UN Human Rights Council where, of course, all countries are subject to universal periodic review.</p></speech>

I also welcome from the Irish Traveller Movement Ms Susan Fay, managing solicitor, and Ms Jacinta Brack, communications co-ordinator.  I also welcome Ms Ronnie Fay and Mr. Martin Collins, directors of the Pavee Point Travellers Centre.  We will ask them to make brief opening remarks for approximately five minutes, after which we will have a question and answer session on the issues raised.</p><p>    By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the salient rulings of the Chair that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I ask everybody to please switch off all mobile phones.  It is not good enough to leave them in silent mode because they interfere with the recording system.  I even take the battery out of mine to ensure it is completely switched off.  </p><p>  I invite Ms Quilligan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The Irish Traveller Movement has more than 40 member organisations and a mandate to speak on their behalf and advocate for the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  Our submission includes details of Irish Travellers who number 40,000 in Ireland, 15,000 in Britain and 10,000 of Irish descent in the United States.  We have a shared history, cultural values, a language, customs and traditions which are recognisable and distinct to our own people.  We constitute an ethnic group on the basis of these distinct and separate cultural values and traditions which make us self-identify as a separate group and enable us to be identified by the majority of the Irish population as a separate group.  We have been recognised as an ethnic group by all major international human rights instruments and bodies in Europe and worldwide and by the major human rights instruments in Ireland.  Uniquely, we also have two distinct features which mark our difference.  We have a dual identity of being indigenous Irish and Travellers and an undisputed and historical experience of marginalisation and discrimination in the country to which we belong.</p><p>  Members will note from our submission that our legal argument is watertight.  There is no dispute among national and international legal experts that we constitute an ethnic group.  We self-identify as an ethnic group and others recognise us such.  I will speak about the impact of not being recognised in one's own country as an ethnic group.  No matter how many boxes we tick or how much we fulfil our requirements and responsibilities in Irish society, we still experience discrimination and prejudice in every area of life on a daily basis.  People justify racism against us by stating we bring it on ourselves. That is what the general Irish population thinks about us and we know this.  We feel the hate, as do our children.  We see the hate in the media and displayed by people in positions of responsibility, politicians, judges, the police, teachers and doctors.  We feel, see and experience it on a daily basis.  It is not good enough for the State not to offer us the protection to which we are entitled.  </p><p>  We are not speaking about major changes; we are speaking about people who have been on the island of Ireland for as long as anybody can record and recognition for the valuable contribution we have made to Irish society.</p> <p>We are talking about having our own history recorded, rather than a history that has been written for us, imposed upon us and dictated to us.  We are talking about setting the record straight and supporting our people to stand tall and feel they are a valuable part of Irish society.  Make no bones about it - despite what one might hear regularly, Travellers want to be part of Irish society.  We work hard and tirelessly to be part of society.  Unfortunately, however, doors are often closed in our faces, so many of our community do not engage.  Working with the Irish Traveller Movement, I can see how people - especially the most vulnerable in society who are dependent on the State - are treated by agents of the State.  I can therefore understand why people choose not to engage.  However, our message today is that both local and national Traveller organisations want to support people to engage with the State.</p><p> We want recognition so that our culture and people can survive into the future.  We cannot do it on our own, however, so we need your support.  We need allies and while we have some already, we need more allies in the Oireachtas.  We need people to stand up for us.  We are on this side of the table while the committee members are on the other side.</p><p> There is a lot we could say about ethnicity and I could talk all day about it, including key points as to why the recognition of our people is so vital for our survival.  Our suicide rate is six times the national average.  My colleagues and those in the Visitors Gallery know that it is directly related to the oppression and marginalisation our people suffer.  </p><p> During questions and answers I hope to have an opportunity to elaborate further.  I thank the committee for its attention.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is on record as having said that same-sex marriage is the human rights issue of our generation and I would agree with that.  I would also suggest, however, that for the Traveller community, the recognition of Traveller ethnicity is the human rights issue of our generation.</p><p>  We are disappointed at the persistent refusal of successive Governments to recognise what is self evident, namely, that we Travellers constitute a distinct ethnic group.  The Government has continued to ignore the opinions and recommendations of a range of eminent domestic and international bodies which have all said the Government should take concrete measures to recognise Traveller ethnicity.  The same eminent human rights bodies have also said, very clearly, that Travellers meet all the legal and academic criteria in terms of what constitutes ethnicity.  </p><p>  In particular, I want to draw the attention of the committee to general recommendation No. 8 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, CERD, which is the principle of the right to self identify, if no objective justification can be put to the contrary.  The Irish Government is immediately in breach of this principle because it has not explained or justified why it will not recognise Traveller ethnicity.  The mantra we consistently get is that there is a divergence of views within the Traveller community.</p><p>  While recognising that there are a number of individuals who disagree with the recognition of Traveller ethnicity, the four national Traveller organisations - the Irish Traveller Movement, the National Traveller Women's Forum, Pavee Point Travellers' Centre, and Minc&eacute;irs Whiden, a Traveller-only forum - all agree that Travellers do constitute an ethnic minority and should be recognised as such.</p><p>  Last September, at a conference organised in Dublin Castle by the National Traveller Monitoring Advisory Committee, NTMAC, 99% of the Travellers in attendance also agreed that we do constitute an ethnic minority and should be granted that status.  There was one dissenting individual.  </p><p>  Nowhere in international law does it suggest that a consensus is needed for the recognition of ethnicity to be granted to our people.  In the final analysis, it is irrelevant whether one agrees or disagrees.  It is about recognising that there are international objective criteria on what constitutes ethnicity.  It is against this that assessments and decisions ought to be made.  If this approach was adopted by the Government there is no doubt in my view that our ethnicity would be recognised.</p><p>  The 1976 Mandla<i> v.</i> Dowell-Lee judgment in the UK is of significant importance to Irish Travellers.  It gave a lengthy definition of an ethnic group.  I want to convey two essential elements to this committee.  One is that the group has a long shared history, of which it is conscious, distinguishing it from other groups and the memory of which is kept alive.  The second element is a cultural tradition of its own, including family, social customs and manners, often but not necessarily associated with religious observance.</p><p>  In 2002, this criterion was heavily relied on in the English courts in O'Leary and Others<i> v.</i> Allied Domecq and Others.  After long deliberation, the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Goldstein, concluded that Irish Travellers met this criterion and therefore should be recognised as an ethnic minority.  In addition, the 1997 Race Relations Order grants recognition to Travellers in the North of Ireland, yet in this jurisdiction we do not. </p><p>  In that context, we also suggest that the Irish Government is in breach of the Good Friday Agreement which refers to an equivalence of rights.  In other words, it is about harmonising legislation upwards.  If there is a piece of legislation in the North of Ireland which is inferior to our legislation, there is an obligation on the Northern Ireland authorities to enhance their legislation upwards.  Likewise, there is a corresponding obligation on the Irish Government to enhance our legislation.  Unfortunately, however, it has not done so.</p><p>  Our own Equal Status Act gives a very good definition of what constitutes ethnicity in all but name.  Traveller organisations have provided evidence, both legal and academic, which clearly suggests that Travellers constitute an ethnic group.  Therefore, under international law the burden of proof to the contrary now lies with the State, but it has failed to act.  As I said, the mantra we get all the time is that there is a divergence of views in the Traveller community.</p><p>  This is not some sort of academic or ideological debate.  Not to recognise Traveller ethnicity has profound implications in terms of legal protection.  It is questionable whether Travellers are afforded the full protection of the EU race directive.  There are also implications concerning support for Traveller nomadism, language, culture, history and the inclusion of Travellers in intercultural and anti-racism initiatives.</p><p>  As regards the ethnic question in our national census, we had to fight tooth and nail to get Travellers included in that because we were not recognised as an ethnic group.  In the end, we reached a compromise.  As well as practical implications, ethnicity also has a symbolic value.  It would be good for Travellers' self-esteem and confidence, as well as being important for our people's overall status in Irish society.  </p><p>  In our opinion, there needs to be an unequivocal recognition of our ethnicity either by way of legislation or constitutionally, or both.  In the absence of this unequivocal recognition, the subtext is that we are a dysfunctional, primitive community who need to be civilised and rehabilitated.  </p><p>  Ethnicity is fundamentally about recognition, respect and, by extension, inclusion.  It is about recognising our history, culture and language.  Let us be clear about it - this is not about saying that the more one claims ethnicity, the less one claims Irishness.  We are very proud of our ethnicity and we are also very proud of our Irishness.  We are willing, and demanding, to play our part in the Irish nation.</p></speech>

The committee has agreed to have these hearings today and will probably have others.  We have invited Deputy Mac Lochlainn to act as rapporteur and prepare a report for the committee, which we will discuss when we have finished this work.  We will be presenting that to the Government, as well as publishing it.  I wanted to clarify where we currently are and I think I speak for everybody in saying that.</p> <p>Deputy McGrath was the first member I saw indicating a wish to ask one or two questions.  Members will ask a question and then get an answer and so on.  The witnesses will be glad to hear members do not make speeches but ask questions.</p></speech>

I am an Independent Deputy and on the broader issues, I endorse fully what the witnesses have said.  Their submissions were excellent and right to the point.  My first question pertains to a single sentence that jumped out at me, namely, Ms Quilligan's comment that Travellers feel the hate.  I believe that was the phrase she used.  I ask her to expand a little on this because many people in Leinster House and in the broader community do not get that and do not understand the impact it has on adults, as Ms Quilligan mentioned, but also on young Traveller children.  That is my first question.</p></speech>

We should keep that in mind when debating this point because that is at the core of the work we are doing today.</p></speech>

Through generations, where we were once a strong, proud people -  and for some part still are - we have been devalued within society.  Never before in my lifetime have I seen such hate as I have seen in the past five years.  If one opens a newspaper or turns on the television, if one is in a shop or on a train, if one looks at Facebook, Twitter, thejournal.ie or anything at all, anti-Traveller sentiment is fired at one.  As Travellers, we experience this in our daily lives and we try to set about changing that by making people aware of us and by working in partnership with people.  However, while we accept there is a certain tolerance from the people on the street, where it is happening more often is with people in positions of power who are coming out with absolutely outrageous anti-Traveller propaganda in the media in public open forums.  It is open season on Travellers, with little or no consequences for their actions.  When one is a Traveller, whether one is in the line of work we do or is a doctor, a hairdresser or anything else, be it getting involved or being a mother staying at home with one's children, when one sees such things in the media, one asks whether there is no law in the land of Ireland for one's people.  We ask if there no justice for our people if so much hate can be expressed towards us.  Like anyone, we internalise things.  If one is constantly told and fed negative things about one's self, one internalises them.  Certainly, we see some of our young people struggling with their identity and it is very hard, as a parent, to try to instil pride in one's identity because of all the hate one encounters.  I do not know whether anyone else wishes to add to this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.636" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ronnie Fay" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013041700004#C00500"><p>May I make a point pertaining to ethnicity?  One problem with the denial of Traveller ethnicity is that Travellers are not automatically included in anti-racism and inter-cultural initiatives, many of which are about promoting integration and mutual respect in Ireland.  Because this ethnicity is not recognised, the units in those Departments that are dealing with anti-racism and inter-culturalism actually do not include Travellers.  Consequently, Travellers have a unique experience of discrimination and we do not call it racism.  This, for us, is a key and core part of the debate regarding ethnicity, because if one recognises Traveller ethnicity, one recognises that racism is the root cause of discrimination with which Travellers are faced.  If one does that, one then seeks to address and challenge it in order that adults and children are not exposed to hate, racism and discrimination.  This is a fundamental problem.  The unit in the Department of Justice and Equality that deals with anti-racism and promotes inter-culturalism excludes Travellers.  Travellers are dealt with by the Traveller division, and this is hugely problematic.  For example, while the Government was developing the inter-cultural education policy, Travellers were excluded until we were obliged to bang down the door and demand to be included.  Moreover, we then are perceived to be difficult, awkward and always complaining, whereas, were we to be included as a right, our input would be planned.  As Mr. Martin Collins noted, we have campaigned for an ethnic question in the census since 1986.  We finally succeeded in getting one in the early 1990s and it was only a Traveller question.  When the ethnic question was introduced in 2002, Travellers were going to be excluded from it because they were not recognised as an ethnic group.  That is the reason the question in the census is what is one's ethnic and cultural background.  Really, however, the issue needs to be that ethnicity is recognised, that racism is named and that Travellers are included in anti-racism and inter-cultural initiatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1017" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013041700004#C00600"><p>My second question is related, to an extent, and is specifically to do with the ethnic group aspect.  In her submission, Ms Quilligan stated that the 40,000 Travellers in Ireland are recognised by many human rights groups, both nationally and internationally, as an ethnic group.  She then made a comment about the argument from a legal perspective and stated it was recognised as being, and I believe she used the word, "watertight".  Do the witnesses have information about the view of the present Attorney General?  Has the Irish Travellers Movement ever been given a view from the Attorney General in with regard to that aspect of the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.638" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Fay" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013041700004#C00700"><p>I am not in a position to comment on the view of the Attorney General.  However, I can state that both the Equality Authority, in a report from 2006 on Traveller ethnicity, and the Irish Human Rights Commission in 2004 and 2013 agreed that Travellers should be recognised as an ethnic group.  Both of these statutory human rights and equality organisations agreed.  Picking up on a concern raised by Ms Ronnie Fay, the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, that is being formed, with which I am sure all members are familiar, has an inter-culturalism remit.  However, because Travellers are not specifically named as an ethnic group, it is unclear whether Travellers will be included within that remit.  Consequently, there is less legal clarity, more confusion and more lobbying to be included in provisions and rights that justifiably should be afforded to Travellers.  I hope this has dealt with Deputy McGrath's question.</p></speech>

To zoom in on the highly relevant point made by Mr. Martin Collins when he spoke of the Good Friday Agreement, if legislation both North and South is being brought into line and if we are really serious about equality and human rights, my personal view is to question the reason we are not getting on with it and to ask what is the problem in this regard.</p></speech>

First, are there examples internationally of good practice in respect of Travellers, gypsies or different minority groups?  Are there international examples of where it works in the context of human rights and recognition?  Mr. Collins might answer my final question, which pertains to the burning out of a house allocated to a Traveller family in County Donegal.  At the time of that horrific incident, only a minority of Deputies in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann spoke out, and personally I felt very let down.  How did Mr. Collins react to that?  Violence against Travellers is happening frequently-----</p></speech>

As for other examples internationally, we have the example of the Sami people in Scandinavia, whose ethnicity was denied for many years.  In our consultation with members of the Sami people, the similarities between us were absolutely uncanny.  One of the main things from which they feel they have benefited since they were recognised in, I think, the late 1970s is the increase in self-esteem and pride among their own people, as well as preservation of their own culture and identity and the value that has been placed on them within their own country.  However, one does not need to look too far.  We mention Northern Ireland and how, if one is in Dundalk and crosses the Border, one has more rights in Newry as an Irish Traveller than one has in Dundalk at present.</p></speech>

The reaction to the burning of a house allocated to a Traveller family in Donegal was disappointing.  There was a lack of courage and political leadership from most people, with a few exceptions, including Deputy Finian McGrath and Deputy Pringle.  In the absence of that, the signal being given is that it is open season on Travellers and one can attack Travellers with impunity.  This does not befit a western, civilised democracy.  The rule of law is being completely ignored.  I hope the culprits who were responsible will be brought to justice.  In fact, it is reported by the Garda this morning that after 61 days the incident has been found to be criminal damage and arson.  It was not an accident.</p><p>  With regard to good practice, in Romania the Roma are recognised as a distinct ethnic minority.  That is reflected in its constitution.  In Romania there is a model of good practice in political leadership.  Its national parliament has an affirmative action programme in which Roma are represented in the political system.  That is a model of good practice and is something that potentially could and should be replicated in the Irish context.  I agree with Brigid that recognising Traveller ethnicity is not a panacea or a cure-for-all, but it is a step in the right direction.  If that is the starting point, it must be supported by appropriate legislation and resources.  I can give an example.  I was in primary education for six years.  Unfortunately, I did not get the opportunity to get a secondary education.  In those six years I was in an exclusively settled environment and I was taught about settled history, settled people's culture and so forth.  That is quite valuable, but at no stage in those six years was my identity as a Traveller in Ireland affirmed and celebrated.  I am not a human rights lawyer but I suspect that if Traveller ethnicity was granted, under international law there would be an obligation on the State to ensure that our curriculum is inter-cultural and reflects diversity.  It would be different from what it is now, which is basically a monocultural system.</p></speech>

I welcome the other Travellers in the gallery.</p><p>  I favour the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group for all the reasons the witnesses have identified, particularly the strength of the argument that there are international objective criteria which should be used to acknowledge ethnicity as well as the principle of the right to self-identity.  What do the witnesses believe are the reasons for the State's resistance to this?  Is there a paper or body of evidence that the State has produced to argue against the recognition of ethnicity?  Does it have anything to do with some of the policy or, perhaps, service implications of Travellers being recognised as having a distinct ethnic identity?</p></speech>

We ask the Government to produce its evidence or rationale for not recognising Travellers as an ethnic minority.  I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath's suggestion.  At some stage it would be appropriate and productive if the Attorney General could be invited to appear before this committee and account for why Travellers are not recognised as an ethnic minority.  I hope the committee will do that.</p></speech>

Ms Brigid Quilligan gave a fantastic presentation.  I believe it will be a defining moment in terms of what this State can and should do to right the absolute wrongs that exist in this society against members of the Traveller community.  Am I correct in suggesting that, from the witnesses' perspective, this will be the test of whether politics cares about or respects the Traveller community and whether politics works for the Traveller community?  Is this such an important issue for the witnesses that it will define their relationship with politics and with the State?</p></speech>

This is the core issue of our time, as the Senator said.  It means building a good foundation for everything else.  We have everything else in place but if people are not recognised as the indigenous minority and ethnic group they are, everything else is like a house of cards.  It just falls.  We need political leadership and allies.  We need somebody to step up and support us to further our human rights within Ireland and to take our rightful place in Ireland.  As Mr. Collins said, we are a people who are seen as outcasts, deviants and undesirable.  Regardless of how hard we work in Ireland, this is still the opinion.  We need people at political level to show leadership and lead the way with us.  We are absolutely willing to work alongside them to achieve this.  This is the issue of our time.</p></speech>

I commend the witnesses on their presentation.  The human rights and legal framework for this, domestically and internationally, is watertight.  It cannot be argued with.  It is that simple.  I invite anybody to argue the case against it, as there is no case against it.  We will develop that as the hearings proceed.  We will see if it can be argued against, but that is my analysis at this point.  However, there is a far more important question than my analysis.  The transcript of these proceedings will be produced and perhaps could be circulated to a wider audience, particularly the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Will the witnesses take us through the history of the Traveller people?  What is their history over hundreds of years of nomadism?  I have read a number of books in the recent past but we have not yet had this conversation.  It might be helpful if the witnesses would discuss the history of the Traveller people, how they are connected to this island over hundreds of years, their nomadism and how it evolved and how we as a people evolved into an urbanised, settled people, because we all emanated from the same place originally.</p></speech>

We believe there is a record of Irish Travellers in the island of Ireland as far back as the fifth century.  There is a fallacy that we were a by-product of the Famine, but we strongly dispute this.  We know, for example, that Travellers emigrated to Murphy Village in America prior to the Famine.  I did not bring them with me but there are different references to Travellers throughout the past.  We are a nomadic people, mainly working in tin smithing and known as tinkers.  Some of us are musicians, bards and storytellers.  There are people in the gallery who are far more experienced at telling our history than I am, so I apologise to those people.  I do not know if the Chairman wishes to invite them to speak.</p></speech>

Our recollection is that settlement was imposed on us rather than being something we wanted.  I deferred to one of our members in the Visitors Gallery because of one of our cultural norms, which is to defer to older people who have more experience.  I take on board the Chairman's suggestion to come back and outline the detail involved, but in the assimilation policies from the 1960s onwards something got lost along the way and we began to be seen as the Traveller problem.  Once anything is approached as a problem, that is how one will respond to it.  I am sorry I cut Mr. Collins off.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.670" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Collins" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013041700006#E01000"><p>As Ms Quilligan alluded to, our people have been here since the 5th century.  There are sporadic references in some historical texts which suggest our people date back that far.  The reason the references are sporadic is history is always written by the victors, the powerful, the privileged and the elite; therefore, minorities and women, in this case, were largely excluded from the texts.  Their contribution to the evolution of the State has been largely overlooked.  We have been on the island since the 5th century and, in that context, are an integral part of it.  Travellers and settled people have a shared history.  As Travellers, we also, unfortunately, have a discrete history of oppression and persecution.  In some cases - I do not mean to be emotive - there was attempted genocide or ethnic cleansing to rid society of Travellers through assimilationist policies.</p><p>  We need to be careful in looking at Travellers through a cultural lens because we can end up pigeon-holing people.  That is why, in terms of a legal framework, we would be better off considering this issue from an ethnicity point of view because ethnicity recognises a distinguishable group, but, within it, it allows people to be individuals also.  In other words, not every Traveller is in favour of having large elaborate headstones when a loved one dies.  Some Travellers like it and are quite flamboyant and extravagant, while others are more modest.  Likewise, some celebrations of christenings and weddings are flamboyant and extravagant, while others are not.  Similarly, some Travellers value nomadism, while others do not.  Some Travellers see language as valuable, while others do not.  It the same for settled people when it comes to ethnicity.  They do not all share the same cultural practices and do not have the same values and beliefs.  That is why it is better to look at Travellers from an ethnicity point of view in terms of a legal framework rather than through a cultural lens.</p></speech>

The Deputy might recall a programme was made on researching Travellers' DNA.  It concluded that more than 1,000 years ago there were the beginnings of a separation of the two communities.  The information is quite sketchy, but it is a chapter that has yet to be written.  I hope it will be researched and written.</p></speech>

I am present because I want to bear witness to the stories told.  I support the Chairman's view because it is important to have all of this information on the record in order that historians and others can look back on them.  It is embarrassing for somebody such as me to feel I have a right as an Oireachtas Member to somehow convey or transfer ethnicity to fellow citizens.  I also acknowledge the artist and playwright, Rosie McDonagh, who is in the gallery, someone with whom I have worked, collaborated and fought on many occasions.  I thank the representatives for their vivid, lucid and articulate presentations which have given me clarity.  I have one question for Ms Quilligan which emanates from Mr. Collins's comments on the Good Friday Agreement and the disparity between the North and the South.  They outlined a number of compelling stories, particularly in the context of the suicide rate.  What are the practical differences between being a Traveller in the two jurisdictions?  Are there headline issues that would help the committee to clarify what recognition of ethnicity would bring to the Traveller community in the South?</p></speech>

For instance, integration policies, supports and affirmative actions to support people from an ethnic minority automatically include Travellers.  In Ireland we have had to battle to be included in anything positive to do with equality.  Initially, it was equality legislation, then broadcasting legislation and the press complaints procedures.  We have had to lobby every step of the way to be included in legislation under which we should be automatically included.</p></speech>

It ran counter to the report prepared for the Department of Justice and Equality when it was making preparations for the establishment of the Press Council.  The only ground excluded initially was the Traveller ground.  This coincided with visits to Ireland by members of the advisory committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance.  We brought the matter to their attention and I subsequently brought it to the attention of the National Traveller Monitoring and Advisory Committee.  We lobbied the Department of Justice and Equality and many Deputies on the issue and succeeded in having the decision rescinded and Travellers included in the scope of the Equal Status Act.  For this reason, we take the view that just because we are not paranoid, that does not mean they are not out to get us.  The case I cited was a clear example of the further exclusion of Travellers.</p><p> In terms of the media, these developments took place at the time of the P&aacute;draig Nally case. </p></speech>

Research done in 2000 showed that 90% of people would not want a Traveller as part of their family, yet some 80% of the respondents to the survey had never met a Traveller.  When they were asked how they formed their view, the respondents indicated it was based on media reports.  The media have a major responsibility in this regard.  Unless Traveller ethnicity is recognised and Travellers are planned into matters by design, representatives of Travellers end up being viewed as difficult, in other words, those who come hammering on the door to make a case.  We end up being perceived as highly adversarial, even though we work professionally, collaboratively and in a spirit of solidarity and partnership.  We want to be included by design and recognised as equal but different.  Difference must be factored into the planning.</p></speech>

We have been continually reminded that unfounded denials of Traveller ethnicity are not in compliance with the third Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.  As Mr. Collins pointed out, the burden of proof on the question of showing that Travellers are not an ethnic group rests firmly with the State.  It has not been established that Travellers are not an ethnic group.</p><p>  To respond to Deputy Finian McGrath's comments, the Irish Traveller Movement has contacted the Attorney General on the issue of ethnic recognition but has not yet received a definitive answer.</p><p>  On international human rights legislation, which has been alluded to previously, when international conventions or covenants are being implemented in Irish law groups such as the Irish Traveller Movement, Pavee Point and the National Traveller Women's Forum must lobby to have Travellers included as they are not included as a matter of right.  When the Equal Status and Incitement to Hatred Acts were initiated they did not include Travellers, nor were Travellers automatically included within the scope of the Press Council and lobbying was required to address the issue.</p><p>  Some people assert that the protection afforded to Travellers under the Equal Status Act is sufficient.  As my submission sets out, however, there is a lack of legal clarity in this regard.  As Travellers are not recognised as an ethnic group, the question arises as to whether Travellers can seek the application of the EU racial equality directive in national courts or seek to impugn the State in relation to the transposition of the directive.  The lack of legal clarity on these issues is a serious matter.  It is not a case of paranoia on our part because we have experienced this in the Irish Traveller Movement law centre.  The fact that Travellers are not recognised as an ethnic group has been used against us in cases taken by the law centre.  I am unable to give clients advice on the interpretation of whether the Equal Status Act transposes the racial equality directive because no one can give such advice.  Ireland has a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council but is refusing to recognise the country's indigenous ethnic group as a people in accordance with international human rights norms and anthropological and sociological norms and definitions.  This is an uncomfortable position for the State to be in. </p></speech>

If one considers the composition of the D&aacute;il, it is 87% male, almost exclusively white, does not include anyone from a Traveller background, as far as we are aware, and has few Members from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual, LGBT, community.  Unfortunately, therefore, when one seeks to run for election some people use hatred of minorities as a political platform.  Given that minorities are powerless and do not have the same access to mainstream media as others or political power and people willing to advocate for them, the fear factor tends to win out.  Unfortunately, the Traveller community has been on the receiving end of prejudice, including in some disgraceful recent cases.  Individual councillors or Deputies who have made outrageous statements have never paid a political price for doing so.</p><p>  Inequality is incredibly destructive.  Discrimination and inequality impacts on the individual and his or her community and hangs over him or her for life.  I am delighted we are having a positive discussion about a step the country and travelling community wish to take.  A major healing process can take place between two groups that have probably never come to terms with each other.  This is what is so engaging, attractive and positive about the discussion on ethnic status for Traveller people.</p><p>  The international argument for ethnic status is undeniable.  Do the witnesses agree that it would be a wonderful step for the Traveller community, one which would also bring responsibility, and something the settled community will also have to embrace and celebrate?  Ethnic status must not be viewed as exclusively an issue for the Traveller community, as it is one for all of Irish society and one which everyone should feel part of and celebrate.  In response to the decision made at the weekend on gay marriage, some people indicated their marriage will be slightly diminished if we extend marriage rights to other people.  I ask the witnesses to nail the lie that ethnic status for Travellers will somehow diminish other people's sense of themselves or identity.  On the contrary, it is a major cause for celebration.  An argument based on the law of unintended consequences is always rolled out to oppose such steps. </p></speech>

When one considers the context in which the Traveller community finds itself, educational outcomes for Travellers are much inferior to those of the settled community, few Travellers have an opportunity to go to post-primary education, never mind third level education, and the outcomes of accommodation policy are despicable.  The health inequalities between the two communities show that, on average, a Traveller man will live 15 years less than his settled counterpart and a Traveller woman will live 12 years less than her settled counterpart.  The infant mortality rate among Travellers is almost four times the national average.  Ms Quilligan referred to the suicide rate among Travellers, which is almost seven times higher than in the settled community.  There is also a significant and growing drugs problem in the community and an alcohol problem.  All of these issues are fundamentally tied up with the issue of identity and for these reasons, the issue of ethnic status has more than practical implications for us.  It has symbolic meaning to us in terms of our self-esteem, self-worth, confidence and status in society overall.  That is the point I was trying to make.  It is not some sort of academic, ideological or philosophical debate but an issue with practical and symbolic implications.  This is a core point and the reason ethnic status is the human rights issue for our generation, in the same way that same sex marriage will be the issue for many people, including Travellers.  The starting point, in the context in which we find ourselves, is that choosing not to recognise Traveller ethnicity has cost implications.</p><p>  I can only speculate as to whether the Government has done its own work and research which may show cost implications in recognising Traveller ethnicity.  While that may be the case, investment and parity of esteem are needed in the long term.</p><p>  There is a peculiar understanding about ethnicity in an Irish context in that we seem to attribute it to minority groups only.  People tend to overlook that there are also majority ethnic groups.  In the Irish context, settled people belong to a majority ethnic group.  I am not suggesting that all the members present practise the same traditions or hold the same values but they all belong to one ethnic group.</p> <p>I am not suggesting that all settled people have the same traditions and values but they all belong to the same ethnic group.  Settled people have no need to be conscious of that because they have developed an infrastructure which supports and validates their ethnicity.  We do not have the same infrastructure.  I would like Traveller history and identity to be reflected in our schools.  I would like our history, our culture and our contribution to Irish society to be reflected in museums and heritage centres.</p><p> As already stated, we do not have the relevant infrastructure.  We are continually conscious of that fact.  Our ethnicity is, therefore, always under siege and being contested and questioned in a way that does not happen to other groups.  That is the fundamental message we are trying to get across to members and I hope we will succeed in that regard.  I have never had an opportunity to meet the Attorney General or to hear an explanation as to why the Government has refused to recognise Traveller ethnicity.  I hope, therefore, the committee will at some point invite the Attorney General to appear before it in order that she might explain what is the objection-----</p></speech>

We are of the view that focusing on ethnicity will commence a dialogue and foster an environment of respect and understanding.  We believe that, in general, Irish people are good people.  We are known throughout the world for being generous, good-hearted and welcoming.  However, the question of Travellers relates to one of the last battles.  Very good-hearted and politically correct people still feel it is okay to openly discriminate against us, to make anti-Traveller comments and to use the "K" word in reference to us.  I refer here to conversations which take place around the dinner table in good, respectable homes and in good, respectable offices.  In these places, we continue to be discriminated against and spoken about as if we come from another world.  Recognition of our ethnicity would be a start in the context of commencing a dialogue, promoting respect and understanding between both communities and, hopefully, rolling back the years of conflict we have experienced.  We find ourselves standing in a place that is not very nice.  We are continually justifying ourselves, fighting for our rights and explaining who we are.  We know there is a lack of understanding among the general public with regard to who we are.</p></speech>

I spoke to the latter earlier and discovered that one of their number is a native of Offaly.  It was lovely to meet all of them.</p><p>  Our guests' presentations have been both informative and educational.  In the context of what they are seeking, have our guests liaised with the Department of Justice and Equality's Traveller policy division?  Have they engaged with the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office?  Our guests stated that the fact Travellers are not identified as a separate ethnic group excludes them - unless they have to do battle - from the various projects to which they want access.  To what type of projects are they referring?  Of the 40,000 members of the Traveller community to which reference was made, how many are actually settled, how many move during the summer months and how many are always on the move throughout and out of the country?</p><p>  I take our guests' point with regard to recording Traveller history.  It is extremely important that it should be recorded.  I have seen many old photographs of members of the Traveller community and, as a county councillor and a member of my local authority's Traveller committee, I received the magazine for a number of years.  I found the magazine fascinating and there is no doubt that the Traveller community has an incredible history which we do not discuss enough.</p><p>  Mr. Collins referred to the Roma community in Romania and ethnic recognition.  Is there any evidence available in respect of how successful this recognition has been for the Roma community in Romania?  What can we learn from what happened in that instance?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.692" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Brigid Quilligan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013041700008#G00800"><p>I will take a stab at answering some of them and then others can come in.  We are in close contact with the Department of Justice and Equality's Traveller policy division on an ongoing basis in the context of the question of Traveller ethnicity.  The division is fully aware of our campaign during the past 25 years to have our ethnicity recognised.  I am sure those in the division are blue in the face listening to us.  We are of the view that there is a blockage somewhere along the line.  The division is the liaison between us and the various Ministers.  As Mr. Collins stated, we held a conference on ethnicity last September.  That conference was supported by the national Traveller monitoring and advisory committee, which comes under the remit of the Department.  With the exception of one individual, every Traveller present was in favour of our ethnicity being recognised.  The Department is, therefore, fully aware of our position on Traveller ethnicity.  We try to work with the Department in a collaborative way and we hope to work with it in an even more collaborative way on the issue of Traveller ethnicity.  We seek its support in respect of that matter.</p><p>  We also liaise with the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office.  The national groups meet representatives from the office once a year and we attend its conference.  Again, there is an issue in terms of our being recognised as an ethnic group.  We can liaise with the office's liaison officers throughout the country but, again, it is very wishy-washy.  For example, one of our members went into the Garda station in Ballyshannon-----</p></speech>

The garda on duty was not aware of the existence of the legislation to which I refer and advised the person that it would not apply to them in any event because they were not a member of an ethnic minority.  We collaborate with people but obviously there is room for even further collaboration.</p><p>  On nomadism, the Irish Traveller Movement is currently hosting a national conference to deal with the crisis we face in the context of accommodation.  The most recent figures available to us will be released at that conference today.  We can, therefore, submit them to the Chairman for distribution to members later in the day.</p></speech>

As a number of speakers indicated, this, in itself, will not act as a panacea but it is a step in the right direction.  It needs to be followed up with a policy and legal framework which can, in turn, create the conditions in which our existence and contribution to Irish society can be affirmed and celebrated.  Under international law, the right to self-identification is sacrosanct.  However, as a result of the hostile environment in which we live, it is easier for Travellers to choose not to be Travellers.  We need to reverse that and consider how we can create the conditions in which one's identity can be affirmed and celebrated.  There is no doubt that many more people would identify themselves as members of the Traveller community if we created a context in which our ethnicity is affirmed and celebrated and an infrastructure which supports that ethnicity.  It is not a question of how many Travellers want to pursue a nomadic existence or wish to research, practice and speak the language, rather it is a question of choice.</p> <p>However, we do not have that choice because we have not created the conditions that would facilitate it.  I do not know how many Travellers want to be nomadic, speak the language or have their culture reflected in the educational curriculum.  It is a question of creating the conditions in which people can make these choices, which can only be done by recognising Traveller ethnicity and introducing a legal and policy framework, whereby one is free to choose to give expression to one's identity.  We do not have that luxury.</p><p> Irish society has made considerable progress in terms of human rights, although we still have a long way to go.  It is not that long ago when homosexuality was criminalised.  Thanks be to God, that is no longer the case.  Recently there was an apology to the victims of the Magdalen laundries.  Several years ago the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, apologised to the victims of clerical sexual abuse.  We are becoming more enlightened as a society, but we want that spirit of inclusivity extended to our community.  Frankly, we have not seen this happen yet.</p></speech>

International human rights and equality protections do not automatically include Travellers because Travellers are not recognised as an ethnic group.  I have made an interesting observation on the benefit of recognising Traveller ethnicity.  It is interesting that Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn needed to ask Ms Quilligan and Mr. Collins about their history.  All of the members before me are educated and we should know.  There are many versions of history.  As a woman, for example, I often feel women have been written out of history because history is written by men.  Travellers and their contribution have been written out of history.  We should have been taught it in school.</p><p>  There is more.  When I learned about Travellers in the civil, social and political education, CSPE, programme, it was about deprivation.  We do not learn about the richness of their culture.  Ethnicity recognition will bring about an enrichment of society by valuing an indigenous group.  It must be noted that there have been cuts to the Traveller education budget.  On average, &euro;17 million per annum used to be spent, but in 2010 that budget was cut totally.  Many of the special provisions, for example, the Traveller transport scheme and the allocation of special teachers, were axed.  That pain will be felt for generations to come.</p><p>  We should know the history of Travellers.  I hope ethnicity recognition will bring about value and respect.</p></speech>

I have often heard Mr. Collins speak.  He is a powerful advocate.  However, I have never heard Ms Quilligan speak.  She should do so more often.  I was surprised by her contribution.  Coming from Kilkenny and having been a member of the local authority which was involved with the Traveller community, I want to focus on a specific comment made by Ms Quilligan on a matter of which I was not aware, namely, the suicide rate among the Traveller community.</p><p>  In the context of our discussion on ethnicity, is there practical discrimination?  I agree that there is casual discrimination, even among people who regard themselves as educated and politically correct and who throw around phrases not heard in the past.  I often speak with my mother.  She is elderly, but she refers to the symbiotic relationship between small rural farmers and the Travellers who visited areas during the summer while she was growing up in the 1940s and 1950s.  As Ms Fay mentioned, that relationship changed in the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>  Is there a denial of access to services?  While the settled community has always regarded mental health issues as a taboo subject, are they even more so in the Traveller community?  It is probably too much to expect a brief explanation, but why is there such a significant disparity in the rate of suicide between the Traveller community and the settled community?</p><p>  Mr. Collins is right about newspaper headlines.  A member of the Traveller community who does something is identified as being a Traveller.  If a politician does something, he or she is identified as being a politician.  We have empathy in that regard.</p></speech>

People internalise it.  Consider any minority across the globe that has been marginalised or excluded for generations, for example, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia or America or the Maori of New Zealand.  The suicide rate among such peoples is higher than it is among the majority population.</p><p>  Ms Fay and Mr. Collins, whose organisation deals with health matters more than ours, might address my next point.  There is an issue in accessing mental health services.  If Travellers can access them, they must then justify their culture to their counsellors.  Some Travellers do not have access to a doctor because they cannot register with one.  A difficulty is presented by the fact that it is not culturally appropriate to access mental health services and that the person with whom the Traveller is dealing does not value that culture.  Not only must one discuss one's mental illness, but one must also justify one's ethnicity.  That has been my personal experience, but, of the Travellers present who I know, each has been impacted on by suicide.  It is an epidemic.  I come from Killarney and the number of people close to me who have passed away through suicide in recent years is shocking.</p><p>  A component of this issue is the crisis of identity and not feeling part of anything.  People need to have a sense of belonging.  Thank God for the increased awareness of the fact that good mental health is as important as physical well-being.  Mr. Thomas McCann, a Traveller psychotherapist, refers to the link between mental health and oppression.  The effect on our people is staggering.  It is a generational issue.  My earliest incident of discrimination was as a four year old in school.  My young son is 13 years of age and attends a good school that has good policies, yet everyday he must correct someone who uses the word "knacker" and act like an advocate for his community.  Can members imagine the weight on a 13 year old's shoulders?  If someone makes an anti-Traveller comment, he feels he must correct it.  This happens everywhere our children go.  It is no surprise that the suicide rate is higher, but I am sorry that I am not able to elaborate further on the matter.  Perhaps Ms Fay might contribute.</p></speech>

It showed a mortality rate three and a half times the national average between men, women and children, a huge disparity in life expectancy, high levels of morbidity and high levels of mortality due to suicide.  The abuse is that since that time there has been no action plan to address the findings of the all-Ireland health study.  The Department of Health has refused to develop core recommendations to develop an action plan to address the findings of the study.  The Traveller health budget has been decimated both pre-austerity and following it.  The criminal aspect is that it was used to balance the HSE's books in 2006 and 2007 and the legacy continues today.  There are not enough resources to address the Traveller health inequalities.</p><p> The third issue relates to the new directorates being set up in the health service.  The national Traveller health advisory committee has not met since last October because we are not allowed to meet owing to the row about the lack of an action plan.  This is disgraceful in terms of human rights and the matter must be addressed.</p><p> The mental health issues have been well documented.  To relate them back to ethnicity, one of the practical implications in the denial of Traveller ethnicity is the mindset of many civil servants at both national and local level where the default mechanism is one of assimilation.  The Traveller accommodation budget has not even been drawn down.  Even in times of austerity there is an underspend and many Travellers are forced into private rented accommodation and dispersed.  Young women with children live in apartment blocks and are totally isolated.  They miss their mothers, sisters, aunts and cousins.  All of this has a big impact on mental health.</p><p> A big issue that emerged in the all-Ireland Traveller health study was the level of trust.  Approximately 40% of Travellers had trust in the health service, while the level among the general population was 84%.  Many issues arise in terms of access and quality of service.  The big challenge is the outcomes from services.  The way to address this is to have an ethnic identifier across all administrative systems in order that we can see what is happening in education, health and the provision of accommodation and the outcomes.  We do not have that information.  The danger is that Travellers will be excluded if the ethic identifier has to be introduced under data developments at a European level because they are not recognised as an ethnic group.  There are huge practical reasons for the recognition of Traveller ethnicity, not just legal or ideological but also practical reasons that affect their human rights on a daily basis.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I was at another meeting.  However, I have listened to the answers given to the various questions asked.  </p><p>  Some of the statistics and stories related are shocking.  Ms Fay is correct to say people in the settled community just get on with their lives and do not give a second thought to the discrimination experienced by the Traveller community.</p><p>  I live in Bray where we have a great Traveller community.  The training and development centre run by Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Brien is fantastic and does tremendous work.  Like other members, I was a member of a local authority and involved in housing and accommodation matters.</p><p>  I do not have a question as such.  Prior to today I always felt I knew a lot about Travellers, but it is clear that I do not.  I urge the Chairman to invite the delegates back again, as it would be interesting to hear stories from some of the accompanying Traveller men and women to give us more information.  Information is power.  I hope the committee can get the Minister on board to progress the issue.</p><p>  I thank Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn for being rapporteur for the committee and the tremendous work he has undertaken.</p></speech>

I was also at a meeting and then had to be in the Seanad Chamber and got delayed.  I wanted to attend this meeting.  I also commend Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn for putting the issue on the agenda of the committee and thank the delegates for attending.</p><p>  As a lawyer and someone who has worked on equality legislation, I have always instinctively believed the recognition of Traveller ethnicity is important for legally symbolic reasons to do with equality.  I am particularly interested in the last comment made by Ms Fay on the practical reasons for recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  That is something we must emphasise because some of the time the argument is made very much in human rights language, something we all appreciate, but there is also an important case to be made on the practical implications.  People ask what is the point of it and why one should seek it.  That is an important point for the committee to take on board.</p></speech>

The presentations were very powerful and I am sure all would agree it has been a good initial interaction.  The consensus is that we will have further interaction later in the year, if possible, to tease out some of the issues raised.  It seems one issue is the understanding of ethnicity which has been well explained and my understanding has improved as a result.  It is not about race or culture; there is also a sociological aspect which we must tease out.  One speaker referred to a lack of understanding and knowledge.  If we can add to this, we will do something good.  We have made a start today and will take it from there.</p><p>  I was also struck by the richness of tradition outlined and would like to learn more about it.  I sense that there is a very rich tradition, but not many people know about it.  I do not know enough about it and would like to learn more.  It would also be interesting to know about the history of Travellers.</p><p>  The delegates might not wish to comment further as time is getting tight, but my sense is that, in addition to Travellers, there are traders who are sometimes confused about the Traveller community.  People mix them up.  We must take into account the fact that there might be people without Traveller ethnicity who can give Travellers a bad name owing to their behaviour.</p></speech>

For the record, the recommendations are, first, that the committee note that the World Health Organisation's international EMF project is expected to issue a formal risk assessment of all studied health outcomes from radiofrequency field exposure in 2014.  Second, the view of the committee is that publication of the risk assessment will present a further opportunity for review of public policy in regard to non-ionising radiation.

The view of the committee is that publication of the report will present an opportunity for informed debate in regard to public policy in this area.

It is something with which not many of us are familiar - certainly not myself, as I have never been involved with diving in any way.  This committee has made clear that we must be made aware of previous action taken by petitioners.  In this case the petitioner appears to have lobbied in the United Kingdom regarding this matter, and that is to be lauded, but we do not know whether he may have been involved already with the public consultation that occurred some years ago on the diving industry regulations.  It would help us to know this, and he might indicate whether we can be of any further assistance.  I would recommend the committee seek clarification of the work he may have done and then make a decision as to whether we close the petition or refer it to the relevant Department, which I believe is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></speech>

We have a major problem with the consumption of alcohol which kills 1,200 people per year in Ireland.  Some 2,000 Irish people are in hospital beds today owing to alcohol use.  The harm generated by alcohol is felt not just by drinkers but also by those around them.  Some 10% of Irish children say their lives have been adversely affected by their parents' drinking.</p> <p>More starkly, it is estimated that parental drinking accounts for one sixth of all cases of child abuse and neglect.  How strange these innocent victims of our drinking culture must find it looking into an Ireland that chooses to bombard them with positive images of alcohol, linking it with fun, social success and sporting prowess.  Alcohol Action Ireland was one of a vast number of stakeholders represented on the national substance misuse strategy steering group.  Like committee members, that group recognised that this was a complex health and social problem, with many factors influencing consumption and, therefore, requiring a multi-pronged approach.  Today we are discussing in isolation just one of the dozens of recommendations made in that report.  There is a danger that we will fail to see the big picture.  </p><p> In addition to making changes to pricing and availability to apply a brake on Ireland's runaway drinking culture, we must also take our foot off the accelerator.  Alcohol promotion via advertising and sponsorship acts as that accelerator.  While common sense tells us that sponsorship promotes consumption, with typical arrogance, the alcohol industry and those in receipt of its money demand that we provide them with evidence that it does.  It is this multi-billion euro industry that should be required to provide proof.  If they have proof that alcohol sponsorship does nothing to increase alcohol-related harm or drinking by adolescents, Alcohol Action Ireland would have no issue with this activity.</p><p> Although the recession has caused <i>per capita</i>consumption to fall slightly, Irish adult drinkers still consume, on average, the equivalent of one bottle of whiskey per man and woman per week.  This average consumption is well into the range of hazardous drinking, using WHO definitions.  The My World survey in 2012 demonstrated that the majority of young Irish men grew up to use alcohol in a manner that was harmful to their health.  Again, this information is based on on the World Health Organization's AUDIT screening instrument.  With 72,000 babies born each year, it is our view that this country now functions as a conveyor belt, producing very heavy drinkers, each of whom generates great profits for the alcohol industry. </p><p> The sports in receipt of the bulk of drink industry money are rugby, soccer and Gaelic games.  These sports are typically played by young men aged 15 to 29 years.  Young men tend to be healthy.  The two biggest causes of death among young men are suicide and accidents.  We all know that alcohol commonly has a role in accidents.  We also know from Irish research that it is a contributory factor in half of all suicides and that the majority of young men who kill themselves are drunk at the time.  Overall, it is estimated that alcohol is responsible for one in every four deaths among young males aged 15 to 29 years.  There is no<b></b>product on the planet that causes more deaths and social problems in young men.  We believe, therefore, that there is no product on the planet that could more inappropriately be promoted by sports organisations.  In terms of the harm experienced by the demographic who play these sports, it would make more sense to allow them to be sponsored by tobacco companies, as cigarettes tend to kill old people.</p><p> The age of onset of drinking is typically around 15 years.  During the next 12 months 60,000 children will start drinking.  Therefore, during the next five years 300,000 Irish children will commence their drinking careers.  Because they are going to grow up to be among the heaviest drinkers on earth by the time they are 20 years old, it is they who are the real targets of alcohol advertising and sponsorship.  From a business perspective, it is vital to establish brand awareness and, ideally, brand loyalty prior to children commencing drinking.  As was pointed out last weekend by a former president of the GAA, through our ridiculously lax advertising and sponsorship guidelines, we facilitate the drinks industry to groom children in the interests of profit to become the next generation of hard and heavy Irish drinkers.</p></speech>

We read with interest the transcript of the committee's interaction on 27 March with the three main sports bodies.  I have been playing sport since my early teens and only gave up contact sports after five years of playing over-35s soccer.  Like the majority of Irish adults, I, too, drink alcohol.  I continue to enjoy watching and attending all sports codes and agree that sports organisations have a very important part to play in the social life of the country.  I was, therefore, saddened by what the heads of the IRFU, the FAI and the GAA had to say to the committee on 27 March.</p><p>  I would like to concentrate in my presentation on the influence of alcohol marketing.  Alcohol marketing and advertising does work.  It influences young people's alcohol beliefs and behaviour.  The alcohol companies would not spend so much on marketing and advertising if it did not work.  That is obvious.  We have much evidence that young people exposed to alcohol branding begin drinking at an earlier age and that this can lead to dependence in adulthood.  The younger a person is when he or she commences drinking alcohol the greater the chance he or she will have a dependency problem from his or her 30s onwards.</p><p>  A study commissioned by the Department of Health in 2001 showed that alcohol advertisements were the favourite among children.  They are expensive to produce, but obviously they are the best advertisements.  A study in the United States in 2006 showed that young people who watched more alcohol advertisements on television were more likely to have drunk beer.  It also showed that for each dollar spent on alcohol advertisements alcohol consumption increased and that drinking by people brought up in more advertising rich environments plateaued in their late 20s, while drinking by people exposed to alcohol marketing plateaued in their early 20s.  As such, what one is exposed to as a teenager has long-term effects.  Another study in Australia and New Zealand showed that sports people exposed to alcohol sports sponsorship had higher drinking scores.  In this study approximately 600 people in New South Wales were asked about their exposure to sports sponsorship in their sports organisations.  There was a link between sports sponsorship and their drinking behaviour.</p></speech>

It showed that young people who were exposed early to alcohol marketing were more likely to commence drinking earlier or, if already drinking, were more likely to drink more.  There was what was termed a "dose response", namely, the more one was exposed the more one drank.  The statement that alcohol advertising does not influence behaviour is not true.  There is a great deal evidence to the contrary.</p><p>  The sports bodies and the alcohol industry are incorrect when they state there is no evidence that sports sponsorship by drinks companies influences children to drink.  The measures we are hoping will be introduced to break the link between sports bodies and alcohol marketing are a crucial part of our response as a country.  We have a big drinking problem and many young people are storing up trouble for themselves and their families in the future.  Sport is a very important part of our culture and long may it remain so, but let it not be dependent on alcohol money as seems to be the case.  The alcohol industry is making money from sports sponsorship.  Those involved on the health side believe there should be reduced alcohol sponsorship of sports.  Unfortunately, the sports bodies are very much in the pocket of the alcohol industry, which is a shame.  We would like them to take our point of view on board.  I appeal to members of the committee, as legislators, to implement some of the recommendations made.  Self-regulation does not work, as we have seen to our cost in other areas of public life.  </p><p>  I will be happy to elaborate on any of these points or answer questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.750" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. William Flannery" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013041700005#J00200"><p>I am the chair of the faculty of addiction psychiatry of the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland.</p><p>  The college has repeatedly called for the implementation of evidence-based measures to reduce alcohol-related harm.  Such measures include pricing, reducing availability and banning the promotion of alcohol.  In 2008, the college issued a policy paper calling for a ban on all alcohol advertising and sponsorship in Ireland, particularly given the evidence of adolescent alcohol-related harm.  Since then, additional national and international research has outlined the extent of alcohol advertising targeted at adolescents.</p><p>  Internationally, the British Medical Association, BMA, which advocates for the health of the public, has examined the damaging effect of alcohol marketing on young people.  It concluded alcohol marketing communications have a powerful effect on young people and are independently linked with the onset, amount and continuation of their drinking.  Through the use of TV, social networking, sponsorship of music and sporting events, they reinforce and exaggerate strong pro-alcohol social norms.  Its first recommendation was to ban all alcohol marketing communications.</p><p>  The scientific opinion of the Science Group of the European Alcohol and Health Forum found consistent evidence to demonstrate an impact of alcohol advertising on the uptake of drinking among non-drinking young people and increased consumption among existing drinkers.  A survey in New Zealand found that sports people receiving direct alcohol industry sponsorship reported more hazardous drinking than those not receiving sponsorship.  Finally, the World Health Organization has stressed the critical importance of delaying the onset of drinking in young people.</p><p>  Suicide is the leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds in Ireland.  We have the fourth highest rate of youth suicide in the EU.  Research from the National Suicide Research Foundation in 2010 found that alcohol was involved in 24% of all cases of deliberate self-harm, that is attempted suicide, which rose to 44% for male cases.  The association between alcohol and attempted suicide appears self-evident given the timing of peak presentation to accident and emergency departments around midnight on Sundays, Mondays and increasingly on or after public holidays.  More research from the National Suicide Research Foundation shows suicides among men rose sharply as the economy went into recession with higher rates for those in the construction industry and having a harmful drinking pattern.</p><p>  Given these facts, I am disappointed at the drinks industry behaviour towards the national substance misuse steering group.  The aim of the group was to develop an alcohol strategy to run alongside the national drug strategy.  The college, the drinks industry and representatives from other areas of health, community and government were there.  The college believed all present were acting in good faith and over two and a half years worked to reach a consensus.  The group issued its report just over a year ago.  Despite being in the group, the drinks industry chose to stand aside and issue a minority report.</p><p>  At a personal level, I have been working in psychiatry now for 15 years.  One of my first training positions was in child psychiatry where every morning the patients greeted me with &ldquo;Whassup&rdquo;.  This was a slogan for Budweiser at the time.  These patients were children, the majority under the age of 12.  It is these children who picked up on this advert who are now adults and making headlines about being drunk in Australia.</p><p>  I now run an addiction service in the midlands and most of the patients are dependent on alcohol - that is, alcoholics.  As anyone who knows an alcoholic is aware, denial is a strong feature of the illness.  They are convinced they need alcohol to be normal, to be happy and to function.  I hear the same language from those who have alcohol sponsors with statements such as "Without alcohol our sports, music or culture events will not happen" or "We need alcohol sponsorship to have major tournaments or to run our organisation", or "Alcohol is our culture".  Denial is very powerful.</p><p>  Sadly with some of my patients, my advice and that of their family, friends and work colleagues is ignored and they continue drinking to their death.  Since 1990 there have been 11 committees and 15 reports giving advice on how to tackle alcohol-related harm.  Just as the call to drink responsibly for an alcoholic does not work, I ask this committee to call a stop to the promotion of the drinks industry and call for a ban on all alcohol advertising and sponsorship.</p></speech>

Last week we had delegations from the GAA, rugby and soccer organisations and they suggested that a ban would lead to a reduction in their ability to fund participation programmes for children in many communities throughout the country.  As the witnesses are aware, all three organisations are embedded in communities where they do substantial work.  They have made a strong statement that a ban would inhibit the activities for young people in our communities.  Would any of the witnesses like to comment on that?</p></speech>

I understand from the clubs with which they are involved that mini-rugby and under-age gaelic are a major source of income for the clubs.  Armies of little lads are training away, generally trained by their dads, at minimal or no cost to the clubs, but the parents pay &euro;100 or &euro;200 a head per child per sport.  I refute the suggestion that a ban on the advertising of alcohol would inhibit those programmes and would ask the associations to give the committee the hard figures on that.  I agree the organisations will take a hit as a result of a ban, but that hit will be felt at the upper and elite levels as it will be the elite sports people and the coaches who will get less cash.  It will not have an impact on children.</p></speech>

The task force began in 2009 and we suggested a phased reduction in about four years from then, but now we are talking about 2016.  What the sporting bodies said was that in an ideal world, they would rather not have alcohol sponsorship and that they had never seen any evidence that it works.  However, it does work.  Therefore, if they say they will continue as they are doing because they do not believe it causes any harm, they are-----</p></speech>

The same issue arose in the context of tobacco sponsorship approximately ten or 15 years ago.  Some non-alcohol companies will sponsor sports.  We all want sporting organisations to flourish, but we believe they have been completely influenced by the alcohol industry.  If I was working for the alcohol industry, I would be doing what it is doing and trying to minimise the harm my product causes and trying to associate it with positive health.  This issue first arose about 2002 and the industry was concerned then that a ban would be introduced before the 2002 soccer world cup.  A generation of youngsters has been exposed to alcohol advertising since then and we have a very young age for the onset of drinking.  Other sponsors could be found for sporting organisations, such as sponsors from the mobile technology area.</p><p>  Reading between the lines of what the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU have said, there are probably differences in the degree of dependence on alcohol sponsorship.  However, it is unacceptable that our major sporting bodies are dismissing the evidence and saying they must continue to get funding through alcohol sponsorship.  We have a duty of care to our children.  Clubs must not be under any illusion that if they accept alcohol sponsorship, this will not increase drinking among young people.  They cannot pretend this is not a problem.  That is the reason I am saddened by the fact the sporting bodies have completely accepted the words of the drinks industry.</p></speech>

They are right in saying that we are legislators and have a job to do in terms of bringing forward proposals.  This is never easy.  We have been presented with facts from Alcohol Action Ireland, but I am not overly taken by what has been presented.  Perhaps the group can give us more backup data.  We have also had presentations from the sporting organisations, but two of them made a lazy sort of assertion that life will not go on if they do not continue to receive this sponsorship.  The GAA pretty much said that a ban on this sponsorship is not a deal breaker and it can survive.</p><p>  The way I look at this is that we have a dreadful culture of abuse of alcohol.  This is a cultural issue that existed before modern sport emerged in a televisual way and had more to do with an ancestral culture passed down from generation to generation.  Perhaps we need to consider this.  The sporting organisations made the point here when questioned on whether alcohol advertising had the potential to encourage the misuse of alcohol that it did not.  They also felt that it did not encourage the increased consumption of alcohol.  They made the point that the pie was so big and there were so many competitors for a slice of it, making sponsorship more about brand awareness and developing brand loyalty than about targeting or increasing the sale or consumption of alcohol.  What is the group's view on that?  Some people take a bland approach and see sponsorship and brand development as part of advertising.</p><p>  If we are to proceed as Alcohol Action Ireland recommends, there is an issue with regard to the practical implications.  One would have to consider how we could block content from other jurisdictions.  We live in a very open world where the flow of content is televisual, on the Internet, on the phone and on the iPad etc.  How can we prevent information presenting alcohol in a good light getting to young people?  It is all very well that the alcohol companies will no longer sponsor the local soccer club, but young people already access content in a mobile way over which we do not have any control because it is sourced from jurisdictions outside of ours.  Is Alcohol Action Ireland asking for something impossible in this regard?  Will the group also comment on the situation in France where a ban was introduced and the consumption of alcohol rose?  I see Dr. Smyth shaking his head and perhaps he can guide us on that.</p></speech>

However, I am pretty shocked by some of the assertions made and would like clarification on some issues.  The bigger picture was mentioned and it was suggested there is an issue with pricing and availability as well as with sports sponsorship.  Where does sports sponsorship rate as a priority in that regard?</p><p>  Is Alcohol Action Ireland seeking that sponsorship and funding by alcohol companies of sports be banned in isolation, thereby allowing for the money spent on that to go into radio, television and print advertising of alcohol?  How would the group deal with the situation where if Ireland passed legislation on this, we would still have multimedia and digital media putting advertising through to youngsters anyway?</p> <p>How would the witnesses deal with that?  How would they deal with the issue that was mentioned by Deputy Dooley?  My experience relates primarily to a single sporting organisation - the GAA.  The GAA might decide it could do without this form of sponsorship at the top level, but how would that be dealt with at local level?  If a pub and restaurant that provides support to the local GAA club in a town sponsors it in the name of the restaurant, everyone will know the sponsorship relates to the pub as well.  Are we talking about something that will not be possible to implement?</p><p> When Dr. Smyth mentioned the costs in this regard, he suggested that sporting organisations could do without the money.  While I am not here to speak on behalf of the sporting organisations, I would like to pick up on Dr. Smyth's remark that most of the coaching is done by parents rather than highly paid coaches.  As someone who has been coaching for many years, I am aware of the difficulties that can arise when parents coach their own children.  There needs to be a distinction between parents who help out and those who provide coaching.  I have often attended under-12 games where one would worry about the parents rather than the children.  Dangers exist in that respect as well.</p><p> I would like to mention something else I have noticed during my involvement in coaching over the years.  Four or five years ago, when I was helping to train a local club team, I looked out the window to see two or three of the guys who were supposed to be training that day walking by with 24-can slabs of &euro;1 beer on their shoulders.  It was clear what they were planning to do instead of attending training.  I know from my experience of coaching that sport helps to encourage people to be disciplined.  I would love if they had gone training that evening instead of going home with slabs of beer on their shoulders.  Will this country's issues with drink be solved if we ban alcohol sponsorship, advertisement and promotion of sporting teams and events?  That is the key to this.</p><p> Having listened to the three presentations, it seems to me that the witnesses are saying this entire problem would be solved if we could prohibit alcohol altogether.  Are we heading into a prohibition situation?  Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, who is in attendance, has suggested at other forums that cannabis should be legalised and that such a move would bring a great deal of funding to Governments.  Is it possible that alcohol will be driven underground in the future but drugs will be okay?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the bigger picture.  There are approximately 40 recommendations, across many domains, in the substance misuse strategy.  Some of the recommendations relate to the availability of cheap drink.  It has been recommended that corner shops should not be able to sell drink as they can at present.  The approach that has been taken with regard to drink-driving has been very successful.  There has been a big improvement on the roads as a result of the legislation that was needed in that case.  Some of the recommendations relate to marketing, promotions and culture.  Sport and music are the two biggest forms of culture that grab the hearts and minds of Irish people of all ages.  There is strong evidence that the potential and the reality of people drinking more - particularly younger people - increases when the alcohol industry gets itself gripped onto sports.  We are all pro-sport.  Our problem relates to the sporting bodies.  I think the GAA is different because it has alternative strategies.  It has taken a very public position on drink for quite a while.</p></speech>

We have been asked to talk about this aspect of the issue today.  We know what the alcohol industry's position will be.  We are making our position known, just as the Department of Health has done.  As the committee knows, all of this is being discussed in the hope that some sort of political position will be reached soon.  Our position is that the process of phasing out the alcohol sponsorship of sports should be commenced.  It is doable.  Of course it will not sort out everything.  The overall aim is to reduce consumption of and harm caused by alcohol by approximately 15%.  If there are fewer people in trouble, there will be less pressure on the health service.  We are not here because this is a trivial issue.  It is a very serious issue.  It is important to address marketing by encouraging the sporting bodies to seek funding from other avenues.  I would like to refer to a suggestion that was made in one of the newspapers I mentioned.  In Australia, it has been proposed that the taxes collected through excise duty on alcohol should be used to fill the gap.  Of course we do not want the sporting bodies to struggle.  Nobody is saying they should.  We are saying we need to exert some pressure.  Alcohol is causing harm.  We have big problems.  I remind Deputy Dooley that all the evidence is available on our website.  It will help the members of the committee to make their decision on the basis of our material as well as what they have been told by the sporting bodies.</p></speech>

At the moment, their relationship with these drinks companies is causing a great deal of harm to our young people.  As health professionals, we are concerned about that.  We believe that legislators are concerned about it as well.  Legislation is sometimes needed in order to change behaviour.  Voluntary codes can be tried in any field, but legislation is ultimately needed.</p></speech>

The French people and the French Government became very concerned about alcohol consumption levels in the 1980s.  A complex multi-pronged strategy was introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  This included a ban on sponsorship and severe restrictions on advertising.  Over the following four or five years, <i>per capita</i> consumption decreased by approximately 50%.  The point made by the sporting organisations is that youth drinking, specifically, has increased slightly in France in recent years.  If that is an indication of the inability of sponsorship curtailment to solve the drink problem, that should not come as news to anyone.  It is a multifaceted problem.  The escalation in drinking among young people in France is reflected across the Mediterranean.  Perhaps youth culture is becoming more homogenised as a result of the influence of MTV, etc.  It has been suggested that drunkenness among people in this age range has become more acceptable in Mediterranean countries than it used to be.  That has nothing to do with sports sponsorship.  The short-term impact of the French prohibition on sports sponsorship, as part of a broader suite of measures like those recommended in our substance misuse strategy, was to reduce consumption and, importantly, to reduce harm.  We do not want people to drink less for the sake of it - we want to see fewer body bags, fewer suicides and fewer people in our emergency departments, psychiatric hospitals and prison cells.</p><p>  Both Deputies asked how we propose to deal with the challenge of alcohol-related content.  The French have laudably stood alone in Europe by insisting on restrictions, at significant costs to local organisations.  When we watch Champions League matches from France, we do not see the Heineken logo.  Similarly, the Heineken Cup is known as the H Cup in France.  Ireland needs to decide whether it will wait for everyone else, or whether the problem is currently bad enough to justify showing some leadership on this issue as we did in the case of the smoking ban, when the world followed.  We need to put these actions in place while advocating loudly and consistently at European level to get our colleagues in Europe to follow what we do.  I understand that Norway is putting restrictions in place as we speak.</p></speech>

It is a sort of mantra on the part of the drinks industry.  Certain people seem to believe that the more something is repeated, the more true it becomes.  The reality is that there is clear scientific evidence to link alcohol sponsorship of sports with alcohol use and misuse among young people.  The science group of the European Alcohol and Health Forum examined many longitudinal studies.  It looked at patterns of behaviour over periods of time, which is the most effective way of measuring change.</p> <p>They looked at 13 studies which involved 38,000 young people between the ages of ten and 21.  Of those 13 studies nine were from America, one from New Zealand, one from Belgium and one from Germany.  Seven of the studies showed that there was clear evidence that the data related to initiation of alcohol use among non-drinkers.  Three of the studies indicated that the maintenance and frequency of alcohol use among people who were drinking increased and seven of the studies showed that on the overall pattern of people who are not drinking, alcohol sponsorship has an effect on their alcohol use.  Only one of the studies would have indicated that there was no impact; that study was in relation to outdoor advertising near schools.  All of the other studies, which included 38,000 people, indicated a clear link between sponsorship, marketing, advertising and the initiation and use of alcohol by young people.  It is young people we are concerned about.  The Deputy asked about all the other social media issues that are thrown at young people.  Sport is supposed to be a healthy option for a young person.  If one is linking sport with alcohol, which has clear detrimental health effects for young people, it is incongruous, it does not work.   </p></speech>

Legislation and regulation are about making it easy for people to do the right thing and making it difficult for people to do the wrong thing, as expressed by society, through legislators and based on available evidence.  If any of us were to go to any of the sporting organisations and say they could replace what they are currently getting from the alcohol companies with A, B, C plus what they are getting we would not have this debate and the sporting organisations accept that.  We talked about the sporting bodies at national level.  At local level clubs would have difficulty in paying for insurance, transport and a kit unless the local pub sponsored them.  It may not be a large amount of money but the sponsorship is crucial to the running of the under-eights, under 12s and under 16s teams.  What are the alternatives?  If they go to the banks, they will take the shirts off their back and will certainly not sponsor their kit.  They do not have that many options.  That is my first concern.  To some extent that issue might be addressed through phasing in but we or somebody needs to identify alternative sources of financial support if the sports companies are to deliver the benefits that I see in my local community, particularly at under age level and in teenage teams.</p><p>  Is there any research or data that identifies the level of alcohol abuse, the level of suicide or self harm attempts among young people who commenced drinking before the legal minimum age?  In other words, are we failing to enforce existing legislation in this area?  It is a frightening statistic that Irish adult drinkers still consume the equivalent of one bottle of whisky on average for every man and woman per week.  I think it was Dr. Bobby Smith who gave that statistic.  Is that a percentage of alcohol consumers or a percentage of adults over the age of 18 years? </p></speech>

I am in favour of a total ban on sponsorship of any of the national sports by alcohol companies.  Just as some people become dependent on alcohol, cocaine, hash, and so on, the drinks companies, very cleverly, have manoeuvred in the past 20 or 30 years into a situation where the major sporting bodies depend on them.  I cited an example when the sporting bodies appeared before the committee.  People ask where the sporting bodies will get their money from as if the only commercial operations in the country were alcohol companies.  We all know they are not.  We also know, or at least we should face up to the fact, that none of the other commercial operators can compete with the alcohol industry because they have more money.  That is the reality.</p><p>  The French Government was quite right to phase alcohol sponsorship out in 1991.  It did so very cleverly.  I heard some rubbish coming from the alcohol industry in relation to the French experience.  These people should take a look at the report prepared two years after the ban, after the phasing out of sponsorship of the sports bodies by alcohol companies in France.  I will give one example.  There was a decline in domestic violence.  These people never mention that.  I represent a constituency which is almost exclusively working class.  People stand up and say that the alcohol thing in Ireland is a cross-community issue.  It affects all the community but it affects working class people much more.  One has only to ask a primary school teacher in a working class community and he or she will tell one all about it.</p><p>  The phrase "being in denial" was used.  That alcoholics are in denial is true.  There are more people than alcoholics in denial.  Irish society is in denial.  On the basis of the number of reports that came out of this House, most politicians are in denial.  There are so many reports that one could actually build a barricade on Kildare Street, but none is ever acted upon.  One of the glaring examples of the lack of courage among politicians to deal with the national drug - it is a gateway drug and not a soft drink - was when the controversy arose about head shops.  I know nothing about head shops except what I read.  I was not a member of this esteemed body when the head shops became an issue.  There was such a flurry around here that within a matter of weeks the head shops were banned.  I do not know how one can calculate the damage caused by head shops compared to what the national drug has cost over the years.  It costs &euro;3.4 billion every year in domestic violence, courts services, etc.  There is an issue here that needs to be addressed.     </p></speech>

There has to be an element of people working through within themselves what are the potential unintended consequences of all this.  What we are talking about here is sponsorship and high profile bombardment by the large alcohol companies of the major sporting bodies.  There are different issues when it comes to local clubs.  People suffer hugely because of alcohol-related problems.  For some it is a matter of shame.  Nobody will go public on this issue.  I am not exaggerating but the problem is huge within the health service.  There are also social impacts.  There are evidence-based strategies that work.  This country needs them more than most because of our drinking patterns.</p> <p>I will not say further negative things about the industry, but the committee must hear about the impact there has been.  Members will be aware of it from their own work.</p></speech>

I mentioned the substance abuse strategy group before.  I thought we were there to address real issues and the practical implementation of the 40 recommendations made, some of which were not in accordance with my position, but there was consensus on them within the group.  I was disappointed that the drinks industry had chosen to stand aside, which raised the question of what exactly we had achieved after two and a half years.  Some of the solutions to the issues raised are within the recommendations of the strategy group.</p><p>  As a psychiatrist, my job is to prevent suicide, which, unfortunately, has become more and more widespread.  Once again, we win when it comes to the European Union in having one of the highest rates of youth suicide, which is matched by one of the highest rates of binge drinking.  These two issues are certainly related.</p></speech>

The joint committee has a sports remit.  In that regard, I want to touch on a question posed by Deputy O'Mahony.  In the suite of recommendations what is the priority or urgency of the proposed phased ban on sponsorship?  I have a concern.  If sponsorship was to be phased out, the national sports bodies could easily fill the gap.  Information and communications technology accounts for some &euro;60 billion, or 35%, of total exports, but I rarely see the brands of companies in that sector in sports organisations.  They are missing.  The drinks industry has a very active advertising budget and uses its initiative on how it is spent.  If a ban is phased in or imposed, the industry will not invest 40% of its advertising budget somewhere else.  Drinks companies will advertise where young people are.  One might see them advertising on games consoles.  While advertising money may not come to sports organisations, it may go to sports personalities, subliminally.</p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony touched on the club issue.  I have not reached the lofty heights reached by the Deputy in the GAA, but I was an active club footballer and coach.  When I started, it was tolerated to have a drink a few days before a championship match.  Now, it would not be unusual for a club player to avoid alcohol and bars for three or four weeks before a game.  In the national arena, however, one reads in the gossip columns about sports personalities who have been out for the night after a Premiership or FA Cup game, even though there is another game a week later.  It becomes acceptable again.  This is where we have a problem when it comes to sport.  The national side will look after itself and the GAA seems to have a strong, different opinion.  I have seen in the case of one club in County Kerry that it cost &euro;30,000 to get to an all-Ireland final - to put jerseys on 30 guys to get them to the end of a championship campaign.  Alcohol would not have been a feature of the lives of these 30 guys for eight months of that year.</p><p>  The problem for the committee is how to make one policy fit all.  I am concerned that the effort would slip sideways and that the advertising budgets of drinks companies would be spent in areas which were not as public or as well supervised and which might be even more threatening to the well-being of younger people.  If the delegates have a view on this, I would be very interested to hear it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-17a.777" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013041700009#N00400"><p>I had worries about alcohol advertising in sport and elsewhere before I attended the committee, having read quite a bit about the subject.  Some of the things the heads of the main sports organisations said to the committee on the last occasion were astounding.  They did not fit with what I had read about the damage sponsorship by drinks companies of sports events and in general caused.  Having listened to the delegates, I would like to have a look at some of the studies to which they have referred.  I believe what they are saying, which is that it is not good and is, in fact, very bad.</p><p>  The suggestion that the main sports organisations are dependent on sponsorship is true, which they showed by saying at our meeting that sponsorship was not the problem but the selling of alcohol in supermarkets at low prices.  That argument is not good enough.  It is the sort of argument I have with my daughters when one of them does something wrong and tries to get off by suggesting her sister has done something even more wrong.  That does not actually let the first child off.  They have still done something wrong and it needs to be changed.  In fairness to the sports organisations, they told us that if they could get the money somewhere else, they would not go near sponsorship by drinks companies.  We must listen to this.  They need the money and will not have it if we ban such sponsorship.  We must find another way to get the money.</p><p>  There was a suggestion about using the money generated through excise duties for sport.  The committee has been told that alcohol abuse costs the country &euro;3.4 billion every year.  If we could reduce the figure by 1%, it would save the State &euro;34 million.  We did not get a figure from the three main sports organisations the last day, but from what they told us, I get the impression that the money they receive through sponsorship does not amount to much more than &euro;34 million.  The delegates have made it quite clear that it is not good to have a connection between sport and the alcohol industry and I cannot see how anyone could argue with them.  If we ban alcohol advertising within sport, we must start to explore alternative revenue streams.  If it means putting an extra penny on a pint or a short and investing the revenue generated in sport, it must be done.</p><p>  Alcohol advertising should not only be banned in sport, it should be banned full stop.  The idea that one would promote - another word for which is "push" - a drug to young people cannot be accepted.  In reality, people will drink in any event.  I drink and like to do so.  Every now and then I like to get drunk, which is perhaps not the politically correct thing to say, but I recognise the damage alcohol causes.</p> <p>Deputy O'Mahony wondered would we end up banning alcohol.  That would be ridiculous.  They tried that in the early part of the last century in the United States and to this day there is a Mafia as a result.  That would not be a good way to go.  Deputy O'Mahony's point that somehow alcohol is not really a drug is very important.  It is a drug and until we face that fact we will never really solve the problem because a drug is not defined by its legality or otherwise.  It is a pharmacological question.  It has nothing to do with legality.  Alcohol is a drug.  It is a mind-altering substance.  I know.  I have tried it.  To keep half-denying that means that we will never deal with the problem.  There is an idea that if alcohol were banned, which it would not be, other drugs might be legalised.  Maybe we can learn something from places which have gone down the road of partial legality, or tolerance as they call it in Holland.  Marijuana cannot be advertised there.  The places where one purchases the drug cannot be called marijuana shops or anything like that.  They are called 'coffee shops'.  This is done so that young people will not walk by them and say "Oh look, this is where a certain substance is sold."  It is just another coffee shop.  They are shielded from that.</p><p> What the witnesses have told us today is very important.  I look forward to reading more about it but they have further convinced me that alcohol sponsorship must be taken out of sport.  The sporting organisations will survive.  I want to make one final point.</p></speech>

There is a question.  Local clubs can survive without alcohol sponsorship.  In my first few years as a county councillor I set up a soccer league with 16 teams, in order to give people of all ages something to do.  Every week I received a phone call from a pub asking me would I bring them in there afterwards for a few sandwiches.  My response was to put the tournament on later to make sure they would not be able to get to the pub but this went on for two years.  We resisted it.  Our league was successful and we were not dependent on the alcohol industry.  There is another way.  There has to be another way because it is not acceptable for young people to go around with jerseys with advertisements for alcohol printed on them.  It is sick.</p></speech>

There are only 200 people in this country who can legislate.  They are the Members of these Houses and sometimes legislation is required to change behaviour and culture.  We are well past the time to do this.  I was on the task force in 2002 and at that time Diageo was very worried about a ban on sports sponsorship and that there would be no soccer sponsorship for the 2002 World Cup.  A decade has passed and there is an industry trying to do one thing and a public health group trying to do something else.  Unfortunately at the moment the sporting bodies are completely tied in with the industry.  I appeal to the members of this committee to come down on the side of health.  They can do it.  We cannot.  We can advocate what should be done.</p></speech>

In other words, if we could implement only two of the measures recommended in the substance misuse strategy, where would sponsorship lie?  It is not at the top of the list.  Curtailing availability, increasing cost and reducing affordability would be the bigger impact features.  We also believe that Deputy Flanagan is absolutely correct.  Even if sponsorship influences only 2% or 3% of those it reaches, 2% of 2,000 dead people could reduce the death toll by 60 per annum.</p></speech>

This cannot be treated in isolation.  I am anti-drink but I am trying to tease out how this can be done by isolating a particular group rather than attacking the whole problem.</p></speech>

The committee responsible for finance will worry about the impact an increase in excise duty will have on inflation.  Any committee which looks narrowly at the stakeholders for which it has primary responsibility has nothing to gain from this.  Unfortunately the problem is global.  It impinges on every aspect of society.  Each sector of society is probably going to have to take a bit of pain to get the broader benefit.</p><p>  Deputy Harrington asked where the money will go.  The tobacco industry spends as much on the marketing and promotion of its products now as it ever did.  It just does it in a different way.  Marketing will not go away but marketers will not be given direct access to our homes via sports sponsorship.  It will become less convenient, more expensive and less efficient for the companies to market alcohol.  I will use a brief anecdote to illustrate this.  I asked my eight year old son to name a cigarette brand, and I encourage the committee members to do likewise if they want evidence that bans do work.  He could not name any and suggested we Google it, despite the fact that his mother smokes cigarettes.  I asked him to name any brands of alcohol.  The first two to trip off his little lips were Guinness and Heineken.  He struggled beyond that.</p></speech>

We have spoken about the need to introduce a social responsibility levy on the drinks industry which could go some way towards funding sporting organisations.  There are alternative forms of sponsorship.  The drinks industry aggressively aims at sporting organisations to provide sponsorship for them.  If they were not there other areas of society would want to advertise through sport because it is seen as a healthy alternative for young people as they grow up.  RaboDirect has replaced Magners.</p> <p>Reference was made to Liverpool and Carlsberg.  When Liverpool played in France and Carlsberg did not appear on their jerseys, my son asked me what was going on.
