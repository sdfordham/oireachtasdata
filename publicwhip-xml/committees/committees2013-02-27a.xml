The select sub-committee will consider this Bill from now until 7 p.m.  If our consideration is not completed by this evening we will resume at 11 a.m. tomorrow.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with responsibility for the NewERA project, and the officials from his Department, Mr. Ivan Grimes and Mr. David Kelly.

I propose that we insert a new section.  This amendment proposes that we insert &quot;other than section 24&quot; because it is obviously in conflict with that new section.  Amendment No. 3 proposes between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following subsection: &quot;(3) Section 24 of this Act shall come in to operation after the 1st of January 2014, or following a review of that section under section 24(4), whichever date is the later.&quot;.

We feel that these amendments are not appropriate in that the purpose of section 24 is to provide the commission with the necessary powers to prepare for the performance of regulatory functions and to advise the Government on the development of policy regarding the regulation of water services.  It is very important that this work commences as soon as possible.  Therefore we do not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

We believe that water charges will hit those on the lowest incomes the hardest, particularly households with low incomes where there are several people living in the house, such as large families, or people living on a disability allowance where there may be only one or two people living in the house.  We firmly believe that it should be poverty-proofed and I have asked about this several times when this came up in the D&aacute;il and at committee meetings over the past year or so.  We believe that should be the case.</p></speech>

The Sinn F&eacute;in proposed framework team would not have the capacity or competence to sort out specific issues.</p><p>  Local authorities and their members communicating their views to Irish Water will be very important.

The objective of this section is to ensure the full economic interest in Irish Water remains in the State and, as such, the shares are invested in the Ministers for Finance and the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, for the purposes of borrowing from financial markets, it is important that Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann can demonstrate it controls the subsidiary.  Under this structure, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will retain one share which will have a nominal value but which will have full voting rights such that the board will have full operational control of the subsidiary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12013022700003#B02200"><p>Ten years ago, no one would have anticipated State assets would have to be put up for sale such as Coillte.  I have been examining how Coillte has been structured and is packaged in a way to sell it off.  Given the role of the troika, we have not been the masters of our destiny.  One of my key concerns is that we will not be the masters of the ownership of Irish Water, irrespective of where the shares are held.  I accept the point about raising finance.  However, it is important ownership is retained in the State and there is a free supply of water.</p><p>  It had been agreed to have some of the moneys raised from the originally agreed sale of State assets to be re-invested in job creation initiatives.  As we are in such a precarious economic state, however, how valuable is such an assurance, given the way it has transpired with the sale of other State assets in the past?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12013022700003#B02300"><p>Given the fact Irish Water will be a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and that company is earmarked for privatisation under NewERA, it puts Irish Water in a precarious position.  While I accept the Minister's claim it is not the Government's intention to put Uisce &Eacute;ireann at risk of privatisation, events move on.  If one had asked a Minister in 1983 when Telecom &Eacute;ireann was set up if it would be privatised down the line, he would have said it was not his intention for that to happen to the company.  We have seen the difficulties caused by water privatisation across the water in England.  Water companies there charge astronomical water bills, metering has not been completed in some areas and the executives of some of them are earning astronomical salaries and bonuses.</p> <p>Householders in parts of England are paying vast water fees.  There is a genuine concern that in several years&rsquo; time the Minister of State or someone else in government may be unable to make changes.  Events may overtake the Government of the day and because the company is out and under the umbrella of a company that will be substantially privatised, events could put the Government in a position whereby it may be unable to stop any adverse events.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12013022700004#C00200"><p>My concerns are similar to what has been aired before.  The main reasoning behind the appointment of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann as the company under which Irish Water would be formed was supposedly based on its expertise and billing systems.  Is this not the same section of Bord G&aacute;is that is to be sold?  If this is the case, how long will the so-called expertise remain in the ownership of Irish Water?</p><p>  I do not wish to delve beyond the section, save to say we opposed the Bill in the D&aacute;il by virtue of the fact that we had no definitive specifications on costs associated with the Bill.  The absence of an audit, which had been promised, on the amount of repairs and reinstatement to the national network required is a factor.  It needed to be put on the table.  The exact costs associated with metering needed to be put on the table.  The exact costs of the Dublin water solution needed to be put on the table.  Only at that stage could we get an indication of the overall costs and how they could be capitalised over time.  That would give an indication of what Government subvention, if any, would be appropriate.  Only then could a free allowance be adjudicated on.</p><p>  In the absence of all of this I find it rather difficult to make specific recommendations on the various sections.  Given the good faith with which many of the amendments are put forward, especially in this area, we all share the fear that further down the road this may lead to privatisation.  If that were to be the case there may be difficulties for those who do not find themselves in a population cluster deemed to be feasible or profitable.  I am conscious of rural group water schemes which will not be the want of any private investor and will be left behind.  We fear for them.  That is the background to our support for the intentions of those who have moved amendments in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EN12013022700004#C00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for their comments.  The Deputies are expressing concerns which many people have.  However, the Bill is to amend existing legislation, which contains a definitive, authoritative statement that no water infrastructure can be owned privately.  We are amending that Act.  It is not appropriate at this stage to include this as an issue because it is already in the Act.</p><p>  There is a second stage to this debate.  More legislation will be introduced before the end of the year dealing with this issue and I hope to be able to clarify at that stage the issues and provide the assurance which Deputies accept from me, but they will want see it in the next Bill and I have no issue with that.</p><p>  If it is helpful I will clarify some points raised by Deputies.  What we are doing is giving Irish Water or Uisce &Eacute;ireann the power to go ahead and carry out certain works which perhaps local authorities currently do, including installing meters, as well as empowering the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, to commence some work relating to the preparation it must do with regard to issues raised by the Deputies.</p><p>  This is the first stage which will involve two Bills.  While I acknowledge and appreciate the points made by Deputies about privatisation, there is no intention on the part of the Government to do that.  It is not included specifically in the programme for Government.  We have not sold and we are not selling any networks.  We are not selling Bord G&aacute;is, ESB or local authority networks.  We are setting up a company which is owned by the State.  Bord G&aacute;is is a State-owned company.  There was an alternative.  We could have gone for a stand-alone company or we could have set one up.  However, as Deputy Cowen rightly pointed out, it was done in this way because of the skills, knowledge and experience that Bord G&aacute;is brought to the table, as did Bord na M&oacute;na in terms of the competition between the two companies.  There is no private involvement and there is no private interest.  The shareholders are ourselves, essentially, working through Bord G&aacute;is, the two Departments and the committee passing the legislation.</p><p>  A comment was made about the costs.  The overall charges for water at the moment, including capital and current costs, amount to approximately &euro;1.2 billion per annum.  I understand the subsidy this year is approximately &euro;300 million.  We get in &euro;200 million-----</p></speech>

There was a commitment given at the time of the setting up of Irish Water that it would provide an audit of the current network and systems throughout the country with a view to laying the cards on the table about the reinstatement and repairs required and the associated costs.  That had to go on top of the &euro;1.2 billion and many other costs.  Only then can we begin to capitalise the costs over 20 years if it is the case that we will pay back part of the costs to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Only then will we get an indication of what the annual cost to each household will be.  Only then can the level of subvention be agreed thereafter in the form of a free allowance and only then will we know what the appropriate charge will be.</p></speech>

All these will have to go to Irish Water and be examined.  It will have to consider a capital programme, as Deputy Cowen rightly pointed out, and add to it what needs to be done in five or ten years or whatever.  All of this will then go to the regulator which will calculate the sums on what exactly is allowable, as Deputy Cowen remarked.  In the United Kingdom the regulator plans today for five years hence.  I presume the regulator in Ireland will do exactly the same.  There must be transparency about what the regulator does.  It will have to publish its intention and allow people the opportunity to comment on it before a price is fixed.  In other words, it will have to be transparent, accountable and open to full scrutiny and it will be.  There is no intention of not getting everything done.  Clearly we need to take into account the Shannon scheme, which has been referred to, and the timescale for it and how things fit into different financial frameworks.  There is no issue about hiding any costs with this project.</p></speech>

Will Irish Water report to the relevant Minister in the same way that the HSE reports to the Minister for Health?  It will be a separate company.  Deputy Cowen made some points about the need for full information in advance to calculate what is required.  Only then can we see how the numbers pan out in terms of the number of households and what is possible.  In terms of the information available, once the body is set up it will not be as directly responsible to us and it will not have to provide the same degree of information.  That becomes an issue in its own right.  Will the Minister of State describe how he envisages this will play out?</p></speech>

All the other issues raised are important and one of those issues is in the Bill.  There will be an annual report laid before the Oireachtas and it will be a matter for debate here.</p><p>  I agree with the points made on how significant water policy is and will continue to be.  I expect that by the time the second Bill comes before the Houses we will be laying out the other necessary measures of accountability there should be through the Oireachtas, local councils, regional water authorities or whatever.  We must have a structure and have clearly defined roles.  Importantly, there must be areas where councillors and councils have development plans.  Clearly the development plan of a given council will have an impact on water policy in that area.</p> <p>We will need joined-up thinking between the local authority, Irish Water and the Government.  Clear lines of communication and decision processes will be called for to resolve the problems that will arise.  I expect these issues will be addressed in the next phase.  At this stage Irish Water will not own anything.  It is not being given any assets which, as Deputy Cowen rightly noted, have to be assessed.  There is no transfer of assets in this respect.  All of that is to come, including the articles of association for the company, and we will have an opportunity to discuss them fully in the second phase.  The points raised will be taken on board in that context.</p></speech>

Bord G&aacute;is and Bord na M&oacute;na are semi-State companies.  The refuse collection company, AES, is a subsidiary of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Irish Water will become a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is.  I am a customer of AES and I will have the same relationship, both as a customer and a Deputy, with Irish Water.  I put a cheque in the post and make a telephone call to the company once a year.  I can make a complaint but it does not have to listen to me because there is no direct line of accountability through county councillors or anyone else.  It will be a stand-alone subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is.</p><p>  In regard to the regulator and the finances, there will be &euro;300 million in subsidies.  If the estimated cost of &euro;1.2 billion is divided by 1.5 million households, it works out at approximately &euro;750 per house.</p></speech>

The Government wants us to open the door to metering in the absence of details, costings or projections.  It is only later that we will have an idea of what this will cost per household.  Deputy Stanley is correct.  Ongoing maintenance costs in counties Offaly, Laois and Westmeath, for example, amount to approximately &euro;12 million per annum for 20,000 houses.  This works out at &euro;600 per household even before we add the cost of metering, reinstatements and repairs.  Many people think the existing system is inefficient.  They cannot be expected to pay for an inefficient system even though &euro;600 comes out of their taxes already.  This is why I find it difficult to support an interim Bill in the absence of the facts.  We were promised that a full audit would be made available.  Bord G&aacute;is was successful in winning this new role largely on the basis of its billing and auditing capacity.  Metering is to be completed by the end of 2014.  Is the billing system within Bord G&aacute;is part of the ongoing negotiations for the sale of parts of the company?  How far behind the initial schedule is the delivery of Irish Water and subsequent charging of households, having made the system fit for practice?  Are we one year or two years behind or are we on schedule?</p></speech>

I will ask that Department to issue a reply to Deputy Cowen's question on the sale of parts of the company.  The plan for the future of water and the water services investment programme, which is available to the Oireachtas as a document, sets out the future needs so we can compute a costed programme.  There is no question of lack of transparency in that regard.</p><p>  The PwC report dealt with the  issue of weaknesses and inefficiencies in the system, as did the value for money report on the effectiveness of the water services programme nationally.  There are numerous pages of detailed information on problems which need to be ironed out.  It will not cost anywhere near the &euro;600 or &euro;700 that Deputy Stanley suggests.  A value-for-money assessment of the cost of meters and related matters has been conducted and this will be published after they have been purchased.  There will be transparency on costs.  We believe the plan offers value for money and will create a more efficient and better system with new synergies.  In most countries there are reductions of at least 10% to 12% in overall consumption of water.  That would have a knock-on effect on the capital investment programme.  By becoming more efficient and wasting less - 42% of the water treated and pumped never reaches the tap for human consumption - we can achieve massive synergies.  I expect significant cost reductions.  Scotland reduced the cost of water services by more than 40% over a five year period.  New efficiencies will clearly be achievable.</p></speech>

Section 12 provides for borrowing by the board and the subsidiary.  The estimated cost of installing the meters varies from &euro;350 million to &euro;1.2 billion, to be borrowed from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The most commonly quoted figure is &euro;500 million.  That money will have to be paid back in addition to the &euro;1.2 billion it currently costs to operate the system.</p> <p> Operational cost is approximately &euro;900 million and capital investment each year will be approximately &euro;300 million.  The investment in metering is a further capital investment which will have to be repaid.  The Minister of State pointed out that we are wasting 42% of our water and that this water does not even get to the taps.  That is correct.  It does not get to the taps because the mains system leaks.  Surely the first thing that needs to be done is to fix the leaks.  One can keep mopping up the floor for as long as one likes, but if the leaking pipe is not fixed one will be mopping up the floor all day and tomorrow as well.  The first sign of madness is to keep doing the same thing, but to expect a different outcome.  We must do something that will give us a different outcome.  The first thing we must do is stop the leaks at district level.</p><p> District metering has been shown to be effective and has been proven on the ground.  I already provided information on where it works.  It saves huge amounts of water and local authorities that have used it wisely have found it very efficient.  In the context of section 12, the installation of meters will heap more borrowing onto householders, but will not save water.  This is the truth.  The Minister of State has outlined the fact that 42% of water does not even reach the taps.  That is what must be changed.  That is the issue and the elephant in the room here.</p></speech>

However, we read in the newspapers about the practical difficulties in regard to the contractors responsible for this work.  A number of high profile articles have appeared in the media over the past week or so indicating the significant amounts of money contractors would be required to have in terms of turnover before they can be in a position to qualify as contractors for this work.  This is very worrying.  One can easily foresee these contracts being sub-contracted out and the sub-contractors being badly burned.</p><p>  This is happening in advance of the establishment of Irish Water and I am concerned about how the situation is being handled.  It could come back and bite us.  I accept the point made regarding metering and in principle I am not opposed to metering, but we must find out where the leaky pipes are.  Many households are thrifty with water.  Therefore, if the Minister allocated a usage allowance, it should be possible for these households not to be faced with a bill if they stay within the allocated allowance.  That should be the aim.  This should be about changing behaviour.  However, it is hard to see how metering will stack up in the context of the amount of money that must be invested.  I accept the point made that the savings will produce a dividend, but will that dividend be sufficient to allow households to operate within an environment where they can have a nil bill?</p></speech>

Ultimately, this lack of information bars us from making a judgment with regard to free allowances and so on and so forth.</p><p>  On the specific issue, section 12(1)(c) says the aggregate borrowings of the board and its subsidiary under this subsection shall not exceed &euro;500 million.  This interim Bill is being introduced in order to allow Irish Water commence metering.  Therefore, does this limit on borrowing suggest that the cost of metering will not exceed &euro;500 million?  If that is the case, surely the Minister of State can indicate how this will be capitalised and what it means for houseowners with regard to how they will pay.  How is this money to be repaid to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, if that is where it is borrowed from?  Is it the case that this being an interim measure to give Irish Water the authority and wherewithal to commence metering, the next Bill the Department brings forward will also contain other powers allowing Irish Water to borrow?  Having completed the audit, will it cap those borrowings against the cost of upgrade of the system?   Will it cap the borrowings to provide resolution to the situation in Dublin?  Will it provide annual maintenance cost borrowings into the future and for how long?  If this subsection in part measures the cost, will the next Bill have these costs maximising the amount of borrowings which are required within such a subsection?  How is the money to be repaid to the National Pensions Reserve Fund?  This being the case, it gives us an indication of what each household will be charged for this element, the metering costs.</p></speech>

My understanding, having met with Bord G&aacute;is and having raised this issue with it, is that regional contractors will be appointed and that in turn, those regional contractors will appoint local people, through the county councils, to install water meters.  There appears to be some misinformation going on in this regard, though not on the part of my colleagues on the right.  However, Deputy Mattie McGrath made a public statement recently saying that no local people would be able to afford to get the contract, because a company would require a minimum turnover of &euro;400,000.  I believe the Deputy is confused in that regard and he is mixing this requirement up with that for the regional contractors.  Will the Minister of State clarify the situation?  Will local tradespeople get the opportunity to install water meters?</p></speech>

He is quite right that the solution to the appalling waste of resources, with 42% of water wasted, is to deal with that.  The best way to deal with it is to improve the mains network where possible.  On the customer side, we must also ensure there are no leaks between the mains and the premises where the tap is located.</p><p>  The evidence from group water schemes so far, such as those in Cavan-Monaghan, is that these schemes have saved as much as 80% of water.  I am aware that some of those schemes involved farms.  Significant savings will result following the installation of meters, because meters will track usage.  District meters will track a housing estate, but the individual meter will track the individual household.  If there is a leak between the public supply and the private house, Irish Water will repair the first leak for free.  In other words, there will be an uninterrupted, metered supply between the public supply and the private house.  This will protect resources significantly.</p><p>  On the question of sub-contractors and regional contractors, I understand there are eight different regions for the country and that there could be up to eight regional contractors.  Then, approximately 220 companies will be pre-qualified as competent SMEs to do the work.  Every regional contractor will have to insist that 10% of the people working on the metering programme are drawn from SMEs, 10% from the unemployed register and 5% are apprentices, graduates or school leavers.  This is the minimum required.  The more the contracts are broken down, the better the opportunity there will be for smaller SMEs to get the work.  However, it is a competitive process.  Therefore, the regional contractor will seek tenders and the person tendering must meet the criteria in terms of the percentages.  The idea is to ensure, as well as possible, that as many local people as possible are employed in the work.</p></speech>

That is the category into which one of these companies must fit.  The whole idea is to make sure of the quality of workmanship actually done by the company that will be doing it.  We want to ensure they are not cowboys, they are competent, they have a track record and they can prove they have a sustainable business with the capacity to do the work.  Clearly, as I said earlier, people coming off the unemployment register, along with apprentices, graduates and school leavers, will be very much a part of this.  Notwithstanding the Deputy's concerns, I have no doubt that a significant number of people who are as local as possible will be involved in this work.  There is a direct link on the Bord G&aacute;is website that can be used by people who wish to be employed by the company.  If an unemployed plumber called John Murphy wants to work in this area, he can contact the company, which will ensure his data goes to all of the successful contractors.  I was also asked about the costs.  I think the idea is that the maximum at any one time will be &euro;500 million.</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy has made an important point about subcontracting further.  Each of the 220 local contractors, for want of a better term, can contract some of that work to other people locally as long as - this is the key point - the legal accountability will continue to rest with the local contractor.  In other words, there will be a legal relationship between the regional contractor and the local contractor.  They will be liable and accountable for the production of that.  If John Murphy or John Maguire supplies a service to a local contractor, but is not a direct employee of that contractor, the local contractor will be accountable for the work that is done by virtue of the nature of the contract that will exist.</p></speech>

I have a couple of queries in relation to contracting.  What guarantees are there that the regional contractors will consider employing small subcontractors in local areas?  Like many of my colleagues, I have been contacted by smaller contractors who have worked on group water schemes over the years.  They are anxious to get involved in this project.  Have guarantees been received from the regional contractors that these people will be employed?  Will the local authorities have any role in the recruitment process?</p></speech>

The actual physical metering, which is what the Deputy is talking about, will be done by pre-qualified local contractors.  The 25% minimum requirement that I mentioned earlier comprises the minimum of 10% who must come from the SME sector, the minimum of 10% who must come from the unemployment register and the minimum of 5% who must be apprentices, graduates or school leavers.  We cannot legally insist that they must be local people, but we can insist and we are insisting that a minimum of 25% of the workforce comes from these categories.</p> <p>That is part of the tendering process and the documentation.  </p></speech>

For the purposes of the record, amendment No. 6 proposes to delete section 17 and replace it with a new section which provides for the establishment of daily allowances of water for consumption by a household.  While the Bill provides for the establishment of a national domestic water metering programme, the details of the limits and allowances are not provided for in the current Bill.  This amendment must be ruled out of order as it is not relevant to the provisions of the current Bill in accordance with Standing Order 131.

Obviously, there would be a limit on that, which is what I was attempting to do.  It is difficult to deal with these two pieces of legislation separately because one is judging one piece without having the detail of the other.  This has been mentioned by others here today.  That is a deficiency in the process here.  Clearly, that is why this amendment has been ruled out of order.</p></speech>

Clearly, I would be concerned about low-income families.  We keep taking money out of the pockets of a lot of these families.  This is an environmental issue.  It is about changing a culture and people being very careful about their water usage.  This is not about poverty proofing.  The idea of a free allowance is to allow people to live within that allowance and not end up with a bill because they have done exactly what the Government wants them to do, which is not waste water.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach indicated in the D&aacute;il last year, if I heard him correctly, that water would be turned off.  Will water be turned off completely if a household cannot pay, rather than refuses to pay, regardless of the circumstances of that household?  Will it have no supply?  That is a key issue that is not just environmental.  It is a health issue for the household and family.</p></speech>

It goes without saying that there would be an allowance there but it is what happens over and above that which is the issue, as Deputy Murphy noted.  Is the polluter pays principle at work here in the sense that an allowance will be calculated per the number of people in the household and anything beyond that refers to a charge?  Has the Government agreed that concept?  If so, can the Minister give some indication of what that percentage might be?  We are in the dark again in this regard.</p></speech>

However, it is stated in the programme for Government that there will be a free allowance.  Deputy Murphy is correct in that it is about changing people's behaviour.  One issue I have seen in the UK and elsewhere is that if there is charging for water, there must be significant attempts by the water companies to reduce use.  I know that in the UK if people want to put something into the cistern, they are given a special container that brings the volume of water up and displaces water in the cistern so they flush less.  There are many things one can do to ensure that one reduces the volume of water and to encourage people to do that.  Hand-in-hand with charging for water is the issue of how one encourages people to use less apart from the cost of the same and to protect the resource.  This must be very much a part of it.  There will be ongoing education and information programmes relating to all these matters.</p> <p>A major campaign on the conservation of water will be similar to the Race Against Waste campaign.  This is a significant issue which will be addressed properly at national level by means of a sustained and effective campaign.</p></speech>

I would not want water lost between the meter outside my house and the tap at the kitchen sink.  There is no evidence to show that this is happening.  If it is happening it will show up very quickly in the household.  During my time as a public representative I have only come across a few houses where that has happened.  It becomes evident very quickly because water appears in the house, in the back yard or at the side of the house, wherever the pipe is leaking.  The householder will not want that to happen.  New pipework will show up a leak very quickly without the need for a meter outside the gate.  Water loss is an issue of concern to me.  I have asked engineers and water-keepers working with county councils where most water is lost.  They will always say that the vast majority of loss occurs through the mains before it gets to the stop-cock on the footpath at the front gate.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that if the water is leaking out at the back of a house, then the consumer will deal with it because it is visible.  However, the vast majority of leaks are not visible.  They are small but continuous and they may not be noticed for years.</p><p>  I met a person who was told that a significant portion of the foundations of his house was being destroyed because of leakage over a number of years that nobody ever saw.  It was a leak that ran down before it ran out.  The key benefit of a meter is that leaks are significantly reduced.  All the studies show that metering of the domestic water supply reduces waste.  There is no doubt about this finding.  </p></speech>

The Department, Irish Water, the National Roads Authority and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, are all engaged on this aspect.  The Deputy is correct that it must be a foolproof system to ensure proper and full restoration of the roads.  Senator Norris lives in a Georgian house and the footpaths on his street are very old.  The restoration must be competent and be in keeping with the original.  I agree with the Deputy that there must be certainty about the quality of the work.  I hope to have those protocols available to show the Deputy by Report Stage.</p></speech>

Houses will not generally be constructed along national primary routes.  This will be an additional oversight responsibility for local authorities which may result in a resourcing issue.  In many cases because of the recruitment embargo there is a deficiency of local authority staff numbers to provide oversight.  I expect that short cuts will be taken when oversight is not in place.  It should not be a case of relying on the public to make complaints.  The sub-contracting of services is also an issue.</p></speech>

The relationship in this regard is very successful.  The question of water quality is separate.  If water is not up to standard, then it is not fit for human consumption.  Issues arise with regard to the pollution of water sources, cryptosporidium and the use of infra-red barriers.  Obviously, health issues must come first.  That is the case regardless of who provides the water.  Local authority provision of water nationally is as good as anywhere in the world.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the cumbersome directives which may come into place in the future in respect of the maintenance and management of group schemes.  It could be that complying with such directives could prove too costly for existing schemes.  If the eventuality to which I refer arises, will the taking in charge of schemes by the new authority be as seamless as has been the case heretofore?</p></speech>

What we are discussing is my main concern with regard to group water schemes and the concept of a new water authority.  I fear that if - despite the guarantees given to the Minister of State - said authority were sold off in the future, the high maintenance cost attaching to the group schemes might lead to them being seen as unprofitable by those who wish to buy into this area.  I am seeking a commitment to the effect that the new authority will not be able to object to its being obliged to take existing group water schemes in charge.</p></speech>

However, I am in a position to assure the Deputy that the relationship between the Department and the group water schemes nationally is top class.  Those schemes constitute one of the biggest advocates for change nationally in respect of water policy.  I do not know if that would happen in the case of individual schemes.  If it is of assistance and in order that there will be clarity, I will return to the Deputy with an answer on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Let us consider the position of unprofitable group water schemes.  Only two people are required in order for a group water scheme to be established.  In such circumstances, a person could be a member of a group water scheme which would not be remotely financially attractive in the context of a takeover.  Unless a mechanism is put in place to oblige it to take particular schemes in charge, the new authority will engage in cherry-picking.  It will only take on group water schemes which have 60, 70 or 80 members.  Those with three, four or six members that are located in awkward or inaccessible locations will be abandoned.  If the authority does decide to take such schemes in charge, it will impose a financial cost on those involved.</p><p>  The Minister of State indicated that the necessary mechanisms are not in place.  However, he has ministerial responsibility in this area and now is the time to copper-fasten the position by putting in place a mechanism by means of which the new authority could be obliged to take schemes with two or three members in charge in the same way as it will be happy to take in charge those with 103 members.</p></speech>

That organisation is completely voluntary in nature and was formed by the joining of three separate entities into one larger unit.  The scheme in question employs a full-time professional administrator.  It is so well organised that young children in the local primary schools have all been given badges which proclaim them to be "water deputies".  Schemes in rural areas are ideally suited for community support and involvement.  This is because they can supply services, in either a voluntary or cost-recovery capacity, which no one else can provide.  Group schemes succeed because - with some State support - they are able to lay the many miles of pipe necessary to carry water to particular communities.  There is no proposal or intention to interfere in any way with existing group water schemes.  The legislation does not contain any measures which will affect such schemes.  As I understand it, in certain circumstances group water schemes can opt to become part of the public water supply network.  However, that is a decision for such schemes to make.  In the context of its service level agreements with local authorities, I presume this issue will be a priority for Irish Water.</p></speech>

We are not concerned about that matter.  We are referring to small, financially unattractive schemes which want to be taken in charge.  Will the Minister of State put something in place which would ensure that Irish Water will be obliged to take such schemes in charge?</p></speech>

I am not that familiar with what happens at present but, as I understand it, a scheme which wants to be taken in charge must approach the local authority and then all of the various cost issues are discussed.  Thereafter, the scheme will either be taken in charge or it will not.  In the context of health, the quality of water is the key issue.  If water is polluted or if it is unsafe to drink, that is a serious matter from an environmental point of view.</p> <p>I repeat that the voluntary input I have experienced from talking to people on group water schemes is extremely important.  It is the only way it works, and it is the partnership that works.  I am not aware of the specific schemes to which the Deputy is referring.  He may want to give the Department a list of the issues but in terms of what is happening at the moment, there is no change.</p></speech>

That is the concern.  We are turning a corner here.  After a long campaign domestic water charges were abolished in the early 1990s on the basis that the charge for them was already incorporated in existing taxation.  Nothing has changed since then.  In fact, there have been many new methods of taxation and increased taxation, particularly value added tax, other stealth charges and local authority charges.  It is regrettable that if this legislation sails through, so to speak, this section will supersede the legislation introduced in the early 1990s.</p><p>  Almost half of commercial water rates are not paid.  We gladly pay commercial water rates in our house because it is for a business.  The business uses water for profitable purposes and the water should be paid for.  We pay for water in and water out.  It is the polluter pays principle, with which I agree, but 48% of commercial water rates remain uncollected.</p></speech>

We will contribute accordingly, but I need a commitment that that facility remains open and available to group schemes as it does by enforcement to urban schemes.</p></speech>

It is to allow those groups some relief in this matter because they will not be able to pay this on top of the other charges they must pay.  Last year, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul saw hundreds of thousands of people.  If this charge comes in, it will have a significant impact on those houses and on the working poor.  We meet many people who are in jobs but with the cost of travel to work and all of the other charges they have to pay including health insurance and so on, they are at breaking point.  Some of them are beyond that point, and this will add to the pain they are suffering.  I oppose section 27.</p></speech>

The regulator will not take that decision but it might advise us of its view.  The Department is in regular contact with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Finance, and we have asked the Economic and Social Research Institute to examine this issue and give us an independent perspective on all of these issues, which is important.  I agree with Deputy Stanley.  These are key issues that require clarity before the charging process commences, but it is a decision the Government will take.  Obviously, it will be open to full debate.</p></speech>

I agree with the thrust of what is being proposed by Deputy Stanley but there will be situations in which there is an exceptional need for water supply - for example, for people on kidney dialysis and for children with disabilities.  It cannot be about people going around scrounging for extra water supply.  As was said earlier, we are really operating blind in terms of not having the information.  We are being asked to act in good faith but it is very difficult to do that when we cannot get the detail we need to give us the kind of assurance we need.</p></speech>

All of the issues the Deputy has raised will be in the next Bill.  There is no is question about that.  The transparency of and accountability for the system and all of the issues will have to be clarified for Members of both Houses.  I want to give the Deputy an absolute assurance.  Clearly, if somebody has a significant medical issue and requires volumes of water in excess of whatever a normal amount is deemed to be, I presume there will be a registration system where the individual's doctor would inform the competent authority.  There will not be an issue with that at all.  If people have a medical need, it will be fully met without any problem whatsoever.  I do not believe there will be any issue with that.</p></speech>

All members of the committee have received a copy of Amnesty International's recommendations to the Irish Presidency.  I commend the organisation on producing a very focused, considered and clear document.  The recommendations are realistic and are underpinned by a clear understanding of the broader institutional relationships that exist within the Irish Presidency and the way it operates.  The focus of this committee is on those areas of the document which concern the EU's external relationships and how the Presidency can co-operate with the European External Action Service and use its diplomatic service and membership of other multinational organisations, such as the UN Human Rights Council, to protect and promote human rights.  Some of the committee members travelled to Geneva last December to have some discussions about Ireland's membership of the UN Human Rights Council.  We met the ambassador and many of the people involved in human rights.</p><p>  When the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met the committee last month to discuss the priorities for the Presidency he gave a commitment that the Government would work to ensure the EU upholds its commitment to peace, democracy and human rights.  He said these values were central to Ireland's foreign policy and would be central to the Irish Presidency as well.  I believe Amnesty International Ireland's contribution is a constructive input that helps put a shape onto that commitment.  The witnesses are very welcome.</p><p>  Before I invite the witnesses to make the presentation I wish to advise them that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.</p> <p>If the witnesses are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence connected to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p> I now ask Mr. O'Gorman to address the committee on Amnesty International Ireland's priorities for the EU Presidency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Gorman" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700003#B00200"><p>Thank you, Chairman, and our thanks to the committee for inviting us to speak on the topic of the Irish Presidency's role on EU human rights foreign policy.  As members will be aware, we met the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, at the launch of these recommendations in January.  The T&aacute;naiste welcomed our recommendations and noted the Presidency's firm commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights in Ireland, Europe and globally.  I am happy to say we have had a lot of engagement with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, both here in Dublin and at the Irish Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels, which has been very welcome.</p><p>  I understand that earlier this year the committee met Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis, the EU Special Representative for Human Rights.  Our colleagues in Brussels, one of whom is with us today, Ms Iverna McGowan, are maintaining close contact with Mr. Lambrinidis and look forward to working with him to continually strengthen the EU's external human rights policies.  Indeed, he shares our view that there is a pressing need for greater coherence between the EU's internal and external human rights policies and we will comment further on this later.</p><p>  As parliamentarians, committee members will also be aware that the Treaty of Lisbon has increased the role that national parliamentarians play in EU decision-making processes.  Indeed, only last month I met Deputy Dominic Hannigan, Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, to discuss, among other issues, the Irish Presidency's role in chairing the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union.  Together with the European Parliament, national parliaments play a vital role in overseeing and scrutinising EU policy.  </p><p>  Today, we want to address Amnesty International's recommendations to the Irish Presidency on the external affairs dimension of the EU.  We are aware that the Presidency alone cannot deliver on all of these recommendations but rather will have to work together with the European Commission, the European Parliament and the External Action Service, EEAS.  Nevertheless, the Presidency plays a key role in the Council of the EU, in particular with regard to providing leadership on key human rights dossiers.  As a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and EU member state, Ireland has committed itself to upholding the highest standards in protecting and promoting human rights.  We often hear that human rights are the cornerstone of Irish foreign policy and Ireland cannot limit work on human rights to international fora such as the United Nations or the OSCE, vital as that is, but must also assert the primacy of human rights within its own region.  Indeed, since the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty and the establishment of the EEAS, EU human rights foreign policy has increasing relevance.  </p><p>  I will now ask Ms Iverna McGowan to give the committee an overview of some of our recommendations and we will then take questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Iverna McGowan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700003#B00300"><p>I will begin with the implementation of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, copies of which have been circulated to members.  This framework and action plan was adopted last June and was a significant achievement, marking a new point of departure for the EU's foreign relations.  If this new human rights package is to succeed and meet its full potential, what is needed now is a heavily reinforced emphasis on implementation by all actors.  The Irish Presidency should work in co-operation with the EEAS to ensure that the deadlines set out in the EU human rights package are met and actions are put into practice.  In our recommendations, we have outlined some practical examples of how this might be done and will continue our engagement with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on this in the coming months.</p><p>  Awareness and implementation of the EU guidelines on promoting compliance with international humanitarian law remains remarkably low in comparison with other EU guidelines.  One of the problems in the past has been a lack of clarity over responsibility for their implementation, as this responsibility has been shared between different actors, under the primary oversight of the EU Council Working Group on Public International Law.  As chair of this working group, the Irish Presidency has a particular role in collaboration with the EEAS to ensure further progress in the implementation of the guidelines.  We are conscious that much of Ireland's work on this is below the radar.  For instance, we understand that agreement was reached recently in the working group that during all EU dialogues and discussions with third countries, ratification of additional protocols to the Geneva Convention will be raised.  </p><p>  Current and future enlargement negotiations should be engaged with constructively, maximising the potential to improve the human rights situation in the countries concerned.  This should also include work on freedom of expression and LGBTI and minority rights in Turkey, for example.  In the Balkans, the EU accession process has been an essential tool for addressing impunity for war crimes, both at the international level through co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and at national level through building up domestic judicial systems.  In Croatia, while there has been progress domestically in recent years, further attention will need to be paid, post-accession, to ensuring that victims and their families are given access to truth, justice and reparation for human rights violations committed during the 1991 to 1995 war.  Addressing ongoing impunity will also need to be prioritised with Serbia and other countries in the region as they start accession talks.  </p><p>  Mr. O'Gorman mentioned that we would elaborate further on the issue of internal-external coherence and in that context the Presidency must ensure greater coherence between internal and external human rights policy.  We can no longer ignore the increase in racism and xenophobia in the EU's population and among senior political leaders.  To take the example of Greece, migrants and ethnic minorities are hunted in the streets.  Furthermore, 12 million Roma across the EU suffer pervasive and systemic discrimination.  Amnesty International believes that it is critical to the EU's credibility that its support for women's rights internationally is matched by serious efforts to combat violence against women in EU countries.  An important first step for the EU would be to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.</p><p>  At the launch of the Presidency recommendations, we asked that the Presidency would assist the EEAS to deliver on human rights priorities at the UN and to work to promote more effective burden sharing between EU countries.  A few months into the Presidency, we note and welcome the role that Ireland is playing with regard to EU burden sharing at the UN Human Rights Council.  The Presidency has particular responsibility for helping to deliver on a strong and effective arms trade treaty, with human rights protection at its heart, at the final UN Conference in March 2013.  We commend Ireland's supportive position and action on the arms trade treaty discussions to date and the open engagement with Amnesty International by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  </p><p>  The Presidency could also play a leading role regarding an agreement on UN treaty body strengthening, which can enhance the ability of rights holders to enjoy their human rights.  In terms of supporting the UN human rights mechanisms, Ireland could lead by example and set a firm timetable for ratifying the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed in 2007.  Ireland could also lay out a clear process towards ratifying the optional protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and urge other states to sign and ratify it.  </p><p>  As committee members will recall, Ireland played a key role in the drafting of the EU human rights defenders guidelines during its 2004 Presidency.  It is now important that Ireland follows up on this, shows leadership and ensures an EU focus on implementing those guidelines.  In particular, there is a need to be proactive in ensuring systematic feedback to human rights defenders.  This would involve giving support to human rights defenders under threat and consistently consulting with the individuals concerned regarding the level of visibility to be given to their particular case through prompt, vocal and visible reaction to restrictions to freedoms of expression, association and assembly, though <i>d&eacute;marches</i>, press releases and public statements, including via the EU High Representative on Foreign Policy.  Feedback should also be systematically provided to human rights defendants and their families on actions taken on their behalf. </p><p>  On the recent revision of the EU guidelines on torture, we ask the Irish Presidency to show leadership to ensure that the EU focuses on implementing the guidelines on the ground to effectively eradicate torture and ill-treatment in all parts of the world.  If the guidelines are to be effective on the ground, we need to make sure that EU staff abroad, EU delegations and member state embassies, including those responsible for drawing up country human rights strategy, have a deep understanding of the torture guidelines and their practical application.  </p><p>  On the topic of corporate accountability, under the human rights package EU countries have committed themselves to developing national plans for implementing the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.  We have specific recommendations in this area and I invite members to refer to our document in that regard.  </p><p>  On preventing and combating violence against women, as the holder of the EU Presidency, Ireland must deliver on its pledge to the United Nations, before its election to the Human Rights Council, to play a role in efforts to combat all forms of discrimination and to promote gender equality.  We have already mentioned the importance of signing and ratifying the Council of Europe's Istanbul convention in this regard.</p> <p>Ireland needs to ensure a strong position on violence against women in line with international standards and the EU's external policy at the UN Commission on the Status of Women next week.  Ireland should also fully support EU action to combat female genital mutilation both in EU and third countries.</p><p> In the Presidency recommendations members will find a list of nine cases of people under threat.  People around the world are suffering the consequences of having their human rights violated.  The adoption of the EU guidelines on human rights defenders is one of the key outcomes of the Irish Presidency in 2004.  As Ireland is a member of the UN Human Rights Council and is hosting the EU Presidency, Amnesty International asks that we ensure active engagement on these cases by raising the plight of the people concerned at every opportunity and pressing for tangible progress; working with all EU embassies and delegations in other countries to achieve positive change for those concerned; acting locally and in national capitals under all human rights guidelines; and ensuring that action is taken not only on the cases listed outside the EU but also on the cases mentioned which occur in the European Union.</p></speech>

In his opening statement Mr. O'Gorman states: "Indeed, since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the establishment of the EEAS, EU human rights foreign policy has increasing relevance."  It is not often we hear compliments paid to the work of the External Action Service.  Will he elaborate on that?</p><p>  With regard to the human rights defenders guidelines which were finalised during the previous Irish Presidency, my impression from the opening statement is that they are not being implemented.  Am I correct in that?  Ms McGowan mentioned the nine people whose lives are under threat and whose human rights are being violated.  In the political calendar six months goes by very quickly.  From the experience of Amnesty International, is it better to focus on specific cases that are necessarily high profile and have a wider dimension than just the individual rather than having a laudable and worthwhile programme of advancing issues in general?  Is it the case that if one tries to make progress on too many issues in a very short period, one can end up with little progress in any of them?  Would it be better to focus on the needs of some of the nine individuals whose human rights are being violated?</p></speech>

Human rights is such a broad area of work that trying to focus our agenda to ensure we have maximum possible impact is an enormous challenge.  Nowhere is that more obvious than in the work we do on the cases of individuals who are experiencing human rights violations.</p></speech>

We host the Presidency for a short period, would we as a country do better to concentrate on a lower number of very laudable and necessary objectives?</p></speech>

We would like to see progress throughout the Presidency and beyond this Presidency on these issues.  These are Amnesty International's priorities for the EU Presidency.</p><p>  This is part of a continuum of work for us.  We are already working on our recommendations for the coming Presidency.  We have started the preparatory work and there will be a hand-over moment.  I absolutely understand what Deputy Smith means by asking that question and I have no doubt that following meetings we have had with Ministers - for example, this morning we met the Minister for Justice and Equality and we previously discussed these issues when we met the T&aacute;naiste - that Ireland has its own priorities.  It is choosing what it can progress.  What we want to try to ensure is that there is continuous progression on these issues throughout and beyond all the Presidencies.  I understand how challenging that can be.</p><p>  I will ask Ms McGowan to respond to the specific questions on the External Action Service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.290" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Iverna McGowan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700004#C00800"><p>I will respond to questions on the External Action Service and the increasing relevance of EU human rights and foreign policies.  I mentioned during my opening statement that we passed around the human rights action plan that was adopted last June.  For the first time there is a comprehensive action plan which mainstreams human rights across different policy areas, for example, with the Commission's work on trade.  In third country dialogue there is no longer an excuse to limit it to trade, as the action plan mainstreams human rights across all of those areas.  That is what I meant by referring to its increasing relevance.  There is a tool to ensure its increasing relevance but we are faced with the task of implementing it.  That is the reason we have come up with the strategy in which members states have been assigned specific tasks.  We have spoken to the Irish officials involved to try to take it forward.</p><p>  Let me respond to the question on the human rights guidelines of 2004 not being implemented.  We have established from conversations with different member states that a general issues in regard to the guidelines is that there was too much discussion on the language of the guidelines and not enough focus on their implementation.  We have been working in Brussels to ensure the guidelines are revised not only for the sake of revising them but in consultation with EU delegations and diplomats working on the ground to share best practice.  It has been found that in some places the guidelines are being implemented in a better way.</p><p>  Although I am Irish, I am based in Brussels and have been working on the Cypriot Presidency, the Danish Presidency and the Lithuanian Presidency.  These nine cases would be taken forward.  I accept that six months is a short time to deal with these cases but we also co-ordinate work with our offices across Europe.  These cases are not only being brought to the attention of the Presidency but also have a broader remit.</p><p>  The European Parliament has committed that when delegations go to third countries, they would in their dealing with that third country specifically raise Amnesty International Presidency cases, irrespective of which country they go to.  Although it is specifically in the Presidency documents, these nine cases are part of a broader strategy on the individuals involved.</p></speech>

We suggest if there is an opportunity for Ireland to advance progress in any of the areas or in any of the cases we have suggested, we urge parliamentarians in Ireland to progress those individual cases as best they can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700004#C01000"><p>The witnesses talk in terms of showing leadership to ensure the EU focuses on implementing the Amnesty International policies on human rights defenders.  Part of the difficulty is that the EU has a favourable status with many of the regimes around the world in which torture and human rights abuses are going on.  What do the witnesses suggest the Irish Presidency do about this?  The area that springs to my mind is the Middle East and relations between Palestine and Israel on illegal settlements.  Do the witnesses have a view on the banning of settlement goods?</p><p>  Also raised in the document provided is the issue of the disappearance of people, and there is a reference to the protection of all persons from enforced disappearances.  A recent document on rendition raised the issue of people who disappeared and supposedly went through Irish airports.  The T&aacute;naiste made the point that this information added nothing new.</p> <p>Three individuals subject to rendition have stated they transited through Shannon Airport.  What additional measures could the Government take to address this issue?  If flights organised by the CIA or other organisations are passing through Irish airports, should garda&iacute; board the aircraft in question and carry out inspections?  Apart from implementing the convention, what else can the Government do?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Gorman" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700005#D00200"><p>I will deal with the specific question on renditions.  To clarify, the three cases to which Deputy Crowe refers were revealed through research by Amnesty International.  We do not suggest that the three individuals in question were transited directly through Shannon Airport, rather that the airport was used as a staging post, stop-off or refuelling point as part of the rendition circuit.  This, in itself, would be contrary to international law and Ireland would be in breach of its obligations in allowing its airspace and territory to be used in this manner.</p><p>  Information provided in some of the diplomatic cables revealed by WikiLeaks demonstrated that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was familiar with this research and the relevant facts.  If the cables are to be believed, the then Minister had discussions with the deputy ambassador at the United States embassy in which he effectively sought cover should this information ever be revealed.</p><p>  There are, undoubtedly, grave issues which the European Union needs to tackle regarding breaches of international law as a result of extraordinary rendition on EU territory.  Ireland is involved in this entire issue and significant questions should be asked.  We must first establish facts.  It will not come as a mind-blowing revelation when I state Amnesty International would like a full and proper investigation of extraordinary rendition across the European Union.  Ireland should certainly establish such a process.  For years, we have been asking successive Irish Governments to identify the gaps in current law that allowed such violations to take place.  On inspections, the first thing we need to do is establish what took place and whether it was contrary to existing national legislation or legal provision.  If that is shown to be the case, we need to address that simple fact because it would clearly be in breach of our international obligations.</p><p>  Those are the some of the steps we need to take.  The European Parliament has spoken on this issue on a number of occasions.  Perhaps Ms McGowan will elaborate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.295" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Iverna McGowan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700005#D00300"><p>This again relates to the point about internal-external coherence.  I encourage members to read a European Parliament report published in 2012, on which Amnesty International did intensive work.  Known as the Flautre report, it examines European complicity in US-led rendition and secret detention programmes.  The report is due for revision in September.  We speak of the rule of law and human rights abroad but we are calling for this issue to be addressed.  We must reject impunity and support full, independent and effective investigations of all allegations of European complicity in the US-led detention programme, as outlined in the European Parliament report.  I refer to page 9 of our recommendations.  One of the individuals at risk was also involved in this system.  In terms of what the Presidency could do at European Union level, when the time comes to revise the report, it would be useful to examine what actions were recommended by the European Parliament.</p></speech>

This entire issue requires a proper and full investigation as none has taken place thus far.</p></speech>

On Palestine, the issue of children must also be included.  I attended a briefing yesterday on the plight of children in Palestine, the disproportionate risk they face and the Euro-Mediterranean agreement.</p><p>  I salute Amnesty International and note the extremely important work it has been doing, particularly since this committee was renamed the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I would have liked human rights to have been included in the title.  The pressure exerted by organisations such as Amnesty International is terribly important because one of the points to emerge from yesterday's meeting was that attention to human rights in Palestine and other places around the world has been blown off the agenda by the economic difficulties being experienced in many European countries.</p><p>  The difficulty for people such as me - perhaps the witnesses will have some advice for me in this regard - is that the Euro-Mediterranean agreement, for example, includes a human rights protocol that has never been monitored or assessed.  There is internationally recognised documented evidence of gross human rights abuse by the Israeli authorities and army against the people of Palestine, yet the human rights protocol has not been assessed or monitored.  Does Mr. O'Gorman agree that this brings the whole concept of human rights into disrepute diplomatically?  A protocol is stuck into an agreement which then allows people to believe all is wonderful and everyone's human rights have been sorted out, only to find that human rights violations are taking place right under one's nose.  What can the committee do about this?  I and some of my colleagues have tabled resolutions time and again but they disappear into thin air.</p><p>  Rendition flights were known about five or six years ago and information about them was placed on record by those observing flight traffic at Shannon Airport and a number of Members of the Oireachtas.  One of the strengths of our action on this matter was its all-party nature.  The then Leader of the Seanad, Ms Mary O'Rourke, accepted the position and a committee was established to inquire into the matter at my suggestion.  This committee was sabotaged, however, as a result of pressure from councillors in Shannon who saw an economic angle to the issue.  We tracked and put on record evidence of an unbroken cycle of rendition, providing information on flight paths and so forth.  What does one do in such circumstances?  I wrote to the Council of Europe committee headed by Mr. Dick Marty warning it of what our Minister for Foreign Affairs would say and advising it not to believe him.  The Minister had full knowledge of the matter but was concealing that fact.</p><p>  With regard to the general issue of human rights, it has been suggested that one useful function of the Irish Human Rights Commission, formerly headed by Maurice Manning, was that it should proof all Government legislation for its human rights impact.  Perhaps Amnesty International could play a role in proofing some of the European directives and so forth for human rights, particularly those related to matters such as policing and asylum.  What is the delegation's view on that matter?  Given our extremely poor record on asylum issues, perhaps a proofing of these issues for human rights abuses, even domestically, would be useful.  Such abuses have been enshrined in our legislation in the past and may very well happen again because this Government is showing precisely the same traits as the previous Government.  I am not sure whether we are ruled by Fine F&aacute;il or Fianna Gael.</p><p>  On the individuals who are under threat, given that few other organisations take up the issue of threats to gay citizens, I ask the witnesses to elaborate on this issue.  There is a specific case in Cameroon but gay people are under threat all over Africa in the most horrendous way.  Despite this, we are doing trade with these countries and giving them financial support for civil society and so forth.  These cases are horrifying and as a church-going member of the Church of Ireland, I find it shocking that all the Christian churches seem to support this kind of ignorant brutality.</p><p>  I seek some advice.  Reference was made to a number of protocols to which Ireland and the European Union should sign up and fully recognise.  I ask Amnesty International to provide all Members of both Houses with a document, setting out in bullet points all the conventions or protocols that we have not signed or to which we have not adhered.  There are so many of these agreements that we make assumptions.</p> <p>There are stages, such as, signing, ratification and then there is something else.  It is like one's First Holy Communions and one's this, that and the others.  If the witnesses could give us a list of those things I am sure all colleagues, across the different parties, would be prepared to push for them, particularly at this time.  If that is possible, as an information aid, I would certainly welcome that and, perhaps, my colleagues would as well.</p></speech>

It is a little like the ascension process.  There is a strong focus on human rights standards within countries which are negotiating membership of the EU.  Yet, once they become members very little attention is paid to human rights within those states or their compliance with not just EU standards but international standards.  The same could be said about the negotiation of strong human rights components to trade agreements.  There is little follow-up and little monitoring and evaluation.  That well-used phrase that we recognise in Ireland, implementation deficit disorder, is not a condition that is unique to Ireland and is an issue we need to address.</p></speech>

It is vital if we are to invest time, money, energy, resources and political capital in the development of human rights strategies and bodies of law in the development of agreements that have human rights standards built into them, that we monitor, evaluate and ensure those agreements have values.  That is very important.  It is also worth acknowledging that in successful economies - I am not comfortable as a member of human rights organisation making an economic argument for human rights - there is a principled foundation of principle argument for human rights that needs to be made first and foremost.  The reality is that societies that have respect for human rights and equality are generally more successful economies.  One might argue that if the full framework of human rights law was applied in many parts of the world where is significant conflict, it might go some way towards alleviating elements of that conflict.  In that regard, there are times when it is important that we remind the world generally, as well as Members as legislators, and governments and states.  When we talk about international human rights law, this is not a body of law which, as human rights activists, we wrote but a body of law that was written and developed by states.  In that context all we are saying is that they should respect this law.  This is not our law.  This is a law developed and voluntarily adopted and agreed by states.  In regard to the signature-ratification process, there are other stages to the process in the Irish context.  As we are a dual estate we can sign up to an international law and can then ratify that law.  However, it only becomes binding in national law when it is legislated for at national level.  We have a fine tradition here of signing and over a long period, perhaps, eventually ratifying, but not necessarily bringing those laws into force at national level.  This is an issue to which the committee may wish to pay particular attention.</p><p>  In regard to the role of LGBTI people, I am grateful to the Chairman for giving Kasha Jacqueline an opportunity to meet the committee.  That is important given what is happening in Uganda where, as Members will be aware, an anti-homosexuality law will come into force that can, in certain circumstances, lead to the death penalty being provided for people convicted of aggravated homosexuality - whatever that means.  I am at a loss to understand that concept.</p></speech>

That has something in common with a number of EU states.  There are a number of states within the EU where laws are being advanced to ban or limit what is called the promotion which, effectively, is any public expression of identity by LGBTI people.  In the Irish context, the last two letters of the acronym, transgender and intersex individuals, Ireland has a poor record in respecting their rights, an issue we hope to see addressed in the future.  On the question of intersex rights, there has been very little focus on such rights here.  We are back to that place again about a need for a strong commitment to human rights principles, principles on law developed and written by states.  We want states to be bound by and to respect the law they wrote and at European Union level a coherent approach to human rights as a foreign affairs issue. That requires action.  It requires more than words, or law, even though law matters and we are arguing for advances and developments in law.  It also requires monitoring, engagement and real political commitment to the principles that are enshrined in law.</p></speech>

I am curious as to why Amnesty International would show such a demonstration on its cover given that the taxes and charges were approved by Government and are part of Government policy.  As I would have expected Amnesty International to be neutral on the political front, I would be interested to hear its response.  In regard to the Roma community and the level of discrimination, Amnesty International asked Ireland to take a clear stand on discrimination and to support fellow member states in the fight against racism and to challenge peers to address discriminatory rhetoric by public officials or advocacy of hatred which constitutes incitement to hostility, discrimination and violence.  Is there much evidence of public officials in member states advocating discrimination, hatred and incitement?</p></speech>

In regard to the nine cases the witness highlighted, I presume these are carried over from a previous presidency.  Has significant progress been made on any of those cases in the six months prior to the Irish Presidency and is it expected that progress will be made during our Presidency on any of these cases?</p></speech>

I am afraid the Senator is reading too much into it.  It signifies that in Ireland we are lucky enough to live within a democracy where public protest is permissible and, I hope, encouraged and where peoples' freedom of expression and assembly is guaranteed regardless of whatever political view they may hold.</p> <p>I would love to have engaged conversations with parliamentarians and legislators in this country about how we provide for essential rights such as economic, social and cultural rights.  Human rights organisation comment on human rights issues which are inherently and essentially political in many ways and increasingly, economic, social and cultural rights are too but that is perhaps a discussion for another day.</p><p> On the question of the Roma and the levels of discrimination experienced by them, I can forward research to the Senator by e-mail which cites, sadly, numerous examples of extraordinarily inflammatory statements made by public officials across the EU.  The treatment of Roma people is an enormous blight on the EU and its human rights record.  The levels of discrimination that Roma people experience is quite extraordinary.  Amnesty International will send some of that information on to the Senator.  I do not wish to draw too many parallels with Ireland's experience of working to try to address discrimination and marginalisation of members of the Traveller community because there are some significant differences.  The Traveller community is very much an indigenous, ethnic group within Ireland, in our view.  We recognise the difference in terms of what some Roma people face in some countries to which they are relatively recent migrants.  When I say relatively recent, I mean within the last century.  Ireland, perhaps, has some positive experience that it could share about how we have tried to use an anti-discrimination approach, through legislation, policy formation, funding, resource allocation and so forth, to try to address that particular issue here.  We could also, perhaps, take a look ourselves and see what we can learn in terms of improving that approach.  We have positive things to offer to countries which are a bit more averse to looking at the issue of Roma discrimination directly.  One of the things we would really like to see the Presidency do is to pick up and advance the anti-discrimination directive which has been effectively moribund for the last few years.  Our understanding is that the Irish Presidency is trying to move that forward and we think it is something it should definitely do.  It would go a long way towards addressing discrimination generally, but particularly for the Roma population.</p></speech>

Having read them all, I find there is no recommendation with which I disagree.  However, I need some illumination on some issues.</p><p>  I will start with human rights defenders.

I was in the Mansion House when that organisation was nominating a series of activists.  In fact, some governments protested - I think it was the Israeli, Moroccan and Iranian governments - vigorously at the inclusion of some human rights defenders.</p><p>  The witnesses are representing Amnesty International.  There is another international body that deals with front line defenders, giving them aid when they are threatened and so forth.  Is there duplication there in any sense?  We also have the OSCE, the Council of Europe and others, including this committee, addressing the issue of human rights.  A lot of resources were available to publicise human rights defenders within Ireland, through newspaper articles and advertisements in <i>The Irish Times</i>, on bus shelters and indeed, through enormous banners hanging buildings.  Is there duplication here?  Do the organisations adopt the same people?  For example, Amnesty International lists nine cases of people under threat.  Are those same people already supported by Front Line Defenders?</p><p>  My next question relates to the question of borders and Amnesty International has some interesting recommendations in that regard.  Specific reference is made to Frontex in the submission.  We know that there is great movement of people through countries like Greece and through Morocco to Spain.  There is great movement of people throughout the world and I understand that Frontex is an agency charged with defending national borders or boundaries.  I ask the witnesses to outline whether they are happy with the performance of Frontex.  The submission refers to rescuing people in distress at sea and their prompt and safe disembarkment.  We know there are lots of people coming to Europe from northern Africa by boat.  Is Amnesty International happy that Frontex acts as an independent, impartial agency and upholds human rights standards?</p><p>  My final question relates to the reference to &quot;Dublin Regulation's operation&quot; in the context of asylum seekers and refugees.  Are these international regulations or ones which apply specifically to Ireland?  The submission reads, &quot;The Presidency must ensure that solidarity measures within the EU are also geared to seeking to address systemic deficiencies in asylum systems and addressing the imbalances in the Dublin Regulation' s operation&quot;.  Are these regulations that are applicable solely in Ireland?</p></speech>

On the question of duplication, Front Line Defenders is a really extraordinary organisation.  Its founder and director, Ms Mary Lawlor is a predecessor of mine in Amnesty International and I hold her in very high regard indeed.  She established Front Line Defenders because she believed that there was a need to provide very practical supports to human rights defenders.  Front Line Defenders does really invaluable work in providing respite, resources, funding, technical support and so forth to human rights defenders so that they can continue on with their work.  Its focus is quite different to that of Amnesty International.  Clearly, both organisations campaign to try to protect individual human rights defenders, not least because they deserve that protection but also because if we can improve the situation in any one given case, that can have a broader positive impact for people living and working in that region, or country, as human rights defenders.  I do not believe there is a duplication, as such.  There is a huge amount of co-operation between the two organisations but we undertake somewhat different work.</p><p>  On the question of the Dublin guidelines, as Senator Norris correctly pointed out, Dublin refers to the fact that this agreement was struck in our capital city.  That is perhaps unfortunate, given its provisions and their implications for many people.  </p><p>  Frontex is the EU border control agency.  It is not a human rights entity or agency.  </p></speech>

I am aware that in January there was an announcement at EU level about border management with Libya.  We are slightly concerned that the announcement did not have enough emphasis on human rights.  This is linked, once again, to the point about internal and external coherence.  There cannot be statements at EU level that refer to a full commitment to human rights in Syria but then, on the other hand, when it comes to dealing with people fleeing from that country, the EU clamps down the borders.  There must be a human rights focal point there.  As Colm rightly said, Frontex is concerned with border management but there must be a human rights concerns there too.  We have noticed that other agencies at EU level dealing specifically with refugees and migrants within the EU are not being as well resourced as Frontex, which is a concern of ours.  We are also concerned about the independence of the human rights advice given to Frontex.  We understand that there is now a human rights advisory system in Frontex but we would question its independence.  We would argue that human rights should not just be a consideration but should be central to any decisions or actions taken by Frontex with regard to migrants.</p><p>  The point raised about lives at sea is connected with externalisation.  We had an international human rights camp in Lampedusa in the south of Italy last summer, where we documented and raised awareness about the thousands of lives that are lost at sea. </p> <p>We are speaking about the obligation of the EU and its member states to proactively respond to distress calls and ensure lives are not lost at sea.</p></speech>

We do not have to go too far for this type of comment.  A huge spectrum of issues has been covered and I will confine myself to a small number of them.  Amnesty International works with EU embassies and delegations.  The committee meets many ambassadors and I certainly have followed up on cases with individual ambassadors.  Is there a role for the committee to raise specific human rights issues when we meet ambassadors?  We have a good relationship with the ambassadors from Iran and Kenya.  The African ambassadors meet us collectively.  We do not have an ambassador from the United States just yet but I presume we will have one.  The United States has major questions to answer when it comes to human rights.  They are very good at telling other people what to do but they lack in doing it themselves.</p><p>  I wish to wear my Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, AWEPA, hat and speak about the human rights of workers.  Recently we had an interesting discussion with the Dublin Port Authority which has initiated a programme with ports in certain African countries, particularly in west and east Africa.  It involves a training programme with workers in these ports and AWEPA hopes to follow up on it.  A recent meeting with a gentleman from Kenya brought home the absolute ruthlessness and unscrupulousness of multinational companies when it comes to land.  It is a real David and Goliath issue.  They offer an abysmal amount of money for the use of land, the use of which the population is then deprived of, and this has repercussions for food.  Fortunately in this particular area the Kenyan community stood together with an NGO and was able to do something about it.  I do not think enough is being done with businesses with regard to human rights.  Some NGOs work very hard on country-by-country auditing, so something can be done about the massive amounts of tax evasion and tax avoidance.</p><p>  We have much to answer for when it comes to how we treat migrants.  Regardless of how one feels about them being here, the fact is they are here and they are entitled to be treated with dignity.  I have friends who work with unaccompanied minors on great integration programmes with schools in the inner city.  They work on a pittance and I was appalled recently when I learned of the amount spent on direct provision.  Some people are making a great deal of money out of the needs of other people.  We must look practically at what can be done.  Where is Amnesty International on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700008#G00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Colm O'Gorman and Ms Iverna McGowan.  I wish to follow up Deputy Crowe's point on the Palestinian refugee camps.  Recently I and several colleagues visited Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.  I must say we found the conditions appalling.  We did not expect it to be wonderful, but we were shocked by what we saw.  People received only one meal a day and between 12 and 16 people were sleeping on the ground in one room in sub-zero temperatures, which reach -5&deg;C in some instances.  What really appalled us was that these camps have existed since 1948.  One of my colleagues made the point that we have a plethora of international organisations, NGOs and states dealing with human rights.  The agenda is broadening all the time.  Have we lost focus?  Here is a fundamental breach of human rights, which has existed since 1948, which has not advanced one iota in the interim.</p><p>  I agree fully with my colleague, Senator Norris, on the persecution of gay and lesbian people in certain parts of the world, particularly in the areas mentioned in Africa.  This is to be decried and the Chairman's initiative is good.  Under the EU action plan, as big an issue which probably involves even greater numbers, is freedom of religion and belief.  Tremendous persecution of Christians in particular, but also of other denominations, takes place in various parts of the world.  In the Middle East and parts of Africa, Christians are persecuted.  We see what has happened in Nigeria and the number of Christians killed in Boko Haram when they went to church and were bombed.  I read about freedom of religion in many reports but I hear very little advocacy from NGOs or governments with regard to condemnation and seeking specific actions to be taken in this regard.</p><p>  I commend the comments made on the arms trade treaty and I hope at the end of March to attend the UN debate on it.  What is Amnesty International actively doing, particularly in countries which oppose it, such as the US, to ensure it is adopted and put into effect?  Many of the human rights breaches we see in various parts of the world are as a consequence of some of the major international states selling arms to both sides in conflict areas, which impacts on civilian communities in a disastrous way.</p><p>  Freedom of expression online and offline is an important issue and needs to be promoted.  I do not use social media, but people bring to my attention certain aspects of it.  There is much abuse and personalised commentary, some of it defamatory.  We have seen only one case being taken.  Some of the comment is general but some is very specific and personalised.  This needs to be addressed and tackled.  The abuse of any freedom becomes an impediment to that freedom being universally recognised.  Unless it is tackled, we will provide excuses for people and countries not to embrace the medium as part of our democratic structures.</p><p>  Amnesty International is very familiar with the case of Sergei Magnitsky and I know it has taken a position on it.  Should we use the opportunity of our EU Presidency to create greater awareness of this case throughout the EU?  Tremendous human rights breaches occur in Russia and if this case could in some way be used effectively and constructively, it could be a catalyst to prevent such cases in the future.</p><p>  I presume Amnesty International subscribes fully to the enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities.  I was recently contacted by a lady in England whose first child suffers from Down's syndrome.  As a result of the situation in Britain she finds it almost impossible to get the resources and access the support systems which are essential for the child's development.  The reason for this is that identification of Down's syndrome leads to abortion in 90% of cases.  What is Amnesty International's position on this?  Does it regard this as a breach of human rights?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm O'Gorman" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700008#G00500"><p>Certainly and I will try to get through them.  Deputy O'Sullivan asked about meeting particular ambassadors, and we encourage all members of the committee to raise individual human rights cases when they meet ambassadors of particular countries.  We are available and happy to provide any information we can which may assist them and they should please feel free to contact us in this regard.</p><p>  With regard to corporate accountability, the practices of multinationals and the exploitation of land, we have done a huge amount of work on the clean-up of the Niger Delta with a target for Shell.  There is also what happened in Bhopal in India and other major multinationals have been responsible through their business activity for grave violations of human rights.  We seek a system of law which holds multinationals to account for the human rights abuses for which they are responsible, wherever they might occur.  At EU level this is particularly what we are speaking about.</p> <p>We have asked the Presidency to open discussions on the need to improve access to an effective remedy for victims of corporate human rights abuse, identifying existing obstacles and the steps that could be taken towards removing them.  Such steps should include the facilitation of access to state-based judicial and non-judicial remedies.</p><p> The issue of immunity takes me on in some ways to Senator Walsh's comments on Russia.  There is nothing like immunity to allow human rights violations to continue unchecked.  They become graver and more gratuitous the longer such immunity continues.  The EU must do everything it can to address immunity for human rights violations in the conduct of multinationals or external European states.</p><p> The ongoing scandal - I use that word advisedly - of the length of time that families spend in direct provision in Ireland is the result of the failure of successive Governments to introduce an effective asylum process.  People are perfectly entitled to come to Ireland to seek asylum.  They are then entitled to expect a process to be put in place by the State that addresses their claims for asylum in a timely and effective manner and to be treated with dignity and respect while within the State seeking asylum.  It is fair to say that the State is falling short in that regard.  That families are languishing in direct asylum is a major issue.  Children spending their childhoods in direct provision is unacceptable and I agree that something must be done to address this situation as quickly as possible.</p><p> Freedom of religion and belief is a core human right and is an area in which we are active, including at EU level.  Our work on tackling Islamaphobia and anti-Semitism speaks for itself.  Senator Walsh should feel free to contact us regarding the human rights violations experienced by people of the Christian faith in other parts of the world.  We would be happy to share our information on individual cases and the work we are doing thereon.</p><p> We have lobbied long and hard in Ireland to ensure that Ireland ratifies the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a groundbreaking international treaty that will cause a massive shift in how we as society deal with the question of disability.  It is a profoundly important legal instrument.  Ireland has signed it, but we hope that it will be ratified as quickly as possible.</p><p> The issue of abusive and personalised commentary in social media was raised.  I am familiar with the concept, as I am active in social media.  Thankfully, some of us are more equipped to deal with such comments when we see them.  It is a matter for national legislators to address.  Our concern as regards Internet freedom is that people should, as an extension of their right to freedom of expression, be able to access the kinds of technology that allow them to communicate effectively.  For us as a human rights organisation, this in many ways is an issue of freedom of expression and assembly.</p><p> I believe that I have covered most of the points.</p></speech>

As members know, Mr. Magnitsky died in police custody in Moscow in November, 2009.  This was alarming and gave rise to many disturbing questions over the circumstances of his death that have not been properly answered.  On the contrary, subsequent investigations by Russian authorities and their decision to prosecute Mr. Magnitsky on tax evasion charges, even after his death, call into question whether fundamental human rights are being respected in this case.</p> <p>Mr. William Browder has been present from early today raising issues with other Members of Parliament, including the Council of Europe and the OSCE.  He is raising awareness of the case and seeking justice for Mr. Magnitsky, who as a lawyer advised Mr. Browder&rsquo;s company, Hermitage Capital Management.</p><p> Before he makes his presentation I advise Mr. Browder that he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at the committee.  However, if he is directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his remarks.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the meeting is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses, or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I again thank Mr. Browder for coming before the committee and invite him to address us on Mr. Magnitsky&rsquo;s case.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, he was my lawyer in Moscow who was murdered in police custody on 16 November 2009.  It is my duty to his memory and his family to make sure that justice is done.  I have been working to that end for the past three and a half years.  In order to inform the committee about the campaign and what I hope can be done in this country, I will outline the background to the story, first about myself and then about Sergei Magnitsky.</p><p>  In 1996 I set up a business to invest in the Russian stock market in Moscow.  My company, Hermitage Capital Management, became the largest investment fund in Russia.  We discovered that a number of the companies in which we had bought shares were run in a highly corrupt fashion.  We decided that in order to stop the corruption, we would expose it by doing what we called forensic research and ensuring it would be made available to the international media.  The public naming and shaming campaigns were quite successful but the more successful we became in exposing corruption, the more angry those who were corrupt became.  On 13 November 2005, as I was flying back to Russia, having lived there for ten years and become the largest foreign investor in the country, I was stopped at the border and detained for 15 hours and then deported back to the UK where I had begun my trip.  After that it became clear that I was being persecuted by the Russian Government and I quickly got my employees out of the country and liquidated our holdings there in the hope that it would be the end of the story.  It turned out that it was not the end but the beginning of the worst nightmare anyone could ever experience under pretty much any circumstances.</p><p>  About 18 months after I was expelled, 25 police officers from the Moscow interior ministry raided my Moscow office, and 25 more officers raided the office of my American law firm, Firestone Duncan.  One of the young lawyers there looked at the search warrant and said it did not give entitlement to take the documents they wanted to take.  They pulled the young man into a conference room and beat him viciously.  He was hospitalised for three weeks.  The documents that were seized during the raid were used three months later to fraudulently re-register our investment holding companies out of our name into the name of a man named Viktor Markelov who had been convicted of murder several years previously and let out of jail early by the interior ministry.  At that point we became extremely disturbed by the pattern of events and we hired another lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky.  He was 36 years old.  He worked for the law firm, Firestone Duncan.  He was one of the smartest lawyers we knew in Russia.  We sent Sergei out to investigate what was going on, why the raid was carried out and what the objective was.</p><p>  Sergei investigated and came up with pretty unbelievable conclusions.  He concluded that the officials that had taken the documents had used them first of all to try to steal all of our assets, but did not succeed because they had already been liquidated and taken out of the country.  As a second step the group of corrupt officials used the documents to steal not our assets but $230 million dollars of taxes that we paid in the previous year.  They had gone through a complicated scheme whereby they applied for an illegal tax refund using the documents seized in our offices.  They applied on 23 December 2007 and the tax refund was approved and paid out the very next day.  It was the largest refund in tax history.</p><p>  We believed that this must have been a rogue operation.  It could have been acceptable and even authorised by the Government to steal a foreign investor's assets but it is hardly imaginable that they could have been allowed to steal &euro;230 million of taxes that were paid to the state.  Sergei testified against the police officers who were involved in the raid in June 2008 and again in October 2008.  Shortly after his testimony two subordinates of one of the officers who was named in his testimony came to his house on 24 November 2008 at 8 a.m. and arrested him.  He was put in pre-trial detention and they began to torture him to withdraw his testimony.  They put him in a cell with 14 inmates and eight beds, and left the lights on twenty four hours a day to sleep deprive him in the hope that after a week of it he would recant his testimony against the police officers.  They then presented him with a confession to sign in which they asked him to confess to the theft of the stolen tax money that he had discovered and exposed.  Sergei refused.  They then put him in a cell with no heat and no window panes in December in Moscow, and he nearly froze to death.  They put him in a cell with no toilet, just a hole in the floor, where sewage would bubble up.  They did a number of other terrible things and after approximately six months he became sick.  He developed severe stomach pains, lost 20 kg and was diagnosed with pancreatitis and gallstones.  He needed an operation which was scheduled for 1 August 2009.</p><p>  One week before the scheduled operation, he was abruptly moved from a prison with medical facilities to a maximum security prison called Butyrka, which is considered to be one of the toughest prisons in Russia, and most significantly for Sergei, there were no medical facilities there.  At Butryka, his health completely broke down and he went into a downward spiral of pain and ill health.  He and his lawyers made more than 20 desperate requests for medical attention to various branches of the Russian penal system.  Every single one of them was either ignored or rejected.  We have written copies of some of the rejections to his desperate pleas for medical attention.  On the night of 16 November 2009, Sergei fell into a critical condition.  Only then did they agree to move him to a prison with medical facilities.  When Sergei arrived at the prison with medical facilities, instead of treating him<i>,</i> they put him into an isolation cell and allowed eight riot guards with rubber batons to beat him for one hour and 18 minutes until he died at the age of 37.</p><p>  One could ask how we know all of this.  Up until the last night of his life Sergei wrote it all down.  He wrote 450 complaints about his mistreatment and the misuse of the justice system to torture him.  Those complaints document who did what, when, how and where.  Since he died we have been able to corroborate all of his testimony with documents from the Russian penal system.</p> <p>They are not very good at covering up their crimes and, for example, we have documents showing the signature of the head of the prison authorising the use of rubber batons on him in the last night of his life.  We have the signatures of people in the penal system that denied him medical attention.  We have the signatures of the police officers who fabricated evidence, which we can prove to be fabricated, to arrest him.  Given all of this evidence and at this point this truly is the most well-documented human rights abuse case to have come out of Russia in the past 35 years, we assumed that given the profile of this case, given the level of evidence and most importantly, given that President Medvedev or now ex-President Medvedev, had called for an investigation one week after he died, the people who committed this crime would be prosecuted.  Three and a half years later, not a single Russian official has been prosecuted for the false arrest, torture and murder of Sergei Magnitsky.  They all have been exonerated.  Some of them have been given big promotions and some have been given state honours.  In fact, on the first anniversary of Sergei's death, six people who were involved in this case were given special Interior Ministry honours, which is the highest honour one can get in the Interior Ministry.  Most shockingly, the only prosecution that has happened is the prosecution of Sergei Magnitsky himself.  On 4 March, they intend to resume the case against Sergei Magnitsky and against me in court.  They are prosecuting Sergei Magnitsky in the first-ever posthumous trial in the history of Russia and one of the very few posthumous trials anywhere in the world in the past 1,000 years.  To make matters worse, since Sergei is not there to defend himself in this trial, they have summoned his mother and widow to be the representatives of the defendant in this unprecedented legal procedure.  Moreover, just today Sergei's brother-in-law has been summoned for interrogation at the Interior Ministry in Moscow.</p><p> The conclusion one can draw is there is absolutely no chance of getting any kind of justice for Sergei Magnitsky under the current regime in Russia.  From that conclusion, we decided that if we could not get justice for Sergei in Russia, we should try to get justice for him outside Russia.  How does one get justice outside Russia?  There is no jurisdiction in Ireland, the United Kingdom or anywhere else for the murder in Russia of Sergei Magnitsky.  We cannot prosecute them for murder or various other crimes.  However, the one thing we do know about this crime is it was not a crime of ideology or religion but was a crime of money.  This was a crime of money concerning $230 million.  The people who committed this crime and who commit crimes just like it - there are many other crimes just like it in Russia - like to keep their money outside of Russia.  They do not want to keep their money in Russia because it is not safe there.  Consequently, they keep their money in France by buying villas, or in America and the United Kingdom.  There probably is some of their money in Ireland.  They like to keep their families out of Russia and like to travel and to vacation abroad.  Basically, they like to have the freedom, the security and the rule of law in the West.  They like to commit their crimes in Russia and then have all this great stuff in the West.  We thought that if we could take that away from them, it may not be justice in the true sense of the word but it is at least a small step towards pricking this bubble of impunity that exists in Russia.</p><p> Consequently, I went to the Congress of the United States in April 2010 and suggested this to a bipartisan group of Senators.  They liked the idea and as a result, we ended up with Senator Benjamin Cardin, who is a very liberal Democrat, and Senator John McCain, who is a very conservative Republican, teaming up and proposing what has become known as the Magnitsky Act, which would impose visa sanctions and asset freezes on the people who killed Sergei Magnitsky.  It went through the process of various committees and in November 2012, the Senate voted on the law with a 93% approval.  The House of Representatives also voted on the law and on 14 December, Barack Obama signed the Magnitsky Act into law.  It is now a federal statute in the United States.  As I stated, this would name names, ban visas and freeze the assets of the people who killed Sergei Magnitsky.  In parallel, the European Parliament considered the same law and in November, shortly before President Obama signed the law in America, passed its own version of the Magnitsky Act calling on the European Council to impose EU-wide visa sanctions and asset freezes on the people who killed Magnitsky.  I should point out that the law in America and the law in Europe do not simply apply to Magnitsky.  While Magnitsky is the name on the law, it also applies to other gross human rights abusers in Russia.</p><p> I will turn to what I am doing here and what I hope to achieve in Ireland.  It is a great pleasure to be in Ireland because of all the countries to which I have travelled, and I have travelled to about 13 countries, this is one of the countries in which I am speaking the same language in terms of both language and values.  This is a place where people understand right and wrong and what should be done.  I have got a very warm reaction in all the one-on-one meetings I have had today before coming to testify here.  What I hope will happen here in Ireland is something we also have done in a number of other European Union member states, which is that I would like this joint committee to put forth a resolution calling on the Irish Government to impose visa sanctions and asset freezes for the people who killed Sergei Magnitsky and the people who perpetrate other gross human rights abuses in Russia.  The joint committee should ask the Government to do the same thing here.  In addition, Ireland is punching well above its weight at present by holding the Presidency of the European Union and it could use that opportunity to further what already has happened in the European Parliament.  There is an opportunity to have the Government call on the European Council to discuss and to pass the EU-wide Magnitsky sanctions that were proposed at the European Parliament.  I learned about the story of Veronica Guerin and the Criminal Assets Bureau here, which essentially has the same objectives as the Magnitsky Act.  The final thing I would ask Members of the Oireachtas to do is to amend the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation to include the people who killed Sergei Magnitsky and similar crimes of that nature.</p><p> I wish to finish my thoughts there but will share one last observation, which is that when I propose these things, this is not the West beating up on Russia.  The people in Russia, albeit not the regime in Russia, are all in favour of this.  They have no tool available to them at present to deal with the impunity, the criminality and the kleptocracy of their regime.  Civil society, all the opposition and everyone outside the Putin regime is cheering for this.  One can see it in anecdotal terms but one can also see it in quantitative terms.  A poll was conducted in Russia asking how many people supported the foreign Magnitsky Act-type of legislation and only about 40% of the population had heard of it and approximately 60% had not.  However, of that 40%, two thirds of Russians support Magnitsky-style legislation and only one third are opposed to it.  I thank members for this opportunity and of course will be glad to answer any questions from any one.</p></speech>

It is very disturbing to hear these circumstances.  I will now ask members to ask questions but because many members are present today, including Members representing the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, I ask them to confine themselves to asking questions rather than making lengthy remarks, because Mr. Browder has gone through the background to the case itself.</p></speech>

Deputy John Paul Phelan and I, as well as others, have heard this presentation previously at the OSCE and it had a powerful influence on us, as I believe it has had on the joint committee here.  As for the parallel with the case of Veronica Guerin, who had the courage to tackle organised crime, lawyers often are front-line defenders for human rights and, therefore, when they are attacked and murdered it cries out for people of goodwill to take up their cases.</p> <p>'What is the intention or purpose of the the trial of Mr. Magnitsky?  Is it to discredit him?  It is extraordinary if that is the case.  Mr. Browder referred to his interaction with the US Congress.  I understand he has also met with representatives of other Parliaments and has their support.  Perhaps he would elaborate on this and also on his interaction with the European Parliament and Council of Europe.   </p></speech>

This has never been done before and is ghoulish beyond belief.  It is hard to get inside the minds of criminals.  My theory is that the Russian Government is apoplectically mad about the passage of the Magnitsky Act.  It touches it in such a way it is in a state of raw panic in terms of how to deal with it.  One of the ways in which that panic is manifesting itself is in this posthumous trial.  What it might be trying to do is obtain a conviction against Mr. Magnitsky.  As I stated previously, I am a codefendant.  The Russian Government is trying to secure a conviction against me and is trying me <i>in absentia. </i> In this regard, it is visiting Parliaments throughout Europe, which is where they are afraid the Magnitsky Act will come into force, saying that it has been proven in court that Mr. Magnitsky and I are criminals.  I do not believe what they are doing will have the desired effect.  Most people react in the same manner as Members have today.  I do not believe those involved are emotionally intelligent enough to understand how people will react to this.</p><p>  On my interaction with other Parliaments, we have visited 12 Parliaments throughout Europe seeking to have resolutions passed.  Approximately 18 months ago the Dutch Parliament unanimously passed a resolution calling on the Dutch Government to impose Magnitsky sanctions.  The British Parliament backbench committee passed a cross-party resolution calling for Magnitsky sanctions.  Some 59 members of seven of the eight parties in the Swedish Parliament called on their Prime Minister to impose Magnitsky sanctions.  The Polish, Italian, Canadian and other Parliaments have also passed resolutions.  The OSCE resolution calling on all member states of the OSCE to impose Magnitsky sanctions was supported by approximately 90% of members.  The European Parliament also passed a resolution in November.  We are not treading new ground here.  Ireland is an important place because of its position as President of the European Council.  I would not normally push for swift action but to the extent that Ireland is interested in taking some action, it has only a six month window within to do so.  I ask that it do so quickly.</p></speech>

Mr. Browder mentioned an attempt has been made to freeze assets.  How successful has that been?  Mr. Browder also mentioned forensic research and said that the only avenue open to him was to publicly name and shame those involved.  We are all aware of the show trials in Russia a number of years ago but trial of a dead man seems bizarre.</p><p>  Mr. Browder mentioned the countries who have passed resolutions and the reaction in Russia in terms of enacting legislation preventing US adoptions, imports of pork and so on.

We are now in the final stages of concluding the updated list based on information we have gathered over two years.  While I cannot be definitive, I believe the list will include more than the original 60 persons.  This is not speculation.  This is based on evidence in terms of signatures on documents which come within the US sanctions.  All of this information will be released in the course of the next few weeks when the Americans have completed their list.  The Americans had 120 days from December to 15 April to release a list of who should be on the Magnitsky list.</p></speech>

The Deputy Interior Minister and others are also on that list.  While the original list includes persons up to Deputy Minister level I expect the new list will include persons at a higher level.</p><p>  On asset tracing, there are two issues involved.  First, assets held in America or in Europe by any person on the list and second, where the money has gone.  Through working with a number of investigators, investigative journalists and whistleblowers we have been able to locate &euro;135 million of the &euro;230 million stolen.  That money was located in eight jurisdictions, including Cyprus, Moldova, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Switzerland, Finland and Austria.  The Swiss have frozen millions of dollars, as have the Austrians and Lithuanians.  Our hope is that all this money will be frozen so that the people who perpetrated this crime will not benefit from it.</p><p>  I should also point out that the &euro;230 million stolen was only the tip of the iceberg.  We have discovered that in addition to that amount, the same group in Government and the criminals, using the same scheme and tax office and people, stole at least another &euro;800 million.   On retaliation in other countries, the Russian Government has retaliated against the US in the form of banning US adoptions, pork and cutting off law enforcement co-operation, with a specific purpose.  The Russians are not overly concerned about the US in that the damage has already been done in the US.  They are, however, worried about what happens in Europe, which is where all of their interests are.  They wanted to send out the message loud and clear that Russia proposes to retaliate.  The best way of dealing with this type of threat is to do this on a concerted basis with every other country.  Gazprom has done a lot of bad stuff, in respect of which the European Commission, as opposed to individual countries, is engaged in an investigation.  Acting in numbers is safer.  </p></speech>

To what extent has the international community been alerted and encouraged to bring pressure in respect of this matter on the authorities in Russia?</p> <p>In respect of the European Union, to what degree has the violation of human rights been used as a means of requiring the authorities in Russia to respond in a meaningful way?  Third, it might be opportune for the Chairman and a delegation of the committee to meet the Russian ambassador to bring to his attention the situation as reported to us for the important reason of the trade between Russia and European Union and the need to recognise that this is an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed.  Where there is failure to address the situation, in respect of countries that have committed themselves to international human rights standards and those which do not, there is a need to investigate the matter further.</p></speech>

The US State Department stated that it was resetting its relations with Russia and it had no interest in doing something like that.  It was only after enlisting legislative pressure from elected law makers that I was heard.</p><p>  What one has is <i>realpolitik</i> versus doing right.  Law makers are elected by their constituents to do right.  Persons who sit in the executive positions must weigh up doing right with all other considerations.  What I was able to do was to leverage the way the US system is organised to have doing right ultimately trump <i>realpolitik</i>.</p><p>  In Europe, I have been to a number of different parliaments.  Essentially, I have had the will of the people, as expressed through their members of parliament, call on their governments to do something and so far the governments have not acted.  The reason I believe that is the case is because everybody is afraid to act.  Nobody wants to upset Russia because it is a highly vindictive and aggressive country.  Having said that, among the people in Europe, and the people in Ireland and the members' constituents, there is not a person who would say Parliament has done wrong by banning Russian torturers and murderers from coming into Ireland.</p><p>  A poll came out today in France because President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande is visiting Russia.  It asked French people whether they would support a French version of the Magnitsky Act, and 85% of the French population stated they would support it.  This is one of those issues where the only ones who are against it are the Putin regime.</p><p>  We are in a situation right now that is like the anti-Apartheid movement.  There were many who said, &quot;Listen, let us not get involved with that.  They are doing what they are doing in South Africa but we just have to live with that.  We need to trade with them.&quot; but, eventually, people said &quot;This is outrageous.  We just cannot allow Apartheid to carry on.&quot;  That is what we are talking about here.</p><p>  We are talking about a kleptocracy, which, basically, is stealing all the resources from its country, where 141 million are being stolen from for the benefit of a few; they commit murders and do terrible things, and we have a tool to fight them.  It is not going to be easy.  Doing right is sometimes not easy.  Doing right in concert makes it less painful because it is in their economic interest as well.  What really touched me when I went around talking to people here in Ireland is that they are saying, &quot;Of course, we should do something because this is about basic human rights.&quot;  I do not have that conversation in all countries I go to, but here I did.</p><p>  In terms of the oligarchs and the Putin regime, President Putin wanted to crush anybody who was not reporting to him when he came into power and he crushed Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky as an example of what he would do to anybody else who did not report to him.  As a result, everybody either reported to him or got crushed or was sent into exile.</p><p>  I was not a big fan of the oligarchs in Russia when they were doing their oligarch stuff, but I am now a big sympathiser with Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was actually one of the people I was least a fan of back in his business days.  In fact, his son was there lobbying for the US Magnitsky Act.  Khodorkovsky's son and his other people gave us names of persons to contact here in Ireland with whom they had been in touch.  We all are working towards a common goal which is to stop this terrible stuff going on in Russia for many people because Mr. Sergei Magnitsky and his father are merely the tip of an iceberg.  This stuff is going on everywhere in Russia.</p></speech>

I was appalled by the Russian reaction, which was to punish children who were up for adoption.  I think of the trauma and pain for those families who are ready to take those children.  That was a further example of an abuse of human rights.</p><p>  Mine is a simple question.  Are Mr. Sergei Magnitsky's family in danger?  Mr. Browder mentioned a brother-in-law and I note, from what Mr. Browder was writing, the situation of his mother.  I wonder what protection have other members of his family in Russia, if they are there.</p></speech>

I was impressed with his delivery and the telling of his story.  I would be interested to hear whether he himself is ploughing a lonely furrow or whether he has support with him.</p><p>  On the Act that was signed into law in the United States by President Obama in December last, Mr. Browder stated he identified a number of officials - I think he mentioned 300 - and a list.  I am sure that law is being implemented.  It is an eye-opener to me.  The effect it could have is that there would be persons such as this who would have accumulated such an amount of wealth, investing it abroad and keeping it bank accounts in the United States and elsewhere.</p></speech>

Like everybody here, I am horrified by this case.  As parliamentarians, we certainly want to do everything we possibly can to get justice for Mr. Magnitsky.</p><p>  I have one question.  I am really intrigued as to how Mr. Browder succeeded in getting documentation from inside the prison to prove that Mr. Sergei Magnitsky was so badly ill-treated and denied access to medical treatment during his very serious illness.  I am really curious about that.</p></speech>

If I had my druthers, every close relative would be outside the country.  Some are; many are not.</p> <p>His mother in particular is fighting really hard for justice and putting herself at great personal risk for her only son.  She lost everything in her own mind and she has no interest in leaving but has every interest in fighting.  What can we do to protect her?  We can ensure everybody knows everything she is doing so the eyes of the world are on her.  We have done that.  I was truly shocked to hear that Mr. Magnitsky's brother-in-law was summoned for questioning today but that is what they do, and they want to terrify everybody.  I can only hope that they are feeling restrained by the eyes of world being on them.</p><p> I was asked whether I am doing this alone and the answer is "No".  I am the leader of this campaign but when one works on a righteous cause, many people will join from everywhere.  People say I must have spent much money on this; I have spent much money on plane tickets but I have not spent much on everything else.  People want to be part of something that is right and something which can be effective in having greater significance.  This is not just touching Sergei's case but all the cases in Russia, and the entire Russian opposition has joined me in this campaign.  If any member of the Russian opposition comes here, this is a guaranteed topic about which he or she will talk.  There is a real movement around the world of people supporting us in different ways in the political and legal processes.  They are helping us tell the story, and it is heartwarming to see that there are many good people out there.</p><p> Senator Clune's second question was about the US.</p></speech>

What the implications so far of the Magnitsky Act?  It has only been in place for two months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Browder" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700014#N00300"><p>The Act has been in place since 14 December and the US Administration, according to the law, has 120 days to implement it.  It is an open-ended story, as this would also address all gross human rights abusers.  We do not know if the US State Department will put one name or 300 names on the list or how it will defend the names on the list.  The Russians are really terrified of this.  Not only have they retaliated against the Americans, but they have also passed a number of laws in Russia because of their terror.</p><p>  For example, they passed a law earlier this week banning officials from owning foreign property because they are so afraid of having officials' assets frozen.  The ban on adoption is tremendously heart-breaking, and it led to anger among many Russians, even within the elite.  The Russians are children-loving people if there ever were children-loving people.  Taking children as hostages in order to protect an ability to travel was not acceptable to anybody inside Russia.  Some 50,000 people came out on the street after the adoption ban, and it was called the &quot;law of scoundrels&quot;.  Officials have had to allocate significant sums of money to try to justify that adoption ban.  There have been all sorts of unintended consequences and nobody had an idea that they would come about.</p><p>  The question was asked about how we got the documents from prison.  Russia is a place with no rule of law but there is incredible adherence to procedure that would not be seen in any other place.  If there is a rule about having a detention hearing every three months, it will happen, and if there is a rule that one can file a complaint, that will also happen.  Mr. Magnitsky writes handwritten complaints - sometimes more than once a day - and every month or so he is allowed to meet his lawyer.  He hands the lawyer a stack of complaints to be filed and they would be ignored.  Nevertheless, the lawyer would make a copy when filing the complaints, with the result being our incredible record of what happened to him.  It is like Solzhenitsyn's <i>Gulag Archipelago</i> for a modern time.</p><p>  The psychology of allowing these documents to leave is interesting.  Russia has essentially been operating in what is essentially a closed system, and there was never a thought that any of this would have any impact.  It controls the entire criminal justice system so it does not matter what the documents state.  Russia had no idea that these documents could be used in an international forum to create some type of consequence outside Russia, which is terrifying for those in power.  These people believed they could ask people to do really terrible things and guarantee immunity but although we may not be punishing them the way they should be, we are nonetheless taking away absolute immunity.  President Putin cannot promise his people that nothing will happen if they commit a terrible human rights abuse.  That is the beauty of this policy and why it is so important.  I hope Ireland will join me in doing what we have done elsewhere in the world.</p></speech>

We have come out of interest from a Council of Europe perspective in the case of me and Deputy John Paul Phelan.  Deputy Ann Phelan's interests come from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  I join in welcoming Mr. Browder, and I share the admiration of others for his loyalty to a colleague and his almost single-handed pursuit of the matter.</p><p>  What precisely does Mr. Browder want from the committee?  Does he want a motion to go from the committee to the Government?  Does he want us to suggest to the Government that it freezes the assets of people on the Magnitsky list and that it withdraw visas?</p></speech>

As the Magnitsky list grows, the question arises of whether there is risk of a Star Chamber dimension being added.  As the list grows, how sure could we be that the list is being expanded appropriately?  I am very interested in what Mr. Browder wants us to do and the risks arising as the list grows.</p></speech>

In a perfect world, I would like the committee to draft a motion calling on the Irish Government to implement Magnitsky sanctions in Ireland.  I will describe those sanctions in a moment.  I would also like the motion to call on the Government to use its position as Presidency of the EU to initiate a process at the Council of Ministers for EU-wide implementation of Magnitsky sanctions.  The Magnitsky sanctions specifically proposed would be the publication of names, banning of visas and freezing assets of people involved in the false arrest, torture and death of Mr. Magnitsky and the crimes he uncovered, as well as other comparable gross human rights abuses that take place in Russia.</p><p>  There is currently no list other than what the US Government will ultimately produce.  We can suggest names and it will decide what to do.  The US Government list does not have to be used and other parties can form their own lists.  The list should include people for which there is credible evidence of being involved with these crimes.  I am just an advocate and I am not trying to create extra-judicial processes.  I want a scenario where there is no judicial process.  A visa is not a right but rather it is a privilege.  There are far lower thresholds for denying a visa than evidence that somebody has been involved in a terrible crime.</p><p>  Ireland has its own experience with the Criminal Assets Bureau in deciding the threshold of evidence required to freeze a person's assets.  I would leave this to the Government, as it is not for me to say how this could be done in Ireland.  I would like Ireland to help in creating a process with which we can prick a bubble of impunity.</p></speech>

This is the third time we have met and I am a great supporter of his case.  I was really struck by the commonalities in this case and that of Ms Veronica Guerin.</p> <p>This is the right thing to do.  Everybody has to uphold human rights if we are about democracy at all.  This is not only about Sergei Magnitsky; it is also about the others in Russia who will look to this case to have their human rights vindicated in what is supposedly an emerging democracy.  Human rights are the cornerstone of all democracies and they can only develop where people can live freely and enjoy all the benefits of an open democracy.  There are many human rights abuses in Russia.  I am a big supporter of the case.  There are many similarities between the CAB legislation and the sanctions to which Mr. Browder referred.  However, I will be guided by the Chair as to we proceed with this.  I support this case and I appeal to the committee to also support it.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the facts through the Council of Europe but I have a number of questions that have not been asked through which I seek clarification.  Does the US legislation cover asset freezing or is it only concerned with visas and access to America?  If so, will Mr. Browder give a brief explanation?  He also mentioned that there has been analysis of part of the $230 million involved in Sergei Magnitsky's case and that he had uncovered fraud in addition to other irregularities.  I presume the analysis was conducted by a private individual or company.  How did Mr. Browder gather the information?  Does the April deadline concern only the list of people who will be affected by the legislation signed by President Obama last December?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.403" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Browder" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2013022700015#O00300"><p>The US legislation has three basic components - the publication of the names, the banning of the visas and the freezing of the assets.  There is a different threshold of proof for freezing assets than for banning visas.  With regard to the deadline, the legislation says there is 120 days from the date of the president's signature, which was on 14 December, for the law to be implemented.  In theory - and things never work in practice as well as they work in theory - 13 April is the date on which the US State Department will publish a list.  That is a Saturday and, therefore, 15 April is the first business day after that.  I was in Washington and I have been in touch with the State Department.  They are actively working on not just the Magnitsky case because this includes all other cases.  That is important and I want to stress that.  Magnitsky is the touchstone that surrounds this issue and the sanctions will apply to all gross human rights abuses in Russia.  That is the first date on which there will be a list.  The State Department was specific with me and they said this is an ongoing process.  There will be, perhaps, on 16 April another human rights abuse that will lead to someone being added to the list.  The reason the Russian regime is so terrified is this is open-ended.  This is a process, which, hopefully, after all this push back will start working automatically in a law enforcement manner as opposed to a political manner.  People will just start getting used to the fact that if they engage in human rights abuse, they will lose their visa.</p><p>  With regard to the forensic investigation, this comes back to the question whether I am doing this alone.  All sorts of people have come forward at all sorts of times with all sorts of different types of things.  A journalist from <i>Nezavisimaya Gazeta</i>, one of the main opposition newspapers, gathered a great deal of data in Russia.  An NGO, the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, found information in Moldova.  A whistleblower, who had been a member of the criminal group but fell out with the other members, came forward and gave us a bunch of information about assets in Switzerland.  We went to the New York courts and got a subpoena, which allowed us to get banking information on dollar transfers through US banks and various other things.  We put this all together and that allowed us to come with $135 million of the $230 million.  It allowed us to write these criminal complaints, which led to different asset freezing orders and will lead to many more.  This is just the beginning of the process.</p></speech>

I am of a mind based on what I have heard today and previously during our hearings that it would be prudent to follow the template elsewhere.  I am inclined to go with the suggestion that we seek to have the Government implement the Magnitsky sanctions in Ireland and utilise the opportunity of the EU Presidency to seek to achieve their implementation on an EU-wide basis.  We should do the same as the US regarding the publication of names, the freezing of assets and the withdrawal of assets.  I do not know whether we can do this now or whether legislation needs to be prepared.  We probably need to do this as soon as possible in the context of utilising the final four months of our Presidency.  It would be an important marker regarding where we stand on such fundamental human rights and it would be a courageous move by us.  Perhaps we might consider extending the CAB legislation to include this.  It seems tailor made for the implementation of these sanctions.  We probably need to be advised on which is the best course to take in this regard.</p></speech>

We, as a committee, should support the proposition that we do something and should ask, in turn, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to use the platform of the Presidency.  I would like to caution that this is more about legislation to affect human rights abusers internationally and there is danger in just adopting  the American proposal given this is a Russia-America conflict and the sanctions only affect abusers coming out of Russia and their investment.  We must extend the concept of human rights abuses and allow the Government to use whatever legislation is required in Ireland to apply theses sanctions to countries other than Russia.  I do not know long that would take but we should convey something to the Russian ambassador.  We should also seek a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on this.  I do not how well briefed it is on this issue and how sensitive officials might feel this is because there could be retaliation from a country with which we are building trade relations.  Delegations are going to Russia and there will be sensitivities before we arrive at a conclusion.</p></speech>

So what we are being asked to do is significant.</p><p> I cannot get my head around how any government would allow this asset stripping.  Perhaps the amount of money mentioned is not big relative to the Russian economy, but it is a huge amount.  I do not know how a government could cover up its officials becoming multimillionaires.  I would like to hear what the Russian ambassador has to say on the case.  Mr. Browder may not be too happy with me suggesting that, but we should reflect on it.  I was very moved by what he had to say today.  While I have heard of the case, this is the first time I have actually looked at it in detail and today's session was very informative.  We should invite the Russian ambassador to appear before the committee to discuss the case and consider the broader implications because it is not just this case - there are others.  I would be comfortable enough with regard to tin-pot dictators and some of the other torturers, but many people are on that list.</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the Salient Rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I have a well-documented history, coming from disadvantage and being caught up in the criminal justice system at a very young age.  I am the author of a book, <i>Wasted</i>, that, I think, I have seen in 20 different languages.  I write for <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper and I am an Ashoka fellow.  I am a visiting lecturer at Durham University on the psychology degree.  I am an ex-offender and that is what I have come to talk about.</p><p>  I set up an organisation on which I probably worked for six years.  It has been registered as a charity in the United Kingdom for the past four years.  It is called User Voice and its underline is, &quot;Only offenders can stop re-offending&quot;, which will give the committee a brief on what it is about.</p><p>  This has been my focus.  From entering a period of rehabilitation in 2000, I got clean off drugs.  I started an arboricultural business - tree surgery.  In four years, I employed over 200 young offenders in the business and I developed what I would term a therapeutic work-based environment, that is, one not only works physically but engages mentally in a behavioural change programme that starts in the mind by talking about thoughts and feelings rather than what work one is doing.</p><p>  From there, I wrote the book and started to consult with the British Government, and came up with this idea where I believe there is a gap in the criminal justice system, that is, to learn from the experiences and insight of those at the sharp end of the system.  Often I have found that there is a gap between those who make the policy and those who must live the reality of the system, and my objective for the past six years has been to develop a model that brings them closer together.</p><p>  I set up the organisation as a charity four years ago.  This year we turned over &pound;100 million.  We work in the United Kingdom, from Northumberland, in a 100 mile geographic spread, to Kent and all in between.  We represent probably 15% of the criminal justice system in England, that is, prison and the probation community, and now in youth justice as well.</p><p>  What is it?  We use a council model, a democratic process of service-user engagement.  It is ordered.  We go into prison and we use ex-offenders, who often are the best placed to help somebody who is currently offending to stop because it is that &quot;walked in your shoes&quot; experience.  Offending behaviour, and stepping out of it, is so complex that often the most effective intervention is this communication that takes place between one who is a couple of steps further on than the other and who knows how to navigate his thoughts and feelings and provide information on what one must do to stop offending.  We piloted it in the Isle of Wight in England to 1,600 prisoners on three different sites: Camp Hill, the under 12-months sentence prison; Albany, which is a sex-offender prison where the average length of stay is eight and a half years; and Parkhurst, which is a violent, maximum security prison.</p><p>  In one year, there was a reduction in prisoner complaints in the sex-offender prison - it is an old-age group, a very articulate cohort of persons who submit many complaints and clog the system up, and cost a great deal of money in that time - by 37%.  In Parkhurst prison, there was a reduction in the use of solitary confinement or segregation from 160 days to 47.  At a &pound;30,000 fee it suggested that by addressing problems closer to the cause and involving the community, one reduces the need and expense for punitive measures, and issues were dealt with swiftly by the community.</p><p>  Another of my findings in working with this group is that one its characteristics is the low levels of resilience that exist within it and they find it very difficult to social situations without being violent or disruptive.  Part of the programme, with the learning of this council model, teaches resilience and is, in itself, an intervention.</p><p>  The prison governor would see what we do as a cost-cutting tool.  The UK has seen some significant cuts in the prison budget.  My challenge is that one cannot make the same amount of cuts or remove such a large amount of funding without taking a community along with those changes, otherwise one would get an increase in disturbances, etc.  I believe that is why the prison governor highly values this tool.</p><p>  The prison staff would benefit from low levels of disturbance or occasions of assault on members of staff, and also a more respectable running community - I see prison as a community - where everybody is respectful towards each other and the end user, the prisoner, would get to play a role in something that is positive and contributive.  There is much psychology on how a person doing something positive is less likely to go back and do something negative.</p><p>  We have moved that out into the community.  In London, there are 33 boroughs in London and there are 23 local delivery units for probation services.  We are now in 18 of those boroughs in central London.</p><p>  It is being used in all sorts of ways about which I could not tell the committee in five minutes.  What I can say is that, as far as evidence is concerned, we work with Cambridge University, which is working on a measure in prison called measurement of prison quality of life, MPQL.  It is one that the inspectorate uses in the prison.  Through conversations I have had with the Irish Prison Service, I am aware that it is looking for a similar kind of measurement.  This model is been measured against MPQL in three prisons: Aylesbury which is public-sector run, Maidstone, which is public-sector run; and Birmingham, which is a private G4S prison with 1,600 prisoners.</p> <p>We will see the outcome of that pretty soon.  We have had the worst economic climate, yet in this environment User Voice was started and now has a turnover of &pound;1 million.  Some 80% of my organisation is made up of ex-offenders and we have had 100% contract retention in those four years.  Although many of the programmes, interventions, etc. are being cut, the people on the ground who need to have effective programmes that have resonance for those they work with have retained our service.  That is all.</p></speech>

I commend the work of his organisation.  This committee is very interested in the causes of crime and in dealing with issues.  It tries to assist prisoners and come up with new and radical ideas.  I have some brief questions.  Mr. Johnson mentioned the gap he wanted to bridge.  Does he mean the gap between the political system and the prisoner or that between the prison service and the prisoner?</p></speech>

The way in which we start to look to solving the social problem is often done by a group of people who are not affected by that problem on a personal level.  I do not want to be politically incorrect, although I probably will be, but the white, middle-class, academic-type person often has positions of power over a group of people who either do not have a political voice or do not feel they have one.  They are more predisposed to criminal activity or disadvantage.  This is a tool to try to bridge that gap.  I wish I had some slides because I could illustrate this point.  If we put the criminal justice world into this context, there is a commissioner who is charged with finding a solution to a social problem, a provider who is charged with providing that solution, and an end user.  Those three different components make up criminal justice.  I started User Voice based on the concept that the commissioner has the same agenda as the end user.  Both have an absolute need to find something that is effective in helping a person enter a successful living.  However, the provider is often driven by a sales pitch or a PR drive to look successful, given that the psychology of any business is to protect its own interest before giving any delivery.  There is a dysfunctional environment between commissioner and provider and so the actual voice or insider experience of the end user often comes through the agenda of the provider.  I ask commissioners to show me a robust mechanism in our society - where it has sunk down into this criminal sort of world - that can peel away or provide robust insight into what the real issues are and see what people need in order to stop offending.  Often there is a resounding silence around that, which is where User Voice comes into this market.</p></speech>

Recently we took a trip to Cork Prison where there was an energy and determination shown by the staff.  My personal reaction was that this was really good public service.  I watched the body language between the prisoners as we walked around, and I would be conscious of people putting on a show for the sake of it.  I believed, both from what I saw and from other experiences, that here was a group of people who were very compassionate and truly determined to get these guys back on the road.  Would that be the case in the UK?</p></speech>

One finds one has to enter the criminal justice system to meet, for the first time, somebody who shows a little bit of care or compassion.</p></speech>

The real aim for society should be to invest in an outcome whereby when that person leaves prison, he or she becomes a contributor to society, whereas what we have is a very positive relationship that occurs behind four walls.  The problems occur when those doors open and the person re-enters society.  Then the reference point is: "Somebody cared for me while I was locked up."  When I have no structure, my lifestyle is chaotic and I am on drugs, etc. outside, I will want to go back to this reference point where I know I had a healthy relationship.  That is pretty dysfunctional and I do not believe it is where we need to go for the successful re-integration of offenders and to stop crime.</p></speech>

Do these people really listen?  Will a person aged 17 or 18 years listen to an ex-prisoner who is 35 or 40?  Before I got involved in politics I worked in a disadvantaged school that was involved in a project called Breaking the Cycle.  We used to save 85% of the children at risk because we put a lot of extra work into them.  However, about 15% of the children came from chaotic, violent, dysfunctional families.  By the age of 13 these children were stabbing people and at 16 they were on the way to jail.  There was no saving them, but there was the 85% who could be saved with a bit of extra care and attention when we brought all sorts of help and supports into the school.  Is there any way of turning around the children who come from dysfunctional families in crisis?  They will see their mother being battered when they are four or five years of age, or will hear cocaine-fuelled rows.  Does Mr. Johnson have any advice on that?  The third question relates to what comes up within the Irish prison system.  In Mr. Johnson's life experience in prisons, has he come across people who have an intellectual disability or other serious mental health issues?</p></speech>

I have been involved in mentoring.  One of the first programmes I designed for the Prince's Trust in England has young offenders being mentored by ex-offenders.  There is some matching to be done within that.  My organisation is completely reflective of the community we aim to serve.  Young people do young people's work, although not all the time.  We have a very healthy mixture, which is the point.  Young people are employed within the organisation - that is the seeing-is-believing bit.  Often the charities that claim or aim to help this disadvantaged group do not contain any such people, yet if there is a young person to whom other young people can relate because of their experience and their facing some of the same challenges, when they see this person is employed and has a prospect of growing into the person he or she wants to be, that gives hope.  I find that often it is the unspoken word that does the most.  One could offer any short intervention to a young person but if it includes one ex-offender who has changed his life, to whom others can relate, it will have more effect than any other intervention.  That is my experience.</p><p>  As to the 85% against the 15%, I believe everybody has a potential to change and I absolutely stand by that.  My belief is based on the axis that everybody has the potential to change if they have the capacity to get honest with themselves.  Often what I have experienced in working with this group, especially the younger age group, is a delusion, that is not challenged, namely, that living a life of crime is successful.  I believe that many of the young incarcerated people I have encountered live with this delusion.  They spend whole sentences, either in the community or in prison, and their minds are completely unchallenged.  That is the place I would start.  In my own journey, I call it the "teachable" moment.  We all have opportunities and it is through time and circumstance that we become teachable and open.</p> <p>As a criminal justice system, it misses that whole journey.</p><p> I will give an example.  A facial injuries surgeon in Glasgow told me that the teachable moment for them is in the hospital waiting room after a knife attack or the crime when somebody's adrenaline is gone, and they can communicate with people and get some form of honesty.  That change process should take place at that point or the first night in prison when one can actually crack the delusion and speak to somebody and say: "Do you want this for the rest of your life?"</p></speech>

I was also thinking about a listener service in Wheatfield which seems to operate on similar principles as the peer mentoring Mr. Johnson has been running.  It is very impressive to hear about the councils and peer mentoring as a twin-track approach.  Is this likely to be rolled out in Irish prisons and when might that go ahead?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.436" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Johnson" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013022700005#G00400"><p>I am an Ashoka fellow.  I am not sure if any members are aware of that - I was not until I was made one.  Ashoka is part of Change Nation and change makers.  I came over here to do a keynote address in Wheatfield.  Basically the criminal justice system is mainly the Prison Service, the director general, etc.  I brought over a prison governor to outline his experience and there was some resonance.  I returned and gave a talk at Trinity College where I spoke to senior members of the Probation Service and Prison Service.  We have submitted a proposal to look at the Mountjoy Prison campus with the three different groups of people - young offenders, women and adult males.  Our model is about coming in, upskilling the community and then leaving.  It is not a static service where we are there forever.</p><p>  My mission is to try to get prison joined up with the community.  In the UK that is not the case because a person sent to prison there can be sent anywhere in the country and therefore a prisoner when leaving will not necessarily go back into the community in which the prison is based.  However, in the Mountjoy campus there is significant capacity to do work on entry into prison, which is when rehabilitation should start by having this peer-led mentoring and support and then actually working within the community outside also.  In that process it is ringing out its full potential.  It adds benefit to the prison as a community and makes better services.  It makes better services on release and people are more in tune because people are communicating with the horse's mouth, so to speak.  It also produces this intervention and this peer-led approach to breaking the cycle of crime.  Peer-led approach is probably the most underestimated intervention that has ever been exposed and yet it is completely underfunded because it does not fit in the confines of how we procure services.  However, for me, it is the real answer.  There is all manner of evidence, including the 12-step fellowships of Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous - worldwide programmes on alcohol and drug treatment - that are completely peer led and among the most successful programmes on the planet.  Taking some of that approach of people, who have shared some experience but actually live successfully, has proven hugely successful.</p></speech>

From his contribution, it is clear there is a very strong inspiring vision underlying the practicalities and ideas.  The councils seem to be an integral and critical aspect of his work.  What are the barriers to getting those councils effective in their work and how can those be pushed through?</p></speech>

The group that is hard to reach is the staff of the services.  It comes down to a person's personal sense of security.  Often the dysfunctional sort of conversation that one might have is: "You can do this better than me, so what am I doing?"  That shows a lack of understanding about being a professional.  By far the biggest barrier and the thing that can allow the council concept to stagnate are staff and power holders blocking it.  While I could not have imagined this, I met representatives of the Prison Officers Association here who were really positive about this.  In the UK we have had contrasting conversations where the representatives have not been supportive.  However, here the conversation was with the general secretary who said they would support anything that would reduce staff assaults or disturbances in prisons and improve the environment in which people work.  We have evidence to suggest that this model does that.</p></speech>

The handout we received referred to the social return on investment ratio.  What would be the components of creating value from the investment?</p></speech>

While I do not know how the committee feels about this, I have seen some very weird and wonderful figures on social return on investment, and it is all guessing.  That is an economic figure that was done independently with KPMG in the UK.  However, I would challenge whether the mechanism used was fit for purpose.  It may not extract the full social return on investment.  There are areas of change and rehabilitation that we cannot measure.  How is it possible to measure the impact of someone changing his life around, going back to a community, being a son to his mother, being a father to his children and breaking the cycle of the peer-led criminal chains of conditioning?  We cannot put a figure on it.  It is the same as how we measure recidivism rates, etc.  I question whether the mechanisms by which we evaluate programmes are fit for purpose, never mind accurate.  That was one independent company that looked at a council but just measured it in prison and did not take into account the full picture.  So that gave the &pound;1.02.  I have actually seen third sector programmes coming out with results of &pound;9.</p> <p>I work with venture capitalists and social investors who would probably agree with me that much of it is questionable. </p></speech>

They are still saying that it is double value, &pound;2 for every &pound;1 invested.  Is Mr. Johnson saying that has to be an understatement because they are only looking within the prison at the savings generated?  It is very crude.</p></speech>

The sex offender prison, Albany, is an example.  If there is a 37% reduction in complaints with no information from the prison service about the cost of the traditional complaints procedure, one has to be underselling it.  They have measured only what they can see but one can see the full impact on that cost saving in a prison.  I spoke to the English Minister this week and said that we have had 100% contract retention with people on the ground who need answers and they see the effects.  We are working back on ourselves to provide the science behind this innovation.  Cambridge University is involved.  For instance, what is the measurement of somebody's experience of coming into contact with the criminal justice service?  We do not have one.  The prisons have measurement of prisoner quality of life, MPQL, which I would question on the basis that is underselling.  We work with the probation service in the UK to find a community-based measurement but we are far from that and from youth services.  The MPQL is probably the straightest measurement we have.  Martin O'Neill from the Prison Service here is doing an MSc at Cambridge and is very interested in bringing MPQL to Ireland.</p></speech>

It is inspirational to see how he has come from being a young offender to where he is now.  I look forward to learning more from him.  It would be interesting to get more information as his work with Mountjoy deepens.  Perhaps there will be a mechanism through which he can feed back his results to the committee.</p><p>  If I am a young offender spending my first night in Mountjoy and I have heard that Mr. Johnson is coming in and I want to engage with him, how does that happen?  How does he make that connection with young offenders?  How do they hear about it?  What do they do if they want to engage with him but are not good at communicating?  How does he get through to them?  What techniques does he use?  Does he explore their personalities and what they need through the arts or music?  Could he expand a little on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-27a.447" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Johnson" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013022700006#H00500"><p>I am not sure if I provided detail of the structure of the programme in my notes.  It starts with an ex-offender entering the prison who then starts with inspirational storytelling about himself or herself to see if that resonates.  Then we use a survey.  Arnstein developed the ladder of citizen engagement which is about engagement and its value.  At the bottom is written "informing feedback survey".  It is a tokenistic form for getting insight.  It has no value for the person involved but we use surveys because they introduce us to people.  We cover all members in a prison face-to-face and get them to complete a questionnaire.  That gives us their contact information and whether they are willing to do a little more.  From there we can use a few different tools, some of which are quite colourful, depending on the age group and location.  We run focus groups.  We use a storming and forming concept, taking the million and one issues and gripes and complaints that a governor often hears and work with the focus group to fold those personal gripes and complaints into issue-based complaints.</p><p>  The council is not personality-based which would be corruptible where there are forceful criminal characters involved.  It is issue based.  Often four parties form.  Their world can fall into four areas, housing and resettlement, training and education, drugs and alcohol, community and environment, the prison community itself.  Every gripe that I have ever heard could be housed under one of those headings.  We teach them campaigning techniques and strategising.  We bring local politicians into the prisons and the community to talk about canvassing, how they respond to the public, etc.  A steering group then does a dummy run of a council election, going out to canvass and telling the public what they are standing for and it goes to a vote.  They get proportional representation on the council.  It is quite interesting to watch a group of people who have never voted or had an interest in voting start to emerge and strategise.  One party that is smart will be the biggest but it will run for only one term because everybody starts to figure out that it will put its proposals forward if they do not jump in.  Interesting dynamics start to occur within the prison.  In that process we are teaching people resilience and how to resolve conflict non-violently, which is sometimes a completely new and fresh approach for many of these people.</p><p>  I can give a lot of anecdotal material about how I have watched these very small things develop.  A quote I often hear from a prison governor is "I am amazed that it is the smallest things have the biggest impact in the prison environment."  One example is a deep clean of a visitors' hall when somebody's loved ones and children are coming.  That has a huge impact on the prison environment.  I have seen a group of prisoners at Parkhurst win a can-opener.  It may be an absurd instrument but when one is serving a life sentence and is allowed to buy tins of fruit in the canteen but there is no way to open them, it causes a lot of frustration.</p><p>  There are big effects too, for example, in Parkhurst, the council was instrumental in voting in and doing the groundwork in the community to bring vulnerable prisoners in with mainstream prisoners.  The cohort in Parkhurst are violent armed robber types and very high level sex offenders but the council was instrumental in voting the community of vulnerable people in.  That is another thing on which we cannot put a cost but it is massive.  In one wing it was like running two separate prisons but they are now integrated which cuts the amount of staff time required to manage them.  That came through the communities saying that they are respectful towards one another.</p><p>  I could not describe the sophistication of the model in an hour but I can provide any information that the committee requires.  Four or five years within this environment trying to get this group of people into prisons, never mind produce outcomes, has been difficult but it is well thought out.</p></speech>

If one is a drug addict who does not comply with an order and uses street drugs rather than get a methadone prescription one can provide insight into how to make a better service that might potentially help one, whether or not one is cured or can get off it.  I am a recovering drug addict.  I have been clean for 13 years.  I used heroin at the age of 11.</p> <p>That is well documented.  When people start a programme of change, that is the best measure that offenders have been successfully rehabilitated.  If the drug and alcohol addictions are removed, all of the cryogenic factors are removed.  Some of my staff, although not all, I can manage through my experience of being an employer, and I have employed hundreds of people.  If they are clean, they are okay.  When their behaviour changes, I know if it is time to offer help or remove them from a high-risk job.</p></speech>

The whole concept is based on my belief that everyone can change if they have the capacity to be honest with themselves.  Politically, we are not working with sex offenders.  That is a political and systemic issue rather than a lack of willingness.  We work in sex offender prisons and a large proportion of the English system contains sex offenders who would be difficult to recognise as such.  Outside in the community, however, there is a much greater aversion to that.</p></speech>

Without being unco-operative, the issue in Britain is complex.  To look at costs in one place would require funding so we could undertake research on the economic savings to a prison.  Would a third sector organisation receive funding for such work?  Perhaps it should be undertaken by the public sector, or at least done in conjunction with the public sector.  When I had an arboricultural business, it was successful based on the finances, and everything should be run on that basis.  We can do more for less.  I can create more relevant interventions for people if they are allowed to be involved themselves but we have a bar that stops them.  To offer services a person must do a three-year degree to become a social worker or probation officer.  He or she is then put in control of someone who has 20 years of microscopic insight into that lifestyle.  For me that is wrong.  There is no opportunity for the second person to feed his or her insight and experience back in.</p></speech>

We have come across a number of organisations here in our work on penal reform that are doing other work in a similar way, such as the Cornmarket Project in Wexford, which is very impressive, which uses motivational interviewing techniques that are very powerful.  We have Ashoka in Dublin and the Probation Service and Prison Service are also quite progressive.

However, we think it is not appropriate for this committee, as no particular work has been undertaken by the petitioner in the first instance.  I do not believe we should refer the matter to another committee.  However, we could inform the petitioner that certain work has been done by the Department of Justice and Equality.  If he wishes to pursue the matter perhaps with his own university or with other public representatives, they may be able to assist.  As a courtesy we are able to tell him what the position is concerning the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>  The next petition is No. P00076/12 from Mrs. Sheila Ferris suggesting that greater use be made of resources in community employment schemes in the year of The Gathering, and that historical groups in local areas transcribe, collate and make available electronically all church records held in each parish, and also investigate how these records could be made available from a centralised data website.  The petitioner is of the view that if this suggestion was introduced, it could keep the momentum of The Gathering running for longer than one year.  I will now open it up to the members.  We have had a chance to deliberate on this matter.</p></speech>

Perhaps it is appropriate to pass to the petitioner the information that has been gathered on behalf of the joint committee but to declare the petition closed because in a way, it is a proposal rather than a petition and does not quite fall within the joint committee's remit.  Her idea certainly can be used, perhaps through the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></speech>

However, he has an interesting idea and this is a good example of where committees in the Oireachtas can be joined up because the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection is having a meeting on 13 March relating to digital literacy and e-learning.  It is appropriate that Mr. Dwan's petition should be passed to that joint committee as it is already part of its work programme.  He would welcome the fact that it would be discussed at the aforementioned committee and members therefore should close the petition, while explaining to Mr. Dwan what has happened to it.</p></speech>

From what I can discern, she was seeking to have withdrawn a foreshore licence or to challenge the manner in which it was granted.  I understand from the secretariat, which has worked on this petition, that the licence in question has been surrendered and, consequently, the exact issue has been remedied.  However, there is also an issue here in respect of the planning process and how consultation can happen very subtly and often without public involvement, which contradicts the entire concept of public consultation.  This issue was raised with the joint committee approximately two weeks ago in respect of a planning application for wind farms in Moycullen, west County Galway, and at that time, members agreed to examine the issue of public consultation in the planning process.  That element of the petition under discussion could be linked with the earlier petition and the two could run side-by-side.</p></speech>

It is interesting to see the importance of getting, to use that phrase, the playing pitch properly marked out and understood and having everyone who will be affected properly informed.  The fact the company has withdrawn its licence means there will be a much more focused effort to get corrected those starting points and the blackboard cleaned properly for the purpose of bringing it forward again.</p></speech>

The next point to make concerns petitions P00074/12 and P00064/12, both of which are inadmissible.  The reason for the inadmissibility of P00074/12 is that it has been raised with the Ombudsman and any matter that is currently under her eye is not something members will second-guess or with which they will deal.  Petition P00064/12 is inadmissible because the petitioner has not demonstrated that she has taken all actions to raise this issue herself with the appropriate bodies.  However, in respect of the aforementioned petitions P00074/12 and P00064/12, I propose that the joint committee will correspond to the effect they were inadmissible while also making the petitioners aware of its decision in respect of petition P00075/12, which is linked to their concerns.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

As members are aware, the Ombudsman had expressed concern that the schemes were being run contrary to the laws in respect of equality legislation and had presented her concerns to this joint committee.  The joint committee then brought before it the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and senior departmental officials to press the concerns of the Ombudsman and to seek some assurances from the Government as to its intentions.  The joint committee has had a chance to discuss this issue today and I must state it came as a surprise to members that the courtesy was not extended of making them aware the decision had been made to discontinue the scheme, given they had raised their concerns in this regard only a few weeks ago.</p> <p>We have been charged by the Oireachtas with responsibility to follow up on the Ombudsman's concerns and to try to establish the actions taken by Departments and Ministers to address the specific concerns raised by her.  We were in the process of putting together a report with some recommendations that would be due to be finalised in the next couple of weeks.  We will convey our disappointment at not being notified of these events.</p><p> We have agreed to invite the Secretary General of the Department of Health to come before the committee to discuss the current contentious issue that has arisen in the past 24 hours.  We hope the Secretary General will attend the next meeting, which the committee will convene on Wednesday, 6 March.  We could deal with these issues and other matters of dispute between the Department and the Ombudsman.  We need further clarification from the Secretary General on these matters in order to make concrete recommendations and to assure the public that lessons will be learned.  That is our function.   This is the way we propose to deal with the developments of the past 24 hours.</p></speech>

The processing of applications that had been submitted to date will also continue.  That is a recognition of what is practically and pragmatically feasible within the confined of being in compliance with the law, as the Ombudsman had directed.  I think it is fair to say that.  I hope the Chairman will agree on that.</p></speech>

Essentially the responsibility for these matters lies with the Department of Health.  The Government has been in place two years whereas the Ombudsman had raised her concerns about matters over a decade.  That is the reason we have invited the Secretary General of the Department of Health to come before us.  I hope he will be able to attend on Wednesday, 6 March 2013.</p><p>  As we have dealt with all the issues, I propose we adjourn.</p></speech>

Members will be aware of the Government's decision of May 2011 that put new arrangements in place for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  The joint committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairman designate to hear his views.  We trust this will provide greater transparency in the process of making appointments to State boards and bodies.</p><p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Mullins.  I draw to his attention the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise Mr. Mullins that the opening statements he has submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Mullins to make his opening statement, following which members will ask questions.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate the opportunity to present my credentials and vision for the Port of Cork at this session.  I will first introduce myself to the committee and then present the salient challenges and opportunities facing my intended stewardship of the board of the Port of Cork.  I was born in Cork in 1968 in the south inner city to Patrick and Maureen Mullins.  My father spent his life as a painter-decorator for Cork City Council and my mother was well occupied with five boys of whom I am the eldest.  I was educated in North Monastery primary and secondary schools and then went on to study electrical engineering in University College Cork.  I completed a bachelor's degree in 1989 and was awarded graduate of the year in UCC in 1989.  I also studied a master's degree in electrical engineering in UCC.  In 1997, I graduated from the Smurfit Business School in UCD with a first class honours MBA.</p><p>  I started my career with the ESB and am very thankful for the very fine career foundation I received there.  I also worked as a senior consultant in PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting in London specialising in the communications, energy, water and transport division.  In 2000, I returned to Ireland to work with ESB International where I led projects in Poland and project-managed and commercially negotiated the ESB's largest external investment in Amorebieta in the Basque region.  In 2002, I joined NTR plc and worked with all of the fledgling companies in the group, the toll roads company, Greenstar, Celtic Anglian Water, Bioverda and because of my background, Airtricity.</p> <p> I left NTR in 2007 to take up the position of chief executive officer in Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.  My time in Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann was immensely enjoyable and challenging and my period there is marked by significant diversification of the company.  BGE is now a serious force in electricity as well as gas through the success of the "Big Switch" campaign and investments of more than &euro;1 billion in power plant of conventional and renewable types.  In my time in BGE, the company successfully raised up to &euro;2 billion in funding facilities in an unprecedented time.  I believe my experience in international infrastructure and financing can bring some benefit to the Port of Cork.  My most significant achievement was the awarding in 2012 of the "Great Place to Work" award to BGE. </p><p> I left BGE at the end of last year and am currently reshaping an international solar business for capitalisation before the summer for international expansion in European and US markets.</p><p> I am a fellow of Engineers Ireland, and hold board positions with the Tyndall Institute, UCC, COPE Foundation and am chairman of the bereavement charity, Anamcara.  I am currently President of the Cork Chamber of Commerce, a role I will finish in seven weeks.</p><p> I was very much aware growing up of the importance of the Port of Cork as my mother grew up close to the docklands.  The historical significance of the port to traditional and modern exports cannot be understated.  This infrastructure is a vital cog to the regional and national economy.  The region has a significant maritime history whether it be naval, commercial or, regrettably, the export of our people from Cobh.  The harbour is a phenomenal leisure and tourism resource as well.  As President of the Cork Chamber of Commerce, I am very much minded of the link with the Chamber of Commerce and the port as the chamber was established on the strength of trade and shipping in the region.  The committee may have heard of the term "merchant princes of Cork", a term much used for those who used the port.  The new merchant princes of Cork are large multinationals, indigenous and agri-food exporters.  I am not a merchant prince.</p><p> The Port of Cork has a very strong management team under the capable hands of its chief executive, Brendan Keating.  The port has successfully opened up new trading avenues for the region.  The port boasts unique deep-water facilities which facilitate larger vessels, with economy of scale and world shipping driving ports to facilitate larger ships.  We must remind ourselves that 90% of trade by volume is achieved through ports such as Cork.</p><p> Recent achievements at the port include a new weekly transatlantic container service, the first lo-lo deep sea service in Ireland; a new Arkady bulk store for agri-food products at Ringaskiddy; winning the servicing of the ExxonMobil exploration off our coast; and the achievement of ISO14001, OHSAS 18001 and IPSEM accreditations.  The introduction of the Maersk service represented a &euro;3.5 million investment, providing a strategic customer in to the future.  It is recognition of Cork's competitive advantage in location and deep-water vessel access and berthing.</p><p> In general, the issues facing this State company at this time are no different to those encountered by other State companies.  I am very much aware that the port must continue the ongoing drive for continuous improvement, generating greater efficiencies and improving quality of service.  This is crucial to improve competitiveness of our exports and imports.  The port has considerable financial needs but these can only be achieved through an increase in revenues and improvement in profitability.  Consequently, a higher dividend can be offered to the Exchequer.</p><p> There is an increasing need for varied and appropriate quality services in a maritime world of changing dynamics, with the drive for globalisation, port-centric activities and integrated logistics chains.  Looking forward, the limitations of existing lo-lo facilities in ship size and current urban location at Tivoli will need to be addressed by relocating such services further down the harbour.  The Port of Cork is very much in favour of the Cork docklands redevelopment and we intend to play a full role in its achievement.  The population of Cork city has declined over the past decade and the development of the docklands will right those statistics.</p><p> Ringaskiddy redevelopment will be a key strategic pillar during my stewardship of the company.  The port obtained a previous refusal for Oyster Bank and a multipurpose terminal in 2008.  A review of this strategy took place in 2010 and a strengthening of the planning framework has been achieved.  A new planning application is in hand and the port will finalise pre-planning discussions with An Bord Plean&aacute;la shortly.  We are confident that the rail and traffic issues underlined in the previous refusal can now be addressed.</p><p> Cobh is synonymous with much of the harbour's history and the history of the Titanic is quite a draw for the town.  Cobh now boasts Ireland's only dedicated cruise terminal, where vessels up to 340 metres in length can be accommodated.  In 2012, 57 cruise liners brought more than 100,000 passengers to the region and the port expects to surpass that target this year.  The port will further invest in these facilities with the assistance of external support.  The combination of the Spike Island, Cobh's Titanic links and the harbour forts represents a unique tourism opportunity for the region.  The port is involved with this vision and believes this new experience would be very complementary to cruise traffic.  Access points across the harbour are now being investigated.</p><p> In my time in BGE, I pioneered investments in marine energy sources such as tidal and wave.  I am pleased to say that the land swap with the IDA and UCC is underway in the creation of IMERC in Ringaskiddy.  The IMERC will be a world class facility for research, offshore energy and maritime clusters.  There are considerable synergies between this development and the port.</p><p> The old Marino Point IFI site has been identified as a supplementary site, if it can be acquired, to complement new facilities in Ringaskiddy.  The site has rail connectivity so demand for rail freight, if it arises, can be met.  It also has an existing jetty with 10 metres of draft with access and berthage.  Seveso activity on site offers the opportunity to facilitate relocation of other Seveso sites from Tivoli. </p><p> More than 9 million tonnes of freight passed through the port in 2012, representing 19% of the total nationally.  The oil refinery accounts for 60% of the freight and 30% of the income of the port.  Whitegate is a critical account to the Port of Cork and potentially nationally with the onset of oil exploration and further refining at the port.</p><p> Turnover in 2011 was in excess of &euro;21 million and we expect a marginal improvement for 2012.  Profits reported for 2011 were &euro;838,000 and, again, the port expects an improvement in 2012 outturn.  In 2009, a rationalization programme was implemented at the port that will run until 2015.  We expect an incremental &euro;1 million addition to the bottom line from that period onwards.</p><p> My priorities as chairman will be to continue growth at the Port of Cork through renewed competitiveness, investment and profitability for the long term, to significantly reshape port infrastructure for a long term future, and to assist regional economic development, not just in Cork but across Munster and south Leinster, to the fullest in the docklands development, promotion of tourism, maritime research  and industrial expansion.</p><p> I look forward to taking up my duties and doing the very best for the citizens of the country.</p></speech>

Members will have many questions but for clarification, I saw some reports on proposals not to appoint a new board for Bantry Harbour.  Can Mr. Mullins elaborate on that?  There are some issues there that need to be clarified.  What is Mr. Mullins's vision for Bantry?</p></speech>

The Minister is minded to go through a consultation process on Bantry being amalgamated with the Port of Cork and we are at the start of that process.  As incoming chairman, I am more than willing, and I know CEO Brendan Keating is more than willing, to meet with local concerns and the existing harbour commissioners to ensure that whatever happens, Bantry does not suffer in that transfer.</p><p>  From my perspective, infrastructure enhancement for further cruise traffic into west Cork is vitally important for tourism in the region.  That will be part of the agenda that will be up for discussion, although clearly I do not want to get into that discussion now.  As I engage with Deputy Harrington and Senator O'Donovan from the region, I will listen to what they have to say and be mindful of putting in a place a construct that meets all requirements.</p></speech>

It is clear he has the energy and drive to take on this role.  I have no objection to his joining the ranks of the merchant princes of Cork in his new role and wish him well in that regard.</p><p>  There are proposals to relocate the harbour's activity and we heard An Bord Plean&aacute;la had decided adversely on the previous proposal.  Is Mr. Mullins confident he can get this through now?</p> <p>The various stakeholders, residents and so forth, are being consulted.  One of the main grounds for refusing the previous proposal was the absence of a railway line in the port.  It is highly unlikely that this issue will be resolved to the satisfaction of An Bord Plean&aacute;la any time soon given the moneys available for investment.  At the time the planning application was refused, I questioned the need for a railway line on the basis that only a small volume of freight is moved by rail.  The company depends heavily on the proposed relocation if it is to achieve Cork Harbour's potential for growth.  I ask Mr. Mullins to expand a little on the work the Port of Cork has done on this issue.  </p><p> I have a number of standard questions.  Is Mr. Mullins or has he ever been a member of a political party?  Has he ever sought electoral office?</p></speech>

I hope members of political parties who have dealt with me during my tenure in An Bord G&aacute;is will say I dealt with people in a very fair manner.  I do not have anything to hide in that regard and I wish to engage equally with all political parties and community interests.</p><p>  The Deputy raises a valid point about rail freight in which, as he is aware, we have not had any incremental investment.  On the contrary, we have divestment from the sector for many years.  In a sense, the planning framework within which the previous planning application was submitted was based on different expectations regarding the importance of rail freight as a means of avoiding road transport.  As members are aware, a very good motorway network has been developed in recent years and the majority of our tonnages are being transported by road rather than rail.  That is not to say it is a good or bad thing that we are in that position.  From a shipping point of view, the turning space at Tivoli Docks is not sufficient for the size of the ships that are needed.  While it was appropriate in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, it is not appropriate for this century and we will have to look at better turning spaces.</p><p>  Adjustments have been proposed in the planning framework nationally and I hope An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be minded of these directions which have been issued by the Oireachtas and Government.  </p></speech>

We should pay tribute to the outgoing chairman, Mr. Dermot O'Mahony, under whose stewardship the port has developed and significantly expanded, including through cruise ship traffic.  I am pleased Mr. Mullins will continue with Mr. O'Mahony's work in the port, including the provision of new facilities in Cobh.  We are approaching the point where it may no longer be possible to get more without investing in further facilities.  Perhaps that option will be explored.</p><p>  On the development of Cork Harbour, the proposal to relocate must be welcomed and supported by the entire province of Munster.  At some point, the volume of imports and exports coming through the Port of Cork will reach a critical mass and the region will suffer unless the relocation to the south harbour proceeds.  This is an opportune time to address this issue given the likelihood of an upturn in traffic.  I welcome Mullins's comments that the Port of Cork will deal with the issue.  Will he confirm that the planning process will commence shortly?</p><p>  How does Mr. Mullins intend to learn from the experience of the development of the Dublin docklands?  I refer both to the achievements and mistakes made in Dublin.  How could they be utilised or avoided, as the case may be, for the Cork Harbour experience?</p><p>  Mr. Mullins referred briefly to refining.  A question mark hangs over the future of the Whitegate refinery.  Ireland needs to have a refining capacity and a decision must be taken on this issue within months.  Does Mr. Mullins have an opinion on the matter?</p><p>  The Chairman stole my thunder on the issue of Bantry Bay.  I am pleased he expressed such interest in Bantry Harbour port.  His breadth of knowledge is fascinating.  I welcome Mr. Mullins's comments in that regard.  While the proposal is contentious, it is worth noting the significant potential it offers Bantry Harbour.  I welcome the decision to enter into a consultation process.  This proposed development gives us an idea of the phenomenal reach of the Port of Cork, not only in terms of the maritime sector of County Cork, but as far inland as counties Kilkenny and Tipperary.  Mr. Mullins is assuming an important position in a large company which has a major impact on the commercial and economic life of the region.</p><p>  Cork does not have a passenger link to the United Kingdom.  The closure of the Cork-Swansea ferry link has had a negative impact on tourism in the south west region.  I ask Mr. Mullins to comment.  The Port of Cork has been supportive of efforts to reinstate the Cork-Swansea link and I compliment its operations manager, Mr. Michael McCarthy, on everything he has done on this issue.  While I am aware the Port of Cork is committed to reinstating the link, it would be helpful to have this support on record. </p><p>  Anyone who uses a resource such as the Port of Cork and Cork Harbour will inevitably encounter a conflict between commercial, leisure and fisheries interests and the industrial traffic that has become such a feature of the harbour.  I assume Mr. Mullins is prepared to deal with much of this conflict that will arise during his tenure. </p></speech>

He has an impressive curriculum vitae and I assume from his presentation that he has the energy, enthusiasm and interest to perform this task.  Does he have any continuing involvement in one or more of the companies referred to on his curriculum vitae?</p> <p>Is there a potential for a conflict of interest in any of them?  How much time does Mr. Mullins propose to spend initially at least as chairman of the Port of Cork?</p><p> I have no doubt the phrase "securing greater efficiencies" will appear in the work programme over the next 12 to 24 months.  What is Mr. Mullins's experience of dealing with downsizing and staff redundancies and redeployment?  How has he approached these issues?</p><p> I am delighted that the operation of the port embraces corporate social responsibility.  We have argued a local social responsibility clause is needed in public service contracts and operations.  If it is an objective of Government and the public service to reduce unemployment, are there national or EU legislative impediments to doing so?</p><p> A number of people claim, although I do not agree, that the public service way the ports and harbours are run stifles their development and they should be run along more commercial lines.  What are Mr. Mullins's views on that?</p><p> I am interested in his experience of renewable energy projects and whether he believes port facilities could be used to promote such projects?  Does he consider this to be part of his brief?</p></speech>

I join him in congratulating my friend, Dermot O'Mahony, on a fantastic tenure as chairman of the port.</p><p>  On the cruise liner side, we are probably talking about minor incremental investment in Cobh.  Bantry will quite clearly come up in the consultation process but we should probably acknowledge the fact that, at the world cruise liner conference last year, Cobh won the awards for the best shore side welcome and best tour guides.  It is an award winning location and that is why growth happened.  Irish hospitality is experienced from the get go at Cobh terminal and, hopefully, that will continue.  The Port of Cork will do its utmost to give that Irish welcome directly to any liner that comes in.</p><p>  I would rather not go into the whys and wherefores of the Dublin docklands development.  If one wants a lesson on how not to approach the Cork docklands, that is probably one.  My perspective on this is that there are few spaces within Cork city for development in the future.  The port area is a remnant of the 1980s industrial base in the Cork region.  We are a different region today and, regrettably, all our industry is in a ribbon around the city.  We do not have enough urban planning optimisation or investment in the centre of the city going right out to Pairc &Uacute;i Chaoimh and there is an opportunity to begin with on the north side of the docks.  The reversal of Kent Station on to Horgan's Quay and the potential for development of the north docks area as the start of the overall docklands development is an opportunity.  Based on my experience on the chamber of commerce, a reduction in space for commercial and industrial activity has begun to arise.  That has been commented on by the IDA and so on generally but that is no different in the Cork region and the docklands area to address employment opportunities.</p></speech>

Apple is building its own site currently and the most recent large development of 200,000 sq. ft. is practically fully tenanted at Mahon Point.  There has been a delay in development and a lack of development when one considers the demographic growth that all our urban areas will go through in the future.  The difficulty with that is, from a transport of view, we are allowing more commuter traffic within urban areas and public transport from outside the city bounds rather than within.  From a transport policy perspective, therefore, as well as being an opportunity for the Port of Cork, the development of the north docks and progressively each of the phases that will be presented to a Cabinet sub-committee over the next while will be a major development.  Clearly, somebody has to take responsibility for the stewardship of that and that needs to be looked at.  As chairman designate, I will play my part, as will the chief executive officer, in facilitating what needs to be facilitated for the urban regeneration of the city.</p><p>  With regard to Whitegate refinery, I have a deep energy background.  Thankfully, during my time, we developed a 400 MW power plant on the site and the port is right next door to it.  The refinery, from a European point of view, is seen as of suboptimal size but if we had no refinery, we would be up there with Luxembourg as the only European country without a refinery.  NORA is a big issue in brief of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, but from a national security point of view, I would have deep concerns if we did not have indigenous refining in the country.  There is an opportunity, particularly in the context of the vessels leaving Cork Harbour currently, to carry out seismic testing and engage in drilling in Barryroe, to refine that product in Whitegate into the future.  I would recommend that no collapsing decision with respect to the refinery, strategic or otherwise, should be made until we understand exactly what opportunities are there in the oil industry.  However, from a Port of Cork perspective, I have outlined that if the refinery closed, 30% of the port's income would disappear, which would put pressure on it as a commercial entity.  That is a critical dimension and I made this point to the Minister in my initial meeting with him.</p><p>  As president of the chamber of commerce, we got involved in the passenger link process.  All the stakeholders in Cork city and county and south Kerry were interested in this because Killarney would benefit as much as anywhere else from the link.  As I understand it, the reality is that the bread and butter of a ferry is its freight traffic and, regrettably, that was not coming to pass.  Rosslare is still seen, with tachometers and European regulations, as an option rather than using a ten-hour journey to Swansea from Cork.  It also needs to be understood that perishable goods need to get to their markets as quickly as possible and that is another key dimension.  If another such investment is pending, the Port of Cork will look at that.  I welcome what the Deputy said about Michael McCarthy.  The port put a great deal of its own investment into the Fastnet line.  One of the opportunities being considered by the port is the feasibility of a direct link to northern Spain, which could also open up a new market for produce.  As long as there is a Rosslare-Pembroke service with a short journey time, it will be difficult to compete on freight.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to a conflict regarding commercial traffic.  The systems operated in the port are much more sophisticated now and the asset management systems have improved immeasurably.  The website shows the placement of every vessel in the harbour in real time.  That is the level of information technology that has been invested in at the port.  The details of the ships are available online.</p> <p>That is an example of how the pilotage is managed in the port.  I think I have addressed all the issues raised.  In regard to Bantry, I look forward to engaging with the Deputy.</p><p> In response to Deputy Michael Colreavy, I do not have a conflict of interest with any of the previous companies with which I worked nor do I believe I have any conflict with any entity, but if I do I know the rule which is that at a board meeting I must excuse myself.  I am very familiar with the code of practice of semi-State bodies having been a chief executive of a semi-State body and having working in semi-State bodies for 13 years of my career.  I understand the whole issue of conflict of interest.  I do not have a current conflict of interest with any of my previous employers.</p><p> Clearly, I have been reading into my brief with the chief executive and have had numerous meetings with the chief executive on the port.  I will have to steward ten to 11 board meetings per year.  Next Monday and Tuesday I have a two-day strategic session when I hope to meet all the members of the board for the first time.  The rule of thumb for a board director is that it is at least double the time.  There is an element to the chairmanship of the Port of Cork which is also ceremonial, unlike the role of a chairman in Dublin or elsewhere.  Given the history of the chairmanship of the port, going back to the time of the harbour commissioners, one has to attend many functions on behalf of the Port of Cork because of the importance of the port to the region.  Clearly that is something I have to do.</p><p> From a corporate social responsibility, CSR, point of view, I welcome the comments.  During my time in Bord G&aacute;is I was very conscious of corporate social responsibility, particularly in the context of fuel poverty.  When investing in infrastructure it is vitally important to engage with the local community.  For example, when developing the Whitegate power plant we worked locally with Lower Aghada and Whitegate community group to ensure it was happy with the traffic traverse system which involved 800 people going to and from a site.  It was vitally important that the local community was satisfied that we were not disruptive in any way.  When we built pipelines across the country we had to engage.  Therefore, I fully understand the concerns in that regard.  The rules of strategic infrastructure appropriately include consultation.  They do not hinder but set out appropriate standards for engagement with the local community.  That is vitally important for any new infrastructure, particularly if we are considering major development in Ringaskiddy.</p><p> The issue of the public service stifling development was mentioned.  I have been president of the chamber of commerce in the region for the past two years.  In any review with all the managing directors of the major companies in the region, never once have I had an issue from any of the managing directors who were exporting, particularly agrifood, Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies, Apple etc., on the Port of Cork in terms of a weakness for the region.  Port charges have not changed for many years.  In terms of competitiveness that is an issue of which we need to be conscious while also seeking to ensure the cost base of the port is appropriate to its market.  I have significant experience of downsizing but I also have significant experience of upsizing which is all part of the change in a company.  </p><p> All of the reform in Bord G&aacute;is in the past five years has been done with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission.  Certainly, in the context of Labour Court rulings, it is fundamental in the rules of industrial relations.  That is the way to do business.  Very significant change happened in the industrial relations environment and regarding rationalisation in Bord G&aacute;is while I was with the company, but it was done by agreement.  I am aware that the rationalisation agreement put in place in 2009 at the Port of Cork is probably one of the last steps that needed to be taken in terms of flexibility in the port.  From the brief I have got, I do not think industrial relations or downsizing will be the top priorities.  It will be more about commercialisation, profitability and investment.</p><p> I welcome the question on renewable energy projects.  The power plant built in Whitegate was landed in Ringaskiddy and brought across the harbour.  There had been cases where blades and micelles for onshore wind had been brought to all harbours across the country.  There is an opportunity, in my view, potentially to preassemble offshore turbines for the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea in a number of ports.  The Port of Cork is one of the ports and has been looked at by a number of manufacturers for preassembly before they go on a barge, before they are placed. </p><p> In the chamber of commerce we conducted a study in recent years.  The harbour area is a national energy hub with refining, power plants, the maritime research area, renewable energy landing and, I hope, assembly.  That is a real opportunity.  With the potential onset of oil and gas exploration, who is to say we will not have a mini-Aberdeen in Ringaskiddy in the future.</p></speech>

I visited the Irish maritime and energy research cluster in Cork during the summer and was quite impressed with what it is trying to do.  It was intriguing from the Naval Service point of view given that the Naval Service has reinvented itself into human resource expertise in the area of research and energy innovation.  The question is how to move that on with the wave energy project as there is much research taking place.  How can we get beyond the research stage?  Having been around this issue as well as wind energy for a long time, we never seem to be able to get beyond the prototype stage.  What needs to be done to get that up and running given that we have signed the memorandum of understanding between Britain and Ireland?  We realise that if we are to make headway with wave and tidal energy we have to do it as one jurisdiction.  How can it be moved on from the research stage?  I am aware the Government is trying to get everything in order but there appears to be a major gap between research and the delivery of units of electricity.  What is the missing link and what role, if any, has the witness?</p></speech>

Has it engaged with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the statutory agencies with a view to streamlining it?  From my limited knowledge of foreshore licensing, it has not changed much in the past century.  Whether one wants to put a buoy in a river on which to tie a dingy, or an oil platform in an estuary, it takes the same level of precedence by the Department regardless of the scale of activity and the impact on the economy.  It is clear from speaking to ports around the country that the way it is being implemented is ludicrous.  I would like to hear Mr. Mullins's thoughts on the issue?</p></speech>

I have been involved in energy internationally for more than 20 years.  The Danes got a steal on onshore wind because they invested in it early and we have an opportunity to do the same with regard to marine energy.  We have the intellectual capability and the naval involvement, particularly the involvement of the head of the Navy, Commodore Mark Mellett, has been phenomenal.  He is to be congratulated on the way our navy and Defence Forces engage with industry and academia.  IMERC has already received interest from US financiers in developing products and not only green energy. </p><p> Tidal energy is closer to reality than wave energy.  During my time at Bord G&aacute;is it invested in OpenHydro in Greenore and it has worked out handsomely.  Bord G&aacute;is obtained a Crown Estate licence for 100 MW offshore at Rathlin which goes to the UK market.  As the markets will be unified, the price will be the same on both markets.  The material science for wave energy must improve.  I am an engineer and am aware of the large number of moving parts and hydraulics which go through enormous stresses and strains in storm force winds.  The concept of studying the material science of this is critical to converting a commercial prototype into reality.</p><p> In the next five years, given the work going through IMERC and internationally, we will see the first commercially viable wave machines in motion.  World energy issues will not be addressed with one silver bullet, whether that be shale gas or otherwise.  All of the technologies must be harnessed and between tidal and wave energy IMERC is being developed at the right time and will have benefits for multiple ports throughout the country and for the country's balance of payments.</p><p> I have plenty of experience of the delays which can occur in foreshore licensing.  All I can give the committee is my diagnosis.  I have not engaged with the Port of Cork on the matter and I am not aware of any foreshore licence issue which is hindering the operations of the port.  From my experience of having to deal with cables and other pieces of infrastructure, my diagnosis is that the area dealing with foreshore licensing has been moved from one Department to another and probably has not had the arms around it that it should have had, and has not been integrated as part of the overall planning process.  This is my personal view and not that of the Port of Cork.  There needs to be a realisation that foreshore licensing is part of the overall infrastructure provision and needs to be integrated as part of this.  Many aspects of the planning process are such that economic pragmatism would indicate speed.  There are times when it is proper not to allow a foreshore licence, but the process takes too long for the economic and competitive advantage of the country.  We need to analyse why this happens.  I do not believe the Port of Cork has issues of this nature at present.  This is not to say we will not have such issues in the future.  Perhaps the committee might take up the issue with the appropriate Department.</p></speech>

Recently, two wind turbines just above Whitegate on the eastern side were fully commissioned.  In Copenhagen one sees a number of wind turbines welcoming one to the city.  We still have such opportunities and it makes a statement about the harbour to show sustainability in appropriate locations.  Movements are afoot.</p></speech>

Environmental sustainability is something I will examine very seriously during my tenure.  I am not aware of any specific plans of the Port of Cork with regard to wind farms.</p></speech>

Deputy Dooley referred to the planning decision in Ringaskiddy and I share his surprise and bewilderment at it.  There has not been a railway line anywhere near there for 60 or 70 years.  It was bizarre.  Even if it could be reinstated, how would it go through the city of Cork?  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the railway line in Foynes, which was cannibalised for other parts of the rail network, such as for Silvermines traffic.  If we want railways into ports there are easier ways to achieve it than requiring the Port of Cork to do it in Ringaskiddy.  The Marino Point idea seems to be a good one.  Who owns the site?</p></speech>

Does the harbour authority have the power to develop assets?  I am delighted it is getting one back from NAMA.  Cobh has substantial railway frontage which is not really used.  Is it of any use to the harbour?</p></speech>

The rail service is well-serviced by Irish Rail and is still very successful and is very frequent.</p></speech>

It was the old rail freight line which went to Horgan's Quay and from there to the rest of the country.  The rail freight capability is still intact, not to Cobh which would not have the berthage and area, but to Marino Point.</p></speech>

The last ones I saw from Chambers Ireland found that the ports were the least complained about part of the Irish transport system.  We can compliment the incoming chairman on inheriting that record.  They are unsung but extremely valuable.  I wish the chairman designate every success</p></speech>

The committee appreciates that. </p><p>  Is it agreed that the committee will inform the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, that we have concluded our discussions with Mr. Mullins, and that we forward a copy of the transcript of the meeting to the Minister, for his information?
