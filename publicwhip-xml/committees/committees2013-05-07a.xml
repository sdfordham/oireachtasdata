As this is Europe week in the Oireachtas, the committee felt that our meeting would give the Minister an opportunity to bring us up to date on the key issues arising in both policies.  The Minister is available until 3.15 p.m.  Before I invite him to speak I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

However, as I am happy to take questions I will make a briefer contribution to give members to raise questions or points of clarification.  I am in the Chairman's hands.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700003#B00700"><p>Some members may wish to leave after that.  I thank the committee for inviting me to address it on the issue of CAP reform.  My comments will focus on where the negotiations currently stand and on how progress is likely to be made as we try to reach agreement on a reform package before the end of the Irish Presidency in June.  I will be happy to answer members' questions at the conclusion of my statement.</p><p>  Recent months have seen a number of positive developments in the negotiations on CAP reform.  The agreement by the European Council on the multi-annual financial framework on 8 February provided the necessary clarity to enable negotiations to move forward.  This was followed by the by the European Parliament's adoption of an overall position on the reform proposals in its plenary session of 12 March and agreement by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 19 March on its so-called general approach to the reform package, that is, all four regulations, following the tabling of compromise proposals by the Irish Presidency.  The latter achievement in particular represented a major step forward given the complexity involved in reaching a compromise among 27 member states on such a wide range of issues.  It proved possible to complete this task thanks to the determined commitment of my colleagues to reach agreement and their readiness to compromise on extremely sensitive issues.  More important, the negotiation process is now able to move to the final so-called trialogue stage, whereby the Irish Presidency represents the Council of Ministers in discussions with the European Parliament and Commission on finding an overall compromise.</p><p>  We have, therefore, moved from a narrower focus on finalising a Council position to the point where the Council's position is one of three different perspectives being brought to the table.  Given that the European Parliament and the Commission have their own views on the wide range of issues arising under the CAP reform package and we do not yet know the likely shape of the final compromise package, it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the precise implications for farmers and we will have to await the end of the process, which I hope will be in June.  In the meantime, however, I wish to update the committee on some of the details of the Council agreement and to highlight key issues that will have to be addressed with the Parliament and the Commission as we push for an inter-institutional political agreement by the end of June.</p><p>  Direct payments are the area that has received most coverage in Ireland.  Perhaps the most contentious issue from a political perspective is the question of how direct payments should be distributed within member states.  The Commission's proposal to move to a system of flat rate national or regional payments by 2019 would result in a significant payment transfer between farmers in a number of member states, including Ireland.  As an alternative, the Council added the partial convergence model originally proposed by Ireland, which would instead give member states the option to move only part of the way towards a full convergence payment system.  Based on the Commission's methodology for distribution of payments between member states, we believe this can work.  This option acknowledges the fact that it is no longer tenable to base payments on historical references while at the same time allows member states to move towards convergence in a more measured way than would be possible under the Commission's proposal.  Optional minimum and maximum payments per hectare are also provided for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700005#D00200"><p>I forgot to welcome Ms Br&iacute;d Cannon from the Department in my introduction.  We have not been circulated with copies of the Minister's statement.  Perhaps he could arrange to have them circulated.  We need to discuss the Common Fisheries Policy as well.  Therefore, I would appreciate it if members could limit their contributions to three minutes each in order that we can give the CFP an airing.  The Minister is due to leave by 3.15 p.m. which leaves us 33 minutes.  I call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700005#D00300"><p>I apologise to the Chairman and the Minister for my late arrival.  I had mechanical trouble with the car on the way up.  I did not get the full import of what the Minister said and I regret that.  That said, I call on the Minister to answer some questions here or else to get me the information.  As the trilogue decides things is it possible to make known publicly what has been decided, or is it the policy that nothing is decided until everything is decided and that any agreement remains a secret until everything is decided?  As the thing progresses people are keen to know where exactly we are going.</p><p>  The Minister referred to political agreement by the end of June.  Is that an agreement whereby the Council, the Commission and the Parliament have come to the end of their negotiations and have a package that the negotiators have agreed on?  Do the Council of Ministers and the Parliament have to go back for ratification?  In the case of the Council of Ministers I imagine that would be easy enough but perhaps the Minister will let us know when that is likely to happen.  Are we likely to see the Parliament sign off on this agreement this side of the summer or is it likely to go into the autumn?  Will the Minister outline when that will be decided and when the three parties will have agreed it in their plenary sessions?  I gather there will then be something of a delay in drawing up the final regulation and that it must then be endorsed by the three sides as being a fair reflection on what was agreed.  How long is it likely to take before we have the final signed and sealed version and before each country will know the choices and can begin to make choices from the menu?</p><p>  My understanding is that there has been a strong case made for as wide a menu as possible.  Can the Minister confirm that no matter what happens it is a given that, for example, a flat rate payment is a possibility because countries have it already and the Commission wants it?  In that case there may be several menus including redistributive payments or a minimum payment like the internal convergence.  The flat rate payment will be in the mix anyway.  Then each country would have to decide whether it wanted to level off the playing pitch.</p><p>  The Minister might be able to give us some clarity on another issue that seems to be of considerable concern to the Irish Farmers Association.  If I had any doubts about it, the matter would be a considerable concern to me too.  I am referring to the issue of co-funding for rural development.  Can I take it that it would be most unlikely that any Government of this country would leave European money after it because it could not come up with co-funding?  Can I take it that the likelihood is that the Government will match all the co-funding under the rural development programme as required?  I cannot conceive of any Government that would leave behind what is effectively free money but the Minister needs to put the matter to bed because I keep getting pleas from the IFA to the effect that there is considerable uncertainty about it.  I suppose there may be technical uncertainty but I do not imagine that the Minister would go there and I doubt he will.  It would be useful if the Minister could clarify the matter subject to the usual caveats that any Minister must set down.</p><p>  Given what was agreed in the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, is it possible to give the committee ballpark figures on the Pillar 2 side and what they would mean in terms of disadvantaged area payments, REPS payments or agri-environment options scheme payments and so on?  With the single payment it is easy to do a direct comparison between this time and last time.  However, there was heavy co-funding or over-funding in the beginning and now there is a clawback.  As a result it is far harder to get a calculation of what the 11% cut in Pillar 2 is likely to mean.  For example, is it possible that there could be a REPS 4 payment for 60,000 farmers?  I am assuming that the Government does nothing more than co-fund.  Is it possible that such provision is in the ballpark?  Do we know at this stage the position of what we got in the MFF?  I do not presume the Government will over-fund any more than I presume it will not co-fund; I believe the Government will co-fund and no more.  What order of magnitude in terms of money will be there for the agri-environment options scheme, installation aid, the farm retirement scheme, the disadvantaged area payments scheme, Leader payments and so on compared to the last time?  These details would be useful for an informed debate on the issue.</p><p>  I have probably used my three minutes but I have two quick, final points.  The first relates to small farmers.  What is the definition of a small farmer?  Is it 5 ft. 3 inches, 5 ft. 4 inches or is it that he gets under a certain amount in Government payments or European payments?  What is the level of payment under discussion?  The Minister remarked that there was some divergence in this regard.  The Minister stated that we know his views on payments greater than &euro;150,000.  Will he clarify what they are because I am unsure?  I wish to know exactly what the Minister is proposing to do in this regard because, as he stated, it will be at least optional.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700005#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  I have had reservations about CAP since it has been implemented.  I was hoping to have a more equitable and fairer distribution of payments in particular, to ensure that the weaker and the smaller farmer survives.  The Minister is aware of my position regarding the cap on funding.  I have held the position since the day I came to the House that it was grotesque for anyone to get over &euro;100,000 in payments and that this was unjustifiable.  I cannot for the life of me understand it.  I can understand that the British and other larger beneficiaries would try to hang onto this but I believe it is wrong.  A sum of &euro;100,000 is more than enough for anyone involved in the enterprise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700006#E00200"><p>Yes.  I will answer in a moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700006#E00300"><p>Okay.  My position has always been that it is essential that small family farms survive.  They need whatever supports are possible to get them through difficulties in order that they can survive.  It is essential, not just in monetary terms but for the social fabric of rural Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700006#E00400"><p>I thank the Minister for taking time out of his busy schedule to appear before the committee, take questions and brief us.  I have a couple of points on single farm payments.  The Minister mentioned the gap between the overall figure for internal convergence and the Commission's flat rate proposal.  Does he have any sense of how far away from the figure we had for internal convergence we might end up at?  It is probably a guesstimate at this point.  What are the positions of the Parliament and Commission on the definition of "active farmer"?  What does the Minister think the definition will be after the trialogues?</p><p>  The Minister outlined the different position of young farmers.  Some are voluntary, mandatory or a combination of both depending on the different sides.  I am mindful of the fact Ireland has been a key exponent of protecting young farmers and making sure we have more access to the market for young farmers.  Have there been any discussions on encouraging farmers to retire or putting a scheme in place?  Young farmers will not go into farming unless older farmers give way to them.  </p><p>  The Minister did not mention sugar.  Has it come up under the trialogues?  Concern has been expressed by local community groups which have dealt with applications for local Leader funds.  I know this area is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Hogan, but I am mindful of the fact that the next seven years of the Leader projects are very dependent on Pillar 2 and rural development funding.  I ask the Minister to expand on the current situation. </p><p>  On the trialogue process, which was touched on earlier, and the role of Parliament, do representatives have the power to make final decisions or does everything need to go back to Parliament to be signed off on?  If we meet the target of 20 June, what is the likely timescale for the next six months of the year?  What will happen when the trialogues are completed?  When they are completed what will the next six months entail for the Minister and his Department when we consider the menu of options before us? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700006#E00500"><p>I thank the Minister and, in particular, his officials for the enormous effort to which he referred.  I am sure they have been working extremely hard.  Is one part of the trialogues batting more than the others for smaller farmers?  It is a difficult question.  The idea of supporting young farmers coming through the system almost becomes irrelevant if small farming is in danger, because farms will become more like business operations with businesspeople who will look to become involved with farming as farms get bigger.  The idea of the small farmer and young farmers taking over farms will be diluted.</p><p>  The Minister's time frame looks good but ambitious.  What would happen if there is a hiccup and the process goes beyond the end of June? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700006#E00600"><p>I have a couple of specific questions.  Is there an agreement on the reference to 2012?  Will it apply across the European Union or will it be up to each member state to agree a date?  If that is the case, can the date be retrospective?</p><p>  What is the situation regarding ecological focus areas?  There was a suggestion that farmers could pool greening measures in localities, for example a fairly intensive farm could buy greening measures from a nearby farm which was less intensive or more environmentally sensitive.  </p><p>  On reference years, some people retired prior to the initial scheme and are no longer farming.  One group is active on this issue.  If there is a retrospective reference, does it effectively preclude their re-entry to farming as they will not have drawn down entitlements in a previous year?  Deputy Heydon asked for a definition of "active farmers".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700006#E00700"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  It must be a unique situation, whereby the rich get more money than the poor and those on good land seem to receive more in subsidies than those on poor land.  The Minister said we know his opinion on the cap on payments.  I am curious as to what it is.  It should be limited to &euro;35,000.  Information has been supplied to me by smaller farming groups, which have told me changes would lead to a redistribution of in the region of &euro;90 million.  One thing that is confusing me about the debate is that when one is discussing an issue as important as this, it is important that everyone puts his or her cards on the table.  If people are arguing that there should be no cap on the amount people receive, it is important to know whether those making such decisions receive large payments.  Those speaking should make clear their personal interests.</p><p>  I have heard people in large farming groups, who receive far more than &euro;35,000, argue there should be no &euro;35,000 cap on payments.  At an IFA meeting in Drumshanbo a number of months ago, I discovered the IFA will give the Minister an easy time.  I asked if it would campaign to put a maximum limit on the amount a farmer could receive through CAP and was told it would not campaign to cut anyone's payment.  I thought it would campaign for all of its members.  I have met umpteen members and attended meetings where small farmers - I do know what the definition is but we have a fair idea - are up in arms at the way things are going.  What would be the problem in supporting those who are not on the best land? </p><p>  It is important to differentiate between productive and intensive farming.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1049" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700007#F00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  It is important that two agricultural schemes which were abandoned some time ago are restored.  These are the installation aid scheme for young farmers and the retirement packages for farmers seeking to retire.  The capacity for farmers to manage the changeover of family farms is of vital importance to the future of farming in this country.  Young people must be facilitated where they wish to assume the responsibility of running the family farm.  The unfortunate reality is that farming is now largely a part-time concern because it is so hard to make a living.  In the majority of cases, family farms do not provide sufficient income and farmers are obliged to supplement their resources through other means.</p><p>  I hope the Minister will do all he can to restore both of those schemes, which deal with the two ends of the scale, namely, young farmers starting out and those who wish to retire and pass the farm on to a younger family member.  The future of Irish farming depends on young people retaining an interest and being supported to exercise that interest.  The State must assist them to get going and offer enticement to parents to retire.</p></speech>

I have made this declaration in the past both in this committee and on the floor of the D&aacute;il.

It is simply a question of finding the time to do so.  I will proceed, however, with addressing the points raised as best I can.</p><p>  In regard to the trialogue, what happens there is that as we go through the process, the political issues are essentially parked.  In other words, all the major issues, including capping, internal convergence, greening and young farmers, are assigned to the political process to deal with.  Many of the technical measures are being agreed and the trialogue is wading through all the different issues.  At the end of the process a four-column document is presented.  In fact, it begins as a three-column document setting out the Commission view, the Council view and the Parliament view on each issue, such as active farmers, financial discipline, capping, payment entitlements, Article 21 and so on.  As part of the trialogue process, we have to fill in a fourth column which sets out an agreed compromise between the three.  That is the mechanics of the process.</p><p> The Deputy is correct that many countries will refuse to sign off on anything controversial until they see the full picture.  In that sense, there is indeed an element of nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  The other issue is that I cannot sanction a compromise position without going back to the Council.</p></speech>

In Ireland&rsquo;s role as chairman of the Council of Ministers, we are negotiating with the other institutions to achieve an agreed compromise.  There are essentially two major political discussions remaining.  One will be an informal meeting in Dublin and the other is the Council of Ministers meeting at the end of June in Luxembourg.  Members of the European Parliament and Commissioners will be present at the June meeting, so the three institutions will be represented.  We hope, over two or three days, to hammer out a compromise, in which case there will be political agreement on all of the key issues.</p><p>  If we are successful in that, the second half of the year will be about the Commission turning those political decisions into regulations and law which will be voted on by both the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament in the autumn.  The intention is that the process will be finalised by the end of the year.  In the meantime, member states will decide on how they will implement the different flexibilities and menu options that are available.  Some issues will be mandatory and others not.  We will have to design a system that works for Ireland, given all the flexibilities and options available to us.  It is about finding the best approach to CAP reform for the next seven years in terms of internal convergence, greening, young farmers, capping and all the other issues.  There will be choices to be made and it is our intention to make them in the second half of the year.  There will of course be discussions on all the issues.</p><p>  After a compromise position is agreed, the intention is to leave a full 12 months for member states to prepare for the implementation of the new CAP.  New payment models, mapping capacities and software models will be required.  Whether the revised distribution system includes new rural development schemes or a revised direct payments model, we must put systems in place that will ensure it can happen efficiently, including putting an inspections regime and so on in place to enforce it.  That takes time.  Most countries outsource the process to the private sector which requires designing an entire implementation system and takes at least a year.</p><p>  To summarise, the objective is to have a political decision by the end of June which the Commission will then formulate into regulations and law that will be approved in the autumn by both Parliament and Council, with a view to giving a full 12 months thereafter to member states to prepare for implementation from 1 January 2015.  The complication in this is that the budget starts in 2014, which will require some type of carryover measure to extend existing policy, or close to it, through 2014 on the basis of a new and smaller budget.  We would then have a full implementation of the new policy direction commencing in 2015.  I hope I have set out the position reasonably clearly.</p><p>  In terms of the menu of options, I expect that flat rates will be a possibility.  However, we will have to wait and see what is finalised.  Given that some countries already have flat-rate payments, they are certainly likely to hold onto them.  They are an option for Ireland if we choose to take it.  I do not consider that the best way to go from an Irish perspective, but everybody has their own view on it.</p><p>  In terms of co-funding of rural development schemes, the latest multi-annual financial framework figures indicate that some &euro;313 million per year will be coming to Ireland under Pillar 2.  The Deputy is correct in pointing out that this is a reduction on the current amount and that a large portion of it requires a co-funding element if it is to be drawn down.  It is of course our intention to ensure that all funds from Europe are drawn down.  I have made that very clear to farming organisations and I do not understand where the confusion arises.</p></speech>

As a former Minister himself, the Deputy knows that I cannot make budgetary commitments three or four years in advance.  All I can do is outline my intention and determination to ensure we draw down all available moneys from CAP funds.</p><p>  Regarding the definition of small farmers, the Council position is that a small farmer is one who is in receipt of a payment of less than &euro;1,000.  This definition was designed for other parts of Europe and not so much for Ireland.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is shaking his head, which suggests to me that he does not know the reasoning behind it, which I am happy to explain.  In many countries - Poland, for example - there are hundreds of thousands of farmers with very small holdings, with perhaps only two or three cows and who are in receipt of very small payments.</p></speech>

There are different definitions of "active farmers" and this is one of the most difficult things to get right.  To have a common legal definition of an active farmer across 27 - soon to be 28 - countries is very difficult.  The Commission has said it would categorise active farmers as those having more than 5% of their income coming from farming.  That is not a very sensible proposal.  In the Council we have set a minimum level of activity for areas that are being farmed to qualify that land for payments, to ensure it is being actively farmed and the Parliament has a variant of that.  We are trying to get that right because we obviously want to ensure payments are targeted at active farming, despite what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v says.</p><p>  We have not come to sugar in the trialogues yet but I want to hold strongly to my position in the Council, for which support was hard-won, that we should phase out sugar quotas by 2017 at the latest.  Countries such as Ireland, Slovenia and Portugal which may consider getting back into sugar processing should be entitled to do that.  The Commission's proposal is 2015, the Parliament's proposal is 2020, so the Council position, which is somewhere in the middle, is something I hope we can get agreement on.  A portion of rural development funds will be set aside for future Leader programmes, although the structure of Leader companies may change fundamentally before then.</p><p>  Many people are speaking up for small farmers and young farmers because most countries, especially newer member states, have a lot of small farmers, so that is a very strong part of the equation.  Even in terms of aspects such as contributing towards crisis funds in case of problems such as a collapse in price, we are supporting strong arguments that farmers who earn below a certain amount of money from the CAP system would not have to contribute to that crisis fund.</p></speech>

On the basis of the Department's figures, there is a 30% difference approximately.  The higher the unitary payment goes, the higher the average farm size goes.

It is 3.20 p.m. and I was supposed to leave five minutes ago.</p><p>  With regard to the reference year, we secured some flexibility in this regard following an Irish request in March during the negotiations because the reference year until then had been 2014, which was undisputed.  There was a tie-back year, 2011, but essentially the reference year was 2014.  That was having a significant and negative effect by making land much more expensive to lease.  People were trying to build up their land holdings to maximise them in 2014 either to dilute high payments or to gain additional entitlements.  That is still a problem and, therefore, it was important to have other options and flexibilities around the reference year, which is why we secured agreement that 2011, 2012 or 2013 could also be considered a reference year.  We now have to negotiate with the Parliament and the Commission, neither of which likes that flexibility, and, therefore, we will have to see where we get to on this.  I have consistently said to farmers that they should not make significant investment decisions on the basis of a 2014 reference year because the negotiations were not over and I still maintain that.  However, I will not commit to another reference year either until we have a much clearer picture as to what we can do.</p><p>  I refer to Deputy Healy Rae's request for installation aid and retirement packages.  When we see the options available to us under the new rural development programme, we can then see what we can afford to do.  Obviously, we will have to try to support vulnerable areas within farming where necessary and where possible and we will have to try to take strategic initiatives under the Pillar 2 headings, which provide for strategic investments we can make in the sector.</p></speech>

There are different views in the different institutions.  We have said in the Council that protecting permanent pasture should happen on a national or regional basis.  If the limit on ploughing permanent pasture at 5% was applied on an individual farm basis, it could be restrictive for somebody who is looking to increase productivity, expand a dairy herd or, for example, putting in more land for feed barley and maize.  We have agreement on that but the Commission has been slow to accept that.  I suspect we will have some flexibility in that area.</p><p>  It is a little more difficult on the EFAs.  There will be a requirement on an individual farm basis but there will also be an opportunity for collaboration between neighbours within areas to contribute to an EFA that they may border.  It is not decided yet.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700009#H02300"><p>I will give a brief statement on where we are at.  The CFP is coming down to four areas that need political agreement.  The first is on discards and how we manage the cessation of discarding fish unnecessarily at sea.  Currently, in Irish waters between 400,000 and 500,000 tonnes of fish are thrown over the side dead each year, which is a huge volume of fish.  Some are juvenile fish but many are adult, marketable fish, which fishermen do not have quota to catch.  That is a guesstimate but this does not only affect Irish boats.  Ireland has been responsible on this.  We have documented the discards issue for the Irish fleet and it is there for everybody to see but other boats, whether they be French, British, Spanish or Portuguese, are doing the same.  We are determined, therefore, to introduce an obligation to land with certain flexibilities and exceptions and we are trying to get agreement on that with the parliament and the Commission and on a phasing in period to allow the industry to adapt and to give those involved the financial supports to help them to adapt.</p><p>   The second issue is fishing to maximum sustainable yield, MSY.  There is basic agreement on where we want to get to between the three institutions.  We want to fish to a level that allows the stock to at least maintain its size and there are scientific measurement tools to do that.  There are two ways of measuring MSY - biomass in the water and mortality rate among the fish killed and landed.  We are trying to get the balance right between those two definitions.  The Parliament wants one; the Council wants another.  We are writing compromises at the moment.</p><p>  The third issue is regionalisation.  Countries want to be able to make decisions on a regional basis rather than having to go through a laborious, difficult process of codecision between the parliament and the Council.  Both institutions want to facilitate that to allow groups of countries fishing in the same areas to make collective decisions that make sense within those areas without having to go through a long drawn out and difficult system and we are again making good progress on that.</p><p>  The final issue, which is somewhat controversial, is fleet capacity management.  Essentially, that is about ensuring the size of a fleet is matched with the available fish the boats are going out to catch.  There are some exceptions because some fleets, for example, the pelagic fleet, is tied up for most of the year and then it has an intensive period of fishing.  That intensive period more than allows the fishermen to be economically viable and, therefore, the issue is how to manage that because if they fished 12 months a year, they would catch more fish that they have quota to catch.  We need flexibilities and management tools that can allow us ensure our fleets are sustainable, economically but also from a fisheries point of view.  That is taking a great deal of negotiation.</p><p>  There are many other issues but they are the four key issues.  We hope to come to a conclusion on the CFP by the end of this month.  We have a crucial meeting next week.  I am going back to the Council to seek a mandate to change what we agreed last February, which was a Council position, and we are making changes to try to accommodate the concerns of the European Parliament and the Commission in an effort to secure a final agreement on the codecision trialogue process.  We will have to wait and see where that goes but I cannot keep going back to the Council of Ministers seeking a new mandate over and over again.  I have made it clear, therefore, that this is the final time.</p><p>  There are only two Council meetings left - one next week and the other at the end of next month.  Next month's meeting will be taken up with the CAP.  We are trying to get this across the line from a Council negotiating position in terms of a final mandate next week and then through the trialogue process before the end of this month to finalise the CFP political agreement, which will then to be voted on in the autumn in the same way as the CAP will need to be voted on when the Commission puts the necessary structures in place.</p></speech>

In recent days there have been reports about the European Parliament being unhappy with the situation.  The Minister alluded to it briefly when he said he was going back to the Council seeking a mandate to alter the position in order to continue the negotiations.  Will he explain the implications if the European Parliament withdraws and it cannot achieve that mandate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700010#J00300"><p>This is the first time the European Parliament or the Council have ever done this.  We have never agreed through co-decision or a trialogue process a Common Agricultural Policy or a Common Fisheries Policy.  Therefore, it is new ground for everybody.  There is an element of mistrust, although the personalities have a good relationship.  Everybody is trying to get a final agreement as close to their institution's position as possible.  We started the trialogue process in March for the CFP and have been working through it, but progress has been slow.  Some weeks ago I went to Brussels and had a blunt discussion with the rapporteurs and the co-ordinators and said we wanted to speed up the process if this is to be done during the Irish Presidency.  In my view the way to do it is to leave the technical experts to find technical solutions but to try to get political agreement on these four key issues.  If we can solve those four issues, almost everything else will fall into place quite quickly.  That is what we have been focusing on.</p><p>  To be honest, I have tried to force the pace to a certain extent but at the same time I respect the mandate of the European Parliament, of which I was a member for three years.  It has an equal say in the final outcome of reform of the Common Fisheries Policy but I cannot continue going back to the Council every time there is a minor change to get a new mandate to agree to that change.  I have been in Brussels a number of times speaking to rapporteurs, the committee chair and other key personalities in the parliament.  As I think I have a reasonable understanding at this stage of the compromises the parliament is seeking, I am going back to the Council to try to accommodate those concerns within reason.  I will not get everything I want but I will have, at least, a final position on how far the Council is willing to go to compromise, I hope, by the middle of next week.  I will then go back to Brussels to put that to the European Parliament and I am hopeful that it will accept it because, if not, the consequences are clear.  If it does not accept it we have a stalemate because we do not have any more time during the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  The Lithuanian Presidency, which follows Ireland, has made it clear it does not want this dossier.  It already has much work to do in respect of the fisheries fund, the EMFF, and in preparing for tax and quotas negotiations in December.  It has more than enough to do and it wants this done during the Irish Presidency.  I want it done during the Irish Presidency.  The Commission wants it done during the Irish Presidency because the consequences of not doing it during the Irish Presidency are that the Council may send our finalised document back to the European Parliament and ask it to undertake what is called a second reading of it.  That means there would be a mandatory four-month period for consideration in the parliament and time required for translation into all the different languages.  Even after the second reading it would have to come back to the Council for further consideration, which is probably a year away, which means that reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is not done during the mandate of this parliament and the Commission.  That creates a huge uncertainty into the future.  Given that I have been upfront and blunt about that some people think I am threatening them by saying they have to agree.  I am not; I am simply outlining the reality of the timeframe available to us.  There is a window of opportunity.  There is a presidency that wants to do this deal and wants to find compromise.  We are working night and day on the issue and are willing to take it across the line but we need partners in the other two institutions.  I hope we have the trust that can allow that get over the line but, of course, I cannot speak for the Parliament.</p></speech>

Does that include a quota or has quota been mentioned?  Deputy Thomas Pringle and Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will be aware that the quota for the Irish fleet badly needs to be addressed.  There does not appear to be anything in the negotiations on that issue.</p></speech>

That is not being changed under the CFP reform because if we attempt to change it, the process would go nowhere because there is not a qualified majority and there are probably only two or three countries that would seek to change it.  Obviously, Ireland would like to see an increase in its quota but recent decisions in respect of quota allocations show we have two thirds of the European Union boarfish quota, which is a new quota stock.  When negotiating access to quota in recent years, we have done very well in that area.  We can go through the argument as to why we are where we are when we look to the time Ireland became a member of the EU.  I read in the fishing media each week that people are talking about the need to actually change quota and so on.  I have to concentrate on what is possible in terms of what we are doing.  I avail of every opportunity to try to increase quota for Irish fishermen if it is sustainable to do it.  I will continue to do that and fight for the best possible deal.  We will seek to maintain the Hague Preferences and the protection of the Irish Box off the south and south west coast of Ireland where there are many vulnerable species and a lot of spawning is taking place.  At every opportunity I seek to protect the industry while at the same time trying to be a balanced and fair chairman of the current negotiations.  For me to start promising this in the CFP reform we would want to be able to change relative stability; that would be blatantly misleading and will not happen any time soon.  We need to concentrate on changing what we can rather than spending time and energy debating something we cannot change for the moment, unless something dramatic changes politically in European Union fishing.</p></speech>

It is clear there is a deadline on both policies.  If agreement is not reached on the Common Fisheries Policy in the next three or four weeks it will not happen until God knows when.  In regard to the Common Agricultural Policy, even if we get agreement it is obvious that 2014 will be an interim year and Lithuania will have more than enough to do to take control of the signing of the regulations.  I thank the Minister and look forward to an update at a future session.</p></speech>

I am secretary of the Wood Marketing Federation, forestry correspondent with the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> and author of a number of publications, including <i>Stopping by Woods: a Guide to the Forests and Woodlands of Ireland</i>.</p><p>  I will begin with a brief background on the Society of Irish Foresters.  The society was founded in 1942 to advance and spread the knowledge of forestry in all its aspects.  It represents the forestry profession in Ireland, North and South.  Members of the society since its foundation have planned, managed and maintained State and private forest estate which is worth approximately &euro;2.2 billion annually.  The society also places a strong emphasis on forestry education and the promotion of forestry standards in Ireland.  Since its foundation in 1942, the society has influenced a great deal of what has happened in Irish forestry policy, both State and private.</p><p>  The society has consulted widely during the preparation of this document.  It has discussed it with the sector, trade unions and a wide range of stakeholders.  Our findings take account of social, environmental and economic implications of the sale of Coillte's harvesting rights.</p><p>  I will give a brief background on Irish forestry.  Forest cover had reduced to approximately 1% at the turn of the last century.  On average 95% of all afforestation was carried out by the State from 1904 to the mid-1980s.  This was totally reversed during the late 1980s due a great deal to changing EU agriculture policy and incentives for farmers to plant.  Today, approximately 100% of planting is carried out by the private sector, who are mainly farmers.</p><p>  Total forest cover in Ireland now is 760,000 hectares, approximately 11% of the total land area.  Some 50% of forests or 6% of the land area of Ireland is in public ownership, mainly owned by Coillte.  Because of the young age class of private forests, 83% of wood sourced by Coillte and by other industries is from Coillte-owned forests in Ireland.</p><p>  I will give a brief background on how we got into this private forestry mix.  Private forestry is, first, a partnership between farmers in the main and the State to create a viable forest sector.  The farmer provides the land and the commitment to manage the estate while the State provides grants and annual premium payments until the forest achieves productivity.  Public forestry also has a commercial mandate but it undertakes a much broader remit which looks at areas such as non-wood aspects of forestry, including recreation.</p><p>  The Government continues to support farm forestry in Ireland.  The table in the presentation provides a rough idea of what there is in Ireland at present.  In 2012, the State has more forests than the private sector, but by 2020, based on current planting rates, the private owners will own approximately 18,000 hectares more than the public sector.</p><p>  The society strongly supports the economic, environmental and social function that public forestry provides in Ireland.  This is also known as multi-purpose forestry.  Coillte is required by the 1988 Forestry Act to carry on forestry with due consideration to the environment.</p><p>  Coillte forests provide continuity of timber supply and sustainable forest management, including FSC certification, which is an internationally recognised environmental accreditation which has benefits, not only for Coillte but for the saw-milling and timber processing sector.  There are few industries as interdependent as forestry, from nursery production to forest establishment to road construction to timber harvesting and processing to manufacturing.</p><p>  On its non-wood function, the society supports the continuation of Coillte's open forest policy which provides open access to forests for all our people and for visitors to this island.  This is an acknowledgment that public forestry was funded by the Exchequer through the Irish taxpayers since the foundation of the State.</p><p>  The society believes that the proposal to privatise the harvesting rights of publicly owned forests has a potential to disrupt the sustainable development of forestry and the forest-produced sector in Ireland.  A major change in the ownership or management of publicly owned forests will alter the way these are managed, especially in relation to sustainable forest management and their ultimate benefits, not only to the State but also to society.  The purchasers of the harvesting rights will be unable to pay the full value of the non-wood benefits, especially recreation.  Alternative arrangements to continue to provide these benefits are likely to cost the State much more than current practice.  Instead of the Exchequer being a beneficiary in the long term, this could cost the State much more.  The society believes that the proposal to sell the harvesting rights has not been rationally assessed as to its impact on the sector and on non-wood or public good aspects of forestry.</p><p>  I will speak briefly about the accountability of forest owners.  Both forest service organisations in Ireland, North and South, ensure the range of standards and guidelines on the economic, environmental and social functions of forestry are fully adhered to and enforced.  The society endorses these because they are compatible with good silvicultural practice, which is the proper management and maintenance of forests.</p><p>  We have listed 11 of these that apply to all forest owners, whether they be forest owners in the future, State or private.</p></speech>

To be quite honest, at this stage, all of the evidence from all sectors of the industry is quite simply that it would be ludicrous to sell off the forest crop.  Mr. Magner has outlined that this is multifaceted, in terms of the interests of recreational users, sawmills, users of forest material and the preservation of the forest as a national resource available to the people.</p><p>  Once the forest crop is sold, and the witnesses may have information on this, I presume the Government would want the money from the sale, which means the viability of Coillte would be in doubt.  If Coillte could not fund the rural recreational, public good and non-commercial work it does in our forests at present, such as maintaining arboreta, what would it cost the State to fund it directly?  I understand the forestry in certain older plantations has elements which are not maintained for commercial purposes but have various species of trees in various areas.  I am thinking of places such as Cong with older plantations which are not purely commercial, but the tree element has particular wealth in it.  How much would one pay to maintain these non-commercial forests without the forest crop to fund it?</p></speech>

The Bacon report reduces this value to the estate in the cost of privatisation exercise.  Mr. Bacon estimates the loss of the amenity value, which includes many of these intangibles, to be approximately &euro;105 million which would have to be removed from the price the investor received.  Added to other liabilities, this creates the picture of a loss to the Exchequer after the exercise rather than a gain.</p></speech>

I commend him on putting in print, and explaining it very well here, the fallacy of selling the harvesting rights.  The sale is absolutely and utterly ridiculous and I detect that the Government is having second thoughts about doing so.  We will have to wait and see.</p><p>  At the end of last year we debated the sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte when it indicated that a portion of them would not be sold off due to being unviable.  What percentage of lands owned by the public is non-viable and cannot be sold off?  What would happen to the recreational value of those lands if the harvesting rights were sold?  Would the sale not compromise the recreational value?  A sale would mean that people would lose their right and entitlement to walk on the lands and thus decrease its recreational value.  The communities that benefit from the forests would also lose.</p></speech>

The committee is very interested in the subject.  I  would like to see the recreational aspect of forestry developed more and a lot more can be done.</p><p>  I am concerned about the sale of the harvesting rights.  It is important that we hold onto them as it affects a large amount of lands.  Planting is mostly done in private forests.  Has enough planting taken place?  Do opportunities exist to plant more lands?  Do we import many logs of the spruce variety and that type of species?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013050700013#M00400"><p>The delegation is welcome.  I have a couple of queries that may sound as if I am thoroughly in favour of selling off every tree but that is not the case.  Perhaps the delegation will clarify the following matters for me.</p><p>  Mr. Magner listed some of the standards that he worries will be compromised if harvesting rights are sold.  To me, they look like standards that anybody involved in a private enterprise would be foolish to ignore.  For example, protection against disease, due care for the environment and sustainable forest management.  If one is in the business of making money one must do those things.  Which standards would he deem to be particularly at risk?  </p><p>  With regard to safeguards, Mr. Magner said, "The effect of privatisation on public forests would reduce the area of public forest ownership to less than 2%".  On what did he base his comment?  If one wants to encourage people to enter the business and make money then why would the amount of land be reduced?  I am sorry but I did not understand his comment.  He further stated that the amount of exports had grown considerably in the past number of years and that sawmillers said privatisation could decimate that.  Again, I am at a loss to understand why.  If one is in the business of making money then one would look to where one can sell timber, sustain and grow export markets rather than allow them to wilt.  I would be grateful if Mr. Magner could clarify the matters.  I share the concerns expressed by Senator Comiskey and many other people about harvesting rights.  I want to understand the arguments made by Mr. Magner to keep the rights.</p></speech>

Please inform me where I can find them.</p><p>  I ask the delegation to outline its turnover and profitability.  I hope that all goes well, that the society keeps the rights and we do not sell our forestry.  Can the society share its five-year plan and profitable growth strategy with us?</p></speech>

How diverse is Irish forestry?  Can its small diverse range of plants be compared with other European countries?</p><p>  As I have said previously, there is a lot of forestry in County Clare yet there is very little economic benefit or spin-off industries now.  Ironically, a chipboard factory in Scariff was closed down due to a low supply of wood.  County Clare is the third most afforested county in Ireland.  However, supply was an issue for the factory because Coillte does not engage in supply contracts.  Is it unusual, using western Europe as a comparator, for large forests not to engage in longer term supply contracts?  There is a year-by-year supply but it is hard to justify or secure private sector investment if one is not guaranteed supply.</p></speech>

Last week representatives from the sawmill sector attended.  On that occasion I asked the Irish Timber Council did it have an input into the review but was told it did not make any as it was not approached.  Did the society make an input to the review?</p><p>  Mr. Magner made an excellent presentation and expressed a strong argument against the sale of Coillte.  The arguments are so strong that I shall repeat what I said at last week's meeting.  It is time that we put the matter to bed.  The Government told us exactly what was going to happen.  Therefore, we should concentrate on deciding not to sell and how to improve the sector which would be helped by the publication of the report.  Did the society have an input into the report?</p></speech>

Last week the sawmillers attended and the council stated that it pays a 27% premium when an Irish forestry product enters one of its sawmills.  Earlier the society stated that 82% of its Irish timber product is exported.  Can an export price comparison be made with world market prices?  Is the product sold at a world market price?  Is it exported at a lower price?  Why is there still a need for a 27% premium if so much of the product is exported?  Why must sawmillers pay a 27% premium for an Irish forestry product?</p></speech>

I shall answer some of them and my colleagues shall answer the remainder.  I shall commence by responding to the last question posed by Senator O'Neill.</p><p>  The premium that Irish processors pay on timber is based on log supply here and Irish mills are over supplied.  For example, Glennon Brothers, a mill that was represented here last week, continues to import around 150,000 cu. m of logs into the country because of a shortage of raw timber material.  A shortage means that more mills must compete for less product.  As a result, Irish mills must pay more than their UK counterparts before they can export to the UK.  Unfortunately, Irish mills must pay the premium in order to compete.  </p><p>  I have visited a number of Irish sawmills, especially ECC Teoranta, Murray Timber Company and Glennon Brothers.  I have found them to be much more competitive because they must deal with lesser commodity, use a tighter process and compete with UK growers.  They must also compete with the Scandinavian countries who have a better quality resource than Irish timber, even allowing for the 30% increase.</p></speech>

These mills are more competitive and are able to compete in the market place.</p><p>  I will now respond to Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan's question on the review.  We were not involved in the review of forestry.  The review of forestry started on the same week as the 2020 agricultural review.  Whereas the 2020 report was done and dusted within five or six months, work on the forestry review is still ongoing two years after it started.  At the end of our presentation we stated that perhaps this is a good time to look at Irish forestry and policy and not have to sit back and wait for two or three years for a review that will obviously go nowhere.  The urgency is gone out of it.  It would have been excellent to look at the review of the privatisation of Coillte</p></speech>

Those involved in the forestry industry must be governed by many Acts of Parliament and EC directives.  That would also apply to the harvesting rights.  For example, an investor would have to consider the type of operations it would carry out near rivers and streams.  Some of that can be quite restrictive.  Forestry is unique in that it is the only industry that contributes to the storing of carbon.  It has an extra responsibility, especially in harvesting operations.  If one fells 7,000 cu. m without planning permission that can create a major hole in carbon storage.  These are just a few points.</p></speech>

Coillte has 150 official forests, which are regarded as recreational amenities, in which signage and roads are maintained to ensure the public has free access.  When I went around the country I found that Coillte had entered relationships with Tidy Towns committees, local community groups and by the time I had finished, I had counted 220 forests, which are all written up in my book.  I would imagine that if I explored it further, there are between 250 to 260 forests that are accessible.  Even if one were to put 300 hectares to 400 hectares, at a very minimum Coillte has 100,000 hectares that are widely used.  I am not including people who live close to a forest and use it of an evening as a private amenity.  In some forests I would meet a couple of people over a 24-hour period but others are used by a significant number of people.</p><p>  The point we are making, without being able possibly to put a figure on it, is that if one were to eliminate a company such as Coillte, but decide to hold back 100,000 to 150,000 hectares, some 30% of the estate, some group will have to manage it.  A body such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service could undertake that work but it would be an additional cost to the Exchequer as it will generate very low income as it will be managed solely as an amenity.  The State makes demands on a company such as Coillte to provide open access and other non-wood benefits.  That is paid for by Coillte out of its revenue generated by commercial saw milling.  If one were to give that commercial entity to some other investor, one must ask the local authorities, the National Parks and Wildlife Service or some other non-commercial venture to do that work, it will eventually cost the State money if it is managed properly.</p></speech>

Clare is in the top three counties with forest cover.  A few years ago I did a project with Fr. Harry Bohan in which we looked at forests from Mount Shannon to Feakle.  Approximately 20% of the land of County Clare is now under forest cover, yet it is a success story because one of the first forest producer groups was set up in County Clare - there is another one in County Donegal.  They have decided that to sell timber to mills very far away from Clare is of questionable value because of the transport costs.  They have set up a producer group which is providing the first thinnings, the poor earners, for wood energy in local hospitals and nursing homes.  I think one of the county council buildings is generating energy from wood.  This is a major incentive.</p></speech>

In fairness, Coillte is getting a premium for its logs.  When I worked with the Irish Timber Council years ago, when price was no longer as issue, I saw that the big fear that saw mills have is continuity of supply.  One of the major benefits is that Coillte has given commitments to the market in the United Kingdom, to which it is exporting virtually all of its product.  If Coillte does not honour its commitment, it will fall out of the market and people will lose faith in the company.  In fairness to Coillte, during good times and bad times, it has kept the flow of timber to the saw milling sector and has not withheld it.  One of the fears is that the company which buys the company may decide that if the price of timber does not reach &euro;60 per cu. m it will hold the product back and will wait until the price rises.  That is all fine in short-term planning but in long-term planning it would destroy a number of saw mills.</p></speech>

Every sawmill has a button and a monitor as the timber comes through and they all bid for that timber.  That is the bulk of it.  In the past, however, there was a distribution system.  In other words, some mills had an arrangement - not a long-term one - whereby they would not be totally left out.  The auction system was agreed at the time.  I spent a while with the Irish Timber Council and people there often asked what they could have instead of the auction process.  The electronic auction is overseen independently and it actually works.  However, there is still overcapacity in the mills which means that too many mills are chasing too few logs.  There is no way one can divvy it out, so to speak, for everybody's attention, but there are arrangements.  I know there have been arrangements in the past, although I am not too sure of what it is now, whereby mills did not totally suffer.  If a region around ECC dried up, for example, they often brought forward sales to facilitate them.  It is in Coillte's interest to have a competitive saw-milling sector.</p></speech>

When it was put on the market, not only was Coillte looking at its own interests, but it also considered the sustainability of the mills.  I have one final question on this matter.  Am I right in thinking that if, because of this overcapacity in the mills, one broke the forest crop up into five or six slots, it would exacerbate price problems rather than bringing them back?</p></speech>

If the Deputy is asking whether there are long-term supply contracts with mills the answer is "no".  Otherwise, there would not be weekly timber auctions.  Everybody sees what comes up but this is a two-way street.  If one starts giving contracts to mills, then other mills will not get comparable contracts.  Therefore, the safest way out of it is to have an open, transparent contract system which is working.</p></speech>

However, if one wants to set up a semiconductor plant in Limerick and enter into an agreement with an energy supply company, it will agree to supply the plant as long as one keeps paying.  I agree that there has to be a market for logs but my point concerns thinnings.  I live in Scariff, County Clare, and grew up in the foothills of Slieve Aughty so I know the area.  I also know how sterile the whole area is as a result of deforestation.  There is a single crop from Scariff to Gort, over to Loughrea and back again.  More or less one crop predominates.  It was planted in some areas where it is doing very well, but is doing horrendously badly in other areas.  There is no economic benefit from it, yet those areas are being damaged.  They were ordered to be clear felled by the European Commission, and that has happened.  I know the area and also know that there is a load of thinnings coming on line there, but nobody knows what will happen to them.  Industries could be developed around processing those thinnings, yet no one can develop them because nobody can get a supply contract from Coillte.  Is that usual or unusual in the European context?  Coillte has supply contracts for its own factories.  There might be an anti-competitiveness issue there, but nobody has ever taken it up.  The Irish attitude to competition is quite unusual, as the IFA would know.</p></speech>

There is probably a historical background to it because pulp was almost impossible to sell and had hit rock bottom.  In order to encourage pulp manufacturers into Ireland, Medite in Clonmel had to be given a long-term contract.  That was the only basis upon which it would come in.  The same situation applied to Louisiana-Pacific which was the original owner of the Waterford plant.  Pulp is a different commodity than saw-log timber.  It is a much more fluctuating market in terms of output and is susceptible to sudden requirements of supply.  If there is a hurricane in America, everybody needs hoarding material.  It is a cheap commodity and there are quiet years when no hoarding is required.  However, a slightly different situation applies to pulp than to saw-log.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has described the situation correctly.  Saw-millers have the comfort of knowing that every year Coillte's supply of logs will be put on the market.  They are given a five-year advance understanding of the scale of that, so they can plan accordingly in total confidence.  That is quite different from the situation concerning private sellers such as IFUT, the Irish Forestry Unit Trust.  If one looks at the latter's sales record, one will find that in a particular year, its sales of timber could be one-fourteenth - as it was in one recent instance - of what it is the subsequent year.  One could not invest in a sawmill on the basis of a supplier who is going to hold back this year and offer a whole lot next year when the material is dearer.</p></speech>

In Austria, there is only a 40% or 50% forest cover.  Across Europe forest cover is 40%.  There is a state-private mix and there may be an abundance of logs in some countries.  In Ireland, due to our competitive saw-milling sector and because so little is coming on the market from the private sector, there is a huge demand for logs at the moment.  Any company operating with a commercial mandate will use that as a marketing plus.  That is what Coillte has at the moment.  For example, I know of one mill that fought hard for a guaranteed supply eight years ago.  It is a small to medium-sized mill processing 100,000 cu. m of logs per annum.  Because of the increase in private planting, it is now mainly getting around 65% to 70% of its logs from farmer growers.  Therefore, it is no longer hung up on seeking security of contracts.  That will happen increasingly as one gets farmers coming in.</p></speech>

It seems no one wants the State forestry proposal to go through but to a man there has been criticism of the current model.  Something must be done so could we hear the vision for the forestry if some sort of proper review takes place that offers a new direction?  Some people would say Coillte does not have enough foresters to manage the forests.  I know I am talking to three people with a vested interest as forest inspectors or managers but if a State entity is to provide a forestry sector, it must grow the timber and manage it properly.  That might be a simple place to start from but that is where we should start.</p></speech>

It is the regulatory body for forestry and it hands out grants.  The other body is Coillte, which received a commercial mandate in 1989 to carry out the business of forestry.  It does that and we can talk about the way it does so.  The Forest Service considers how to increase the forest estate in Ireland.  It is currently at 7,000 ha per annum, even though the Government's own strategy is in the region of 20,000 ha per annum.  We are well behind that.</p><p>  The problem is that Ireland has no independent forestry board that takes forestry in its entirety and examines its commercial potential and all the other issues we talked about today.  That is a significant negative for Irish forestry and as a result there is the Forest Service that is always talking about planting land and Coillte which manages its own estate.  No one out there is making the connection between what is planted in the marketplace and growers.  We must change that and establish an independent board to do that.  I do not want to get into the idea of quangos because we had the Council on Forest Research and Development, COFORD, where all members gave of their time freely.  There is significant desire in the industry to get involved at that level, almost voluntarily, so the sawmills can plan.  Also, Coillte will get recognition for the non-wood aspects of forestry while the State can make its own demands on the economic value of the State forestry.  There is no independent body, however, that looks at all stakeholders' input in forestry.  Such a body might be similar to Bord Bia but looking at forestry.</p><p>  As Deputy Flanagan pointed out, it is incredible that the sawmill sector, which contributes most to the industry, is not even at the table when a forestry review of the country is being carried out.  What is the point in having that review if the people who take the timber and convert it into cash do not have any voice?  That is the sort of vision we are looking for.</p></speech>

For example, the 1996 "Growing for the Future" plan was the last policy on forestry.  The stakeholders would be delighted to have the opportunity to have a forum to discuss these policies and where issues of importance such as land use and land availability could be put on the agenda.</p></speech>

There are many complexities in the forestry industry.  I understand one of the main sources of need, aside from the residue issue from the timber mills, is that there is a lot of pine that is not suitable for saw milling.  It was used as a first crop on bogs because the Sitka spruce would not grow on the bog.  When talking about pulp meal, it is a uniform product and pulp wood or clean chips are needed.  It is slightly different from a company buying a standing crop of timber.  There might be a guaranteed supply but the price depends on the quality, size and maturity of the timber.  Until someone sees the standing crop and its location, it is impossible to say what he or she will pay for it.  As long as there is an understanding that a certain amount of timber will be put on the market nationally to keep the mills going, it is not possible to go any further in terms of long-term contracts for the mills because there is such a variation.  For a board mill, there is a slight difference.  We should not forget the board mills depend hugely on the sawmills but the sawmills depend hugely on the board mills being there because if the board mills closed tomorrow, of any log that goes in, only 50% comes out in square timber.  The rest either comes out in bark timber or chips.  When all of this is over, and please God the Government will quietly drop the plan in the next few weeks-----</p></speech>

My experience of forestry since before Coillte was established has been that sawmills will not have difficulty obtaining 10,000 or 20,000 cu. m of timber per annum, especially if they are seeking thinnings.  However, most of the major timber mill companies will use between 300,000 and 500,000 cu. m of timber per annum.  Smaller mills using 20,000 cu. m per annum, primarily thinnings, will not have any problem obtaining timber because they will look for small timbers.

New Zealand, for example, has a huge indigenous forest of podocarps and various other species.  Its non-privatised area of natural forest is very large, whereas Ireland has only a small area of indigenous forest remaining and depends mainly on introduced species.  The area of recreation and amenity is intertwined with forestry.  For example, visitors to Crone Wood in Glencree will find good commercial Douglas fir growing on the side of a mountain on which thousands of visitors walk every weekend.  One cannot put forestry and recreation and amenity into separate boxes because they are closely intertwined.  This is another reason we would prefer the mix of public and private forestry.</p></speech>

We are from Food and Drink Industry Ireland, FDII, a business sector within IBEC, representing approximately 150 food and beverage companies across meat, dairy, consumer foods and beverages.</p><p>  I am the director of FDII and am joined by my colleagues Mr. Michael Barry, director of the Dairy Industries Association on my right and, on my left, by Mr. Shane Dempsey, head of consumer foods in FDII, and Mr. Cormac Healy, director of Meat Industry Ireland.  I will make the initial part of the presentation, my colleagues will each take a couple of slides and I will speak on the concluding slide.</p><p>  Let me give the background to the Irish agrifood sector.  People are familiar with the size and importance of this sector, but it is worth reiterating that one in eight jobs in the economy is linked to food production, indirectly associated jobs or food processing.  It is as important to the Irish economy as the car industry is to Germany.  There are approximately 690 enterprises, the vast majority of which are small and medium-sized in the SME category, as is the case across most of Europe.  However, the number of large companies in this sector at 6% is above the European average for large companies of 1%.  This reflects on our relatively small domestic market.  If companies are going to grow they need to export.  A successful export company leads to scale.  We have rich resources in terms of food production and have a significant number of world class large companies and a very large cohort of world class SMEs.</p><p>  There are two distinct markets.  Many companies will serve both markets but the issues will differ between the export and the domestic focus.  We supply the majority of Ireland's &euro;14 billion grocery sector.  We have also exceeded for the first time in 2012 the &euro;9 billion worth of exports, which accounts for about 30% of net foreign earning.  It has a major link to the economy with &euro;11.5 billion of purchases in the domestic economy.  We regularly make the point that the headline numbers, either on the size and scale of the domestic grocery market or the export figures, are impressive in their own right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.182" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013050700004#D00300"><p>As regards the economy-wide impact of the sector, members of the joint committee will be familiar with Food Harvest 2020 which is the national agrifood strategy.  It is expansionary in nature and while some might say those targets are ambitious, we would say they are realistic.  It may well be the case that those targets can be exceeded.  In headline terms, the targets are to increase exports to &euro;12 billion by 2020.</p><p>  In the context of the deep linkages to the economy, our analysis - which is based on published figures from Forf&aacute;s and the Central Statistics Office - shows that direct expenditure in the Irish economy is equivalent to 60% of sales.  That compares with 19% for the rest of manufacturing so, in essence, every extra &euro;1 we get in exports from the food sector, will result in direct expenditure of 60 cent in the domestic economy.  Compare that with any other aspect of manufacturing and one will get 19 cent.  Therefore, when we grow exports in the food sector we will get a much greater, positive impact for the wider economy than for any other exporting sector.</p><p>  Our strong view is that this export growth will have a beneficial effect on the economy, particularly in terms of jobs.  Last year, we published a report entitled &quot;Sharing the Harvest&quot;.  In that analysis we did all the relevant number crunching involving CSO numbers from their input and output tables.  We also examined the profile of growth out to 2020.  Our estimate is that up to 30,000 jobs will be created across the economy if those export targets are reached.  A fraction of those will be in food manufacturing and processing.  A significant amount will be at farm level but a lot of it will be in the rest of the economy, providing services to food processors and food producers, thus allowing them to achieve that growth.  That is a fairly significant figure in its own right.  </p><p>  Our priorities run across the whole food chain, from farm to fork.  That is because of the unique nature of the supply chain in Ireland.  Unlike any other large-scale sector, everything is here, including raw materials, manufacturing, sales and marketing, exporting, research and development, and innovation.  In addition, the corporate headquarters of many of the companies are located here.  </p><p>  Due to the unique nature of the supply chain we are more affected by policies and regulations than any other sector.  From our perspective therefore it is important that we get this right.  That applies to what is happening nationally and at a European level, as well as what is happening on the international stage.</p><p>  That leads us to what we call the policy dichotomy in Ireland.  As I said earlier, we believe there are positive winds for the economy that will arise from Food Harvest 2020 with jobs growth of up to 30,000 to 2020.  However, there are also a significant number of constraints<i> in situ  </i>which need to be addressed in order to ensure that such growth can be achieved.  It should be borne in mind that we are not looking at things purely from an export focus, but are also interested in the domestic market.  It is an important market for every company even if they are exporting.  Smaller companies in particular need to function properly in the domestic market before they are able to achieve scale and move into export markets.</p><p>  We are experiencing high input costs, including energy costs which are rising significantly.  That is a big competitiveness issue for all companies.  In addition, proposals for taxing food and packaging are matters of concern, as are marketing restrictions.  The issue of retail buying power will be addressed by the incoming statutory code of practice for the grocery sector.  </p><p>  I will now move on to the area of financing difficulties for the sector, while my colleague Mr. Michael Barry will talk about environment constraints in due course.  The big issue for us is how to finance expansion and renewal in the food sector.  The sector is characterised as one with high capital costs and relatively low margins over time.  That is the reality of the sector and Ireland is not much different from other countries in that respect.  We need to match up those two things.  The medium to long-term financing facilities that are required for the sector's profile - high capital costs and relatively low level margins - are difficult to obtain.  The current credit climate in Ireland is even more difficult for the food sector due to those situations.  There have been some positive announcements in the sector of late.  Generally, we have been looking at large companies that have greater access to capital markets.  There is a major roadblock for many SMEs, which have been<i> in situ</i> for a number of years and have a lot of plant and equipment that needs renewal, or they may have expansion plans that require significant capital investment.  That roadblock needs to be dealt with and this can be done in a number of ways.  State aids, including capital investment supports, are currently up for renewal.  The regional aid map is being developed by the European Commission at the moment and will run from 2014 to 2020.  It is important that the Irish negotiating position remains strong to ensure that aid levels at least remain at the same level and, if anything, are increased for the industry here. </p><p>  There is also a need to look at food sector-specific funds.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund and Enterprise Ireland have a number of funds in place.  The take-up by the food industry is relatively low compared to a number of other sectors, so that area needs to be re-examined either in terms of food-specific funds or some sort of primer that will ensure a higher rate of take-up by food companies. </p><p>  We also need an innovative approach to matters such as capital gains tax relief.  If people are selling up and getting out of other businesses, including food ones, there should be incentives for them to reinvest.  The research and development tax credit scheme, which is utilised by many food companies, should be maintained and strengthened with a particular focus on SMEs, so their take-up will be even greater.</p><p>  Manufacturing cost competitiveness is of huge importance to the industry.  If one is exporting, one's cost base in the domestic market will tell a lot about how competitive one is in export markets.  Similarly, if one is selling in the domestic market and the cost base is out of line, imports will be relatively more competitive.  In order to ensure that one is not displaced off supermarket shelves, one must be cost competitive.  That is vitally important, no matter whether one is in the domestic or export market.  A big issue for food companies is industrial energy costs, as the sector accounts for about 25% of such energy usage.</p><p>  It should be borne in mind that we are operating off fairly tight margins and, in addition, many of the raw materials we use are priced on an international basis.  Therefore, if industrial energy costs are out of line with our competitors, either in the domestic or export markets, that will move us out of line significantly in terms of cost competitiveness. </p><p>  When we talk to our companies they tell us that rebates for large energy users, which were in place for the last few years were useful, particularly after the crisis of 2008 and 2009.  They were very useful in reducing the companies' cost base.  More importantly, we now find that electricity costs are 15% to 20% higher than their UK sister plants.  The gas differential is even higher.</p></speech>

I will address the meat sector, Mr. Barry will address the dairy sector and Mr. Dempsey will address consumer foods.  We will briefly refer to the growth potential, as we do not meet this committee regularly, and some of the principal issues in the sectors.</p><p>  I look after IBEC's members in the meat processing industry - beef, lamb and pigmeat.  The first slide relates to the Food Harvest 2020 targets that have been set for the meat sector.  The target for growing output value in the beef industry is 40% by 2020.  The original target was 20%, but subsequent work through an activation committee and a more detailed examination of the figures revised the target to 40%.  A significant amount of the growth in value output has already been achieved.  The targets for the pigmeat and sheepmeat sectors are 50% and 20%, respectively.  When the document was originally being worked on, the latter sector in the agri-economy was at a low point and there were question marks hanging over its ability to recover.  Thankfully, it has.  The opinion within the sector's farming and processing elements is that a more ambitious target of 40% or 45% growth is possible.</p><p>  The table shows that significant progress is being made.  Consider the sectors' export performances.  Beef has grown to &euro;1.9 billion in export value, an increase of approximately 21% on 2010.  Food Harvest 2020's baseline period is 2007-09.  Pigmeat and sheepmeat export values have grown by 36% and 26%, respectively.  A significant amount of this growth has been generated through an increase in commodity prices, but sustainable growth also needs volume.  This is anticipated and I will touch on some of the figures in question.</p><p>  For the beef sector, a recovery in throughput and processing levels is expected to make the 40% target a reality.  The pigmeat sector has seen a volume increase in processing throughput as well as an increase in prices and, therefore, value.  After hitting a low point, the sheepmeat sector has experienced an increase in volume throughput for the past two years.  As Mr. Kelly stated, the targets are ambitious but realistic.  A significant amount of progress has been made.  The meat sector is confident that, between now and 2020, the growth targets are achievable.</p><p>  The second slide highlights a number of key issues for the meat sector.  Will there be a growth in volume?  The beef sector, which is the major industry, has the highest overall value and has the greatest reach into the agri-economy.  Close to 100,000 farmers are involved in beef production in some way or another and there are 60,000 specialist beef producers.  It is a relevant sector.  The anticipation is that slaughtering levels will increase for the next two or three years.  They have increased this year relative to last year.  The forecast for processing activity this year is 1.5 million head of cattle.  In two years' time, it is expected to be 1.7 million.  The target is 1.8 million.  Volumes are also increasing in the pigmeat and sheepmeat sectors.  Great processing activity in the meat sector means more jobs.  It remains a labour intensive pursuit.  An increase or recovery in volumes increases the potential for jobs.  It also increases commodity prices and export opportunities, which in turn feed into job creation.  As Mr. Kelly stated, we believe that 30,000 additional jobs could be created in the food sector with the achievement of the Food Harvest 2020 targets.</p><p>  The maintenance of the suckler beef herd is important to the beef sector.  This specialist herd has been the platform for the past decade's significant progress in penetrating European markets and top retailers.  Coupled with its maintenance, the increase in the beef sector owing to the expansion in the dairy herd is also important.  Mr. Barry will refer to that issue shortly.</p><p>  We must continue to differentiate ourselves and work on matters of quality assurance, for example, play to our strengths in terms of grass-fed beef production.  Our strong sustainability credentials will be important in the marketplace.  A critical issue in the list on the slide is market access, by which I mean access outside of Europe.  Our focus for beef, pigmeat and lamb is on the European market and will remain so.  However, there are increasing opportunities globally and access is critical.  We do not have access to particular markets because of veterinary restrictions and legacy bans post the BSE episode.  With the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia, we are working to secure access for all of our sectors.  Pigmeat is probably the industry that has the greatest volume of exports to international markets, but there are opportunities for the beef industry, particularly in terms of lower value cuts or fifth quarter items.  The lamb industry is increasingly considering international exports.  The general global increase in demand for protein is driving increased exports.  We want to ensure that we have access to it.</p><p>  I do not plan to discuss major policy issues during my brief presentation, but the outcome of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations is important, as members know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Barry" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013050700006#F00200"><p>I have some summary slides on dairy.  My name is Michael Barry.  I represent both the primary and secondary dairy processors in Ireland.  Much has been said in recent months about the sleeping giant that is the Irish dairy industry.  Behind that is a genuine opportunity for Ireland.  As a legacy of the CAP the industry has operated under production constraints.  We were limited in the ability to increase production because of the European milk quota system.  In 2015 those shackles will finally be lifted.  We have lived with quotas for 30 years and on farms and in processing we are getting cumulative productivity gains.  Farmers have been breeding better animals, investing in newer technologies at farm level and there has been a generational change in many farms.  Agricultural colleges have been oversubscribed.  It is a happening industry with optimism, which is exciting and spells opportunities for Ireland.</p><p>  The market opportunities are also there.  The timing is appropriate.  The global population is growing, and so is the consumption of dairy products.  Not alone are more people eating dairy products, but we as a population are eating more dairy products, yogurts and convenience foods and drinking more dairy-based beverages.  An increasing amount of dairy is coming into our diet.  We are seeing this in the least-developed economies in the developing world.  The market environment is very exciting.  Ireland can play its part in leveraging the opportunities of this changing market dynamic and where that is evolving to.  Ireland is already a strong leader globally in the manufacture of infant nutrition.  We are one of the major producers of powdered infant formula and we have also developed a very significant base in the development of medical and sports nutrition and differentiated consumer foods.  Brand Ireland and dairy brand Ireland is a very well-known and respected product throughout the world.</p><p>  We are producing just under &euro;3 billion of dairy products per annum.  We export to more than 150 countries worldwide, sometimes directly and sometimes in partnership with other industry players.  In Ireland we achieved those sales on the basis of 5.5 billion litres of milk.  That is approximately 3% of the European milk pool.  We are not as intense in Ireland as they are in other parts of Europe, so we have approximately 4% of Europe's dairy cows.  There is a tremendous opportunity to expand there.  An extra 50% milk means an additional 1.5% milk within the European milk pool, meaning the EU 27.  The market can take it.  It is not an unbalanced expansion ambition in the context of European dairy, and when one considers the opportunities outside the European market, one can see that the market demand and potential is there.  We will not have problems finding new markets for that product.</p><p>  We will need to be able to produce and process 50% more milk, and there lies the enterprise opportunity for us.  If one considers the nearest regional dairy processing facility, such as Lakelands Dairies or Glanbia's Ballyragget plant, we will need another three of those in Ireland within the next four years.  We will need three new processing facilities of that size.  Glanbia has recently announced the first of them in Waterford.  There will be more such expansion because we will need to find a means to process that milk.  That is a very exciting prospect.  The industry is up for it.  The industry will need to work more closely and in a stronger and more collaborative way with State agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, which is doing very good work in supporting the industry and finding means to produce and process milk into high-value market products.</p><p>  At farm level we anticipate 200,000 extra cows.  That is a 20% increase in herd size to produce that 50% extra milk.  We are becoming more efficient.  We will be able to get more milk from these cows without changing our grass-based dairy production system.</p><p>  In that context I will refer to some legislative changes that are going through the Houses.  The proposed climate Bill is important because the emissions from primary agriculture are relevant to Ireland and its ambition to move towards becoming a low-carbon economy.  The proposal on the development of sectoral roadmaps is entirely appropriate.  We must deal with emissions from primary agriculture and dairy cows in a different way from how we deal with emissions from cars, machinery and motors - things one can engineer carbon out of.  One cannot engineer carbon out of a natural process such as cows.  This route that has been proposed for the development of sectoral roadmaps within the national climate Bill is appropriate and one that we would definitely support.</p><p>  Innovation is very important.  Enterprise Ireland is part-financing and strongly supporting Food for Health Ireland, FHI, an industry initiative in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland to develop new functional ingredients that can be mined from dairy products.  We are in negotiation with Enterprise Ireland to do something similar towards the development of an innovation centre that will focus on processing efficiency and processing challenges, and trying to help us to become not just a leader in new dairy products but a leader in new dairy technologies.  The growth is real, it is happening and we look forward to a strong collaborative development.</p></speech>

I am head of consumer foods.  I would like to take a few minutes to describe the prepared consumer foods sector to the committee, its potential for jobs growth and the challenges facing prepared consumer foods companies.  These companies produce the products found in the middle aisles of the supermarket.  They cover categories such as beverages, confectionery, cereals, ready meals, ambient, chilled and other convenience foods.  The two things companies in this sector need to achieve sustainable jobs growth are finance and fairness in the domestic grocery sector.  I will touch on these issues as I progress through my presentation.</p><p>  The important strategy document all my colleagues have mentioned is Food Harvest 2020.  It states that the continued developed of value added foods on the home and international markets is key to delivering a sustainable agrifood economy in Ireland.  My two colleagues mentioned the increase in output.  We need consumer foods companies to translate this into jobs and innovative products to retain as much value as possible from that and to create as many jobs as possible.  That is a key challenge for this jobs intensive sector, which is regionally dispersed, and it will benefit the economy greatly.</p><p>  This slide outlines the types of companies in the sector, which include some of the largest global brands and Ireland's leading food companies aligned with a healthy cohort of food microenterprises located around the country.  The commonality between all these companies is the domestic grocery sector.  The indigenous companies and exciting microenterprises we see regularly use the sector as a springboard to export growth, to which Mr. Kelly referred.  Equally, the Irish offices of global companies such as Nestl&eacute;, Coca Cola and Mars require a healthy domestic grocery sector as well to generate the sales required to retain investment and jobs in Ireland and to attract further investment from headquarters in terms of research and development and shared services locating in Ireland.  Unfortunately, due to our lack of cost competitiveness over the past number of years and to power imbalances in the domestic grocery sector, the number and scale of international food companies in Ireland has reduced and many food companies have shed jobs since 2008.</p><p>  That has put us back slightly in the context of the ambitious targets outlined in Food Harvest 2020.  The strategy predicts that prepared consumer food companies can achieve a 40% increase in output from the baseline in 2008 but that is dependent on us getting our policies right and getting the domestic grocery sector operating correctly for food companies. </p><p>  In 2010, the Consumer Foods Council, of which I am head, launched its sectoral report entitled, Feeding the Recovery.  The statistics outline the importance of the sector, the number of companies operating within it, the 12,000 persons engaged in it, gross output of &euro;8 billion and exports worth &euro;1.4 billion.  We believe the figures are slightly understated because consumer foods companies within the meat and dairy sectors are included in the meat and dairy figures as opposed to these figures, which refer to a miscellaneous grouping of companies.  However, they still show the significant importance of the sector.</p><p>  The key Government action these companies require if they are to achieve the ambitious targets set in the strategy is to provide access to finance for them in order that they can expand their capacity.  There is a market failure in regard to finance in the sector and due to the traditionally longer investment returns from food companies that Mr. Kelly mentioned, sources of finance such as venture capital are not available to them.  We believe that a sector specific development is required.  There are approximately 70 State-run development funds, many of which are sector specific and focus on technology, but none is focused on food.  If we are serious about food, we need such funding to address the gap.</p><p>  The domestic grocery sector is the springboard for growth for prepared consumer foods companies.  However, the sector is not providing that springboard at the moment due to the recession and the imbalance of power in the grocery sector.  Large retailers, therefore, have been able in the past few years to offset the costs and risks of the recession against suppliers and producers.  We await the introduction of a statutory code of practice and an adjudicator.  This is essential in order that all stakeholders, including the consumer, can benefit from the grocery sector.  It is vital that the Government does everything in its power to reduce costs and boost competitiveness.  Future policy such as VAT increases, the mooted packaging tax or any other consumption taxes such as a tax on beverages should be avoided as they will have a further depressing effect on consumer sentiment, which is greatly damaged the sector currently.</p><p>  One other area of key importance to consumer food companies is their brand and reputation.  There have been a number of attacks on them over the past few years.  The obesity crisis is a major societal challenge for Ireland and for consumer foods companies.  The Government parties must ensure their approach to tackling this key challenge does not damage the reputation of Irish food companies.  These companies take their responsibility seriously and they have been, and are, seeking to collaborate with Government and the Department of Health to achieve health objectives.  However, currently, the Department is examining a proposal to introduce a tax on food products.  Officials previously considered a 10% increase in excise duty on soft drinks but now they are moving on to other categories.  The taxation of food is being seriously considered by the Department, despite the fact that there is no evidence that taxation reduces obesity.  We have said for a long time that tax is a fiscal measure affecting people's wealth, not their health, and it is also regressive.  Recently, Denmark's political parties unanimously agreed to rescind their saturated fat, VAT and sugar taxes.  As early as last month, they repealed a tax on soft drinks introduced in the 1930s as part of a suite of measures aimed at stimulating their economy, particularly in the border regions where cross-border shopping has increased over the past few years in response to increased taxation.</p><p>  The solution to the obesity problem is too complex to be solved by a tax  or advertising ban.  These measures will not improve obesity rate or generate the health care savings envisaged but they have been shown in other countries to damage industries, economies and cause job losses.  Obesity will only be addressed through collaboration between all stakeholders, including industry and government.   We are asking the Government to engage with industry on this key issue.</p><p>  The consumer foods sector has the potential to create sustainable, high quality jobs dispersed throughout the economy.  The increase in global demand for food, increased output in the meat and dairy sector and Ireland's reputation as a food industry are positives for this sector.  However, the issues of access to finance and buying power must be addressed, otherwise this potential will never be realised.</p></speech>

There is a national strategy for the sector - Food Harvest 2020 - which is expansionary in nature.  Many things have been done right by the companies and the State in terms of achieving that strategy.  That is acknowledged but that positivity needs to be counteracted to a certain extent by the fact that there are a number of barriers in place, which have much to do with the complexity of the supply chain and the environment in which the sector operates in Ireland.  We have highlighted a number of them.</p></speech>

It is a very exciting industry and always has been but was somewhat overshadowed during the past decade by the Celtic tiger when some people thought there were better things on offer but clearly there was not.  It is therefore good to see the sustainable indigenous industry in agriculture.  Perhaps Mr. Cormac Healy would comment on the live trade which has started again and, presumably, would be of concern.  Farmers and the IFA would welcome this as a means of limiting reductions in beef prices.  As he may have a different view on the issue, perhaps he would comment.</p><p>  The Minister has handled the horsemeat saga well.  Does Mr. Healy think there is a lingering impact on our green image, albeit that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland was the first to discover what was going on?  In regard to the CAP, the bigger farmers have larger entitlements which they would like to protect.  Many of the smaller western farmers, particularly suckler farmers, would have lower entitlements but they are hugely important.  Perhaps he would comment on that in terms of the inevitable reduction in entitlements for beef finishers.  Does he see that impacting on their expansion?</p><p>  I wish to ask Mr. Michael Barry about the dairy sector which will have huge potential following the abolition of quota in 2015.  I watched on Sky News recently a story from China on the lack of availability of infant formula.  A couple of entrepreneur students in the United Kingdom heard it and started to buy formula in the local shops and export it, as a way of doing business.  What work has been done by the Irish Dairy Industries Association in terms of tapping into that market?  Given that the quota system will be abolished by 2015, will the extra processing facilities, one of which is planned for Waterford, be in place by that time?  </p><p>  Mr. Shane Dempsey mentioned the sector's specific development fund.  Will he please expand on that?  Who will lead it?  Will it be the State, the banks or is European Union funding available?</p></speech>

Perhaps the representatives would respond before moving on to the next questioner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Healy" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013050700008#H00500"><p>I will start with the question on the live trade.  I am not the biggest fan of the live trade but it is there as part of trade.  If it is part of trade without particular support in one direction or the other we cannot have an issue with it.  However, I will make the following points.  There is a myth that they are needed to ensure competition in the market.  All I would say is that during the past decade supports have been available in varying degrees, sometimes high, sometimes low.  The more recent developments in third countries, which in the past would have seen very substantial numbers, have been non-existent in recent years.  The price of Irish cattle to the farmer has increased by about 70% in the past decade.  That increase has been driven primarily by the marketing of Irish beef, not of live animals.</p><p>  I answered a question in regard to the live trade.  We did not come here today to say we have to stop the live trade; that is not our agenda.  If it part of fair trade, so be it.  The processing industry is the one with the investment and the roots on the ground.  In the past we have witnessed episodes where trade conditions changed, or there were particular disease issues and where global food bans have arisen the live trade can disappear overnight.  We are here for the long haul with the investment and the jobs on the ground.  Every 60,000 or 70,000 head of cattle that leave Ireland unprocessed, which would be typical of the throughput of one of our processing plants, means a loss of approximately 300 jobs.</p><p>  The Deputy asked if there is a lingering impact following the horsemeat saga.  I would like to think not.  While Ireland was at the centre of the storm for the initial period, it soon became evident that this was a pan-European issue.  In terms of the Minister's report and all the coverage of the fraud - which is what it was - the inclusion of horsemeat was not found to have initiated in Ireland.  It was limited to a segment of the market.  It is important to point out that of about &euro;1.9 billion worth of beef exports, which is a significant value amount for exports, between 5% and 10% is in the frozen category, and s subset of that is the frozen economy category which appeared to be affected.  The problem did not move to the fresh side of the business and, therefore, it is untouched by the issue.  Things will have changed.  DNA monitoring is part of the scene for the future but it had been in place in some areas for some time.  It is the case that there will be a focus in the frozen manufacturing business on a tightening in the supply chain.  It is clear from some of the examples documented that many links in the chain were not required and there will be a tightening in the supply chain. </p><p>  On the issue of the CAP, in addition to the market value generated from Irish farms, the beef sector is the prime one in this discussion.  A further &euro;0.85 billion in direct payments from Brussels is paid to beef enterprises, beef farms, throughout Ireland.  From that we are developing exports to the tune of &euro;1.9 billion.  It is important to retain as much of that as possible in the sector and we want it to go to active producers.  It is clear from my information, and from speaking to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which has done the analysis, that by and large those who have the higher levels of single farm payment were those who have continued to invest and drive output, therefore, I would like to see a continuation of that payment.  The figures I mentioned for on-farm productivity gain are encouraging; the latent capacity to increase gross margin per hectare in beef enterprises will help us in the future.  I would not like to see any significant redistribution purely for the sake of redistributing.  It should go to active producers who support output which in turn supports jobs, value added and exports.</p><p>  The final point I would make on the CAP which is significant is the coupling of payments in the suckler herd.  It is the bedrock of the major export of beef.  Since the last reform of CAP, five or six member states which have suckler herds have, by and large, retained some form of coupling.  We see that as significant for the future.  We should not be afraid to speak about coupling in the context of WTO or those who say we cannot link support to output.  I make no apology for saying that we need to link support to output, drive output and drive job creation.</p></speech>

Mr. Dempsey was asked about the source of funding.</p></speech>

There is a number currently administered by Enterprise Ireland involving State and EU funding and they are generally run by venture capital, VC, companies.  A number of us mentioned that, traditionally, VCs do not find food companies an attractive type of investment because the returns are steadier but they are over a longer period, and they are not as exciting to venture capital companies as other areas such as technology.  However, they are still impressive over a longer period of time.  There are a number of general funds out that have mentioned that.</p><p>  However, in their funding and in how they are administered, the food companies do not get a fair share out of those funds.  We suggest that, even in the general generic funds, there should be more of an incentive for the venture capital company to select food companies for investment.  There may even need to be a quota system created to ensure that enough food companies get finance.  Ultimately, a sector-specific fund, run by a VC with experience and expertise in the food sector, is probably the best solution here.  It has happened in other sectors and we do not see why it should not happen in food.</p></speech>

For infant formula, I cannot stress enough the importance of a properly supervised supply chain.  One's source of supply is integral because this is the most sensitive and vulnerable population.  When one is dealing with infants where their full diet is dependent on formula, food safety is critical.  It is playing with fire for there to be product coming into China or any other market through a chain of which nobody is sure.  There already have been well-documented food scares in China as a consequence of product coming in where people did not know from where it came.  That is the reason behind it.  On a simple matter, even if the product was shown to be from a correct origin, there are not many Chinese consumers in a position to read Dutch or Danish labels on products that they have picked up on mainland Europe.  That aspect can have lethal consequences.</p><p>  Ireland is doing a great deal in China right now.  We have three significant manufacturing facilities in Ireland, Wyatt Nestl&eacute;, Abbott and Danone, all of whom are market leaders and the largest exporters of infant formula from this island to China.  China is critical in that respect.  The other point is that all of our primary dairies, such as Glanbia, Kerry Group, Dairygold and Carbery, are active in supplying ingredients to the market.  It is one of the significant contributors to our ambition of 50% in Food Harvest 2020 and our focus is clearly there.</p><p>  This leads us to the second question as to whether we will be ready by 2015 for the expansion.  It will be challenging, but I believe we will be.  One of the measures we are taking is to ensure it is not a big bang.  We do not believe on 1 April 2015 we will get 50% more milk.  This will take a while, as farmers ramp up as they develop.  Similarly, we must ensure that we have the right equipment to produce the right foods for the market opportunities and much of our expansion will be incremental.  One will see a series of step changes of medium-sized drying facilities being put in place to ensure we are fit for purpose.  That is probably the correct way to go.</p><p>  Members of the committee will be familiar with the fodder shortage as a consequence of this year's weather.  I would go so far as to suggest that I believe we are no longer looking at a 50% increase by 2020 but, probably, are more likely to achieve the 50% by 2021, if not 2022, because the legacy of the fodder crisis is such that it has depressed milk output but will also hamper fertility rates on farms.  It will take a few cycles to get us through this.  The growth will be there but the 2020 piece may not be in terms of the 50:50 ratio.  That would be okay, once we can have our farmers in a sustainable and economic state.  In answer to the question, we will be ready for that.</p></speech>

It was enlightening.  The last point is key.  We are listening to the legacy of the fodder crisis.  We think it is here and now.  I know it will be long term because supplies have dwindled.  Even this year, fertility rates are low as a result, not of the fodder crisis but of the weather.</p><p>  I have a couple of points.  They did not really deal with anything on import substitution.  A number of agrifood companies here, particularly of the smaller scale, are doing something in that regard to replace what we are importing into supermarkets and stores.</p><p>  They spoke of 30,000 jobs being created in the agrifood sector.  I visit meat plants regularly because I supply them.  Most of the jobs in that sector are being generated by foreign non-nationals.  I am aware of small food-producing companies that cannot get staff to work with them because of the associated salary scales and the expectations of the Irish.  Naturally, it ends up, particularly in the beef sector and in boning, that most of the staff are non-nationals.  As far as the 30,000 are concerned, will we be creating jobs for non-nationals or Irish?  As a consequence, what training programmes do we need to provide if we are to take on Irish workers?</p><p>  As they stated, the dairy sector amounts to 4% of EU output and we are optimist about the future.  The 2015 change applies all across the EU, including the big producers such as the Dutch and the Danes.  Have we taken on board what they are putting in place?  We want to know what the competition is.  Obviously, we speak of the Chinese market for baby formula which is exciting, but what are the big producers doing?  They see the opportunities in China too.  For what are our competitors gearing up post 2015?</p><p>  I have always had a problem - it is nothing against Senator Quinn personally or anything like that - with the way the main supermarkets operate with the use of loss leaders and the knock-on effect at my level of farming.  These are loss leaders, not for the supermarket but for the supplier.  IBEC represents all sectors and FDII may be merely a specific sector within that.  How does FDII deal in-house on that matter with the representative organisation for supermarkets, such as SuperValu and Tesco, which may be represented by IBEC too?  Sometimes IBEC issues mixed messages.  As we highlighted earlier, its chief economist has come out with a mixed message in the past month.  Are there mixed signals issuing from within FDII's sector in IBEC on who is the stronger?</p></speech>

Most of the questions I was going to ask have been covered.  Mr. Dempsey spoke about consumer foods and there is a danger involved in introducing an obesity tax.  I raised this matter in the Seanad last week and spoke about what has been done in Denmark.  There is little doubt it has shown a dramatic increase.  It abolished the taxes it had imposed, some of which had been in place for a long time.  It did so because it was losing business across the border into Germany.  We will also lose business if we introduce such a measure.</p><p>  We are part of Europe and I was concerned to hear about a statutory code of practice.  How would a statutory code of practice be enforced on a company whose headquarters and purchasing is based in D&uuml;sseldorf, Munich or London?  We would end up discriminating against Irish-based companies such as SuperValu and Dunnes Stores, which would have to comply with certain measures not applicable to companies based outside of Ireland.  I believe in the marketplace and a measure such as this is not possible.  Such a measure must be on a voluntary basis.</p><p>  I gather a number of supermarkets in Ireland have put a limit on the number of packets of baby formula one can buy because they were being exported.  Mr. Barry explained very well why this had to be done as it could damage us.  What other threats exist with regard to reaching the 2020 targets?  The main threat would be another food safety scandal, such as happened with regard to the pigmeat three or four years ago when it turned out pigs were being fed bread which had been returned but left in the package.  We must forcibly insist on watching this issue.  We were able to identify the horsemeat out of the blue because we were the only country to check it.  Are there other measures we can take to maintain food safety?</p></speech>

It is nice to be discussing agriculture and food for a change as we spend much time discussing IT.  I represent the constituency of Cork North-West which is very rural and dependent on agriculture.  I attended an IFA meeting on Thursday and the farmers there did not share the views of the witnesses, particularly with regard to the fodder crisis and its long-term effect, and they are concerned it might happen again because of climate change.  They are also concerned about the price of milk which is 92 cent per gallon which is the equivalent price it was in 1983 but costs have gone through the roof.  Will increasing production mean losing some smaller farms?  Will this have an impact?  Will this have a long-term effect?</p><p>  Deputy Lawlor spoke about skills in the boning sector and I have many concerns in this regard.  I have not done much research but I understand it is being filled by non-nationals who are probably non-European.  No training is being provided.  I understand one person is being outsourced to train.  Irish boners are no longer working in the industry because they do not get paid.  If we speak about increasing production by 50% by 2020 we must examine this and consider making it more licensed and regulated.  I am not an expert in the field and I would like to hear the witnesses' comments.</p></speech>

The issues raised include import substitution, food production, salary scales, training programmes, competition from other member states post-2013, taxes on consumer foods, enforcing a statutory code of practice, threats to achieving the 2020 targets, food safety and the impact of increased production on small farmers.</p></speech>

With regard to import substitution, in many respects it goes back to my earlier point that one must be cost competitive to get or stay on retail shelves.  Import substitution can be positive if one gets one's cost base right, aside from getting the product right and innovation.  This would provide an opportunity to make a pitch.  Retailers have been working with many companies on private labels and the brands themselves and much development work has been done.</p><p>  Senator Quinn spoke about Denmark and taxation.  Denmark had a huge issue with people travelling from Denmark to Germany.  We had a similar issue a few years ago with people heading north of the Border where costs were very much out of line and we also had VAT, duty and cost differentials.  Opportunities exist, but they can only be realised if the cost base is right.  Part of this will have to do with how companies make themselves more efficient.  Companies have support from Enterprise Ireland with regard to lean manufacturing and this, combined with an appropriate tax regime in the country, is the way to go in this regard.</p><p>  I will make some general points on job development.  In the report we produced last year our analysis suggested the creation of up to 30,000 jobs.  We also examined issues regarding employment and our findings are all based on CSO numbers.  The total payroll for the sector is approximately &euro;1.8 billion, which is the largest of any manufacturing sector.  The average reckonable pay declined in 2009 and 2010, and this was symptomatic of most sectors, be they industry, manufacturing or services, as a result of the economic downturn.  We were hit by sterling depreciation also and the need to regain lost competitiveness.  Having said this, the average pay for the sector remains above the average for the entire economy.  It is slightly lower than the average industrial pay but slightly above the average for the entire economy.  More importantly, the CSO produced a job turn report which is the rate of turnover in the sector.  The job turn for food and drink is 0.25%, which is lower than the average for the entire economy.  In other words the rate of employee attrition is lower than average, which suggests something positive is happening in terms of the quality and attractiveness of working in the sector.</p><p>  With regard to how IBEC deals with the grocery code, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation is an umbrella of many interest groups and on this issue distinct sectoral views are held.  One view is represented by Retail Ireland and the other represented by Food and Drink Industry Ireland, which is the approach taken on this issue.  A Bill to merge the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency is in the current legislative programme.  It is intended this will have an enabling provision to allow the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation enact a statutory grocery code of practice.  The Minister made this announcement quite some time ago.  We came before an Oireachtas joint committee to discuss the issue in 2009, and in 2006 when the groceries order was abolished.  The view of the food industry is that the code is an appropriate remedy to put in place, and what is important is the speed with which it is enacted and put in place.</p><p>  I acknowledge the Senator's point on the European context.</p></speech>

A need and opportunity for highly skilled people was identified which can be solved by a piece of retraining, reskilling and refocusing.  The initiative will serve the sector well into the future.</p><p>  Deputy Lawlor asked whether we had examined the reaction and ambition of other European countries and their potential post-quota.  Yes, is the answer.  Ireland is unique in having its business plan, Food Harvest 2020, which brought the Government and industry together.  There is not an ambitious growth opportunity in many of the dairy exporting countries in Europe because many of them have natural, environmental and societal constraints.  Water is a big issue but water quality is an even bigger issue in many of these intensive countries.  Ireland has a tremendous opportunity to benefit from their constraints.  It is my association's view that the expansion of these countries will be somewhat muted.</p><p>  In terms of the good question of whether we see any other threats post-2020 to achieving the goals, we do not know about the unknowns.  Nobody saw the dioxin or horsemeat scandals coming and more will arise, but it is impossible to predict them.  We can manage things like trade policy.  We work in an increasingly global market so we must ensure the opportunities for accessing markets continue, are enhanced and the competitive base is unhindered.  Trade policy is a known factor that is worth a lot of focus.  A threat to trade policy would hurt the industry both defensively and offensively.</p><p>  Deputy Collins asked whether we would lose smaller farms.  Since quota was introduced, there has been a gradual and even decline in the number of family farms in Ireland, and the same has happened across Europe.  Our feeling on it is that the decline has been driven more by age factors, either a lack of a successor or someone is unwilling to operate a small to medium-sized enterprise.  Earlier, the committee discussed finance but a discussion on finance is also important at farm level.  Somebody working a small to medium-sized enterprise must learn how much it will cost to take on such a challenge.  The problem is that we are increasingly dealing with a very volatile price environment.  There have been price highs and lows which makes it challenging for somebody to secure high levels of finance for his or her business.  That is a long way of saying that I believe that the current decline in farm numbers will continue due to age and demographics.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the sector's potential for growth.  Farmer meetings are difficult now.  Farmer confidence is at an all-time low and has been dented.  I believe that the 50% target is no longer just related to Food Harvest 2020 because it has been supported by very detailed surveys carried out by co-ops throughout the country.  I would go back to the point I made earlier.  Let us think less about Food Harvest 2020 and more about the 50% target which is still a great victory for us nationally if we hit that 50% target by 2022.</p></speech>

That is a positive.</p><p>  With regard to food and expansion in the sector, there will be both a direct increase in processing jobs and a considerable increase in associated jobs throughout the ancillary industries at farm level and downstream.  That is the way that the jobs will evolve.  There will be a certain amount of direct jobs created in processing and additional jobs in associated industries.</p><p>  Over the past decade there has been an increase in the number of foreign nationals working in the meat processing business.  A significant number of them work in the sector for one simple reason.  Individuals with the required skills are unavailable here.  Despite the depths of unemployment to which we have dropped and the significant unemployment rate we have now, not so long ago Ireland was technically known to have zero unemployment.  At that point there was a skills shortage and people moved out of these less attractive jobs.  People who worked in these harsh environments moved to another sector such as construction.  That led to a skills shortage and foreign labour was brought into the country.  Clearly, the demand has now stopped.  Outside of Europe, the permit system is extremely tight and difficult, but we have seen a change in the applications now being submitted for such work.  There is a greater availability of people from the workforce here.  People are now willing to consider such work.</p><p>  In terms of skills, Mr. Kelly did not mention that the FDII has lodged an application for the Skillnets programme to provide a training programme that encompasses the food sector.  A process must be gone through but the FDII is addressing the matter.  In more recent years, the National Butchery Academy in Ballinasloe, County Galway, has been established.  Although the course has small and modest numbers participating, the profession is moving in the right direction.  The students have come from Irish meat processors and, on graduation, will take up employment in boning halls and processing facilities.  The FDII will continue to focus on education and training.</p><p>  Senator Quinn mentioned threats to the sector.  Obviously, if I had the answer to his question, I would be outside of the committee room and working as a consultant.  Dioxin threats, scandals and food scares are a major impediment to progress.  Dioxin, BSE and the foot and mouth disease, though related, are not specific to the food processing area.  We need to ensure there are controls along the food chain, to maintain them and not have them all bottlenecked into just one part of the food supply chain.  We must also concentrate on driving quality in terms of schemes and throughout the food chain, from the farm and through processing.  We must push all of these measures.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Karl O'Leary, public sector director for Microsoft Ireland, and Mr. Niall McDonagh our cloud technology leader for western Europe.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss the important issue of cloud and its roll-out in Ireland during our national cloud week.</p><p>  Under the banner of national cloud week, we are running a series of events designed to raise awareness about the opportunities and benefits that cloud computing can bring to the public and private sectors.  The opportunity to address this joint committee on this important topic is central to part of the week's activities. </p><p>  Microsoft as an organisation has been transformed from a product company into a devices and services company, providing solutions to our customers.  As part of that transformation, cloud is key.  Microsoft Ireland has a 1,200 strong employee base, but we have an extended partner ecosystem of small companies that represents about 40,000 jobs in our ecosystem.  We have been in Ireland 28 years and have been evolving from being a manufacturing facility to being an operations core development centre, a sales, marketing and service group but also a data centre, which is the key cloud element of our ecosystem.  We are driving and facilitating the move to a solutions and services company in Ireland.</p><p>  Many will have heard Microsoft staff speak of the potential that cloud has to offer.  There has been a small level of deployment on cloud in the public sector, but we believe there is so much more we can do.  That is the reason that we are hosting a national cloud week.  Cloud has the opportunity to play a significant role in Ireland's economic recovery efforts.  It can help deliver the public sector transformation agenda, be a catalyst for growth in the indigenous economy and help to retain our competitiveness and attractiveness as a home for multinational companies in the future.  Importantly, we believe cloud can play a significant role in helping Ireland achieve its job creation and growth agenda.  We welcome the fact the Government is committed to encouraging deployment of cloud in both the public and private sectors and that it has been identified as a strategic priority in the programme for Government and in the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>  To ensure that cloud has the maximum impact, organisations need to know of its potential benefits and how it can be harnessed to drive growth and achieve efficiencies.  Today, in partnership with the Irish Internet Association and Enterprise Ireland, we are announcing an initiative to raise the awareness of cloud to hundreds of small businesses around the country.  This was in direct response to a recommendation in the Government's Action Plan for Jobs strategy, which was published earlier in the year.  By working in partnership with a range of organisations we can help encourage broader adoption of cloud.  We have seen some initial data from a cloud index survey that we commissioned from Amarach Consulting.  This will be ready for publication later this week.  We will be delighted to send the full set of findings to members.</p><p>  The early data show that awareness has improved significantly year on year.  It also shows that deployment of cloud services is up year on year, particularly among small businesses.  It shows the movement towards its adoption in the public sector is slow.  If we want to be a leading cloud environment and have a centre of excellence for cloud in Ireland, we need to move faster.  As industry leaders in the area, there are a number of pointers, of which we need to take note.  When asked to determine the primary barrier to cloud deployment, security and privacy were raised as issues of primary concerns.  We have a responsibility to address these continuing concerns and to look for ways to reassure organisations that the cloud is a safe environment for their personal and commercial data.  We plan to work with our industry colleagues to develop solutions in this area.</p><p>  Let me use today's meeting as an opportunity to assure members that the cloud is a trusted environment.  It can play a major part in helping to drive efficiencies in the public sector and in facilitating job creation in the wider economy.  There are a number of successful examples in which cloud has been deployed effectively on a variety of interesting projects in countries across Europe.  Cloud has opened up new possibilities for governments and for the people they serve.  With the advent of cloud computing and IT as a shared service, new levels of flexibility, manageability and agility are possible, enabling organisations to deliver services more effectively.</p> <p>Furthermore, by maximising the use of existing technology infrastructure, governments are able to reduce costs, drive productivity and deliver services across multiple departments and to a broad set of citizens and stakeholders. </p><p> We want to share some of the examples with the joint committee, as we believe many of them are relevant in the Irish context.  The first one is from Mexico City where citizens now spend just one quarter of the time to have a property deed prepared and registered compared with the past.  If we relate this to the Irish environment, we think we could apply the same technology and mechanisms to drive efficiency in areas such as passport and television licence applications.</p><p> Government agencies can implement robust solutions that connect valuable data across disparate systems enabling greater insights and new levels of accountability.  These solutions help agencies to monitor performance and enable greater levels of transparency on where tax dollars are being spent.  For example, the German Government drove a productivity increase of 66% using cloud technology by streamlining access to 400 lines of business applications into a single user interface.  Here in Ireland, we know there is a vast disparity of systems across the public sector.  This is a real area of opportunity to drive efficiency.  The Irish Government can play a role in the growth of cloud computing in Ireland by adopting cloud services within the public sector, taking a lead in the areas of regulation, classifying data and creating open data sets.</p><p> In order to drive momentum on cloud and realise necessary cost savings, governments in many countries are putting programmes in place to accelerate cloud adoption in their public service.  A number of different approaches are being followed.  In the UK, we are seeing a procurement-led approach.  The UK government is driving a process to classify public databases on confidentiality levels and certifying a range of cloud services for different levels of data confidentiality, providing a portal that makes it easy for public sector entities to procure these services for prices that have been negotiated centrally. </p><p> There are currently 500 supplies offering approximately 3,000 cloud services in the UK.  To date, &pound;80 million worth of transactions have been recorded.  Several other countries have followed the procurement-led approach in putting framework agreements in place for a range of IT services, including cloud services.  This approach is common in the Nordic countries.  In Finland, the government has a shared service provider framework contract to one local partner who, within two years, has moved 200 municipalities onto cloud services.  </p><p> There are other mechanisms as well, like policy-led approaches.  In order to accelerate adoption of cloud services in the Federal Government in the US, the CIO introduced a cloud-first policy in 2010.  They mandated all federal agencies to identify three services they would move to the cloud.  One of these services had to be moved within 12 months and another within 18 months.  They then mandated a 40% reduction in their data centre over the following five years.  There are multiple methods the government can use to enable cloud computing.  </p><p> For Ireland to be a leader in the cloud computing area, it is important that we can demonstrate that the Government, its Departments and agencies have seized the opportunity to lead innovation through cloud technology.  In June 2012, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published details of its cloud computing strategy.  We welcome that strategy and look forward to its implementation.  We believe that the approach outlined within the strategy provides a strong foundation upon which a series of cloud-enabled efficiencies can be introduced in the Irish public sector.  We welcome the opportunity to partner with the Government on this task.</p><p> Before concluding, I wish to touch briefly on the issue of skills.  We are all only too aware of the unemployment challenge the country faces.  As has already been stated, we believe that the cloud can be a catalyst for economic growth and job creation.  In the short term, we at Microsoft are finding opportunities for our unemployed youth through our youth-to-work initiative.  We are working with FIT - that is, Fast-track to IT - to help support the development and training of 10,000 young people over the next three years.  Many of these young people will participate in training for the cloud.  They will have the skills to enable them to help with the objective of making Ireland a cloud centre of excellence.  As we know, there are vacancies in the IT sector and it is imperative that we do what we can to ensure that our unemployed young people are equipped with the skills to fill these vacancies.  </p><p> I wanted to use the opportunity of our visit today to thank the joint committee for its continued commitment to addressing unemployment issues and for its focus on job creation.  My colleagues and I would welcome the opportunity to respond to any questions that members of the committee may have at this time.</p></speech>

As time goes on, I cannot imagine how we will do without it - whether it is a drop-box on an iPhone or anything else.  I am particularly aware of Microsoft's youth-to-work initiative globally.  I am delighted that Microsoft has linked with FIT, whose representatives have been before this committee in the past.  Microsoft and FIT together are a great team.  I commend Ms Hallahan on that work.  As a multinational, Microsoft has taken a lead role in examining the issue of unemployment, particularly concerning young people.  That is a credit to her company.</p><p>  I now call Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins who wanted to ask some questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/988" speakername="&Aacute;ine Collins" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013050700013#N00300"><p>I welcome the delegation.  We are all very much in favour of cloud.  As Ms Hallahan knows, Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, is the only college in the country that has a degree course in cloud technology.  As a result, it is retraining quite a lot of people who are going into VMware and EMC, with which I am sure Ms Hallahan is familiar.</p><p>  When I came into this job two years ago, I was completely frustrated with the cumbersome security and data elements.  A few of us wanted to put cloud into the Oireachtas committees, which I thought would be a really good example of how we could let the world know that we had moved on.  I believe we will have it within 16 to 18 months.  None of us will have laptops or desktop computers then; we will all have iPads.</p><p>  However, the attitude to change is slow and people seem to be quite afraid of it.  It is moving in the right direction but it will take us some time.  Ms Hallahan is far more expert in this area than I am, but there are so many areas that would benefit from all of this, including the HSE.  It would sort out a lot of efficiencies that we badly need, but which do not seem to be happening.  The biggest problem we have is people and their attitudes, including the fear of change and the idea that this will end up losing jobs instead of creating them with better efficiency.  I am sure Ms Hallahan has thought about this matter and has researched it, so I wonder if we could publish something on that and discuss it a bit more.  People still do not understand much about cloud and they tend to fear it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.218" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013050700013#N00400"><p>Ms Hallahan mentioned a few things, including security and privacy which are primary concerns.  I remember that we received something from the Oireachtas IT unit stating that, as cloud computing services are located outside the State, security cannot be guaranteed.  Therefore, it is obviously an issue in here as well.</p><p>  Ms Hallahan said she was doing her best to reassure organisations, so how is that progressing?  What sort of reassurances can she give?  Presumably, broadband is an absolute requirement but it is more easily found in urban areas than in rural ones which have intermittent, low-speed broadband.  Ms Hallahan also said that Microsoft's deployment of cloud services, particularly among small businesses, is progressing, although movement towards its adoption in the public sector is slow.  What type of small businesses are progressing in this way?  As regards the public sector, a lot of data is stored by local authorities so what moves are there within those organisations to examine that issue?  What cost savings are involved in moving towards the cloud system?</p></speech>

Ms Hallahan mentioned passports in the context of cloud computing.  I am familiar and comfortable enough with cloud computing.  The passport is a sacred document we all have, so can Ms Hallahan explain how we could involve cloud in applying for passports?  In general, if we were moving more to cloud computing within the public service, what would the knock-on effect be for job displacement?</p></speech>

Regarding change management and cultural changes, Deputy Collins hit the nail on the head.  I have been with Microsoft for 28 years.  In Ireland, it has transformed from a manufacturing facility into an operations, development and data centre.  An element of transformation is change management, given people's fear factor.  This is particularly the case in manufacturing facilities, where people are concerned about whether they have the ability to upskill and move into value added services.  One must put in place a change management strategy, help in educating people on their opportunities and the skills they will need, and have a communications strategy.  The public sector is undergoing significant changes.  In general, an overarching change management or transformation strategy must be built, including a communications pillar.  Such a strategy is the only way to alleviate some of the fear factor.  Small steps should be taken.  For example, identify areas in which success is demonstrable.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne asked about the types of small business that could use cloud computing.  E-mail is a good example.  Many small businesses do not buy their own exchange servers.  Instead, they use e-mail in the cloud.  They log onto a service and pay a subscription.  This helps them in two ways.  First, it moves from making the capital investment of buying servers and licences to paying a subscription cost.  Second, it helps small businesses to be more cost efficient and gives them some of the predictability they need to be able to scale and grow, as it is an operating expense as opposed to a capital one.</p><p>  Deputy Collins asked for public sector examples.  The HSE could benefit greatly.  Mr. O'Leary has been working closely with it in that regard.  He has also been working with the health services in Northern Ireland.  We can share a number of good examples.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Karl O'Leary" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013050700014#O00300"><p>I will address the transformation in the public sector.  On average, &euro;480 million is spent on ICT in the public sector per year.  A minimum of &euro;80 million in savings is being sought.  This will primarily be delivered by adopting new work practices.  Cloud is an enabler in that regard.  We have three pillars, one of which is public service delivery engagement.  Mobile telephone applications being used to access documents was mentioned, but they could also be used to enable citizens to engage with public services.  For example, people could use them to find out where health centres are, what time they are open, to book appointments, etc.  All of this can be done through the cloud.  A school project running out of St. James's Hospital to map health providers' locations is being delivered on the cloud.</p><p>  A second pillar is workplace modernisation, that is, changing how people work.  In Northern Ireland, the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust modernised by adopting a more unified communications approach.  A member mentioned the greater use of mobile devices, but the ability to use video conference calls and examine patient data has saved the trust approximately 30% of its facility costs, those being, heat and power.  It did this by consolidating data and making them more available remotely without needing to get into a car and visit someone.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne mentioned the amount of data that is stored by local authorities but not shared or leveraged when delivering a service.  For example, some UK councils work with their areas' health trusts in determining where to make preventative health investments.</p><p>  I had the chance to listen to an earlier session on the fodder crisis.  In terms of predictive analytics, "big data" is always mentioned.  I will try to make the concept real for the committee.  If we had the capacity for each farmer to notify his or her stock of fodder decreasing at an accelerated rate, those data could be mapped and people could figure out how to put in place local initiatives to solve the crisis.  This is cloud.  It is not just a matter of working differently.  Rather, it is concerned with service delivery and engagement, modernising the workplace and providing better insights and accountability.</p><p>  We would be more than happy to go into the detail of multiple examples.  We are working with the public sector to deliver in this regard.  The recent ECOFIN meeting was an example, in that it was delivered through cloud technology.  We are working closely with the HSE to understand what services we can deliver.  We are working hospital by hospital as well as centrally.  This type of work takes time, but people need to be confident in the cloud.  They will only be confident after they have seen the public sector embracing it.  Hence, the classification of data.  People must be confident that they will receive e-mails and documents from the cloud.  We look to politicians as leaders, who must demonstrate their confidence in the cloud.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.223" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall McDonagh" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013050700014#O00400"><p>I will address a number of points.  The fear of change is probably one of the reasons for the slower movement in the public sector.  There is a risk for the private sector, but there is also an incentive, particularly for chief information officers, CIOs.  There is a risk for the public sector in adopting cloud computing but there is not necessarily an incentive to take that risk.  People will not necessarily see improvements in their budgets or increases in their pay packets.</p><p>  The policy mandated approach in the US is interesting.  In a way, it provides a cover or support for CIOs to take action.  It is possible to dip one's toes in the cloud waters.  One could buy a subscription for one of our services, for example, Windows Azure, for &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000, and start building pilot applications.  A large, overnight and risky transformation is not necessary.</p><p>  Regarding fear of change and questions of security and privacy, "cloud" does not necessarily mean "public cloud".  It need not involve giving one's data to an external provider.  For example, an Irish Government service could have all of the characteristics of cloud.  Indeed, this is exactly the Government's strategy.  While it is primarily intended for central government, it also envisages a private cloud strategy and, therefore, removes many of the risks.</p><p>  Another key security and privacy point is that of data classification.  Of the Departments' data, one needs to know what is and is not sensitive.  Therefore, one can tailor a cloud service.  Typically, the public cloud service is large scale and, for this reason, allows one to make greater cost savings.  However, there are also greater privacy concerns.  If one classifies data, the less sensitive data can be moved onto the public cloud and the more sensitive data can be kept in a private cloud.  This is in line with what the Government has envisaged.</p></speech>

On the other side, if a large cloud service provider like Microsoft has many contractual obligations to protect customers' data, its security practices will be at the highest end.  Most organisations whose business is not to provide or manage cloud services will not be able to invest in those practices.</p></speech>

Where are things going in future?  We are in the cloud at the moment but where is the next movement?  I have an iPhone 3 and there is an iPhone 5 out and an iPhone 10 is probably being developed by Apple at the moment.  The technology is moving on quickly because this is business.  Where are we going?  Do we keep reinventing these products until eventually we go back to the pen and paper?</p></speech>

One of the key things consumers are looking for is access to their data anywhere, on any device.  It is irrelevant what device is being used, those people want to be able to get their data any time, anywhere.  That is what the cloud service provides.  It does not matter if it is an iPhone, a Windows phone, an iPad or a tablet, or an X-Box at home, people should be able to access the same data on any device.  That is where the cloud comes to life because it offers that opportunity regardless of the device.  We will see lots of technological evolution but there will always be a need to be able to access data and it is how that is done is what the cloud services will provide.</p></speech>

We have software the three of us use and if there is something in an e-mail that only I can look after, it is directed to a little app on this phone that will tell me what I need to do based on the workload coming in.  Within that app I can send one of the guys up in the office a message to say I have done that.  There are so many things that make our life much easier and more productive, leaving more time for creativity to do even more creative things.</p></speech>

As a technology company, we have become the custodians of data.  The innovation will be delivered through lots of SMEs.  In Ireland we have 40,000 partners who are involved in delivering jobs and creating skills.  They must have the confidence in us that our data centres host their solutions securely.  As for the Government, it must lead the way in cloud, it must show we have the highest level of cybersecurity policy that is not a barrier to a person adopting the cloud, but makes that person feel secure.  People will be able to change to the latest iPhone when they are ready and they will not lose any data; it will be secure and they will be able to interact with those people they were interacting with before they changed device.</p><p>  In 20 years, everyone will be accessing on multiple mobile devices what they do at work and at home but in that one secure environment.  As Deputy Collins mentioned, she wants to come into this physical environment to see what she has to do there but when she goes home she can use the same device to do something else.  People just want to know that is secure.  Constituents want to know that when Members are looking at something for them, the device it is being done on is secure.  That is the cloud challenge: to address the security concern because that is the barrier to us all adopting the cloud at a greater rate.</p></speech>

We are not getting rid of physical passports, which are key to access, but we want to make it more efficient and easier for the consumer to apply and be issued with a passport and to be able to interact in real time if they have any queries, so the usual to-ing and fro-ing in the post can be avoided.</p><p>  In response to the question of whether moving to the cloud will lead to job displacement, our view is that it drives efficiency and gives an opportunity to redeploy resources into the areas where investment is needed.  That is our focus - driving efficiency and productivity to give the chance to reinvest in future activities.</p></speech>

The whole opportunity for Government and businesses is to turn that on its head, so they spend 20% of their time maintaining their infrastructure because they will have a lot less to maintain, and 80% of the time developing services for their businesses and, ultimately, for their customers.  That is the idea, not to take people out but to turn to their work towards more added value activities.</p></speech>

She has been a regular contributor to the committee since her elevation to a ministerial position and she was previously a member of the committee.  Members are aware that this is Europe week and the event is being celebrated by a number of debates in both Houses and the committees.  It is appropriate that the Minister of State is with us today to broaden the discussion.</p><p>  As part of its work stream on Ireland and the future of the EU, this committee has been examining issues related to the completion of the economic and monetary union, such as banking, fiscal and economic union.  The issues of democratic legitimacy and accountability have been identified at EU level as the fourth critical component of a complete economic and monetary union, and as a committee we have decided to give special consideration to these issues.  The issues of democratic legitimacy and accountability in the EU extend beyond the area of economic governance, and in an Irish context they raise questions on the role of the Oireachtas in EU affairs.  I know the Minister of State chaired a sub-committee which considered the issue in 2010.</p><p>  With European elections coming in 2014 and the changes proposed, we have the opportunity to consider how to address these key questions.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's views in that respect.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to be here today.</p><p>  It is 63 years since Robert Schuman presented a proposal for the creation of a community of European nation states, a community which would be bound together by shared values and concerns while accepting and embracing diversity.  This proposal, made on 9 May 1950, would lay the foundations for lasting peace and prosperity in Europe and would give all Europeans the democratic tools to ensure governments worked together in their interests.  Such is the importance of the Schuman declaration and the European project that 9 May has been designation as Europe Day to acknowledge the peace and unity which has been accomplished but also to acknowledge that there is more to do.  It is for this very reason that this Government committed to a week-long parliamentary debate on Europe and Ireland's priorities within the EU and why I very much welcome the opportunity to speak to this committee in Europe week on the question of democratic accountability and legitimacy in the European Union.  We will have a plenary debate tomorrow in the D&aacute;il Chamber on the same topic.</p><p>  The economic and financial crisis has contributed to a wider crisis in confidence in the institutions that have been so painstakingly built in Europe over the past 50 years and of which Ireland has been an integral part for the past four decades.  We need to confront this crisis of confidence with a sense of urgency and determination, along with a clear understanding of what is at stake.  The immediate context of this discussion is the new framework of economic governance that has been developed in response to the crisis and to protect our common currency.</p></speech>

I understand that we are attempting to create a dialogue between parliamentarians and the EU and that there is a deficit in that regard.  There is certainly a deficit in the sense that we have MEPs elected to represent Ireland who seem to be aloof from this engagement process.</p><p>  I am very worried about what seems to be happening in Europe.  Some of my concerns include the fact that Bulgaria has no government at present and Italy is in an extremely unstable position politically, with the likelihood that its Government will collapse, with further disharmony ensuing.  There are also rumours that Slovenia is having extreme financial difficulties and will head down the thorny bailout path, that Spain is in crisis and that the French banking system is unstable.  There are four countries already in bailout programmes, namely Ireland, Portugal, Cyprus and Greece.  At the same time, the British Prime Minister is gaining support for his proposal to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union.  In Ireland we are blessed by the fact that we have a written Constitution and have to put proposals for major change to the people by way of referenda.  That, in a sense, tends to make us focus quite sharply on issues emanating from Europe, which is positive.  However, I detect a very strong sense of alienation among the citizens of Europe.  The fact that people feel that they can vote for comedians over serious politicians is very worrying.  To some extent, we can be encouraged by the fact that countries such as Iceland, Serbia, Kosovo, Croatia, Turkey and the Ukraine want to join the European Union.  Where does the Minister of State see things going in 2014?  </p><p>  A witness who appeared before an Oireachtas committee recently suggested that the political structure in Ireland is not capable of delivering the degree of professionalism required to properly scrutinise EU business.  He said that the client basis of electoral support here, the multi-seat constituency system and the single transferable vote created so much internal competition that parliamentarians would not have the time or inclination to engage in the serious business of really delving into such scrutiny.</p><p>  What is happening now could be called the politics of the pendulum.  All over Europe, socialists get elected and then they get kicked out, to be replaced by conservatives who then get kicked out and so forth.  Iceland is a great example of this.  The pendulum is in constant motion.  The people are so desperate for some sort of long-term stability and security.  They are in such pain that they opt to get rid of their current leaders in favour of the opposition, in the hope that their situation will improve.  In reality, their situation is deteriorating.  </p></speech>

I attended the launch of the European Movement's Accountability Report for 2012 this morning which shows that the average Irish ministerial attendance at meetings for 2012 increased by 11%.  In fact, we are now at 97%, coming in joint second, which is very welcome and demonstrates the commitment of the Minister of State and the Government.  Irish attendance in Europe is extremely important because there is so much change happening at European level, affecting all of us.</p><p>  As someone who has served in the European Parliament, I am very interested in the question of the scrutiny of EU legislation.  I note from the report launched this morning that Ireland now has 12 MEPs but is only represented on 14 of the 20 committees of the European Parliament.  It is quite likely that we will lose an MEP at the next European elections, which means that our MEPs will be sitting on even fewer committees.  That means that we must be more watchful of what is going on in the European Parliament and across all of the EU institutions.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of accompanying her on a visit to one of the schools in the Blue Star programme.  It is remarkable how open and engaged young people are with the European project.  They are a reminder to everyone involved in politics that we all have a role to play in promoting Europe.  The European Union is of great importance to our culture and the future of our youngest citizens.  This is a long overdue debate.</p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to tease out the issues she addressed and perhaps stray into her personal opinion.  In Bucharest, where she was recently elected one of the vice-presidents of the European People's Party, a motion was passed calling for a directly-elected president of Europe.  The Minister of State indicated that co-operation between all the political blocs is good.  Is this view shared with the other political groupings?  Is there discussion of how such a directly-elected role would play out with European Commissioners?  Would they be directly elected or appointed?  Would countries such as Ireland be at risk of losing a Commissioner?</p><p>  The issue of eurocrats and technocrats generates considerable negative publicity.  In the aftermath of recent economic reforms, most people accept there is a democratic deficit in Europe.  How does the Minister of State expect the institutions to develop?  Will a Commissioner become a Minister and so forth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-07a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013050700005#D00300"><p>I will make a few comments before asking the Minister of State to conclude.  The notion that there is a democratic deficit is overstated as the enhanced role of the European Parliament has created a more direct connection to citizens.  This is evident in today's visit to Brussels by the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste to discuss and negotiate the multi-annual financial framework with the European Parliament.  To echo the point raised by Deputy Dara Murphy, there is a concern that smaller states such as Ireland would lose out if citizens participated in direct elections of all office holders.  A fine balance must be struck when trying to re-engineer or reconfigure current structures.  I have no doubt the Minister of State has a keen interest in this issue.</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to the issue of scrutiny.  A number of members of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny believed the approach taken was not the best way to scrutinise EU legislation.  It is appropriate, therefore, that scrutiny is being done by sectoral committees.  I am not certain, however, that Irish parliamentarians are sufficiently well equipped to perform this task.  This deficiency could be addressed in a number of ways.  We could change the electoral system or equip and resource politicians to manage the problem.  However, I am not sure the Oireachtas undertakes sufficient scrutiny of domestic legislation, not to speak of European legislation.  This is as true of the Government side as it is of the Opposition side because far too much of our work is based on clientelism and the process of being re-elected.  We must implement internal reforms before we start demanding more in the European context.  This is an ongoing debate which I am sure will continue not only in this committee but elsewhere.  </p></speech>

While I cannot begin to try to predict the future of Bulgaria, Italy, Slovenia, Spain or France, what is clear is that it would be inaccurate to suggest the crisis is behind us.  A great deal of work still needs to be done at European Union level.  If I had my way, the first step taken at EU level would be to implement the commitment made nearly a year ago to break the link between sovereign debt and bank debt.  Until we do this, the precariousness that exists in certain member states, which places the entire eurozone in a precarious position, will continue.  We must break the link between sovereign and bank debt.</p><p>  Ireland occupies a position on the high moral ground, as it were, because we have implemented the requirements of the troika programme admirably and taken all the pain asked of us, although I do not doubt the steps we took were necessary.  We recapitalised and stabilised our banks, for example, and are in a strong position to advocate for developments at eurozone and EU level which other countries, owing to their economic difficulties, may not believe they can do persuasively or with authority.  Ireland must take a lead on this issue.  This is what we are trying to do but to fully realise this objective Europe must put in place all the elements of banking union.  The Irish Presidency has been taking a lead in this matter and has made considerable progress to date.  We secured an agreement to establish a single supervisory mechanism, for example, although it would be wrong to believe this new arrangement will provide a solution to the crisis.  The new mechanism is only a start as we must also put in place a resolution mechanism and Europe-wide guarantee scheme.  We are on the right path and the process is being driven by the Irish Presidency.  I hope we will continue to lead and drive this agenda beyond the Presidency because there is no substitute to the current approach, even if it will be politically difficult for many countries to pursue it.</p></speech>
