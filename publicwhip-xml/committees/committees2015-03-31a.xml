    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Flaherty" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015033100002#F00200"><p>Animal Health Ireland, AHI, wishes to thank the Chairman for the invitation to today&rsquo;s meeting and looks forward to the opportunity of engaging with members on this, the fourth occasion on which we have appeared before the committee.  In my opening statement I wish to outline for members the key aspects of the Animal Health Ireland Strategic Plan for the period 2015-2017, and to summarise progress being made in two of the major programmes for which we are responsible &ndash; the eradication of bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, and the control of dairy cow mastitis.</p> <p>  It is most appropriate that AHI is meeting with the committee today, 31 March 2015, the day on which the milk quota regime comes to an end.  The ending of restrictions on the volume of milk supplied by our dairy sector represents the beginning of a once in a generation opportunity for that sector particularly, but also the agrifood sector more generally, which has already demonstrated its resilience and its ability to achieve strong growth, even in the face of recession.  Animal Health Ireland is proud of the contribution it has made to improving the profitability, sustainability and competitiveness of the sector in recent years and looks forward to continuing this contribution over the period of the current strategic plan and beyond.</p> <p>  This strategic plan, which has been developed following intensive consultations with our stakeholders, is the second such plan developed by AHI since our establishment in 2009.  It is the outcome of an extensive consultation with our stakeholders, which was undertaken in the second half of last year, a report of which is available on our website.  In conjunction with the imminent publication of the strategic plan, Animal Health Ireland will also shortly publish a document summarising the extent to which we have delivered on the commitments set out in the previous plan. </p> <p>  The work programme in this strategic plan is significant and ambitious.  However, I believe that much more can and needs to be done to further improve animal health in Ireland; that with a more robust and expanded funding model, the return on investment which AHI has demonstrated to date can be extended into new areas, such as a programme to improve fertility in the national beef herd or the establishment of animal health programmes for species other than cattle.  As a food exporting nation, we should aspire to stand in the first rank of countries worldwide in terms of our animal health status, and I am convinced that, properly leveraged, the animal health infrastructure, both public and private, which has been developed in this country, can enable Ireland to achieve such a goal.</p> <p>  The strategic plan identifies four priorities for Animal Health Ireland in the period 2015-17.  The first of these, in fulfilment of the substantial commitments which we have already made to our stakeholders, is to "ensure the continued delivery of the priority programmes and the other work areas identified in the 2012-2014 strategic plan".  Priority two, reflecting the concerns of the board and many stakeholders in relation to the manner in which our activities are financed, is to "review the fitness for purpose of the funding model and reconfigure as appropriate".  The third priority, related to the second, is to "review the fitness for purpose of the corporate governance structures, including the process of appointment to the board, and to reconfigure as appropriate".  Finally, priority four, which takes account of the need to bring additional resources to bear in support of the beef sector, in particular, is to "develop new programmes to support the beef sector and strengthen the horizontal supports to all programmes".</p> <p>  While priority one &ndash; the delivery of our existing core programmes &ndash; will be dealt with more substantively later in this opening statement, and will undoubtedly be the subject of further questions by members, I wish to outline some of the thinking behind the other three priorities articulated in the strategic plan.</p> <p>  Priority two is to review the fitness for purpose of the funding model and reconfigure as appropriate.  The stakeholder consultation exercise highlighted that the current funding model, which is largely based on subscriptions provided by private sector organisations and the partial matching of these by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, is highly vulnerable to the loss or withdrawal of funding by individual stakeholders.  The loss of even relatively modest amounts of stakeholder income, amplified by the consequent loss of matched departmental funding, would have a dramatic impact on AHI&rsquo;s ability to sustain current programmes and hence on the viability of the organisation itself.  Concrete proposals for the development of a revised, sustainable funding model for Animal Health Ireland will be developed by the board, in consultation with stakeholders.  These proposals will be presented to members, in conjunction with proposals on revised governance arrangements, at a special general meeting, which will take place in 2015.</p> <p>  Priority three is to review the fitness for purpose of the corporate governance structures, including the process of appointment to the board, and reconfigure as appropriate.  Following consideration of the outcome of the stakeholder consultation exercise, the board of AHI has undertaken, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and other members and stakeholders, to bring forward proposals aimed at further strengthening and ensuring the continued fitness for purpose of the corporate governance of the organisation.  These proposals will establish the competencies and skills mix required of directors, embody best practice in terms of corporate governance, bring greater transparency to the appointments process and provide a mechanism to allow for members&rsquo; voices to be directly represented on the board.  A discussion document detailing the proposed new arrangements will be circulated to members in the first half of 2015.  The alterations to the articles of association required to give effect to the proposed changes will be presented to members, in conjunction with proposals on revised funding arrangements, at a special general meeting, which will take place in 2015.  </p> <p>  Priority four is to develop new programmes to support the beef sector and strengthen the horizontal supports to all programmes.  In this regard, Animal Health Ireland is pleased to be able to highlight to members the establishment of a new programme &ndash; Beef HealthCheck &ndash; which is being developed by AHI, Meat Industry Ireland and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Veterinary Ireland.  The objectives of this programme are twofold - to develop tools to assist farmers and their veterinary practitioners to control losses due to liver fluke and pneumonia through capture, analysis and reporting of abattoir data; and to contribute to the development by ICBF of economic breeding indexes that incorporate health and disease data.</p> <p>  The objective of this programme is to eradicate bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, from the national cattle herd by year end 2020.  BVD is a disease of considerable economic importance to Irish farmers; a cost-benefit analysis commissioned by AHI places the losses associated with this infection at &euro;102 million per annum. </p> <p>  The compulsory phase of the programme, which began in 2013 following a successful pilot in 2012, is divided into two three-year periods.  In the first of these, running from 2013-2015, the emphasis is on tissue tag testing of newborn calves, using the modified national identity tag, with follow-up testing by blood sample and tag testing, as required.  The second period, running from 2016-2018, will see the emphasis switching to monitoring, by means of targeted blood and milk sampling, in addition to continued tag testing.  The level of farmer engagement with the programme has been very strong, with in excess of 99% of all registered calves having been tested for BVD each year since the programme entered the compulsory phase. </p> <p>  My colleague, David Graham, will be happy to take members through the details of the progress being made in this programme.  However, to briefly summarise here; the incidence of PI calves has fallen by 31% from 0.67%, 13,942, of all calves born in 2013 to 0.46%, 9,762, in 2014.  To date in 2015, the PI birth rate has fallen further to 0.30%.</p> <p>  The CellCheck programme is the national mastitis control programme, which is co-ordinated and facilitated by Animal Health Ireland, and which is being developed and delivered in partnership with industry bodies representing farmers, processors, service providers and Government.  The objective of the programme is to facilitate the Irish dairy industry to continue to improve milk quality, such that 75% of the milk supplied by Irish farmers will have a somatic cell count, SCC, of 200,000 cells per millilitre or less by year end 2020.</p> <p>  High somatic cell counts, which are an indicator of mastitis, have a major impact on the profitability of dairy farmers and dairy processors.  Teagasc research shows that there is a very significant inverse correlation between SCC and net farm profit.  On the basis of this research, it can be stated that the average dairy farmer can improve net profitability by at least 1 cent per litre by improving mastitis control to reduce SCC to achievable and sustainable levels.  Put another way, the research shows that a reduction from >400,000 to <100,000 cells per millilitre would lead to an increase in overall returns to farmer and processor together of 4.8 cent per litre.  A 10% reduction in national cell count would be expected to yield &euro;37.6 million savings for the Irish dairy industry.</p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Finola McCoy, will be pleased to provide further details of this programme to members.  However, I wish to highlight at this point that data from milk recording herds shows that the proportion of these with a SCC of less than 200,000 cells per millilitre, which had fluctuated between approximately 25% and 35% of all milk recording herds in the period 2004-2010, has shown a marked improvement in the period since then, to stand at approximately 55% in 2014.</p><p>I take the opportunity to acknowledge publicly the steadfast support, financial and otherwise, which we have received from our members and stakeholders in the period since our establishment.  Without it, we would have been unable to deliver on behalf of the industry.  As CEO, I thank the chairman and directors of AHI on whose good counsel and guidance I have always been able to rely.  We are prepared to answer any questions the committee has on the opening statement or any other aspect of our business.</p></speech>

It indicates the level of progress that has been made by virtue of the establishment of Animal Health Ireland with regard to the two diseases with which it has initially been charged.  There is plenty of ground for other work programmes including in relation to beef.  I call Deputy Martin Ferris.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015033100002#G00300"><p>I thank Mr. O'Flaherty for his presentation and commend him on the work that has been done.  When it is laid out in front of one and one sees what has been achieved, one is very encouraged.  I am very complimentary to AHI on that.  I note in particular BVD and the 99% take-up by farmers in that regard.  It shows what a tremendous effect one gets from that kind of co-operation in trying to eradicate disease.  I note also liver fluke and pneumonia have been checked and so forth.  The thing that worries me is AHI's financial situation.  It is very dependent on stakeholders to continue its work.  I do not mean anything derogratory in asking who the stakeholders are.  Is Mr. O'Flaherty referring to farming organisations, meat factories and people who have a vested interest in the sector?  If that is the case, I note the necessity for an organisation to be independent.  Being dependent for funding on people who are stakeholders can send the wrong message.  AHI is working in the context of the new phase we are entering following the abolition of quota and the potential that has to deliver.  Many of us are a little concerned about how it will work out and what can be delivered if enough people stay in the industry.  AHI's independence is hugely important in that context, in particular its financial independence.  Mr. O'Flahery might respond on that.  Mr. O'Flaherty also said AHI has proposed changes to the members in conjunction with proposals for a revised funding arrangement at a special general meeting in 2015.  Can he elaborate on that?</p> <p>  It was stated that one could increase one's profitability by at least 1 cent per litre with proper controls and the reduction of mastitis and through SCC control.  That looks very encouraging.  Is there more scope to improve in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015033100002#G00400"><p>I thank the members of Animal Health Ireland for attending today.  Deputy Ferris has hit on an observation I had regarding priority 2.  AHI's funding appears to be on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  Mr. O'Flaherty said it receives matching funding from the Department.  Do the witnesses consider that AHI should be 100% supported by the Department rather than having to rely on the stakeholders whom Deputy Ferris has asked Mr. O'Flahery to identify?  We are not saying it is the case here, but when people from an outside body are providing funding, they may have a conflict of interest.  Animal Health Ireland is a fine organisation and the work it has done in many areas can only be commended, but how is it funded?  Is it 60% from the stakeholders and 40% from the Department?  Do the witnesses feel it should be 100% supported by the Department so that the stakeholders are left out of this?</p><p>My other observation is in relation to BVD.  I compliment AHI on BVD which was a scourge in the beef herd, especially for those buying weanlings in the autumn.  For some unknown reason, one could find one dead in a house that was down to BVD at a later stage, particularly where an animal came under stress.  How can it be that only 99% of all registered calves are tested?  If an animal is to be tagged, one must use BVD to tag.  What happens the other 1% that are not tested for BVD?</p><p>I compliment AHI on CellCheck.  The figures set out on profitability are there for all farmers to see.  The fact that 55% now stand at under 200,000 cells per millilitre is a testament to AHI's advice and the husbandry of farmers.  It is something we must continue.  As milk quotas disappear after tomorrow, it will be all about being competitive.  To be competitive, one must use best practice.  Best practice is about doing things most efficiently.  This is the advice AHI has given farmers in relation to CellCheck.  It has been more than helpful and it must be continued.</p><p>The funding issue is the main one.  As a committee, we recognise the work AHI has done and its neutrality.  It is important that there does not appear to be a conflict of interest from stakeholders.  Should the Department provide the organisation with 100% of its funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015033100002#G00500"><p>I thank Mr. O'Flaherty for his presentation and apologise for being late.  I also have a couple of questions on funding.  Mr. O'Flaherty said that under priority 2 of the strategic review, AHI is highly vulnerable to the loss or withdrawal of funding by individual stakeholders.  Has there been an ongoing level of withdrawal of funding by stakeholders that has given rise to concern?  Do stakeholders attempt to exert any influence on the type of programmes AHI develops and use funding as leverage in that regard?</p> <p>  On priority 3, the review of corporate governance structures has been flagged through the consultation with stakeholders.  What has been the nature of the concerns that have been flagged on corporate governance?</p> <p>  Priority 4 is linked to the funding issue.  How viable are new programmes if funding is precarious in respect of existing programmes in the context of the reliance on stakeholders?  How sure is AHI that the new scheme can continue based on the funding doubts that exist?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015033100002#G00600"><p>Deputy Pringle referred to new programmes of which the beef health check is an example in conjunction with AHI, Meat Industry Ireland, ICBF and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The Food Safety Authority and Teagasc are both funded by the Department.  Do they collaborate with AHI, if not financially?  If one is looking at the overall expansion of a healthier herd and food production system in the interests of reputation and profit, they are the other key stakeholders that should be involved.  While it is in the report, Mr. O'Flaherty did not mention Johne's disease in his presentation.  Does Mr. O'Flaherty have any comments on that?  Deputy Ferris and I were at the first meeting with the committee during the last D&aacute;il when Johne's diseases was predicted as something to watch.  Certainly, it is coming down the line.  Does Mr. O'Flaherty have any observations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Flaherty" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015033100002#H00100"><p>I will address the Chairman&rsquo;s questions first and then take the others in order.  He asked about the level of collaboration with Teagasc and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  There have been and continue to be very strong linkages between Animal Health Ireland and Teagasc.  Staff from Teagasc are on many of our technical working groups.  We have a technical working group that underpins each of our programmes.  In addition to making a contribution on the technical working groups, Teagasc provides considerable support, particularly regarding the economics of animal health.  Therefore, the work on cell counts, which I referred to, was undertaken as part of Teagasc's research programme.</p> <p>  Teagasc is a major interested party in regard to the CellCheck programme.  It provides specific funding in this regard.  My colleague, Ms Finola McCoy, was formerly an employee of Teagasc and is now employed by Animal Health Ireland.  Across a range of issues, we have an extremely good, close working relationship with Teagasc.  Yesterday, we met the director.  We are continually exploring areas of further collaboration between the two organisations and we are very happy on that front.</p> <p>  We have not to date had any structured engagement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  However, we are aware that a new CEO has recently been appointed to the authority.  We certainly would seek to reach out to that individual and look for areas of collaboration.  An obvious area for collaboration is antimicrobial resistance.  It is an area of interest common to both organisations.  We will pick up on it with the new CEO in short course.</p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. David Graham, to respond to the query on Johne&rsquo;s disease.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Graham" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015033100002#H00200"><p>On Johne&rsquo;s disease, following extensive discussion by the technical working group and subsequently the implementation group, drawn from industry representatives, we initiated a pilot national dairy programme.  It started at the end of 2013 but 2014 was really its first year.  The implementation group has, in the past month or so, taken the decision to continue with that programme through this year.  The initial intention when it was launched was to recruit some 1,000 dairy herds to the programme.  That was quickly passed and a revised target of 2,000 herds was agreed upon.  We ended up with some 1,900 herd owners submitting applications and agreeing to the various terms and conditions of the programme.</p> <p>  The programme has three elements: a testing element; an on-farm risk assessment element, which evaluates the likelihood of management and husbandry practices to control or contribute to the spread of the organism within the herd; and a process of herd categorisation to compute the degree of confidence we have that a herd, although it tests negative, is genuinely free from infection, based on some of the limitations of the tests that are available.</p> <p>  We are very encouraged by the uptake in the first year of the programme.  There was considerable work to get it going, including through the training of veterinary practitioners to carry out the on-farm risk assessments.  We recently completed a survey of participants in the programme.  Certainly, there was very positive feedback on the range of elements, including the risk assessment or the "ramp", as it is referred to.  We are just in the process of delivering a similar survey to the practitioners who are involved in the programme.  As with bovine viral diarrhoea, for example, the goal is to learn the relevant lessons and apply them to the refinement of the programme for the incoming year.  That is the current position.  We now have a significant body of data and we are working through it to analyse trends and determine what it tells us.</p></speech>

It should be remembered that if Johne&rsquo;s disease is to be dealt with there is no compensation package.  There are protocols in place for bovine viral diarrhoea, and there are obviously protocols for tuberculosis and brucellosis.  Is the culling of animals a matter on which the delegates hope to engage with the Department&rsquo;s agriculture officials with a view to forming some sort of programme to reduce the incidence of Johne&rsquo;s disease or eliminate it?  Is that the overall goal?</p></speech>

My answer touches on a couple of the questions asked by members.  All the programmes have a range of beneficiaries.  Very often, the farmer is the primary beneficiary of the control, but not the exclusive beneficiary.  Certainly in the case of Johne's disease, the farmer benefits absolutely from controlling the disease but other parties do also.  Milk processors benefit but one could also argue that the State benefits at some level because we are controlling the risk from a potential pathogen in the food chain.  Where there is a range of beneficiaries, for the programme to be sustainable one has to come up with an equitable model of cost sharing.  Inevitably, that will involve a contribution by farmers, processors and the State.</p> <p>  One of the distinctions between the tuberculosis eradication programme and the Johne's disease programme might be that the culling of a Johne's disease-infected animal, or an animal that tests positive, could be undertaken within the course of the normal management of the farm.  It would not necessarily require the immediate removal of the animal.  It is largely about controlling the risk that the cow represents to her calf or the other calves in the group.  The programme will provide tools to the farmer to assist him or her to manage those risks without necessarily triggering an immediate cull of the animal.  Perhaps the Chairman might like to comment on this issue.  As a dairy farmer, he is probably more exposed to the front-end of these programmes than I am.</p></speech>

However, we are very anxious that we do not create a scare in the industry from an issue that could potentially spook the market.  At the same time, we need to have something happen regarding Johne's disease in Ireland.  As a farmer responding to Mr. O&rsquo;Flaherty&rsquo;s prompt, my intention, if the disease were in my herd, would be to manage it out of the herd, to use the information from the programme and scheme to help me to become better at managing the risk around calving time, which is when a spread is most likely to occur, and to manage the animal so she would not rebreed the next year.  I would cull the animal earlier than she would otherwise go in normal circumstances.</p> <p>  Our intention is not to create another programme of compensation for the removal of the animal but certainly a programme with State support, perhaps for the risk assessment on the farm.  I refer to a novel approach rather than compensation for the removal of the animal.  Ultimately, we need to free ourselves from compensating in respect of animals on the farm.  Ultimately, we must get across to the farmers of Ireland that the benefit is healthier herds.  By being as good as or better than any other country, Ireland&rsquo;s reputation in international marketplaces benefits.  That is really the approach.  It is a novel approach to disease control.  It is best captured in the area of Johne's disease by trying to approach the problem in a different way.</p> <p>  Consider the question on governance and change to the board structure.  We inherited the model we have when we were set up by the previous Government.  We are very keen to examine any model with which the industry is more comfortable.  I take the points on potential influence by stakeholders if they are funding us, but equally it is only fair that those making a significant contribution to the finances of the organisation feel they have a voice around the board table.  There is a delicate balance to be struck between not being influenced by the stakeholders regarding what they believe is in their best interest and having the independence we currently enjoy.</p><p>It is a delicate balance.  The point about funding is well made and it is something about which we are very keen.  We are very aware that the current model will not stand an enlarging of our programmes.</p><p> It is to the benefit of the reputation of Ireland that our programme be expanded and that we examine disease eradication programmes in other countries.  At a minimum we must compete with them and even be better than them.  As we enlarge output from the dairy  herd we will become challenged as to how we are dealing with certain diseases.  Significant progress has been achieved but we need to ensure that the programmes are robustly funded so that we do not run into difficulty.  It is good to highlight this point in this forum so that we can get the support of members as we look at enlarging that funding model.</p><p> On the Senator's question as to whether the State should provide 100% of the funding, I think not.  It is good that the industry co-funds as it keeps us on our toes and it keeps us relevant to the needs of the industry.  It keeps us very reactive and in touch with their needs.  No more than moving away from the compensation structure, moving away from a 100% State funding structure is good but we do need the State's involvement.  The State brings an authority and an influence with our stakeholders that we would not otherwise enjoy.  Finding that balance between State involvement and also being funded independently by the industry is something that we probably need to look at.  I favour perhaps a redeployment of the national disease levy that is currently being collected.  A contribution of a very small amount from every animal to the overall funding would be a good model for us to consider.</p></speech>

The pass through of the Department funding of the risk assessment component of the ONAYs programme was included in our accounts for last year.  We characterise it in our accounts as a Department grant.</p> <p>  Stakeholder income of the order of &euro;450,000 or &euro;460,000, comes from the dairy sector.  In reply to Deputy Ferris, the stakeholders on the dairy side are the large processors who account for about 95% of the milk processed in Ireland.  We have recently entered into an agreement with Meat Industry Ireland for significant six-figure funding from them.  We also have the income from the Department.  Whereas we started at a balance of about 50-50 between the Department and the private and sub-private sectors, because there is a cap the Department has fallen behind that 50%.  Therefore, in last year's accounts its subscription represented about 43% of the total subscriber income.  Those other companies I mentioned represent the balance of the 57%.</p> <p>  I will pick up on some of the questions on financing.  I refer to Deputy Ferris's point about the independents and to which the chairman of AHI has alluded.  There would be opportunity for Animal Health Ireland to acquire significant funding from commercial interests within the sector but we have rejected that approach to date.  I will explain.  I refer to the pharmaceutical industry which has a clear interest in some of the programmes and some of the animal remedies side of things.  We have resisted approaching that sector for funding.  We have drawn the entirety of our funding from dairy processors and meat processors.  We have not come under undue influence from any quarter.  In answer to Senator O'Neill, there has been no withdrawal of funding by any stakeholder so we have actually maintained all of the stakeholders from the beginning and in fact, grown the contribution from each of the stakeholders.  While there is certainly a theoretical risk that the current stakeholders might attempt to exercise undue influence I can assure the committee that this has not happened to date.  Animal Health Ireland is very much an evidence-driven body and it could not allow that to happen because we trade on our reputation with farmers and on our advice which is independent and science-based.  We will not allow that to be compromised in any way.</p> <p>  As to the evolution of the funding over the period I would concur with the AHI chairman that it would be inappropriate for the Department to be the 100% funder of Animal Health Ireland because the range of issues which we examine falls into the category of being closer to the private goods end of the spectrum.  One can imagine that diseases like TB, brucellosis and BSE very much fall on the public good end of the spectrum because these diseases have the potential to impact on human health and on the macro-economy whereas many of the diseases and animal health issues that Animal Health Ireland is addressing fall at the private end of the spectrum where the beneficiaries are largely farmers.  It would be inappropriate for the Department or the State to be the 100% funder.  We have probably approached a reasonable balance in the current state of affairs but that is an evolving position.  </p> <p>  Deputy Pringle raised a very good point about the viability of future programmes.  Animal Health Ireland has been very careful in the current strategic plan and in the previous plan, to very clearly state what we intend to do.  We have identified three core programmes and we state in the current plan that we will only expand beyond those if we have a robust funding model in place.  We will be sticking to the knitting in terms of what we are already delivering, barring that we get additional resources.</p> <p>  A couple of questions were asked about the CellCheck programme.  My colleague, Finola McCoy will deal with those points.  Deputy Ferris referred to-----</p></speech>

With respect to the calf registrations for 2013, the final outturn figure was 99.6% which left 0.4% where we had not got a result.  The amended legislation requires that any animal born after 1 January 2013 requires a negative result in order to be moved.  Any calves or older animals on farm at this stage that have not been tested in compliance with the legislation, cannot be traded and they cannot leave the farm.  The 0.4% missing from the 2013 data set represents animals who died as calves.  The calf may have died before it was tagged or maybe the initial sample was empty and it had died before the re-test.  We are aware of a very small number of herds which have not fully complied with the programme and the Department is in the process of addressing that issue with those non-participants but typically it is a very small number of herds and very small numbers of animals within those herds.</p></speech>

The figures that have been presented by the CEO show that Irish farmers, on average, stand to gain an extra 1 cent per litre through improved udder health.  When we talk about averages, essentially it depends where they are starting from.  In other words, if a farm has a herd with a cell count of 350,000, if they aim to reduce that to 250,000 there will be a gain of probably about 1 cent per litre.  If they start at 250,000 and their target is to reach 150,000, the gain will be even greater.  It is probably about 1.5 cent per litre.  Depending on the starting point, there are various increments of opportunity in terms of financial gain.  The bottom line is almost all farmers in Ireland stand to gain from improved udder health.  That can be achieved through very simple practices and measures.  There is no miracle solution and there is no quick fix but it is about attention to detail and focus on everyday routines and practices.  They are the messages that we present, and that the science would stand behind from the cell check programme, through all of the resources and through farmer workshops.  We have five simple practical messages that all workshop participants can explore and use in their own milking practices and they are the ways in which farmers will achieve that extra gain.  Where the gain is coming from is primarily through increased production.  When an animal has a higher cell count, it is because she has an infection in a quarter, and because of that infection she cannot produce as much milk as she is genetically capable of.  If we keep infection out of the equation she will produce to her full potential and that is where the majority of that extra gain is from.</p></speech>

We have Professor Michael Doherty, professor of veterinary medicine in UCD; Joe Collins from the Irish Dairy Board; Gerard Brickley, a dairy farmer who was one of the executives of Bord Bia; John O'Sullivan, a dairy farmer from Cork, who is chairman of ICBF; Robin Talbot, a beef farmer from Laois; myself, a dairy farmer from Longford; and Dr. Sean Brady, who I think the members of the committee know.  They are the seven.</p> <p>  We have put ourselves forward for election or removal, whichever is the appropriate, and to date that offer has not been taken up.  There is some pressure from the farm organisations and Meat Industry Ireland to have somebody on the board.  Equally, there is an alternate view from some of the other stakeholders that we would find ourselves enlarging the board substantially if we were to put most of the major funders around the board table.  My view is that we have avoided having political debates around the board table.  We are concerned about output and technical advice to farmers and the science.  We are hesitant to change the model without necessarily changing the funding model in conjunction with that.  I think the most appropriate thing would be to change the funding model in conjunction with changing the governance or the representation model around the board.  What we do is we keep the science and then we bring it to the industry and at implementation level the agri-politicians have their cut and thrust as to how to implement it.  I contend that that model is working very very well.  </p> <p>  Maybe we will have to have a serious look at how we are structured as a board.  I do not necessarily want to go into how much each individual organisation gives.  It is available for people to study.  There are conflicting views as to how the board is best structured.  Some believe that the current model works well.  I share that view.  Otherwise, I feel that there is, as I said earlier, a legitimate claim by some of the very large funding stakeholders that they need a voice around the board table.  I am concerned by the point raised by some members of the committee that our independence is being compromised slightly.  To date, it has not.  </p></speech>

When there are people who have that influence on the board whether real or otherwise, it creates a perception and it can be very damaging to the confidence that people would have in the board as it is working and constituted now.  I am saying this because if there was somebody from the meat processors on the board they would have influence even though the producers are fighting a battle with them over price and so forth.  It would send a very bad message because of the perception that is there.  What is needed is independence.  The importance of it being independent is paramount, in order to have that credibility.</p></speech>

If Mr. Magan looks at this committee's pre-legislative scrutiny of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill, which proposed amendments to the structure of Horse Racing Ireland, or if he looks at the board of Teagasc on the other hand, because they are probably the most comparable, he will see that there are representatives from industry but it is counterbalanced.  For instance, if Animal Health Ireland was to have representatives from Meat Industry Ireland and ICOS on its board, that would have to be balanced with representatives from the farming organisations.  As it stands, the chairman of Animal Health Ireland is a farmer.  When one looks at the structure of the board it is made up of experts in the field of health.  If one widens out the remit one is widening out what the board has to consider.  I think that is why the technical working groups are there to deal with that.  I think the biggest risk is not the risk of reputation being compromised but the risk of losing focus on what the core work of what Animal Health Ireland should be.  Everybody has a stake in this because it boils down to reputation and profit, basically.  That is what it boils down to for everybody.</p></speech>

The industry had been talking for some time about having something like a structured animal health grouping but like a lot of other great ideas somebody needs to be the catalyst to make it happen.  The Department took on that role and decided to develop a structure and they went to the industry and asked if it would accept it.  Initially, to get things moving it accepted the existing structure.  There are now negotiations to change that structure and I would like to put on record that I have no opposition or objection <i>per se</i>to any of the farm organisations or Meat Industry Ireland being on the board but I feel that it needs to be thought through very carefully and it should only be in conjunction, for example, with the delivery of another funding model.  I think we need the agreement of farm organisations.  For example, if we were to have some kind of a levy, I believe it would be impossible to get a levy through the farming industry without having its approval and I would equally accept that that approval should probably come with a seat on the board.  I take on board the points made by the members of the committee and I think it is something that we need to be careful about but, as I say, I do not want it to go out from here that I have an objection to anybody else sitting around the board table but I feel the current model is delivering.  We should be judged on delivery and I think delivery since we were formed a relatively short time ago has been pretty impressive and I would also suggest that there is more to be done.</p><p>Having the debate with the industry at implementation level is appropriate, but as I say let us see how things evolve.  Meat Industry Ireland was really good to come on board and provide funding because it was not part of the original agreement on the setting up of Animal Health Ireland, AHI, by the State with the industry.  That was hard won work on behalf of the CEO of AHI, in particular to get it on board.  We need some quiet discussion with the industry as to what is in their best interest because we have conflicting views.  We are open to change provided it makes things better.</p></speech>

Bord Bia and the Irish Dairy Board have the job of marketing the product when everything has been satisfied.</p> <p>  The mission of Animal Health Ireland is very simple.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  If they achieve healthier animal status, be it in the dairy, beef or other sector the system is working.  There is an old saying, "if it ain't broke don't fix it".  I would be careful of change, because in an industry worth of the order of &euro;10 billion -  depending on whom one talks and listens to - an expenditure of &euro;1.5 million or &euro;2 million on dealing with animal health issues seems like very good value for money.  I think we could all accept that.  The reputation of the work of Animal Health Ireland has never been questioned.  That is the reason the joint committee sees the value of bringing the witnesses from Animal Health Ireland before it to put on public record the work of AHl so that people understand what it has done.

They were based on the fact that people from the LGBT community in certain countries are not afforded proper and equal rights.  Also, a large number of farming representative groups in these countries had major difficulties with the way these trade agreements were to be implemented.  A massive part of these trade agreements is enforced liberalisation, which will make it very difficult for many local farmers and agricultural organisations.  I propose that this committee send a letter to our own Minister, as a member of the Council of Europe, in an effort to highlight those concerns.</p></speech>

I am joined this afternoon by my colleague, Eileen Bentley, who is our entrepreneurship manager, and by Colette Twomey, the managing director of Clonakilty Food Company.</p> <p>  As many members of the committee will know, Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board, provides a link between the Irish food, drink and horticulture industry and existing and potential customers throughout the world.  Bord Bia's mission is to drive, through market insight and in partnership with industry, the commercial success of a world-class Irish food and drink industry.  Over the next five minutes or so, I would like to share with you a brief overview of our strategy, in which I will feature a number of our key services for both small and large companies.  I will, as requested, also touch on Food Academy.  I will close with a case study of an indigenous success story - that of Colette Twomey from Clonakilty Food Company, owner of the Clonakilty brand of black pudding. </p> <p>  Bord Bia's current strategy is built on four pillars.  The first is Origin Green, which has as its ambition for Ireland to be a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink.  We are currently well on our way on this journey, with 431 companies now signed up to our Origin Green initiative, which was launched in 2012.  Today, almost 80% of our exports are now supplied by Origin Green verified companies.  Our plan going forward is to have 100% of our exports from companies on the Origin Green journey by the end of 2016.  This initiative is a world first and continues to gain momentum as it meets the needs of our key customers throughout the globe.  The second pillar of our strategy is enhancing competitiveness, under which we focus on the provision of insight, education and competency support programmes for companies and executives in the food industry.  Market and consumer insight are at the heart of our work, with our research, insight and strategic branding specialists acting as the voice of the consumer.  Our mission is to use consumer and market insight to drive business growth for our clients, whether smaller startups or well-established businesses.  Within this pillar we also invest in entrepreneurs through Food Works, a joint initiative undertaken with Teagasc and Enterprise Ireland, as we look to support the next generation of high-potential food startups.  Attracting the best talent to work in the food industry is also relevant, and through our partnership with Smurfit Business School our fellowship programme is succeeding in attracting more than 500 applications for just 20 places each year.</p> <p>  Under our third pillar, enhancing exports, we look to build case studies similar to that of Clonakilty black pudding and others in our export markets, supporting our clients with commercially focused programmes, be that through our network of overseas offices, our participation at over 15 international trade shows annually or the creation of events such as our recent Marketplace International event.  Over the course of last week we hosted more than 400 international buyers, culminating in our largest ever speed-dating event last Thursday, in which more than 4,500 meetings were scheduled for the 530 attending buyers and 185 exhibiting Irish companies.  Both large and small enterprises and new and well established businesses attended this event, from Glenilen to Glanbia, from Aryzta to Boutique Bake, and from the recently established SynerChi Kombucha to the seventh-generation business Flahavan's.  We expect over &euro;30 million to be written from this event, leading to many more opportunities in years to come.</p> <p>  Our fourth and final pillar focuses on the creation of a vibrant home market, with activities such as quality assurance programmes and events such as Bloom and our small business open day.  In the last number of years, local food has undergone a significant shift in importance, becoming central to both consumer needs and supermarket strategies.  Bord Bia's PERIscope research from 2013 indicated that Ireland is second only to France in terms of the importance of local food to shoppers.  Some 50% of consumers in Ireland are buying local food on a weekly basis and eight out of ten consumers believe that local food results in higher-quality products.  </p> <p>  Ireland's food producers are ideally positioned to maintain and build local food opportunities, and Bord Bia's Vantage programme has been designed to support the smaller producers in this process.  Launched in 2007, Bord Bia Vantage, which serves more than 700 SMEs with a turnover of less than &euro;3.5 million, is a key platform that enables owners and managers to access best practice resources, expertise and processes to help build their respective markets.  It consists of three pillars.  Vantage Point, a dedicated website for small food businesses, was re-launched in 2015 and is a core part of the small business service, with almost 50,000 visits annually.  Vantage Plus, the second pillar, is a programme designed to develop small companies' capabilities and competencies in the key areas of business and market development.  Supporting Vantage Plus is the new Food Academy Start programme.  Food Academy is a collaborative new initiative from Bord Bia, the local enterprise offices and SuperValu, which was launched in September 2013.  The aim of the academy is to provide integrated best practice supports specific to food companies as they progress on their growth journey from startup to national distribution and export.  At entry level, or Food Academy Start, the aim is to create a level playing field of food marketing knowledge across all counties and to deliver consistent information to companies in local areas as they begin their journeys as food producers.  The Start programme is delivered by the local enterprise offices, supported by SuperValu, which nominates a SuperValu store manager in each county to participate on the programme and provide retailer insights and expertise.  Bord Bia has designed the full course content of Start.  By the end of 2014, Food Academy had reached more than 200 participants across almost the entire LEO network, with almost 100 participants securing product trials in 150 participating SuperValu stores.  In November 2014, Food Academy Advance began, with 30 of the graduate participants of Food Academy Start.  This programme, jointly run by Bord Bia and SuperValu, aims to take participants on a supplier development journey with SuperValu that will take businesses from local to regional and eventually national supplier status.  In addition to the Food Academy programme, many producers have participated on other Bord Bia supplier development programmes, such as the Tesco Retail programme and the Ireland Food Service programme with Compass Ireland.  The final pillar of the Vantage suite is Vantage Promote, which includes all business development and public relations activities for the promotion of the small business and speciality sectors.  One of the key vehicles for the promotion of the sector is the annual artisan food market at Bloom.  Now in its eighth year, the artisan food market is an established feature of the food village in Bloom.  Adjacent to the food market is the Bloom Inn, where 14 craft whiskey, beer and cider producers showcase their products over the course of the Bloom festival.  In 2014, 106,000 visitors attended the show over the five days. </p> <p>  The final area I will touch on today is funding.  Funding for marketing is always a challenge for companies.  To help businesses with a turnover of less than &euro;3.5 million to improve their marketing techniques and capabilities, the Bord Bia marketing assistance programme provides financial support to food, drink and horticulture companies.  In 2014, 186 companies were approved grants to a total of &euro;976,000.  Additionally, in 2015, Bord Bia launched a new Step Change fund, valued at &euro;400,000.  This grant scheme is aimed at companies with a turnover between &euro;100,000 and &euro;5 million which are embarking on a new project to take their business to the next level.  In 2015, Bord Bia expects the Step Change programme will benefit at least eight high-potential Irish businesses with individual grants of up to &euro;50,000.  As the members of the committee will see from this brief presentation, there is a lot happening in the food industry at present.  Over the past five years we have also enjoyed a strong flow of new entrants into our industry, which is why there are so many new programmes for startup companies.</p> <p>  In the committee's letter of invitation, it asked that I be accompanied by an entrepreneur, and in fulfilment of that request I invited Colette Twomey to join me.  Ms Twomey will briefly bring the committee through the story of her company and the supports that she received along the way, and share with the committee her insights from the eyes of an entrepreneur.</p></speech>

To this day it remains true to its original recipe from the 1880s.  Starting with my husband in our local butcher shop in 1976, and servicing Clonakilty, today our customer base extends outside the local area, through national distribution in both retail and food service.  Today, after almost 40 years in the business, I am proud to say that we are the leading pudding producer in Ireland, producing over 20 tonnes of product per week.</p><p>We use only Irish beef and pork in our pudding, sausages, rashers and bacon joints.  We have approximately 25% of the total retail market in pudding.  I am the sole owner of the company and the only person who knows the secret spice mix for our famous Clonakilty black pudding.  We are conscious of our role in the local community, sourcing ingredients in Ireland.  In addition to all our beef and pork being Irish, Flahavan's has been supplying us with pinhead oats for over 40 years.  These oats give our puddings that lovely crumbly texture.</p><p> Today we have 48 staff and have plans to return production to Clonakilty from the factory in Cork.  We have national distribution in Ireland and our growth ambitions are in the export markets, where our range is available in the UK, mainland Europe and Australia.  Some of the key accounts in the UK include Selfridges, Budgens, Tesco, Morrisons, Asda, Waitrose and Sainsbury.</p><p> We have received a lot of support from the State and from colleagues in the food industry to help us get to where we are.  Bord Bia supported us by participating in tastings around the country, and these proved to be a fantastic launch pad.  Since then, we have participated in many of the programmes that Ms McCarthy mentioned, and we have benefited strongly.  Today, we are members of the Bord Bia brand forum, and if I cannot attend I always have one of my team attend.  The access to insight and best practice is unequalled at the forum.  We were also assisted with early export attempts when Bord Bia held our hands through the challenges a first-time exporter faces, and we continue to participate in the UK support programme.  In addition, through the fellowship programme we were able to broaden our footprint as far away as Australia.</p><p> Most recently, we started in the Digital Food Hub to help us communicate our message and brand more strongly in the digital age.  Last week, we participated in the Bord Bia flagship marketplace international event, where we hosted 18 buyer meetings over the course of one day.  Enterprise Ireland has supported me in my personal journey, most recently through the leadership programme.  I learned a lot from the academics present and more from the other participating food practitioners.  The food industry is an exciting one and I am delighted that in recent years it is getting the recognition it deserves as a leading pillar of the economy.  Its contribution to the country, through jobs and investment in rural areas, is unparalleled, and I hope innovative programmes for businesses such as Food Works and Food Academy, as well as events like Marketplace International and the brand forum, remain the focus of organisations such as Bord Bia, local enterprise offices and enterprise boards.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Rimmington" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015033100002#F00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it on the issue of female entrepreneurship, women in the tech industry, skills needs and balanced regional development of entrepreneurial hubs.  We appreciate that the committee is highlighting these important issues, which go overlooked too often.</p> <p>  I am a partner with Kernel Capital, a venture capital firm with offices in Cork, Dublin and Belfast, managing the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital venture funds, which are one of the largest and most active sources of equity finance for technology companies on the island of Ireland.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Denise Sidhu, finance director and partner, and Ms Jayne Brady, partner.  Our backgrounds are in computer science, finance and engineering, respectively.  Kernel has a proactive approach to funding women in business, enabled by the fact that three of the six partners in our firm are female.  We do not back a company because it has a female founder or CEO, but we know from experience that female founders and CEOs can create and run great businesses.</p> <p>  Under the leadership of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s first female CEO, Ms Julie Sinnamon, alongside her colleague Ms Jean O&rsquo;Sullivan, great strides have been made in driving female entrepreneurship in Ireland.  In 2014, almost one in every four companies backed by Enterprise Ireland were led by females, an increase from every one in ten in 2012.  In addition, we have seen a welcome boost in female-focused startup accelerators and business mentoring programmes pioneered by the likes of Paula Fitzsimmons from Cork Institute of Technology, the DCU Ryan Academy and the National Digital Research Centre, NDRC.  However, the reality is that female entrepreneurial potential is still not being tapped to its fullest.  It is still a male-dominated space, with a disproportionately low level of women becoming entrepreneurs in Ireland.  Research in the US has revealed that private technology companies led by women achieve a 35% higher return on investment than those owned by men.  Women are also proving to be better at managing their investment money once they get it.  In contrast, men are 40% more likely to receive funding for their new ventures than those led by women, with only 7% of venture capital money flowing into female-owned businesses, according to MIT.  The picture in Ireland is similar, and I am keenly aware of this because I meet so many courageous founders every day, but not enough of them are women.  I am delighted that we have five great female founders in our portfolio and we are actively seeking to back more of Ireland's most promising female entrepreneurs.</p> <p>  Not only is it important to encourage female entrepreneurs, it is also important to encourage females in senior executive roles, particularly finance and engineering.  Female representation on boards of directors is also very important.  It would be great if our major indigenous companies and multinationals encouraged and possibly incentivised their senior female executives to mentor and take non-executive roles in early-stage companies.  In order to increase the scale of female senior-level engagement, it is important that we create a favourable environment for female-headed enterprises in Ireland and proactively support women to set up businesses.  Being an entrepreneur is hard, but no career worth having is easy.  We need to go a step further and consider support programmes that will suit family schedules and incorporate child care.</p> <p>  Raising the profile of our female entrepreneur role models in Ireland and recognising and celebrating their achievements is also essential.  According to research conducted by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, women are five times more likely to set up their own business as a result of meeting other women entrepreneurs.  The private sector must be encouraged to build upon the platform provided by Enterprise Ireland, and others such as Bord Bia, so that our female entrepreneur role models can share their insight with the next generation of female leaders and convey the benefits of entrepreneurship, such as flexible work hours, which can pay dividends on the family side.</p> <p>  Overall, it is important to point out that venture capital, along with everything else, is a people game.  We invest in intelligent people and reference them from our network, which is a key factor in the industry.  People group with people who are similar to themselves, and female investors are more likely to come across opportunities to invest in females.  Therefore, it is imperative that we proactively encourage women to develop and maintain active networks.  From a venture capital perspective, we also need to see more female CEOs building companies across all sectors, not just where they have a distinct advantage over their male counterparts.  Greater female participation in science, technology, engineering and maths, STEM, would address skills shortages and spur innovation and tech entrepreneurship in Ireland.  Currently, far more male graduates emerge from STEM college courses than female, and only one in four people working in STEM in Ireland are women.  STEM careers are already shaping our future and we need to encourage more young women to get involved in STEM at an early stage.  My colleague Ms Jayne Brady will discuss skills needs in more detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jayne Brady" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015033100002#F00400"><p>As my colleague, Ms Rimmington, mentioned, I am a partner in Kernel Capital.  My background is in electrical and electronic engineering, and prior to taking up this position I held a number of technology leadership positions with multinationals and startups in a variety of global locations, including Europe, China, India and North America.  I am also a past chairman of the Institution of Engineering and Technology in Northern Ireland, which is one of the world&rsquo;s leading professional organisations for the engineering and technology community, with more than 150,000 members in 127 countries.</p> <p>  When I left school to take up a career in engineering, which was almost a quarter of a century ago, the world of technology was a very different place.  There was no Internet and there were no smartphones, and only 1% of the population in Ireland had a mobile phone.  The percentage of female engineers was 7%.  We have seen a massive change in the world of technology, driven by continual innovation.  Now, more than 90% of us own a mobile phone.  Surely the percentage of woman pursuing careers in engineering has also been transformed?  A 2013 report by Engineers Ireland found that men outnumber women in the engineering profession by nearly nine to one, and that male engineers are almost twice as likely to work in senior management compared to female engineers.</p><p>The issues here are as much about improving business performance as about promoting equal opportunities for women.  If we are to meet the grand societal and economic challenges, the solutions exist in the science and maths domain.  One of the greatest natural resources of our economy is our human resource; if we leave 50% of the talent pool of Europe and Ireland behind, we will not be able to meet these challenges.<br/><br/>The business case for managing gender balance in the workplace was well made by Warren Buffett in <i>Fortune Magazine</i>in May 2013:</p><blockquote>For most of our history, women - whatever their abilities - have been relegated to the side-lines.  Only in recent years have we begun to correct that problem....The closer that America comes to fully employing the talents of all its citizens, the greater its output of goods and services will be.  We&rsquo;ve seen what can be accomplished when we use 50% of our human capacity.  If you visualize what 100% can do, you&rsquo;ll join me as an unbridled optimist about America&rsquo;s future.</blockquote><p>At Kernel Capital we are also optimistic about Ireland&rsquo;s future.  We need the best leaders and entrepreneurs, be they male or female, or we are wasting the assets of our economy.  It is crucial that we encourage young girls to take on maths and science courses and to participate in solving these problems of the future.  At Kernel Capital we are willing to play our part to support addressing the gender gap, both in our words and in our actions.  Kernel Capital were recently promoting female entrepreneurship at the inaugural I Wish event in Cork, a partnership between Cork Chamber, it@cork, Cork city and county councils, UCC and CIT, which aimed to inspire and encourage female transition year students to pursue STEM careers.  It was an excellent event that could go country-wide.  It really captured the interest of lots of young women who had previously considered STEM to be a male orientated subject area.  Hopefully, events like these are a step towards normalising STEM achievement for girls in our classrooms.  We are going in the right direction and we need to build upon the momentum already established.<br/><br/>The gender gap does not apply solely to technology sectors; globally in 2014 about 6 % of VC partners were women.  I am delighted that Ireland is bucking this trend with prominent female VCs such as Elaine Coughlan, general partner of Atlantic Bridge; Sinead Heaney, managing director of the BDO development capital fund and 50% female partnership representation in Kernel Capital.<br/><br/>My colleague, Denise Sidhu will discuss balanced regional development of entrepreneurial hubs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Denise Sidhu" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015033100002#G00200"><p>As previously mentioned I am a partner and finance director in Kernel Capital.  At Kernel we are acutely aware of the need to realise sustained and balanced regional growth of entrepreneurial hubs across Ireland.  We strongly welcome the regional focus of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs 2015, aimed specifically at investing in and developing our regions, which is key to Ireland&rsquo;s overall recovery.  Every region in Ireland must leverage its unique competitive strengths to create jobs and broader prosperity.  Being regionally located should no longer be the impediment it once was to addressing international markets.  Connectivity is key and of foremost importance in this regard, particularly for ICT and Internet companies, is the availability of high speed fibre broadband.  We welcome the ambition from Government in this regard.  This ever-increasing regional potential is borne out by the many great initiatives which are regionally located but which address global markets, including investments we have made in areas such as Kilkenny, Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Tralee, Limerick and Galway.  Further developing regional hubs such as these and others is the continuing challenge.</p> <p>  Ultimately, the success of all enterprises is driven by its people and sourcing human capital is a challenge faced by many startups across the country.  We seek to invest in companies which have an unfair advantage over incumbent competitors; regions, likewise, need to look to their own strengths for their unfair advantage, be it skill clusters, quality of life, natural or geographical factors.  Harnessing the collective power of regional stakeholders to drive a region&rsquo;s individual innovation narrative around its own identity and strengths can then be a powerful enabler.</p> <p>  We have strong regional diversity across our portfolio of 75-plus companies, with over 50% located outside of the Dublin region.  Collectively, they employ almost 1,200 people across the island of Ireland, mostly at graduate and postgraduate level and with our assistance, have raised over half a billion euro in equity and debt funding.  We have a track record of generating strong returns with divestments including, FeedHenry, Farran Technology, Straatum, Chip sensors and Stokes Bio, which all brought significant foreign direct investment to those respective regions.  We are strongly committed to achieving even greater regional spread and travel throughout the country meeting entrepreneurs at local level through our  Open Hours events which provide a forum for entrepreneurs to build a relationship with the Kernel Capital team.  To date, we have met with hundreds of companies in locations such as Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Letterkenny and Dundalk.  We are also heavily involved in the eDIGIREGION FP7 programme.  This is a 36 month initiative which aims to increase regional competitiveness via research-driven clusters in the technology domain.</p> <p>  Kernel Capital is the first Irish venture capital firm to be a direct partner of a European framework programme, FP7.  This &euro;2.8 million project is led by Waterford Institute of Technology and our Irish partners are IBEC and the South East Regional Authority.  Together we are working with our EU partners from Hungary, Spain and Romania, and regional stakeholders in the south east, to develop a joint action plan to boost new international business opportunities for SMEs, drive job creation and long term sustainability of the regions in line with the Action Plan for Jobs 2015.</p> <p>  Our key investors, Bank of Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, The University of Limerick Foundation and the University of Galway Foundation, are exceptionally supportive of the work we do in supporting technology companies across Ireland ensuring we are contributing to the vibrancy of the Irish technology scene.  These companies are the beginning of an ecosystem that can eventually lead to larger companies that will create more jobs and fuel the Irish economy.  Together we must ensure that we give our country&rsquo;s leading innovators every chance to succeed.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee on behalf of Ms Rimmington, Ms Brady and all the team at Kernel Capital.</p></speech>

My initial questions are for Bord Bia.  Are all Bord Bia's clients indigenous or does it also represent foreign direct investment companies?  Does it deal with high potential start-ups in the same way that Enterprise Ireland deals with them?  How many companies are dealt with by Bord Bia?  Does it collect statistical information on annual net job creation figures, comparative cost per job and the regional spread of those jobs?  Many of Bord Bia's clients and their suppliers have difficulties with the multiples.  Every supplier will have difficulties with customers at some level but the difficulties with the multiples are quite acute.  I ask Ms Twomey to comment.</p> <p>  On the subject of venture capital I have an understanding that Ireland has a low take-up of venture capital compared to other countries as a form of funding for business.  Is this the case?  What levels of growth have been experienced over recent years because of the crash in banking funding?  I imagine there has been some reawakening in venture capital terms.  How can this be increased?  What is the gender difference with regard to knowledge levels and experience in the area of venture capital and capital markets?  </p> <p>  On the question of female participation in entrepreneurship a mix of issues have been identified as contributing to difficulties such as issues relating to education and STEM.</p><p>Some have related to role models, which have been mentioned here today, and some have been with regard to family friendly entrepreneur supports.  People who have appeared before the committee have mentioned the lack of child care and difficulties with child care as a significant element.  Does discrimination play a role in certain situations with regard to female entrepreneurship today, be that with respect to access to finance or in any other engagement an entrepreneur would have?  Of all the issues we have discussed, what is the biggest issue and what can be done to resolve it?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015033100002#H00300"><p>With regard to our client base, every company that manufactures in the Republic of Ireland is a client base of Bord Bia.  Whether it is foreign direct investment or indigenously owned is irrelevant to us.  What we require is that it is manufacturing here or is working with product that is manufactured here, so if it outsources its production to another manufacturer in Ireland, we will also treat them as a separate client.</p> <p>  We work in partnership with Enterprise Ireland.  We do not have the high potential start-up remit within that space, but when we created Food Works it was to support Enterprise Ireland to create a better flow through of high potential start-ups in food.  When we looked at that area in 2010 our figures showed that there were approximately 100 high potential start-ups coming through every year, be that in medical, pharmacy or technology, but there were only two or three coming from the food industry.  We felt that was challenging because food is our largest indigenous industry.  While traditionally we work with every company on a needs basis, we created a programme specifically for new start-ups under the working title of Food Works.  That is where we gather the intensive programme of help for that.  However, Enterprise Ireland will work with other high potential start-ups outside of Food Works.</p> <p>  Regarding jobs, we do not measure jobs, only exports.  Enterprise Ireland measures the jobs and we would not seek duplication with it.  It has a remit in that area while ours is very much directed at looking for exports from Ireland.  We do that through working with the client companies and also with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to measure where we are going, and that will influence where we put our offices, where we have our spaces and where we have our services focused.  The Deputy will have seen from our strategy that we have a very strong remit both in exports and also in ensuring we have a vibrant home market.  As far as we are concerned, a vibrant home market is an essential feed into getting an export orientated industry as well.</p></speech>

Their remit is to give their customers the best value they can.  We are in the very lucky position that we do not do an own brand, it is just the Clonakilty brand.  My colleagues who are producing an own brand are in a much more competitive situation.  The multiples are the big players and they squeeze on price so it is very competitive, to the point where some smaller or inefficient companies are being squeezed out.  However, that is just the business in which we are involved.</p></speech>

We are currently discussing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  She is not exporting to the United States, and it appears that TTIP could offer a valuable opportunity for her given the Irish diaspora in the US.  Is there a reason for that?  Are there regulatory reasons or is it just not part of her strategy?</p></speech>

The situation with Australia is that we could not export directly to Australia, so we partnered with a small manufacturer there.  We can send our black pudding spice out there and we have a small operation serving the expat community initially.  We have only been in operation for 12 months.  That was a type of pilot scheme for us and we hope to roll it out, and likewise in the United States.  Hopefully, in the meantime, the legislation will be available so we will be able to export into the United States.  With the new plant we are building in Clonakilty we will have the set up to be able to do that.</p></speech>

They can be very challenging.  What we are trying to do with all of the programmes I listed is to work in partnership with retailers.  What often drives the challenge is when there is very little growth in a market and when the only differential is price.  Then the discussion becomes very one dimensional.  What we are trying to do is enhance innovation and create differentiators in the market.  That gives the Irish supply base a much stronger negotiating power because it is now able to move the conversation to the consumer needs that it is addressing.  That statistic I shared with the committee, that the Irish consumer wishes to buy Irish local products, is the reason we have been able to create programmes to help the retailer address that issue by having more Irish products on their shelves.  It is a consumer orientated message it is responding to, rather than just a one dimensional price aspect.  That is an important element.</p></speech>

Ireland has a very strong VC presence, with active fund managers.  Bank of Ireland, which is a cornerstone investor of Kernel Capital, has invested more in Irish VC since 2000 than any other Irish bank.  As part of the recapitalisation programme for the banks, a number of seed and early stage funds were set up to stimulate entrepreneurship in Ireland.  These have been very successful funds.  They have been almost fully utilised.  Many of the portfolio companies over those funds are now ready to scale and grow and receive growth funding in their series A funds.  We believe it to be a very active, vibrant market.</p></speech>

What came out of the recapitalisation of the banks was a number of seed and early stage programmes.  Many of those companies have received the maximum level of funding under those programmes so there is a need to look at the growth element now as we move forward.  In Kernel Capital we provide a very broad continuum of funding, from &euro;100,000 investments up to &euro;5 million, so we have it covered, but there is definitely a need to look at that area for the future because we need more companies to scale and grow internationally.  They will need series A investment for that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jayne Brady" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015033100002#H01400"><p>Regarding females in STEM, it starts very early.  No female unconsciously decides to go into a career in engineering; it is a conscious decision.  Creating the link between females and role models at an early stage and the options that are open to them is key in that.  At present, 25% are coming out of schools with backgrounds in science and technology but it is important to give options to children at an early stage to open up those opportunities to them.</p> <p>  Another key aspect for me, as a female engineer and a mother of three young children, is having family friendly policies for all of the family, both husbands and wives.  This is not just a female debate but about allowing it to be normal for husbands to participate equally in the child care arrangements.</p></speech>

It is not just a burden of putting schemes in place to support the female but supporting schemes to support the family, that is, the children, the husband and the wife.</p></speech>

We do not feel there is a bias towards men in VC.  Unfortunately, however, we do not see enough women in technology, and that is our key focus.  We invest in ICT companies with a particular focus on engineering, and we are just not seeing enough in that.  Our job as a VC is to seek the best opportunities, the best teams and ensure they are backed at an early stage.</p><p>Unfortunately we just are not seeing the level of companies coming forward.  Typically, when we have made investments in companies led by female CEOs, we have initiated those funding discussions, so perhaps they have not thought about approaching venture capital investors.  When they do come to us, it is typically on the lower end in terms of investment; they are not looking for series A investment to scale their businesses.</p></speech>

We find that LEOs are very strapped for funding.  Does Bord Bia support LEOs in this programme with respect to funding?  Mentoring of small companies and start-ups is a crucial area.  Sometimes the LEOs themselves do not have the expertise, particularly in the food sector.  Is Bord Bia actively supporting start-ups through the use of mentoring?</p> <p>  I always welcome the fact that sources of finance other than banks are available to start-ups.  Many start-ups have difficulty in accessing finance because they have no track history.  The venture capital side of things is, therefore, interesting.  The percentage of women being supported was not mentioned in the Kernel Capital presentation and I would appreciate that information.  What other sources of finance can start-ups access?  It is one question we are asking small businesses.  We are trying to explain to them what is available, but they also like to hear it directly from companies that are involved in that.</p> <p>  Is it Ms Bentley who is wearing an Origin Green badge?

That would probably be high in Ireland.  The good news is that, as I said in the presentation, Enterprise Ireland is making great strides with regard to female entrepreneurship.  The emphasis that has been put on this issue is building momentum and we just need to keep that up.  From speaking with Enterprise Ireland, I know that 84% of the women it funded last year were female tech entrepreneurs.  That is really positive.</p></speech>

We are primarily seeing consumer and food at the moment.  We are saying, as Ms Brady said, that if we could see more women going into STEM at an earlier stage, the number of female tech entrepreneurs would increase.  We just are not seeing them, which is why we are not funding them.  In the case of three of the five entrepreneurs we have funded, we initiated those funding talks.  They are not coming to us.  They are not knocking down our doors.  We are inundated with queries on funding, but unfortunately the percentage of women is very low.  We are a big advocate for female entrepreneurship.  Three of the six partners are female.  That is why we are here, to bring that message across.  We are hopeful for the future, given that such a high percentage of Enterprise Ireland investments this year involve female entrepreneurs.  That is very strong.  Many of them are at the low stage, with the competitive start fund, but we are hoping that they will, over the next year or so, be ready for series A investment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015033100002#J01000"><p>I will give some history about our relationship with the local enterprise offices.  We commenced a change in our relationship with them in 2012, with the establishment of a memorandum of understanding between our two organisations.  One of the key changes happening at that time was that we were getting a huge number of start-ups in the food industry and it was a challenge for us to answer all the queries that were coming through to us.  We were also conscious that the county enterprise boards were in a similar position and that there was a significant danger that we were duplicating each other's efforts.  If I gave one answer, the county enterprise board might give a different one, and lines of communication were not as fluid as they could and should be.  We reached out to establish a memorandum of understanding and to ensure that any food company was getting the right type of help at a local level, rather than having to come to Dublin, where we are based.  We worked with the local enterprise offices in this journey.  We brought every local enterprise office to Bord Bia to train them in food because, as the Deputy commented, we were conscious that there were varying degrees of exposure to food.  The number of companies that would previously have come to a local enterprise office varied, so they did not all have a great degree of experience.   Some counties would have had a very strong level of interest, while others might not have dealt with such queries.  We brought everyone in to train them on how best to use Bord Bia in the first instance, rather than using consultants or external resources.  Once that journey was finished, we designed a programme for them to deliver so that, again, they did not have to use consultants for it.  It also had the benefit that one got the same course and content no matter what county one was in.  We also facilitated the identification of suitable mentors who were strong in food and had experience in that area, rather than just being strong in the area of start-up businesses.</p> <p>  Financially, we did not contribute to the programme.  What we were doing was very much the content element, the contacts and the design of the programme.  We funded all of that, but the enterprise offices themselves, which operate on an individual county basis, rather than a centrally-funded basis, funded their own programmes.  We also reached out to SuperValu because we felt that would add more value.  When we were talking to our entrepreneurs, we found that when the State says something to them it is one thing, but when the retailer and potential customer suggests a change to their packaging or flavours, that change happens much more quickly, as a commercial interest is at stake.  The benefits of that programme were huge.</p> <p>  That is a long answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on how we funded it.  We fully agree with him that mentoring is very important in the food industry.  That is why we were looking for the quality from our Food Academy start-up programme that we received at the very beginning.  In all our programmes, whether the Tesco or the Food Works programme, we handpick the mentors we use to ensure they have relevant, recent and robust experience to share.  That is one of the key differentiators we use in that selection process.  Ms Twomey might add something to that.</p></speech>

We were given a mentor and when we went to look at the broader UK market the first thing we did was to meet our mentor over there.  We did an on-the-ground survey.  People in the UK did not know where Clonakilty was.  They did not know it was a place.  White pudding was alien to them.  Bord Bia helped us with our packaging.  We boxed our product, put the story on the packaging, and even included a guide to what thickness to cut the pudding.  These were all practical suggestions about everyday things that we took for granted, but our mentor was an ex-Sainsbury buyer and we could ring him day or night.  Likewise for the fellowship programme in Australia, Bord Bia was just superb.</p></speech>

I met Ms Twomey and her husband, Lord have mercy on him, only a few years after she started in 1976.  What a smashing job she has done.  Innovation is so important, certainly in the food business, which is the one I know best.  What Bord Bia is and has been doing is encouraging innovation.  In the case of Clonakilty, there is a success story.  By the way, today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>also gave Clonakilty great marks for its product.</p><p>What are the obstacles?  What are the difficulties, particularly in regard to competitiveness?  How does one manage to become more competitive, whether the business is engineering, food or whatever?  If an Irish company was the same as every other company, then Ms Twomey would not have had a chance when she knocked on the doors of those stores in Britain.  She gave an interesting answer to the question posed by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  She said her company did not get into a private label but maintained an individual own-brand one.  That is an important element which can succeed very well.  My questions on innovation, obstacles to exports and the challenges in terms of competitiveness apply to all of the witnesses.    </p><p> I found the presentations made by Ms Rimmington, Ms Brady and Ms Sidhu very interesting.  I was on the board of the Food Marketing Institute in America for 20 years.  I am also a former chairman of the Consumer Goods Forum, a worldwide organisation based in Paris, and the Brussels-based EuroCommerce.  It was interesting to find very successful female chief executives, although there were not many, in companies such as PepsiCo.  These people did not get their appointment because they were women.  They were appointed because they were better than all of the other applicants.  I do not think these particular companies, which have had such success, had positive discrimination.  I think these women had to earn their  appointments against all the other contenders.</p><p> I want to know the following.  What are the difficulties that women face in trying to get to the top?  Are they expected to be double-jobbers?  Are they expected to look after their homes and families as well as being entrepreneurs and success stories?  If so, is there anything that the State or society as a whole can do to overcome that scenario?  If we lose out on very talented and competent women we will lose 50% of the available market.  We as a society must do something about the matter, but probably not by law or anything like that.  There is probably something else that we can do.  Have the witnesses any suggestions in that area?</p></speech>

We have a portfolio of 80 companies.  We have some great technology, universities and institutions here in Ireland.  However, we have found that one of the largest challenges for them is the commercialisation of technology.  Nothing is as important as technology because it helps to deliver business value and makes sales.  There is great focus on technology and innovation, and we have great skills in that space.  Unfortunately, there is no focus on international sales, which is a skill we need to develop as a country.  In July 2013 we wrote an open letter to the Minister for Education and Skills discussing the need for this skill.  We also encouraged a renewed focus on looking at the subject in education.  There are a few exceptions to the trend, such as the Dublin Institute of Technology.  However, we need to focus on education because the fulfilment of innovation and technology is the commercialisation of that piece.  The economy needs to increase core skills to enable us to do so.</p></speech>

One then needs to be able to sell that into the market, and the market will reward whoever does so.  It can be difficult when one has an excellent technology.  Millions of euro could have been spent on a technology but there could be a problem selling it, which is an issue we need to address.  Earlier we talked about STEM, but we are also talking about sales, about CEOs with strong domain expertise who know the market and how to sell into it.  Those are the key ingredients necessary.</p></speech>

A number of our portfolio companies have a strong technology but they need to validate their technology by getting a reference customer.  Who takes the first punch in a startup technology?  For example, we have a portfolio company in data storage which we believe to be world class.  In order to test the system to its full capacity, one needs an organisation the size of eBay.  How does the portfolio company get its first validation customer?  For us, it would be helpful if the State-funded companies could act as Government procurement in order to get a reference customer and secure validation.  Such an initiative would go a long way to help those companies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.102" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015033100002#K00500"><p>Senator Quinn has asked a very complex question.  The food industry is an exciting industry, as he has acknowledged, and it has experienced phenomenal growth over the past five years.  There are obstacles and challenges in the food industry, but every single industry experiences them.  Let us look at the food and drinks industry.  We have a small home market, which means one must export at a very early stage compared with an equivalent UK or French supplier.  That means an Irish company must get into the issues faced by much larger competitors earlier.  That is one of the obstacles regularly faced by companies.</p> <p>  Remaining consumer-relevant is also a challenge.  This is the fast-moving consumer goods industry, and one must keep the consumer at the heart of one's business decision-making at all times.  If one is a small business, having the Irish consumer at one's heart is not going to be very good if one wants to export to France.  Therefore, companies must ensure they remain nimble to deal with a complex export piece.  Ms Twomey mentioned the changes she had to make to her product category, packaging and the way the product was presented.  These are all challenges for smaller businesses.  It is the constant focus on getting our industry to a value-added stage rather than a commodity play.  We have created huge scale in the commodities, as one can see from the excitement happening tomorrow with the lifting of the dairy quota.  One wants to make sure, where we get a great opportunity, that investment is returned to farmers, but one can only do so if one is in the value-added piece.</p> <p>  The final challenge in terms of food is attracting talent to the industry.  In some ways the recession has been very good to the food industry, because a huge number of people have come back into the industry again.  Over the past five years, everything from our fellowship programme to agricultural colleges have been full, which means that food has been re-established in the career path of many.  We must continuously be aware that the food industry will only be as good as the talent it attracts.  We need to make sure we have a very talent-filled industry if we want to keep the growth trajectory going.</p></speech>

There have been some great success stories and An Bord Bia have great representatives.  My wife and I have five children and we sent them all to school in France for a short term when they were about 13 years of age.  It is a dangerous thing to do, because my two girls fell in love with Frenchmen and are now married to them.  My daughter Gilliane lives in France.  She has a chain of smoothie bars around France, which is not an easy job.  It is a real reminder to us that if we are going to encourage exports we must move learning a foreign language higher up on the agenda of everything we do in education.</p></speech>

The one area that has a higher participation by women is the fellowship programme.  It is our international export programme, in which we place graduates into export markets.  To return to the last point made by the Senator, we were able to place those women because women and girls have a higher rate of language skills.  About 65% of our participants are female, and traditionally women have stronger language skills.</p></speech>

A lot of people are probably embracing it.  Does Bord Bia see fears for the future?  In New Zealand, 25% of the economy is based on the dairy industry.  We have had a problem with that over the years regarding the construction side of things.  I went in to study agriculture  in 1976 with all my hopes and aspirations, and came out in 1981 when there was nothing and had to leave the country as a result.  Is there a fear that something like this might happen through the expansion in dairy?  What are the witnesses' own viewpoints on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara McCarthy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015033100002#L00400"><p>We are very excited about the possibilities for the dairy industry, but very conscious of the volatility that is part of this new journey.  It is important to stress right the way through this that we need to be focused on adding value and not be sucked into a commodity game.  Origin Green will be one of the fundamentals that helps to differentiate Ireland from New Zealand, all our European competitors and the US, and this will protect us going forward.  In December 2013 we introduced a dairy quality assurance scheme.  We have had guests such as Starbucks coming to Ireland specifically because they have the reassurance of this scheme and because Ireland plays as a united front rather than having Irish interests compete with each other.  There are many aspects to this, and we would need a huge crystal ball to forecast where dairy is going to go and whether it will be influenced by the consumption patterns of the Russians or the Chinese.  The overall dynamic is hugely positive, with increased consumption of dairy.  The key piece is that we remain part of the value-added element of that trading and are not just at the lower end.  Looking at the journey to date, although we have just 1% of global trade in dairy, we actually have 10% of the market for infant formula.  That shows we are playing to our strengths in operating in the absolute top end of that market.  With that come huge responsibilities regarding food security, sustainability and the brand protection for customers.  We have huge responsibilities but are playing for huge opportunities.</p></speech>

I knew Senator Quinn would be very impressed, particularly with the venture capitalist ladies, because of the field he is in now, considering all the opportunities he gave to people such as Ms Twomey and ourselves at Lir Chocolates.  The cross-party document that we are producing aims to encourage more women entrepreneurs.  Our mantra will be that we are not utilising half the population - we are failing to utilise the attributes of women.  Our committee is driving for opportunities for women to participate more.  It was in the Action Plan for Jobs.  The Minister felt it was an area we should deal with as a committee.</p> <p>  I would like to predict that Ms McCarthy will be the future chief executive of Bord Bia.  I met her first when I was honoured to be on the board of Bord Bia.  Tara made her presentation of the work she was doing in France, and I instantly said to myself, "This is a four star general if ever there was one."  She has risen to the top now and it is my great pleasure to congratulate her.  My friend Ms Maeve Bracken was telling me this morning how Ms Twomey was on a stand promoting her products - I hope she does not mind me saying so - and she went behind the stand to feed the baby as well, so fair dues to her.  Her pudding is just a favourite with everybody; it is tremendous.  I knew her husband myself and am very sorry that he died.  They were a great partnership and Ms Twomey is a wonderful woman.</p> <p>  What Ms Bentley was saying about the languages is important.  The three ladies from Kernel Capital are something else, and their presentations were outstanding.  People are not aware of the leadership of women in the venture capital area.  We need women in business and women entrepreneurs and we have it here today.  Hopefully, under the chairmanship of Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, we will do a good document.  I thank the witnesses. It was pure brilliant, actually.</p></speech>

The blueprint for such a union is a key priority of the Juncker Commission and is one of the most significant policy developments in the area of financial services.  The creation of a single market for capital is intended to remove obstacles that currently inhibit and obstruct the free movement of capital.  By eliminating these barriers, it is hoped cross-border EU investment will expand.  This could have an effect on jobs and growth, as capital which may be currently frozen is unlocked and distributed to the most productive parts of the economy.</p><p>The capital markets union, CMU, is also designed to increase the availability and choice of funding to the SME sector.  Difficulties in the banking sector and the requirement to repair balance sheets are considered to have adversely affected lending to SMEs.  A transition to markets-based finance would provide an alternative source of finance for start-ups and innovative enterprises.  The objective of CMU is to link investors and savers with viable and employment generating businesses, in the process making the investment chain more efficient.</p><p>The joint committee over the course of today's hearings will gain an insight into the key issues outlined in the Green Paper.  The committee is interested in learning about the different aspects of the initiative, and from a diverse range of stakeholders.  The committee intends to make a submission to the Commission and this session offers an opportunity to inform that.  More important, the hearing allows for a constructive debate on both the key issues outlined in the Green Paper and the broader concept of capital markets integration.</p><p>I thank all the witnesses sincerely for making themselves available at short notice.  Committee rooms and slots are at a premium and, therefore, we had to seize the opportunity when one became available to allow us to prepare a submission on this topic before the middle of May.  There will be four sessions this afternoon of a maximum of one hour each.  I welcome to the first session Mr. Mark O'Mahoney, director of policy, Chambers Ireland, and Ms Regina Breheny, director general, Irish Venture Capital Association.  Both will make opening remarks of approximately five minutes each, although I will not be strict about that.  A question and answer session will follow to clarify matters that may arise.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. O'Mahoney to make his presentation.</p></speech>

Chambers Ireland is Ireland's largest business network.  We represent business throughout Ireland and, what is important in the context of this discussion, we are also a member of the European chamber of commerce.  The European Commission&rsquo;s decision to move towards the establishment of a single capital market is welcome.  The development of a fully functioning single market for the movement of capital throughout the 28 member states will support EU competitiveness by facilitating the effective and efficient allocation of capital and ease access to finance for the real economy.  Ultimately, an efficient CMU will support the Commission&rsquo;s priorities of jobs and growth for Europe.</p><p> Equity markets in the EU are dwarfed by those in the US and there remains an over-reliance on loan financing, typically from retail banks, to finance SME activity across the EU.  The downside of this over-reliance on bank credit became apparent during the financial crisis when banks deleveraged and credit to SMEs was severely constrained across the EU.  A capital markets union will facilitate the development of a new range of innovative financing options for European businesses and reduce the unhealthy dependence on bank loan finance.</p><p> The Green Paper sets out a comprehensive and ambitious programme which will take some years to implement.  There are significant obstacles that will need to be addressed in advance of a full capital markets union being achieved.  However, there are areas in which progress can be made in the short to medium term and we believe it is essential that focus is placed on these to deliver benefits in the short term and to generate positive momentum for the project.</p><p> The first of these is standardising credit information for SMEs.  The development of a common standard on balance sheet information on SMEs across the EU would be useful in allowing for the accurate assessment of investment propositions across borders.  However, due to the vast differences that exist between member states, the chances that this is feasible in the medium term are low.  A minimum amount of common comparable information across the EU could, however, be developed and shared with interested parties.  The European Central Bank could play a role as a co-ordinating body.  The standardisation of SME credit information may also become a driver for the development of cross-border peer-to-peer lending mechanisms and other innovative financial services.  This aim must be balanced with the recognition that European SMEs are already struggling under a weighty administrative burden, so mandatory public disclosure of company information in addition to national reporting requirements should be opposed.</p><p> The development of a European private placement market offers some potential for Irish companies, but it remains highly fragmented and defined by domestic investments.  In addition to support for the pan-European corporate private placement market guide covering a voluntary framework for common market standards and best practices which has been endorsed by Europe&rsquo;s leading central bankers and capital markets players, the EU and national policy-makers should take into account tax legislation, for example, an exemption from withholding tax for private placements.  Simple steps such as the utilisation of standardised documentation across the EU would also encourage potential investors to look across borders for opportunities.</p><p> If managed correctly, the development of a standardised European-wide securitisation market could be of significant benefit to SMEs.  Allowing lenders to pool SME loan portfolios and convert them to securities which can attract investment from those with greater risk tolerance will remove some risk from bank balance sheets and increase the appetite for SME lending.  However, clear regulatory oversight of securitisations is essential.</p><p> The final point relates to the tax treatment of equity.  Despite a general agreement on tax policy being biased against equity, very little has been done to change that.  Policy-makers could consider changing the tax treatment of equity to remove the bias.  This is particularly relevant in Ireland as we seek to reduce the typical reliance on loan finance to fund projects and introduce innovative new finance products to part-fund capital investments.</p><p> The development of the capital markets union will be a long and challenging process, but the benefits to European productivity and competitiveness will be significant.  We believe CMU is a worthwhile project.  If it is delivered as envisaged, it will unlock investment and facilitate the development of a new range of financing options for European companies in the real economy.  There will undoubtedly be benefits for Ireland and Irish companies and opportunities for Ireland to leverage its role as a centre of financial services and a centre of excellence for fund management.  A caveat would be that it is difficult to see where some of the proposals would be relevant for the typical Irish SME.  Notwithstanding this, it is a positive initiative and we would support its delivery.</p></speech>

I will give some brief background of what we are and what we do before I make some recommendations.</p> <p>  The IVCA is the representative organisation for venture capital firms in Ireland.  These VC firms have specialist domain knowledge and invest primarily in fast-growing, high-tech companies operating in the ICT and life sciences sectors.  These companies are developing deep technologies, addressing global markets and creating thousands of high-calibre jobs.  VC provides equity capital to fund the start-up, growth and expansion of innovative SMEs that are high risk and high potential but are unable to access credit markets because their underlying assets are typically based on intellectual property.  VC firms bridge the five-to-ten year funding gap between small amounts of money raised from friends and family to funding from bank debt at a much later stage.</p> <p>  A particular feature of the VC model is that a VC fund is precluded from taking on debt, distinguishing it from the buyout part of the private sector industry.  It usually invests equity for a minority shareholding.  As leverage is not an issue, thus it must be said that venture capital activity does not pose any systemic risk.</p> <p>  VC teams usually have a technology background and are scientists, engineers or researchers or they come from a business background with deep industry experience.  A core skill is the ability to identify novel technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage.  Normally the interests of the VC fund and entrepreneurs are aligned and both have a common interest in building a business around a piece of technology and exiting it through an IPO or a trade sale over time.</p> <p>  International studies indicate that venture capital stimulates growth, innovation, research and development, new businesses and entrepreneurialism.  In Ireland, VC as a percentage of GDP trebled from 0.06% in 2003 to 0.22% in 2014, the second highest level in Europe after Finland.  Throughout this period the number of new innovative companies raising seed capital increased fourfold.  Irish technology companies have spawned a significant number of new companies and created a new generation of serial entrepreneurs who are now dominant as angel investors in the early stage sectors.</p> <p>  The IVCA's economic impact analysis shows that, over the past decade, venture-backed companies have created high-calibre jobs, with employment growing by 11% per annum since 2003.  They are export led, with exports growing by 12% per annum since 2003 and revenues by 17% in the same period.  These companies are knowledge based and graduates represent 73% of the workforce.  The research and development spend by venture-backed companies represents 30% of all Irish SMEs' share of total spend on BERD, which is the measure of spending on research and development.  Growing Ireland&rsquo;s indigenous export-oriented SME sector is becoming a national imperative as these companies provide 50% of the jobs in the economy and generate 10% of exports.  A strong and well-financed venture capital industry is vital to this growth.  This imperative is emphasised also in Europe and is reflected in policy guidelines and in the fact that VC as an asset class has been carved out of the more stringent regulatory regime applying to private equity.</p> <p>  We welcome the Green Paper on CMU.  It highlights what is well known, that access to risk capital is much lower in Europe for a variety of reasons and this is more pronounced as one moves up the risk curve.  The report also highlights the need to improve access to finance, especially for SMEs, to increase and diversify sources of finance and to improve market efficiency across member states.  It promotes VC as having an important role to play.  However, while there has been progress on regulation and finance, vigilance is required and sanctions may be needed to prevent gold plating and to ensure additional costs are not imposed by individual countries in an uncompetitive way.  In addition, a co-ordinated approach needs to be followed to ensure the VC asset class is not excluded or restricted as an investment under the current discussions on prudential rules for the insurance and pensions industries. Joined-up thinking is essential in this regard.</p> <p>  The industry in Ireland is performing very well, but this story is not consistent across Europe.  While the level of VC investment activity worldwide has been adversely affected by the credit crunch, with no growth and significant volatility throughout this period, there has been strong investment in Ireland throughout the recession and &euro;401 million was raised by Irish SMEs in 2014 alone.  Annual investment activity in Ireland has grown by 65% since 2007 while fund-raising in Europe as a whole was halved over this period.</p> <p>  The focus of venture capital activity is on investment in high-tech, early stage companies in the ICT and the med-tech sectors.  More than 500 of these companies have been supported by Irish VCs in the past ten years.  Consequently, Ireland is recognised as a major force in technology development.</p><p>In the past ten years, &euro;1 billion in capital has been imported by Irish venture capital firms through syndication with US and European-based venture capital funds.  On average, every euro invested by an Irish venture capital firm is matched by a euro from an international venture capital firm.  Since 1997 the number of venture capital funds operating in Ireland has more than doubled and the average size has increased from &euro;20 million to &euro;75 million.  In Europe the average fund size is &euro;60 million but the median size is &euro;27 million.  That is how small the industry is.  It is also very fragmented.<br/><br/>Irish venture capital firms have invested in a wide range of deal types and many of the firms are entering their fourth investment cycle.  They have specialist domain knowledge in the sectors in which they invest.  Unfortunately, deal size is an issue both in Ireland and across Europe.  In the US, SMEs receive five times more funding from capital markets than in the EU, and, in venture capital terms, US companies receive up to ten times more funding than in the EU.  This is particularly evident in the growth and expansion stage.<br/><br/>The venture ecosystem is well developed, with spin-outs coming from publicly funded research centres and, with the emergence of incubation centres and accelerator programs, these start-up companies are now better prepared in terms of investor readiness than ever before.  Almost all of the leading US ICT, pharma, med tech and biotechnology companies have located their European headquarters here.  They draw talent and are breeding grounds for the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.  Most exits in Ireland are through trade sales mainly to these multinationals, thus further expanding and embedding the presence of the multinational industry in Ireland. <br/><br/>In essence, the US is composed of a number of venture capital hubs. There is Silicon Valley on the west coast, Austin in Texas, Boston in Massachusetts, and New York.  It is unlikely that a homogenous industry can be spread evenly across Europe.  This seems to be the purpose and intent of the policy in the capital markets union document.  Venture capital hubs are already emerging in Europe and policy initiatives should focus more on driving this process and supporting what is being created by the private sector.<br/><br/>It is our ambition to ensure that Dublin is a venture capital hub alongside London and Berlin.  We already have many of the building blocks in place.  To create a best-in-class venture capital hub, Ireland needs, on the demand side, to attract skilled labour and start-ups from<b></b>other states.  To achieve this, key initiatives around personal tax will be essential.  We see the UK as our main competitor.  Unfortunately Ireland&rsquo;s tax regime has lost significant competitiveness compared to the UK.  There is now a misalignment between the Government&rsquo;s tax policy in regard to entrepreneurship and the key objectives in the Action Plan for Jobs.  The main areas of contention are the capital gains tax regime, where rates here are currently 33% as against 10% in the UK, reduced by entrepreneur&rsquo;s relief, and there is also a lack of share option schemes to incentivise entrepreneurs.  These are barriers to encouraging entrepreneurs to set up in Ireland.  All a person has to do is drive one hour to the North to avail of the better regime that operates in the UK.<br/><br/>On the supply side, we need to increase the amount of capital in order to scale opportunities.  In this regard, Irish venture capital firms have performed very well because of their ability to import international private capital by syndicating deals.  This process has gone some way towards alleviating the lack of depth in Irish and European capital markets.  This is a unique advantage for Ireland and, from a competitive viewpoint, local venture capital firms should be supported by the State through Enterprise Ireland, by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and by the European Investment Fund, EIF, in order to capitalise on this advantage.<br/><br/>Fundraising for venture capital funds in Ireland, and in Europe generally, is very challenging.  Support from the private sector is limited.  In Europe, the international long-term investor has decreased its share of venture capital funding from 35% to 15%.  The main reasons for this include a significant fragmentation of investment opportunities.  There are not enough large venture capital funds to absorb the investor&rsquo;s bite size.  There is a significant gap between the size of the investor and the size of the venture capital fund.  Prudential rules at EU level are restricting the venture capital asset class as an investment.  Further, there were high performance expectations, which, unfortunately, after the dotcom crash around 2000, were not met.<br/><br/>There is also a distinct absence of certain classes of institutional investor that have historically supported US venture capital firms.  These include private equity funds-of-funds, university endowments, foundations and family offices.  Most life assurance companies operating in Ireland are foreign-owned and are managed from abroad, with little influence on decisions to invest in the Irish venture capital asset class.  There is also a limited pool of Irish pension funds of sufficient scale and management resources willing to invest in Irish venture capital.  They are largely semi-state or public sector defined benefit schemes.  Many of these defined benefit schemes are in deficit and have been actively seeking to reduce their risk profile.</p></speech>

I will now deal with initiatives to free up private sector capital.  These initiatives should be considered and could include, for example, the establishment of a fund-of-funds mechanism, using a PPP model, in Europe, with preferential treatment for the private sector and the State taking a subordinated position.   I think that would be essential in terms of attracting private sector money.  This fund would in turn invest in individual venture capital funds.  This mechanism could satisfy large investor appetites and create larger pan-European funds that could invest in larger tickets required to scale business.</p> <p>  The venture capital threshold in the alternative investment fund managers directive, AIFMD, of &euro;500 million should be increased to &euro;1 billion to allow bigger funds to be created without undue regulatory issues.  We also need a Government or EU initiative to underwrite a liquidity mechanism that allows defined contribution schemes to invest in selected Irish-focused investments such as venture capital.  We also probably need some tax relief for retail investors if we are going to encourage them to look at venture capital funds as an asset class.</p></speech>

There is much talk and noise about the importance of venture capital, but we have not seen much action yet in terms of increasing the capital available.  I hope that will be the result of it.

Some of them were laid out in Ms Breheny's statement, but what are the biggest barriers?  Let us assume that we have a bunch of venture capital firms in Ireland, still fairly small-scale, and we have two hubs in Berlin and London of a bigger scale.  We then have a load of cash floating around.  It is owned by pension funds, private equity funds, corporates, governments and so forth.  Ms Breheny wants those funds and those fund managers reinvesting in venture capital.  It sounds as though they have seriously deleveraged their venture capital exposure over the past number of years.  What is involved?  What barriers need to be taken away to get them to reinvest?</p></speech>

There is a growing pool of venture capital money in Dublin and we are getting an exciting hub here, but whenever I have talked to people about what it takes to invest, I have never heard mention of tax.  The lobby groups mention tax all the time and never stop talking about it.  From a producer's perspective, Ireland has an extremely low corporation tax rate and the lowest employer's PRSI rate in Europe.  For the chambers' members, who are ultimately the people in whom funds are investing, we are highly tax-efficient.

However, they are crucified with capital gains tax when they sell their companies.  In the UK, the rate is significantly lower so there is a relative incentive.  That is the problem.  The UK was very far behind Ireland until a year or two ago, to the extent that activity here in terms of fundraising for companies was approximately 25% of what it was in the UK.  That was notwithstanding the fact that the UK economy is 16 times the size of Ireland's.

The capital markets union seems like a good idea.  One removes transaction costs, improves the free movement of capital and makes it possible for Irish-based investors to look at opportunities in London or Berlin, while investors in those areas can meet with Mr. O'Mahoney's members and do debt for equity rather than making straightforward loans.  The free movement of capital is a fine idea until one looks at what it has actually done around the world for the last number of centuries.  While a great deal of wealth has been created by the more efficient redistribution of supply and demand for capital, a great deal of damage has been done as well.  Most of the growth we see in the USA, Europe and Ireland relates to debt.  It is not real growth.  It is not something any engineer, scientist or business person would recognise as growth.  The Federal Reserve and the ECB are printing money and giving it to banks for free.  Those banks are buying sovereign debt and becoming vastly wealthy for doing nothing.  We were meant to deleverage.  We all saw in 2007 and 2008 what happens when one has debt-fuelled growth and the amount of capital in the system far exceeds and outgrows the underlying real economy by a huge factor.  It is happening again.</p><p>We have not deleveraged and, in fact, we are on the way back up again.  The Federal Reserve has printed a vast amount of money and now the ECB is doing the same.  </p><p> One of the risks of the CMU is that it facilitates more and more debt.  The members of the organisations present are the producers.  They are the people who must take on this debt and then sell widgets, services and products to pay it back.  Are they concerned?  Is the Chambers of Ireland concerned that it has been made easier for hot money to arrive over from the Valley, Japan or wherever there happens to be free cash?  In Australia there is an asset price bubble, which means there is a load of extra cash.  What happens if that suddenly arrives in Europe and Ireland?  That hot money will drive up asset prices and leave members of the organisations that are before us today massively in debt.  They will find themselves unable to pay it back when all the asset prices and economic activity go back down.  Is there a concern among the witnesses' organisations that the CMU will make it easier for hot money to get into the Union and move within the Union, and that this will drive up asset prices and create a false economic growth that is ultimately damaging to their members?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.165" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Mahoney" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015033100002#F00200"><p>The issue around inflated asset classes and their super-liquidity at the moment is a concern.  It is probably more of a macroeconomic concern than something our members would be concerned about on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>  The point has been well made that if there is a lot of hot money looking for a home and this floods into bonds based on SMEs or SME debt, for example, without due diligence as to its quality, there is a risk that ultimately the businesses will fail and it will not be an efficient use of capital.  Facilitating the flow of capital for the sake of it is not necessarily a good thing.  From the point of view of our members, we would look for a diversification of the avenues in which they could access finance - not necessarily easy money, but a broader spectrum of financial instruments or products that they can access.  SMEs would not necessarily need to know what the backing is behind the bank or front of house from which they are procuring a financial product.  They would need to know that it is suitable for them and their financing needs.</p></speech>

That will typically suit the Mittelstand or the larger SMEs at the core of Europe.  However, there are opportunities to encourage more venture capital and in areas around crowd-funding and non-traditional bank finance and reducing the overall reliance on bank finance and debt.  One of the key benefits of the CMU will be helping to change the culture in terms of Irish SMEs looking beyond the retail bank and traditional loan finance.  There is also the principle of an efficient flow of capital within the Union.</p></speech>

Banking will be redefined in the next decade, and peer-to-peer lending will explode.  Let us take it as an example of what could happen from the point of view of citizens or investors and members of the organisation.  Let us assume a widget manufacturer in Clonshaugh lends money to a widget manufacturer in Bavaria because it knows the business.  The funding has been crowd-sourced, they have checked each other out and things are beginning to happen on a citizen-to-citizen level.  The CMU could help make this easier.  Does Mr. O'Mahoney know what is stopping that from happening now?</p></speech>

Domestically, one would see it happen on a national basis.  For example, the UK has a fairly advanced peer-to-peer lending market, some of which is supported by the state.  Ireland is probably some way off that situation at the moment.  Even though it goes against my DNA, probably more regulation or appropriate regulation is needed in peer-to-peer lending.</p></speech>

The concept of a lot of people losing a small amount of money is not necessarily a good thing either.  In particular, for the private investor or householder whom we are trying to encourage to invest by taking their money out of lower-returning deposit accounts and moving it into a more productive use of capital, some form of investor protection is needed.  Similarly to the Deputy's question about hot money, a lot of people pumping money into quasi-blind investments is not necessarily a good thing.  Such investments need to be managed appropriately, and regulatory infrastructure is probably one of the main barriers to the effective use of crowd-funding.  It is probably quite effective at the moment in smaller projects.  We need appropriate oversight and regulation if we want to bring this option up to the scale at which SMEs can benefit and investors can earn an appropriate return.</p></speech>

There is a view among the lay population that venture capitalists are synonymous with vulture capitalists.  What springs to mind is a character like Gordon Gekko, taking over a small company, asset-stripping it and selling it off to the market for its bits and pieces or body parts.  As a category of investor, venture capitalists do not have a great reputation.  Both delegations have made the point that 80% more investment in the SME sector the United States comes from venture capitalists-----</p></speech>

That means the reality is the opposite.  It is 20:80 versus 80:20.  There is a general perspective that the Irish financial system does not support SMEs or investment in SMEs.  We need to move towards more engagement by venture capitalists in the European markets in order to promote and stimulate growth.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Mahoney mentioned in his initial presentation the idea of common standards.  In other words, if one is going to have a genuine market, or wants to buy equity in a company rather than debt, then we need to develop common standards when providing balance sheet information and so forth, which would allow for an assessment across the EU on a particular investment in a company in any of the EU member states.  There was also talk of a minimum set of comparable information that would be developed and shared with the interested parties in which the European Central Bank could play a role - in other words, a standardisation of SME credit information.  It could be a little like launching shares on a stock exchange, such as the Green Book requirements or whatever.  What has been proposed, and I am open to correction, sounds like a new weighty administrative system.  Is that realistic?  I am not necessarily talking about it being realistic for some of the big European companies.  Is it realistic, in general, for the kinds of company that would want to avail of venture capital finance in order to develop new products?  To what extent is the administrative burden more overwhelming than the benefits?</p> <p>  Another question occurred to me as a presentation was being made.  Unfortunately, I did not have Ms Breheny's quite lengthy presentation in front of me and it was difficult to make notes on thin air.</p><p>She mentioned that tax policy is biased against equity.  My understanding from decades of economic deliberation, dating from my university days, is that this nation is generally very risk averse and tends towards opting for the more traditional financial products.  Back in the 1990s, we moved towards the business expansion scheme, BES, and tried to encourage individuals to have an appetite for more risky investment backed by tax incentives and so forth.  It was clearly abandoned afterwards.  To what extent is there room for moving as a nation back in that direction?</p><p> With regard to Deputy Donnelly's questions, which were very comprehensive, my query is purely nationalistic.  We seem to be doing quite well on the investment front.  Ms Breheny mentioned that we are doing comparatively better than other EU states in terms of venture capital investment.  The phenomenon seems to be confined to a couple of sectors.  Ms Breheny mentioned technology principally.  Is it only technology?  Why are we getting better?  Could the growth be extended to other Irish companies of a similar size?  Is there a danger that if we move more towards a single market in capital, we may actually lose out?  If the market is to become more efficient, might there be more dragging of capital into the centre and a movement away from investment in the periphery?  Are there dangers facing us if we have a more efficient capital market?  According to Ms Breheny, we seem to be doing quite well in this regard anyway.</p></speech>

We build businesses; we do not take them apart.  One reason the industry has evolved and developed is that it builds very successfully on technology and teams with expertise. We are good at this for two reasons.  First, the State has been very supportive in terms of providing capital when the private sector had pulled away and also in terms of establishing seed funds.  As part of the recapitalisation of the banking system, the banks were asked to put up some funding.  The State, through Enterprise Ireland, put up funding and the seed funds were created.  The management of the funds was made the responsibility of the commercial VCs.  That brought on board a significantly improved and expanded pipeline of new start-up companies, which were there for the taking and the growing.  On top of that, the Irish VCs have had tremendous relationships with foreign VCs and were able to pull in the international capital.  The two aspects came together to create a business that was much better than what was available in other European markets.  That, in essence, is why we have been more successful.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman is absolutely correct that one of the risks of capital market union is that if those concerned do not accept that hubs are the way to go and that Dublin is to be a significant one, it might pull capital away.  That is a big risk.  We will have to fight very hard to get the message across.  Europe is listening.  Two years ago, VC was being pulled into this horrible regulatory regime under the alternative investment management directive.  At the very last moment, however, VC was carved out of it.  Therefore, somebody is listening, paying attention to the benefits of VC, promoting it and trying to develop it in a way that means money is being put into SMEs, which is its job.</p> <p>  We are largely technology based because there was no great breadth in the Irish economy.  Many companies that were on the stock market were doing fine and did not need VC.  There has always been a VC industry but it moved more towards technology when the FDI sector became increasingly significant within the economy.  There were teams of people coming out of the multinational companies with research under their arm looking for funding, and the VC industry was delighted to be able to support them and the technology.  That is where the industry absolutely exploded over the years.  One reason we have been really successful at technology investment is the preponderance of the FDI sector that was established here through the IDA.</p></speech>

The asymmetrical information is always the issue.  It is a question of how a potential investor in Germany assesses the proposition of an SME in Ireland, Greece or elsewhere.  Some mechanism needs to be developed so there can be meaningful comparisons between SMEs' creditworthiness and investment-worthiness without having a system that is unduly burdensome on the SME.  I do not have an answer to that at present but SMEs will probably have to examine this.  If they want to engage in overseas or cross-border investment, they will have to be willing to put a bit of work into producing information that is comparable.</p> <p>  On the point on equity, a couple of schemes across Europe have considered giving an allowance for equity in the same way as one would get a deduction for debt.  Belgium has one, as have Italy and Portugal.  It is worth considering again, regardless of the merits or demerits of the BES, because there is a greater imperative at present with the equity gap that we all speak about.  The retail banks will fund perhaps 70% of a loan while 30% equity will have to be found elsewhere.  Irish SMEs will have to get used to finding or being open to equity investment.  That is a challenge, particularly given the nature of the typical Irish SME and the preponderance of family-owned businesses.  They are very reluctant to give away equity.  It will have to happen if Irish SMEs are to continue to grow.  Now is the time to re-examine equity treatment or the tax treatment of equity.</p></speech>

The European Commission Green Paper, "Building a Capital Markets Union", published just under six weeks ago, is the first step in a significant multi-year project which will likely have a significant impact on the Irish investment funds industry.  Throughout our discussion today I will refer to Capital Markets Union as CMU.</p> <p>  By way of introduction the Irish Funds Industry Association, IFIA, is the representative member organisation for those companies involved in the international investment funds industry in Ireland.  The investment funds our members provide services to are widely held, predominantly by institutional and retail investors outside of Ireland.  They invest in global assets and securities and reflect a wide range of investment strategies.  The business of internationally distributed investment funds is highly regulated and Ireland has developed into a significant domicile and administration centre for such fund products within a legal and regulatory environment supervised locally and anchored in a number of European directives.  The UCITS directive, which was transposed into Irish legislation in 1989, provided a key opportunity for the development of the industry here in Ireland.  By developing and continually enhancing the environment in Ireland with the support of an industry that demonstrates excellence and expertise, Ireland enjoys a strong reputation as an investment fund jurisdiction and is now an acknowledged leading international domicile and administration centre for investment funds. </p> <p>  The Irish funds industry employs 13,000 professionals working throughout ten counties in Ireland, making it the single largest employment sub-sector within internationally traded financial services.  Ireland is the second largest European centre for the administration and servicing of investment funds.  In excess of &euro;3.4 trillion of assets in over 13,000 collective investment schemes, CIS, are administered in Ireland.  As such, all significant developments in the European arena are of particular interest and relevance to the Irish industry.  In recent years we have also seen an increasing number of jurisdictions seek to position themselves as domicile and servicing centres for investment funds so this business is increasingly competitive.  IFIA is an active participant in the industry at European and international level, being a member of both the European Fund and Asset Management Association, EFAMA and the International Investment Funds Association, IIFA. </p> <p>  Earlier this month the Government launched a strategy for Ireland's international financial services sector for the next five years, IFS2020.  The strategy acknowledges the spectacular growth in international financial services over the past 25 years, in which the funds industry has played a leading role.  The strategy also recognises the need to respond to competitive challenges and opportunities, to innovate and develop new expertise in order to maintain and grow employment in the sector and continue to attract new foreign direct investment. </p> <p>  As the respective timeframes of the IFS2020 strategy and the CMU project are largely contemporaneous, the potential to ensure Ireland is responsive in identifying opportunities exists.  We look forward to working with the Government, its Departments and agencies, on the roll-out and implementation of IFS2020 and the potential for new product offerings and services under CMU which will encourage further industry growth and associated employment.</p> <p>  Our discussion this afternoon occurs roughly half way through the initial consultation on CMU, therefore IFIA, like many other organisations and stakeholders, are in the process of forming and testing views on the specific matters and questions contained therein.  Any views expressed today should therefore be understood to be initial thoughts which are subject to change, given where we are in that consultation period.</p> <p>  We welcome the CMU initiative on a number of levels.  Firstly, the political recognition that capital market based funding of economies is essential but less pervasive than it should be to encourage growth and jobs is significant.  The free flow of capital within the Single Market is one of the fundamental principles on which the EU was built and the CMU project should act as an enabler and facilitator.  Having multiple sources of financing for economies makes sense and the role of capital markets or market based financing should, as witnessed elsewhere, be stronger.</p><p>Second, from the Green Paper and public comments by Commissioner Hill, there is a clear understanding of the importance of investors or asset owners and finding mechanisms that meet their needs &quot;to identify and remove the barriers which stand between investors' money and investment opportunities&rdquo;.  That is a quote from the Green Paper.<br/><br/>An approach based on pragmatism and recognising that a capital market, like any other market, must offer utility both to buyers and investors, as well as sellers or issuers, is the only way to proceed.<br/><br/>A specific initiative on CMU will draw out further the distinctions between bank and market-based financing and the appropriate structures to support each.<br/><br/>The Green Paper sets out the areas that the Commission believes should be included under the broad CMU initiative.  Rather than reiterating all the points contained in the Green Paper and accompanying working document, we would highlight the following as being relevant for further examination through the consultation process:</p><blockquote>Effective, i.e. liquid, secondary markets are an essential for primary markets to be seen as credible; investment funds are both an effective aggregator of investor capital and provide a mechanism to allow the unique risks of a specific investment - because of underlying risk, liquidity or other factors - to be absorbed via diversification in a manner that is less likely to compromise the achievement of an investor&rsquo;s overall objectives; national economies, and the capital markets that currently serve them, are far from homogenous so the measures implemented <i>en route</i>to CMU will need to be flexible enough to reflect these differences; a common understanding of what a SME is, from a size and capital appetite perspective, across markets is important to identify in assessing actual versus perceived benefits; the concept of passporting has proven to be effective in the investment funds world.  Additional usage of this mechanism may prove beneficial in developing a CMU which encourages capital, assets, securities and investors to move freely; an effective CMU should aid the efficient usage and deployment of bank lending capacity; and, private markets, whether in equity or debt, require specific focus and are further down the development curve.</blockquote><p>While an EU initiative, no capital market operates in isolation.  The extent to which the measures delivered under CMU make European investment opportunities attractive and accessible to non-Europeans will have a significant bearing on the success of the project.  Investment funds will be crucial to this. <br/><br/>This project is also occurring at the same time as the Chinese authorities are internationalising their currency and developing their own capital markets.  If Ireland can act as an effective bridge between Asia and the EU it will increase its relevance and attractiveness as a location for internationally-traded financial services.<br/><br/>Stimulating greater capital markets breadth, depth and utilisation should benefit Ireland and the Irish funds industry, as this is likely to bring about increased activity and demand for services supporting the capital markets.  Achieving the goals identified in IFS2020 will, in part, be linked to how Ireland responds to the opportunities and challenges encountered along the road to CMU.</p></speech>

The IAIM is the representative body for institutional investors operating in Ireland.</p> <p>  Like my colleague, I should say that the association will be responding to the consultation, but our board has yet to finalise its position.  The views I am expressing today are not settled policy and, indeed, some of the opinions may well be my own.  </p> <p>  It is abundantly clear that dependence on bank financing in the EU is markedly higher than in the US where up to 75% of funding of the real economy is provided by the markets.  It is interesting to note that up to two years ago, non-bank financing was generally referred to as shadow banking.  It was a term that was quite pejorative and likely to inflame legislators and policy makers.  It is really over the past 18 months or so that people have begun to call it what it is - markets-based financing.</p> <p>  A simple comparison, however, between the US and Europe can be misleading.  The US has always been a single market, with one language, a relatively uniform legal system and, proportionately, a much greater number of very large institutional investors.  Generally, across all regions of the US, investors have similar attitudes to risk. </p> <p>  In contrast, the EU has 28 legal systems, 24 languages and, more important, 28 different economies and differing national priorities.  There are 11 currencies and very different attitudes across the Union towards savings and investments.</p> <p>  For example, in Germany there is a marked predisposition to avoid risky, complex or new investment-type products.  The Commission's own supporting documentation shows that in the case of the US, 13.5% of the savings and investment assets of US citizens are in cash or deposits, while 31.2% of them are in shares and other equities.  In Germany, almost 41% is in cash and under 10% is in shares or other equities.  The diversity within Europe is evident from the fact that in Sweden, for example, only 16% of investments are in cash, with 33% in equities.  There is therefore a wide disparity across Europe.</p> <p>  Despite all of this complexity, the association welcomes the project.  The EU needs to eliminate barriers which impede the movement of capital both within the Union and between the EU and the rest of the world.  </p> <p>  The Green Paper is underpinned by a desire to see greater flows of capital markets funding into the SME sector.  As the debate unfolds, I suggest that a fundamental starting point is the adoption of some standardised definition of what an SME is.  The reality is that a small-sized enterprise in Germany would be a large business in Ireland, Latvia or a number of other EU member states.  </p> <p>  In Germany, a company with a market capitalisation of &euro;200 million is considered an SME, although that is larger than some companies listed on the Irish stock market.  For policy makers and legislators, it is important to have a common understanding of what is the target group of businesses, the target sector, of the real economy that this initiative is meant to address. </p> <p>  The Green Paper does, even if indirectly, acknowledge this issue because it identifies a range of measures which are necessary to build a capital markets union.  In some of the larger economies, all of the proposed measures are likely to have some merit.  However, in smaller economies such as Ireland's, some of the proposals will have much more relevance than others.  For example, I do not believe that relaxing the Prospectus Directive requirements would have a meaningful benefit for Irish SMEs as a whole.  Nor do I believe that initiatives to facilitate mini-bond markets or bond markets specifically aimed at SME issuers, would be of significant benefit to Irish SMEs.  I also believe that some innovative thinking may be needed for smaller member states, such as Ireland, to maximise the benefits which would emerge from a capital markets union.</p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to refer in these opening remarks to what I see as the greatest challenge to the success of this project.  Legislators will have to address the balance of regulation.  The Green Paper and supporting working papers acknowledge that the financing of SMEs and infrastructure represents long-term, illiquid investments with greater risk characteristics.  However, the largest sources of investment funds, the owners of funds, in the EU are insurance companies with assets of approximately &euro;8 trillion and pension funds with assets of approximately &euro;4 trillion.  Both of these owners of funds are currently heavily regulated.  In both cases, current and impending regulatory changes penalise, in one fashion or another, investment in long-term illiquid assets.</p> <p>  Having said that, in no way do I wish to narrow this debate to regulatory issues or to question the need for prudent regulation of pension funds or insurance companies.  However, if we are to encourage investment in SMEs and infrastructure, then legislators and policy makers will have to engage in this debate.  The process simply cannot work unless that debate is addressed.  </p> <p>  Institutional investors are keen to have new asset classes in which to invest, including loan origination funds and other real economy-friendly products.  We welcome Commissioner Hill&rsquo;s commitment to engage with providers of investment funds as the CMU project progresses.</p></speech>

BPFI is the voice of banking and payments in Ireland with over 70 members, including 35 international banks, which are represented by our affiliate organisation, the Federation of International Banks in Ireland, FIBI.</p> <p>  Our submission document includes some background information on capital markets union, CMU.  In the interests of time I would like to outline briefly what BPFI sees as the eight priorities for CMU at this initial stage.  First, CMU should enhance existing markets.  Policy makers need to avoid introducing measures that are likely to have negative impact on capital flows and investment.</p> <p>  Second, the Commission must ensure a level playing field between markets and EU and non-EU actors.  To ensure an effective Single Market, it is necessary to align regulations so that they do not act to prevent cross-border activities or distort competition.  So-called shadow banking activities should not benefit from less onerous or even preferential regulatory treatment and should be subject to the principle of same risk, same rules.  </p> <p>  Third, the single rulebook must be completed by close convergence of supervisory practices that must be effectively and consistently enforced across all member states.  Member states should not be competing on legislation but instead competing on business-friendly environments to attract investment.</p> <p>  Fourth, the CMU should emphasise the importance of liquidity and market making.  Liquid capital markets will boost the process of moving capital from slow-growing sectors to dynamic innovative industries and raise the confidence of investors.</p> <p>  Fifth, efficiencies in cross-border investments should be delivered with the removal of existing tax barriers.  Several tax barriers have been identified which impact negatively on cross-border investments, such as the complexity and cost of obtaining the tax relief.  We would like these to be addressed under CMU to promote cross-border activity.</p> <p>  Sixth is the improvement of financial education.  The Commission should take steps to improve the level of financial education in the EU, for both retail investors and SMEs.  This would help retail investors to better understand the functioning of capital markets and their role within markets, while SMEs would benefit from increased knowledge of possible funding options available within capital markets.</p> <p>  Seventh &ndash; our last two priorities are shared with the Commission as seen by their consultations on the prospectus directive and on securitisation &ndash; we would like to ease the burden on firms going to market and to see a review of the prospectus directive.  The threshold for producing the prospectus should be significantly higher to ease the burden on SMEs.  A revised prospectus directive should make it easier and cheaper for firms to go to market, while still preserving a high level of investor protection.</p> <p>  Finally, we would like to restore the economics of and revise the rules for securitisation.  The Commission needs to revitalise the market for simple, standard and transparent securitisations.  This should include a revision of the capital requirements for securitisations and recalibration of regulations on simple, standard and transparent securitisations.  We support the Commission&rsquo;s Green Paper on capital markets union and its desired outcomes of increasing the pool and variety of finance available, improving cross-border investment opportunities and making the economy more resilient to economic shocks.</p> <p>  I thank the members for their time and look forward to their questions.</p></speech>

There are some obvious advantages to CMU.  Transaction costs are reduced, competition is increased - in theory, anyway - and the end consumers, be they SMEs, large organisations or citizens, should see the advantages of that through lower prices and lower costs of financing.  There is also an obvious danger, however.  I do not know if the committee is doing a report on the Green Paper but I believe it is weak and written as if the last 15 years had not happened.  It lists all the advantages, which are real, yet there is not a single word about the fact that it was the free movement of capital that caused the bubble and subsequent collapse.  It is a very intellectually and technically weak piece of work, which is what I want to ask the witnesses' opinions on.</p><p>Obviously, it is not in BPFI's or its members' interests for us to repeat the mistakes of the past.  When the euro was set up we had a massive jump in how easy it was for European money to move across borders.  We were into a single currency, there was all manner of lining up of regulations.  It became much easier to move money and capital between eurozone borders.  In Ireland this tsunami of hot money came in.  There was a massive asset price bubble, the money got pulled back out again, the bubble collapsed, the banking sector was destroyed, the economy was destroyed and so on.  The single trigger of that event, although there were failings across the country in banking, politics, regulation and all of that, was the creation of the eurozone and the substantial increase in ease of capital moving around.</p><p>The now famous Reinhart and Rogoff book, <i>This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly</i>, tracks 800 years of financial crashes.  It is a big book with a very simple message that capital has been swishing around the world for centuries and leaving an awful lot of destruction in its wake.  This has not been the case all the time, as capital has obviously been useful and a lot of good things have been built because investors could move money around so that supply could meet demand.  Nonetheless, what we are seeing now?</p><p>McKinsey released a report, &quot;Debt and (not much) deleveraging&quot; in February, which looked around the world at what has happened in terms of corporate, financial sector and government debt.  Contrary to what everyone thought was going to happen, namely that debt would go down and governments, households and everybody would deleverage, actually debt has just gone up and up.  It is pump primed by a few things such as the Chinese central bank, the Fed, and now of course the European Central Bank with quantitative easing, QE.  Trillions of euro are being made available basically for free on a weekly basis to banks and other institutions around Europe.  They are buying sovereign paper with it and government yields are going down, which is a useful thing, but we are also seeing another asset price bubble.  House prices have shot up 50% in the last two years and we are going to see that spilling over into equities and so on.  Bond yields have fallen and we are back in another cycle of debt-fuelled growth.</p><p>The real economy is growing at a fraction of the pace at which the capital markets are growing.  We are all being lulled into this sense that we are back, while in fact we are not.  Central banks around the world are printing money and we are simply continuing debt-fuelled consumption.  Engineers, scientists, shopkeepers and people in the real world are not becoming more productive as quickly as the amount of capital and balancing debt is.</p><p>Can I ask each of the witnesses, in the context of what has happened with money being able to flow around and in and out of the eurozone much more easily and given that there are obvious advantages which the Green Paper has laid out, if they are worried there is an unintended consequence in the form of another repeat of hot money destroying the economy or parts of it?  Is there anything that should be done as part of CMU to try to stop some of the damage that global capital markets can cause?</p></speech>

In terms of the single rulebook, close convergence of supervisory practices of non-banks and banks is what we would look for.

The Commission is very much in listening mode and we are engaging with the Commission.  We participated in a workshop with the Commission and the Department of Finance today.  The Commission will look to build on the priorities.  It is too early to have those kind of concerns because we have not seen the end game.  Once we see the end game we can formulate whether there are concerns.  However, I am confident that the correct safeguards for protection will be put in place and that the single rule book and the insurance of the convergence of regulatory practices across non-banks and banks will protect against that.</p></speech>

I will separate the information into a couple of parts.  There are risks associated with quantitative easing and they are not necessarily the same risks associated with capital markets union.  The interesting question will be, at the point at which quantitative easing will be unwound, where we will be in the capital markets union project when that happens.</p> <p>  Speaking for our sector we are a regulated business so there are very strict product rules, for example, about what one can invest in any fund which is distributed.  There are rules around what type of entity can manage an alternative investment fund.  There are rules around European long-term investment funds.  There is an existing body of regulation that has meant that even with regard to some of the well documented difficulties over past years these tended not to happen as much in a regulated fund or product space, which is why funds are important.  I would not necessarily concur with Mr. Purtill's view that the same rules that apply to banks should apply to non-banks.  The rules that applied to banking did not necessarily always work.  There is a fundamental and structural difference.  For example, if a depositor gives money which is put on a balance sheet to be deployed in various mechanisms or ways, that is different to a contractual relationship wherein a depositor gives money for a particular investment purpose within particular product rules because that is a totally different activity.  What we are trying to establish with capital markets union is the premise that a singularity or a single way in financing the economy in itself brings risks with it.  Therefore, having a range of financing mechanisms is of benefit.  That is by no means to say that funds are right or banks are wrong.  All of these important sources need to be brought to bear and they all have a benefit.</p> <p>  In terms of knowing one's customer, Ireland as a jurisdiction has been very much to the forefront in exchange of information and in its obligations under the OECD with regard to transparency to ensure clear information with regard to the regulated funds' activity and as to the identity of investors in the funds.  There will always be risks of capital movement.  The down side is that if we want commercial activity, which involves a risk, we must have capital to fund it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank O'Dwyer" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015033100002#L00400"><p>I have a sense that some of this is behavioural, in an odd way.  A number of years ago I heard Lord Turner speak about the early documentation that underpinned the idea of a single currency.  That think-tank process in Europe envisaged that a British citizen could walk into a bank in Paris and get a mortgage and that we would all be integrated.  However, this did not happen.  There is a national approach with regard to investment and capital markets.  If within CMU we come up with some form of regulated way or regulated product where SME loans can be pooled and sold, it is likely that a pool of French loans will be sold to French people and Irish loans will be sold to Irish people.  Irish investment managers, French banks or German insurance companies, all competing in a CMU, will all be pushing product into their own jurisdictions.  I have a sense that this kind of behaviour is a risk.  I would love to point to lots of detailed research but it is more a strong sense.</p> <p>  After the banking crisis we saw financial nationalism taking action as every non-domestic bank pulled its assets out of Ireland and other jurisdictions.  That kind of thing might also be at play at some level in the capital markets union.  It is not a very scientific answer but I just have a sense that there is some behavioural stuff going on there.</p></speech>

Why is he so ambitious for Ireland to be the bridge between Asia and Ireland?  What is so distinctive about Ireland that we could aspire to being the bridge builder with Asia?</p> <p>  In respect of the matter that has arisen about quantitative easing, QE, I would have thought that the decision that policy-makers have to make and had to make at the time that Mr. Draghi and his board made the decision, was that it was a question of QE versus a eurozone economy in a tail spin in terms of further deflation throughout the eurozone and that the actions taken by Mr. Draghi were motivated by the fact that CMU is a quite separate concept.</p></speech>

I think such an assumption would be a mistake.  It is an issue of scale.  If we loosely define the "S" part of SME in the larger economies with market capitalisation of say, &euro;20 million or &euro;25 million, at the top end, to be &euro;200 million, that rules out a direct value to large chunks of the real economy in Ireland.  However, I mentioned innovative approaches.  One is an indirect benefit to the extent that there is an ability of banks to pool portfolios of loans and then that there are investors able to take those securitised products and leave yet more head room for the banks to lend within their capital bases.  That is an indirect benefit.</p> <p>  There are ways of being innovative.  Large institutional investors in Europe possibly considering a play on the Irish economy might look at a pool of loans that are with the acknowledged leading edge end of Enterprise Ireland's food and agri-sector companies or maybe the technology or the financial cechnology side or life sciences.  If they have some way of pooling together the best of what we have I could conceive of people being interested.  It would not be directly going to a life sciences company that needs a couple of million euro but maybe in some form of aggregation.  People would take an interest in it because they would say, touch wood, that these sectors in Ireland are well done, well managed, outward looking and that there is upside there.  In that sense I think we need to be smart about how we think about it as directly impacting in terms of medium and long term funding into what we in Ireland call SMEs.</p><p> A good example is a session organised by the Department of Finance at the Stock Exchange a number of months ago about the concept of mini bonds.  There are mini bond markets in Germany and UK.  Market participants and investors made the point that the minimum cost to a company to get together a bond prospectus and some form of specialist investor rating is probably &euro;250,000 including legal fees, tax fees and accounting fees.  That means the minimum ticket size of the bond issue is between &euro;8 million and &euro;10 million.  The number of companies in Ireland that cannot access bank finance and for which a bond issue of between &euro;8 million and &euro;10 million solves the problem is small.  In that context, we must examine the matter.</p></speech>

The standard definition of an SME in EU terms is any business employing up to 250 employees.  The reality is that 91% of SMEs in this country are employing fewer than ten people.  Let us look at the impact on the SME sector of capital market union here and in other countries.  Talking to business representative bodies, I have recently discovered that the vast majority of SMEs in other countries are also quite small.  Ireland is not unique in that respect.  We all share the concern about this challenge.  The previous speakers, Mr. Mark O'Mahoney from Chambers Ireland and Ms Regina Breheny, alluded to the same.  Either we can collectively focus policymakers at European level to make an element of capital market union realistically tangible for the cohort of SMEs, 91% of them in this country, or else we acknowledge that capital markets union will always be about the 9% of SMEs in this country that have been scaled up.  The figure might actually be 3% or 4% of companies in this country of that scale.  It is a challenge that is recognised to some extent by everyone but we have the opportunity at this early stage to interrogate it and challenge it.  If we cannot succeed in that regard, we must make sure collectively that the message does not go out that capital markets union is for SMEs because SMEs in Ireland mean the joinery works in Wicklow employing eight people or the restaurant in Dublin employing seven people.  That may not be the typical SME that will benefit in any way from capital markets union.</p></speech>

The comment about the regulatory environment reflected the investment funds context, whether for broad distribution to retail and institutional investors - UCITS - and in the alternative investment funds area, and to respond to concerns about the movement of capital.  We have already seen a 25 year track record, with good success, in a regulated investment funds framework in Europe encouraging savings, which is part of what CMU is about, and doing it in a way that has investor protection and utility from the investor point of view at its core.</p> <p>  The second point was about Ireland's role as a bridge.  I keep going back to UCITS, which is the longest standing product construct in Europe, with 25 years reputation.  I speak from an Irish point of view in terms of economic activity and employment.  The services provided here allow us to connect managers, providers of investment strategies from some 50 different countries around the world, and to help to deliver the investment strategies and collect investment capital to investors in 70 countries around the world.  A creation of Europe in UCITS allowed us to take on a greater role far beyond its original intention or inclination.</p> <p>  I highlight Asia from a demographic perspective and a wealth perspective.  In CMU, the European long-term investment fund, LTIF, proposal is one where we are trying to get an ageing population and ageing infrastructure in Europe to see more economic investment, which provides downstream activity.  My overall hope is that it will provide benefit if we can, as we have successfully done funds in other parts of internationally traded financial services, position ourselves to bring together the providers of solutions and the providers of capital.</p> <p>  There are two parts to the final question.  My comments about quantitative easing were not a critique of quantitative easing.  As a decision and a mechanism, it is absolutely appropriate in the circumstances in which the policymakers found themselves in.  CMU must create liquid markets and if we leave the market to itself that is fine but quantitative easing creates an external influence on market by introducing liquidity.  At some point the liquidity must be removed and at the point at which the liquidity is removed, the question is what impact it has if there are broader and more liquid markets.</p> <p>  My final comment ties in SMEs and broader concerns.  The benefits to Ireland in CMU can be in two respects.  I will describe one as direct and the other as indirect.  In the direct point of view, it may provide financing from the SME point of view.  Whether a larger number of SMEs get direct financing is a question none of us can answer.  However, if the way CMU operates allows banks to securitise in a clear and a safe way and recycle capital on their balance sheet, it may create more lending capacity.  That is one possible benefit.  The broader benefit is one I describe as indirect.  If Ireland as a location, as a country and as a provider of export services, can position itself, what does it do?  It creates benefits in employment and in revenue for the State.  From the SME perspective, if there is an announcement in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Kilkenny and Drogheda, places where our industry is present, it not only creates direct employment in those enterprises but also creates the other key thing SMEs need, which is business.  Financing a business is one thing for an SME but creating demand for it is another.  There is a dual opportunity and we hope, as we develop, that we can create a broader employment footprint as we look at the opportunities in the direct and indirect sense provided by CMU.</p></speech>

When the Fed turned off the tap, it did not go so well.  However, it is not just about that.  If CMU is in place in four years' time, this would be round 1 of quantitative easing.  We have just started another asset price bubble and the ECB will fuel a bubble through quantitative easing.  Something will happen in the next five or six years and we will see another collapse and then the ECB will do exactly what the Fed did and turn it back on.  We are into a quite standard boom and bust asset bubble burst, fuelled by monetary policy or quantitative easing.  If we are talking about how easy it becomes to move money around the Union, the fact that the money tap is being used in a very serious way is relevant.  They are flooding the market with liquidity and we are talking about making it easier for that liquidity to move around the market.  I agree but what the witnesses are talking about is the end of phase 1 of quantitative easing and there will be second, third and fourth phases over the next 20 years.  I will ask a further question.</p></speech>

It is a bit like gazing into a crystal ball, but in simple terms, if it is as I understand it, the mechanics of CMU should, first, create a wider range of financing options, which in itself should bring a competitive dynamic to the marketplace and perhaps indirectly feed into the provision of finance across a range of channels.  Second, it could lead to a lowering in the cost of funds, which should conceivably give rise to scope for lower retail-priced finance at the consumer or SME stage.  That is the theory of it, but it remains to be seen if the process will deliver that way.  As I understand it, that would be the theory that should conceivably deliver that sort of picture.</p></speech>

Someone must deal with whatever security is being provided.  Unless we have harmonised insolvency law and the bits of contract law that matter, when one has more than one set of lawyers looking at different languages and legal principles, one will not achieve lower financing cost benefits.  The way the system needs to progress is to take bite-sized things that are doable and achievable.  If we are going to wait until we have harmonised legislation on insolvency in Europe to decide the priorities on liquidation and how one exercises a security, then it will be 2020 before we achieve efficiencies.  My view is that we need to look at the bits that might work and get those into play fast.</p></speech>

As a general point, in terms of investment fund provision, we have seen the associated cost go down as it has become a bigger, deeper and broader market.  I am extrapolating to say that I would see something similar.</p> <p>  I will make one final comment, as I know we are tied for time.  There is no single measure, change or silver bullet that represents a fully integrated CMU.  I completely agree with Mr. O&rsquo;Dwyer&rsquo;s point that it is a series of measures.  It is about trying to find out how one eases and frees up things in different areas incrementally to try to move the situation forward, because we are not starting off from the same place.  The aim is to try to bring everyone closer to the same place, but we are not starting from that point.</p></speech>

In terms of the cost of funds for SMEs, for example, if bank funding is 70% and the remaining 30% is equity, CMU proposes innovative solutions in that space, including venture capital, angel investors and crowd-funding.  If they are successful, that should bring down the cost of funds for SMEs.</p> <p>  On the banking side, there has been a consultation paper on securitisation.  If that recalibrates regulations around securitisation to make it more attractive and revive the market, whether on capital risk rates or the liquidity coverage ratio on insolvency, then it will allow banks to de-risk and to transfer risk off their balance sheets, which will drive down their cost of funds, and the benefits will be passed on to the consumer.  A number of things should lead to a reduction in the cost of funds for SMEs.</p></speech>

The concept of opening up funding to the SME sector outside traditional banking and opening up investment opportunities for retail and SME investors is very positive.  It is a very ambitious plan.  The one thing that really needs to be pointed out is that we have just had the most stunning bond market rally in Ireland.  Irish bonds, even from the past three years, have collapsed from 6% down to 0.25% for five-year money and 0.7% for ten-year money.  It is a stunning market rally.  However, &euro;90 billion worth of retail investor money was on deposit with banks during that period, earning practically nothing - 2% net of DIRT at 41%, earning practically 1%.  So we have a large investor base and a bond market, neither of which visited each other in that period of time.  If the investors had been in bonds, which more or less carry the same risk, they would be sitting on a 6% tax-free return for five-year money, or a 35% tax-free return if they were in ten-year bonds.  </p> <p>  If we are going to build a capital markets union, we must ask what is wrong with the current capital markets structure that the investor cannot find the returns that are there in the capital markets.  First, we must ask who made those massive returns.  The Irish bond market is &euro;220 billion.  If someone even bought &euro;10 billion of it, they would have a profit of &euro;5 billion in a three-year period, which is stunning.  </p> <p>  The reality is that the investor market is not sophisticated enough to understand bonds.  The investor market in Ireland only understands deposits.  It does not understand bonds.  More worryingly, the financial services sector is not sophisticated enough to sell bonds.  One must ask why it did not sell bonds to its clients.  It certainly bought them itself.  Why was the Irish investor not in the bond market?  Why was it only foreign hedge funds who made those fortunes?  One US hedge fund walked away with &euro;4.5 billion in profit from the Irish bond market.  Why was the investor not in the bond market?  If we are going for a big capital markets union to expand it, we must start with the present.  My contention is that there is a massive lack of education.  Reading through the paper, there is very little that is related to education - only one sentence.  The paper is massively short on education.  To get the SME to issue a bond into the future requires a huge amount of education to get the SME up that curve.</p><p>To get the investor community to buy a bond requires a huge level of education but, unfortunately, to get the financial services professionals to sell a bond also requires a high level of education.  I do not believe someone can go into a local bank branch and ask for a bond instead of a deposit.  If someone had done that three or five years ago, they would be worth a lot of money now.  Unfortunately, it was a product that was not on offer.  It is the lack of focus on education in the Green Paper that I find disappointing.  I believe there is a huge level of education to be done before we get to a wider capital markets union.  That must be a focus in the Green Paper.</p><p> There is a lot of reliance on the concept of regulation, but I want to state that the investor is not comforted by more regulation.  Regulation did not stop Lehman Brothers from going bust.  It did not stop the United Kingdom banks from going bust.  It did not stop the Irish banks from going bust.  Regulation does not stop banks from going bust.  It does not stop poor financial products from hitting the street.  It is education that stops people from buying poor financial products.  It is education that stops financial institutions from issuing poor financial products.  For some of the investment products linked to the capital markets that were released by major financial institutions during the Celtic tiger period, one would have to ask how a product so poor could get through the board, the management team, the product development team and the point of sales team.  The answer to products like that ending up on the street is education.  It was not that they deliberately wanted to sell poor products; they were just not educated enough to actually do it correctly.</p><p> I welcome the Green Paper.  It is very important that SMEs have an alternative source of funding, because Irish banks will be stressed into the future.  Irish banks cannot raise funds at the same price they could previously.  Before the crash, Irish banks raised money in the wholesale market, just as Deutsche Bank, Barclay's or Royal Bank of Scotland could do.  That has changed.  They have to pay more for their funds now so they will charge higher rates to their customers.</p><p> Greater access to funding is a very positive step, as is access to the capital markets for the investor, but we need to realise in the paper that a good deal of education will be required.</p></speech>

Like Mr. Brown, generally speaking I would be a supporter, but a much more cautious supporter, of the idea, for a number of reasons I will outline.</p> <p>  I second Mr. Brown's point about the education, which is a very important issue in financial markets in general and is certainly lacking here.  I agree with his view that regulation does not stop crises.  We have seen that before.  What does help in addition to education, but is not covered sufficiently in the capital markets Green Paper so far, is the issue of enforcement of regulations.  That is a major issue that we have witnessed in this country, for example, in regard to bank lending in the past.</p> <p>  I will give the members a summary of my view of the EU proposals in general.  First, the European Commission is correct in its analysis of the current state of play and also the pre-crisis state of play in capital markets for SME funding.  The European SMEs certainly do not raise enough debt in direct markets - in other words, in the form of corporate bonds.  They do not have significant issuance in terms of equity - shares in the markets - and historically they have over-relied on bank credit.  Bank credit is not the optimal source of funding for SMEs.  Traditionally, around the world, although not so much in the EU, it is primarily used to fund the operational costs of the SMEs rather than capital expenditure and capital expansion.  It is not suitable for long-term finance and, as such, it is a higher-cost, higher-volatility and uncertain source of funding.  </p> <p>  As a result of that, we have an objective we share with the European Union, and I agree with it that we need to move the SMEs towards more stable and broader sources of funding, including much more reliance on capital markets, particularly on bond markets for issuance of the bonds, and also on equity markets.  However, the European Commission sets targets for policy interventions that are well intentioned in many ways but occasionally contradictory, and I will highlight some of those shortly.</p> <p>  The European Commission presents no substantive case in terms of the main thesis that underlies its proposed reforms.  That is, it claims that a greater degree of capital markets reorganisation is needed to alter the composition of sources of funding for the SMEs, but does not prove the case that it is needed.  To my best knowledge, there is not really any empirical evidence to support that assertion, either in Ireland or outside Ireland.  If we look at countries where different models of funding have been used, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, they all have diverse markets.  Within the United States there are numerous market platforms which are very different from each other from a regulatory, issuance and cost perspective and in terms of the types of enterprise and the types of instrument on which they trade.  There are regional stock exchanges.  There are specialist stock exchanges.  There are over-the-counter markets.  All of them are non-harmonised in many ways and all of them are functioning.  However, in Europe, where there is the same level of diversification in the markets, the same desired result is not being achieved.  Something else is amiss.</p> <p>  Most of the evidence, including from the US market, suggests that the market differences are not as important.  They are important on the margin but not important overall in terms of what SMEs seek with regard to funding sources, which is a crucial issue.  SMEs both in Ireland and in the EU tend not to go for equity financing.  They tend to go for bank loans, usually a securitised bank loan backed by security through some asset, traditionally property.  They also do not seek equity issuance as such, because often these are family firms which do not like dilution by external investors.  Also, external investors do not show much interest.  For example, if we look at the experience of the market in the UK and Irish Enterprise Exchange, IEX, here in Ireland, we cannot say there is a huge interest among professional and institutional investors in low-liquidity, high-volatility, smaller SME types of startup.  Those markets are present and nobody is coming into them.  There is certainly thin trading.</p> <p>  Overall, some of the proposals by the European Commission represent positive steps in the right direction, which I will list.  A push for better regulation and supervision of investor protection is very important in those markets.  We have seen that happen before in alternative investment markets, where the lack of regulation has resulted in mis-selling, so we might as well address that, and it will help investors to come into the market with a little more confidence in terms of SME shares and loans.  </p> <p>  The proposals for standardising basic filing and reporting information for SMEs are also positive, as long as they reduce the overall quantum of the regulatory and compliance burden.  That has to be meaningful.  There is not enough granularity in the proposals to make that judgment, but let us hope they are progressed.  Streamlining and reducing the burdens imposed by the prospectus directive, which is mentioned explicitly in the Green Paper, is always welcome, but only if it reduces overall quantum of burden.</p> <p>  Many proposals by the European Commission contained in the Green Paper are of dubious value in terms of attaining the stated objectives of the Green Paper of enhancing the capital markets for the SMEs.  I will list some examples.  The idea of co-ordinated and pan-European private placement regimes is dubious in value because private placement regimes are diverse regimes.  They cover different types of equity and different types of hybrid deal such as equity together with debt.  They cover different forms of debt.  By their nature they are private placements and, as a result, they are much more targeted towards individual securities and individual issuers.  Harmonising those will be very difficult, and I am not sure there is a value added in that.</p> <p>  Another example is mixing two different targets within a single set of reforms.  What do I mean by that?  There are two targets listed in the Green Paper.  One of those is the pursuit of better and greater funding for SMEs, which is welcome, and the other is the pursuit of enhanced infrastructure and long-term investment projects funding.  Those two objectives are contradictory.  SMEs generally do not participate in large infrastructure projects.  They do not benefit from equity or debt raised directly for those projects and, as a result, if we increase funding in one area, given that the quantum of liquidity overall in funding available in the market stays the same, we decrease the funding available potentially in the other area as well.</p> <p>  Focusing on enhancing securitisation markets is positive overall, but again contradictory in terms of the objective of raising more equity funding for SMEs and reducing the debt for SMEs, because securitisation relates primarily to bank lending.  The banks take and securitise the debt and then sell those debt-securitised packages into the markets.  That is all fine, but it does not free the investors to invest more into SMEs in the form of equity or direct debt issuance.</p><p> Harmonising the markets for equity and bond issuance as a means of expanding the appeal for foreign and internal cross-border EU investment flows is a questionable objective.  Investments from outside and within the EU flow across borders not only on the basis of the risk-adjusted returns pursued, but also on the basis of hedging and risk management within investor portfolios.  If one harmonises markets across the EU, one effectively reduces the ability of the different assets listed on different platforms to act as hedge or risk instruments.  As a result, one can reduce the quantum of liquidity available in those markets.</p><p> I would cautiously support the overall objectives of the Green Paper and some of its main aspects, but a crucial point is that it is missing the first order of policy priorities, which are not related to the market union.  Rather, they relate to the structure within which small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, work with financial service providers and raise finance in general.  They overlap with the paper issued today by the IMF covering non-performing loans to SMEs in the EU.  There are four policy priorities, which I will briefly outline before moving on to questions.</p><p> The first policy priority is to reduce regulatory and tax incentives for SMEs to raise bank debt over and above equity.  This is crucial from the point of view of Ireland and the wider EU.  Currently, we effectively subsidise or support debt issuance and debt raising by companies over and above equity.  This is true for larger corporations and SMEs.  I will cite an example.  In the current proposal under the financial transaction tax, the states of the EU-11 that signed up to it are treated differently in equity and bond trades.  The bond trades are taxed at 0.01% and the equity trades are taxed at 0.1%.  A penalty of ten times is applied to equity trades.  The capital gains taxes applied to equity trades do not apply to bond trades.  The taxation of the bond trade's overall structure incentivises more debt raising than equity.  We must deal with this issue.  Capital gains tax will have to be addressed.</p><p> The second policy priority is to expand access to existing pools of investors instead of first trying to attract external investors.  The largest untapped pool of investors in Ireland, in addition to those whom Mr. Brown mentioned, are those who are working for SMEs.  They can be granted access to employee share ownership schemes and employee equity, but these are not tax efficient.  We have been discussing this for a number of years and Ireland used to have the right tool to incentivise companies to issue equity to their employees.  We undid that tool through subsequent legislation.  Reviewing this situation is probably priority number two if not number one, as it would give us access to available resources.</p><p> Policy priority number three is to enhance, streamline and reform the EU-wide system of insolvency, business insolvency resolution, resolution of bankruptcy and resolution of non-performing loans.  The IMF has done an excellent job on this front and has outlined what the EU-wide proposals should be and their scope, so I will not repeat them.  I will direct members to the IMF's paper, which was published 33 minutes ago, entitled, Tackling Small and Medium Sized Enterprise Problem Loans in Europe.  It is available on the IMF's website.  I would be happy to provide the link.</p><p> The final policy priority is to identify key objectives in longer term reforms.  Some of the reforms that have been proposed are contradictory.  We must figure out what we want in Europe.  Do we want enterprises that are raising more equity and funded on a long-term basis by investors who are interested in staying with enterprises for five years, for example?  In that case, we will need to incentivise them and give them derogations from, or a total write-off of, capital gains tax.  Alternatively, do we pursue the restoration of the traditional model whereby banks loaned on a relationship basis backed by collateral, usually relating to the property?</p><p> I will stop now.  I hope that I have given the committee an idea of my views.</p></speech>

I have raised a matter at all of today's sessions.  When I read through the Green Paper, it worried me because it was intellectually weak and there was no counterfactual analysis or risk assessment.  It felt like it was written by a cheerleader for free capital markets.  Obviously, reducing transaction costs is good and diversifying sources of funding is useful.  There has been much discussion of the debt-for-equity financing over the banking model.  However, the last 15 years have shown us categorically that the poorly regulated free movement of capital, particularly now that the quantitative easing, QE, tap has been turned on, can be a profoundly dangerous and damaging thing.  Not a single paragraph in the Green Paper mentions that if we make it easier for capital to flow around, into and out of the eurozone, there are associated risks.  Dr. Gurdgiev mentioned one, namely, stripping away some of the ability to arbitrage or spread risk over various macroeconomic situations among eurozone members.  Is either witness concerned by the paper's lack of critical thinking or suggestion of the risks associated with freeing up capital movement into and within the eurozone?</p></speech>

Documents and Green Papers are not my expertise, but I view this as a long journey during which the issues that the Deputy rightly outlined will come to the fore.  This paper is premature, as our capital markets and investors do not meet.  We have much work to do before we can get off the ground and head into some of the complex issues to which the Deputy referred.  It will be a long, drawn out process with many hurdles that mean it might never happen, for example, the financial transaction tax, the uniformity across Europe that would be required to get something like this through, etc.  This is not a final document that will address the issues raised by the Deputy, but a starting point on a concept.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Constantin Gurdgiev" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015033100002#Q00500"><p>I will quote the third sentence in the preamble: "But to strengthen investment for the long term, we need to build [there is no argument about that] a true single market for capital &ndash; a Capital Markets Union for all 28 Member States."  The Deputy is correct in the sense that the EU does not allow in this paper any derogation from the core concept of a singular market.  The question then becomes one of what the singular market is.</p> <p>  I am concerned by the lack of substantive assessment, listing and pricing, let alone analysis, of individual risks and the potential for things to go wrong.  I am also concerned by the general approach that the EU has taken recently to a great deal of regulation, for example, the idea that harmonisation repairs all of the problems, that we need a genuine monetary union and a banking union, and that we need a unified tax system across financial services.  This approach to policy making hinges on the extreme technocratic assumption that, once a particular union is in place, the regulation and supervision mechanisms built around it will function perfectly in addressing the future known and unknown challenges.  We know from the history of finance that this is not the case.  For example, Professor Franklin Allen of the Wharton School has put on record that, historically, all of the large systemic financial crises had a similar pattern - overconfidence by regulators who, after the crisis, build institutions to address the causes of the previous crisis, with the financial services hiring the brightest young people to bypass those regulations, leading to more crises, which are usually of greater proportions and of a higher frequency.  Nothing in the EU's approach would prevent this vicious cycle from repeating.  That worries me.</p> <p>  From the point of view of today and the future, it is none the less important that we consider whether we should fund our companies, entrepreneurs and enterprises through equity, the banks' relationships or the direct markets of bonds issuance.  Giving investors and enterprises access to a more diversified base allows for better risk management and targeting, that is, ensuring the suitability of particular investment vehicles to the objectives of the enterprise and the investor.</p> <p>  Mr. Brown raised crucial caveats.  Education is important for investors, companies and regulators.</p><p>Another issue I raised is supervision, not just the regulation.  The issue the Deputy raised is crucial as well, the nitty-gritty details of how we assess those policies, how we write them and how we structure them.  That remains to be done in the future, and none of it is done here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015033100002#R00200"><p>The people who were here earlier today were speaking about the fact that this would diversify risk, there would be securitisation and so forth.  It was like being in America in the early 2000s.  It was the same conversation: "We will make it easier and we will make the markets more efficient.  The markets know how to allocate risk and everything will be good."  It is unsettling to listen to very well intentioned people saying that this time will be different.</p> <p>  I have two more questions.  I am very taken by the idea of equity financing and the fact that we do not have much of it here.  It is a longer-term, steadier, less volatile financing mechanism for Irish SMEs or bigger companies.  We do not do much of it.  When I talk to venture capitalists outside Ireland and ask them why that is the case they do not talk about regulation or the items in the Green Paper.  They talk about a culture.  They tell me that, in their experience, the problem for people in Ireland is that founders think in terms of three to five year exits.  They tell me that if one talks to somebody in Boston or London who is founding a company, they will talk about what they want their company to be 20 years hence.  However, they say that if one talks to an Irish entrepreneur, they talk about the amount of money they think they can clear in three years and exit.  That has nothing to do with regulation but is an entirely cultural issue.  Does the witness think anything can be done about that?  I am not convinced.  We are in the realm of total speculation, but I do not know whether the culture will trump making it easier for equity products to come here.</p> <p>  I will conclude with the following question.  Do the witnesses think that bringing in a CMU will substantively reduce the cost of borrowing for SMEs in Ireland?</p></speech>

Irish SMEs are small, family owned and not big corporations.  As was pointed out, what is classified as an SME in Germany would be considered a large company in Ireland.  How adaptable is this model?  Are we stuck with the bank financing model because that is just the structure of our SMEs or is it possible that we can move to equity based financing?  Is there a model for it or are we simply not at the races, to put it mildly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Brown" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015033100002#R00400"><p>The answer is that we are too small, to be brutally honest.  The SMEs are too small and we are too small.  The people who would buy that type of equity are not in Ireland but are abroad, and Ireland is too small a market.  One could create a very tiny market but it would have no liquidity and would not attract anything.</p> <p>  I was talking to an SME during the week and I can give the committee an idea of what SMEs are struggling with.  The enterprise is an importer and must buy dollars.  The dollar has risen by 30% since May 2014.  I said to the person that surely his bank brought him in and gave some support and advice on it, but there was no contact from the bank at all.  He said their bank would not have the expertise to even discuss it with the enterprise.  When one starts from there, one is then looking at SMEs raising equity, floating it and so forth.  To be honest, it is a step too far for our SMEs.  There are a small number, perhaps in the technology area, but they are in the venture capital area to a greater extent than in any other area.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Donnelly, there is a culture of how quickly one can get one's company to profit, what is its worth and how quickly one can get the money.  We suffer from that culture in the SME sector, unfortunately.  The reality is that the Irish market is not sophisticated and the financial services professionals within it are not as sophisticated as they would like a person to think they are.  My company is involved in diplomas in investing and in educating the investor to see that there are alternatives to just leaving one's money on deposit in a bank.  However, it is a very scary thing for many people to mention a bond because they will be asked what it is.  The level of education on the investor side is very small and certainly a leap into buying SME stocks is a long way away.</p></speech>

One reaches a certain point and it is very hard to grow the company beyond that point because of access to capital and to expertise.  Is it cultural or is it because the system is set up that way?</p></speech>

Access to capital is certainly an issue, and scaling is an issue.  The market is very small.  If one is concentrated on Ireland and the Irish market, it is very small.  Then there is an international dimension and a scale.  There are challenges in that regard.  There is no question that many Irish SMEs are small, family run companies and if people get a pension out of them they will sell them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Constantin Gurdgiev" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015033100002#R00700"><p>The issue of scaling is very important.  We know that most of the Irish SMEs exit before reaching &euro;20 million in sales.  It is too early.  A three to five year horizon is about right, although sometimes it is a little longer, but it is usually driven by the quantum of what they can exit at in terms of the capital gains and the number of partners.  From that point of view the early stage funding by the VCs is certainly a disadvantage because one does not wish to dilute the equity very early.  However, the ability to develop the functional, if only small, or perhaps even integrated market with other European countries, in terms of the equity for those types of companies, can assist that process.  One can raise and liquify one's share through that market much more efficiently than by getting the full exit from the company, if one is a founder, and as a result of that one can go beyond &euro;20 million in sales, grow and raise funding for it.</p> <p>  In many ways it is a catch 22.  We do not see many companies which grow beyond &euro;20 million precisely because we do not have the capability for them to grow.  It is not so much the market size because most of the successful companies in Ireland are trading internationally to a large extent, so they do not have that problem.  They very quickly discover how to use the revenue base in the country to push themselves into the global markets.  There are many such successful companies.  However, giving companies a platform where they can grow without having to opt for not selling at all or selling the entire company would be advantageous in that context.  In the longer run I would be hopeful that we can develop far more functional SME and start-up equity or direct debt type of capital markets.  In the short term it is a challenge.  We already have one and it does not generate a great deal of interest.</p> <p>  In terms of the culture, we are not the only subject to the culture.  SMEs in Italy, for example, which are the backbone of the Italian economy to an even greater extent than is the case in Ireland, do not have the problem of staying longer.  These are multi-generational companies and family firms, and they have a very significant issue in terms of going to the market and either raising debt in the markets outside of the banks or issuing equity into the markets.  What drives their consideration of not taking the equity market route for raising funding is the consideration of family ownership.  They want to have tight control of the ownership.  Cultures are different and cultures are always present.  In general, however, we should give companies the chance to make a choice regarding where they raise funding and not push them straight into the hands of the banks, especially given that the banking sector is not exactly performing and is not likely to be performing in an enterprise growth conducive way in the years to come.  It will be expensive for a number of reasons and it will be difficult to raise funds for companies in that sector.  We should be looking at the diversification.</p></speech>

One has to bi-locate and tri-locate in this place when one is in a small party.  Having listened to some of the discussion, I have not fully developed an expert understanding of what is being discussed so I am on a learning curve.  However, I would be very anxious and suspicious about all of this.  The labyrinthine and opaque world of international finance is quite terrifying.</p><p>Its capacity to unleash devastation on economies, really out of the blue as far as ordinary citizens are concerned, is a big problem.  That the vast majority of participants in the economy can suddenly be devastatingly affected by the ebbs, flows and shifts of international capital is one lesson we should draw from the recent bubble and burst. Private capital moves into areas where it thinks it can make a quick buck and it moves out just as fast when over investment in those areas leads to a bubble and a crash.  So one gets over-investment at one point and then an investment retrenchment and flight at another point.  On the face of it, this is just facilitating that process.  It is actually making a bad situation worse.  If one can pin point who are the investors and if there is a relationship between the investor and the enterprise, then one feels there is some transparency and maybe some potential  to control investment.  What we seem to be talking about here is facilitating anonymous investment from people who happen to have savings or accumulated capital, all over Europe, in different places, and who then throw their money into some vehicle, which will then invest it on the basis of getting a maximum return at any given point in time in another place.  So there is no relationship at all between the real economy and the investor.  To my mind that is just what led us into the mess in the first place.  So, sell me this, but I really do not see the advantage of it.  Can I put it to the witnesses, the problem which lies at the back of this, so far as I understood from the finance representative who was before the committee earlier-----</p></speech>

There is another way to deal with the problem of loads of privately accumulated capital and savings sitting there not invested in the real economy unless it is no risk and absolutely guaranteed to make a big profit - I thought capitalism is all about risk, but it appears it is not.  Private capital today is the enterprise of investing and ensuring no risk.  I believe we actually need to address the fundamental problem of risk averse private capital resulting in no investment.  What we need to do is take some of that money back from them and into the hands of public authorities, controlled by the people, in order to have democratic investment decisions.  That is the problem we grapple with - too much money concentrated in the hands of too few people.</p></speech>

However, now that we owe the capital markets &euro;220 billion there is very little we can do about the fact that we are involved in it.  We are not going to be uninvolved in the capital markets any time soon.  If it was up to me I would do financial markets education in schools so that school leavers would understand the difference between a variable and a tracker, understand the difference between different investment products and understand the effect that financial markets have on everyone's lives in their lifetime.  I fully agree with the Deputy that it is stunning how the financial markets can affect people's lives, wealth, jobs and security throughout their lives.  That is the way it is.  Once we have a capitalist society which chooses to borrow from the financial markets we are involved in the financial markets.  </p> <p>  I am in favour of improving the financial markets from the investor side.  Investors here have &euro;90 billion worth of retail deposits sitting in the bank, accepting risk but not getting a return.  They are using banks like a safety deposit box - they have some risk and are not getting a return for it.  They have missed out on the second greatest bond market rally this State has ever seen.  The reality is that the people who have walked away with all the money from the Irish bond market rally are foreign investors because nobody has educated the Irish investor to understand that there are other ways to make money in the capital markets besides deposits.  We need to educate people and open the financial markets and make them easier to access for the investor and the SME, so that the SME is not stuck all the time going to non-competitive banks to borrow their money.  That is an improvement.  In Ireland we are past the point of whether one likes the financial markets, because we owe so much money.  We are slaves to the bond market.  The interest rate we pay on our bonds is the most important determining factor of the future of this economy for decades to come, whether we like it or not.  It is hugely important how much we pay for our debt and at what rate we fund our debt.  Whoever earns interest from our debt is also hugely important.  I would much prefer to see Irish investors earn the interest from our debt than foreign hedge funds, which is exactly what has happened.  I am not here to defend the financial markets - but we are in them.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy it is tremendous, and it has been rising over time.  The crises becomes sharper and sharper, and with less and less space of time between them.  However, if one looks at the last crisis, it is not the equity market which caused any problem.  It was caused by instrumentation in some of the liberalised markets, such as securitised paper.  In other markets it was the creation of new instruments, again securitised paper is a good example, or asset backed securities or the most simple of all financial products, the bank loans.  It was the bank loans which brought down this country, not the stock market.  The stock market played a very little and a very tangential role in the entire crisis, as a follow up to what the banks were actually doing, because it reflected the banks valuations.  Quick moves in the markets worry the European Commission.  This is part and parcel of the several proposals that the European Commission put forward.  One of the explicit targets of the financial transaction tax, which I mentioned before, is to reduce the volatility in financial markets.  Without going into academic discussions of whether it is a good idea or a bad idea, the point is that in financial markets we can select those parts which work for us and use them to work for us.  We can down-play, regulate tightly, supervise tightly and decentivise the ones which do not.  With the capital market union proposal it is crucial to distinguish the long-hold equity investors - people who go into the businesses on a relationship basis, using only direct equity purchased through private equity, or through the lists of equities on the exchanges.  They buy the stock of a company and hold it for three, five or ten years.  In a number of countries around the world these investors are distinguished and rewarded with higher, tax adjusted returns by reducing their capital gains taxes - in some countries down to zero.  There are some incentives in Ireland but they are not sufficient.</p><p>If we want to discourage rapid moves by speculators in and out of the market we should encourage long-term investors who build their relationship on an activist basis by engaging with the company, participating with advice and opening access to the markets for them.  We can do that but we need to make sure the proposed union allows us to do it by incentivising those types of investors.  I do not mean we should positively incentivise them in the sense of giving something to them.  We should, however, level the playing field by, for example, having the same capital gains for somebody who puts money into an uncertain enterprise for five or six years as for a person who gives money to the Government by buying its bonds.  I do  not argue for over-incentivising investors but nor do I argue for subsidising holders of Government bonds, corporate bonds and the bonds of banks.  We should support equity and debt to the same extent but this is not, unfortunately, part of the proposal.</p><p> The question was asked whether capital markets investors were risk averse.  They are risk averse because all human beings are risk averse.  The only ones who have a risk preference are those who go to Las Vegas and play Russian roulette and they do not last very long.  Investors in the markets do not pursue a risk-free return but they do pursue a risk-adjusted return.  We should bear in mind that SMEs generally imply higher risk because they have higher rates of default and fewer assets, at the time of default, to be captured to compensate investors.  An investor in equity has the lowest priority when it comes to the liquidation of an enterprise which fails.  That is yet another asymmetry in the relationship between equity investors and debt investors.  Whether we like it or not the markets are the most efficient way to decide these things.  If we were to follow the Deputy's line and take money away from people to invest it we will trigger even bigger risk aversion - what is known in behavioural economics as "loss aversion" - which is when people run for the hills with all their money and there is nothing to capture and nothing to invest.</p></speech>

We can, however, work with the markets but my concern with the Green Paper is that it is unclear how much room it gives Ireland to work and how flexible we will be allowed to be in shaping a properly functioning market.

Securitisation is a way of packaging up assets and cleaning up the balance sheet.  One creates some room by hiving these assets off to somebody else who is at a distance and who cannot evaluate it as closely.  In doing so, one can do other things and it is thus an accelerant of credit in the market.  The markets boom and they bust.  They have done that since time immemorial and they are more than likely to do it again.</p> <p>  There are some stunning features of the market at the moment.  For example, Irish bond rates are at 0.25%.  When we owed &euro;40 billion people would only lend us money at 5% but now we owe &euro;240 billion people want to lend us money at 0.25%.  That is a stunning bubble and it has replaced the property bubble on banks' balance sheets.  If anything happened to the bond market we would be back to square one.  The market is full of risk all the time and securitisation is an accelerant of that so heavy levels of securitisation are not a good idea.</p></speech>

The markets function best when they are diversified and when different instruments are available.</p> <p>  In theory, securitisation is not a bad thing.  It is about packaging and pricing risk together and offloading that risk from the balance sheet of the institution to private investors so that the institution can free some of the resources to lend again.  When it is abused it is a bad thing, as it is when it is mispriced.  The key issue is the same as with the question of how to stop the excesses of bank lending.  We should look at placing the risk of mispricing risky assets in the hands of those who are paid to price those risks.  So, if a bank issues a securitised package and the package is mispriced, as might be evidenced by a mismatch in the ratings it is given and the quality of the underlying security and assets, the bank in question should be responsible for it.  It should be the same as if a car salesman sold a car which was supposed to be a certain year and a certain make but was not.  As long as we do not rescue or underwrite financial intermediaries, and provided we make sure they purchase their insurance in the open markets themselves, we will do away with a large part of the problem.</p> <p>  The second tier of protection is to have very robust enforcement of regulations, something that we have not seen in Ireland or elsewhere but which has contributed to the mispricing of risks in the markets.  Is securitisation evil?  No.  Can securitisation be used as an instrument for mispricing risk?  Most certainly, but so can cars or apples or oranges.</p></speech>

The Green Paper is only the first phase in a process that will run for a number of years.  Therefore the benefits of capital markets union, such as they may be, will only become apparent over time.  However, the Commission has set out clear high-level objectives for capital markets union.  They are to improve access to financing for all businesses across Europe, particularly small and medium enterprises, and improve investment projects such as infrastructure; increase and diversify sources of funding from investors in the European Union and all over the world; and make markets work more effectively and efficiently, linking investors to those who need funding at lower cost, both within member states and across borders.  Nobody can argue with the desirability of these high-level objectives, which are underpinned by the key principle that capital markets should benefit the economy, jobs and growth.<br/><br/>The Department submitted an information note on the Green Paper earlier in the month.  In this note we set out a short summary of the Green Paper and its objectives.  We indicated that we support the capital markets union initiative but advised that it was still at a very early phase and that we would need to consult further before developing clear policy positions across the various strands of capital markets union.  We further advised that we were considering organising a workshop and launching a public consultation.  I can confirm that the Department, in conjunction with the European Commission, organised a workshop that took place this morning, with a key speaker from the European Commission and attendance from across financial services.  We used the opportunity to launch our public consultation document, which was uploaded to our website today.  We expect these events will help inform the development of our policies on an initiative that is still at an early phase.<br/><br/>At the outset it might be useful to set out in some detail our current understanding of the key elements of capital markets union.<font color="#212100">  This initiative is not occurring in a vacuum, and in many respects it is a reaction to the dominant role of banks in funding the European economy and their continued difficulty in effectively fulfilling their primary functions of lending to the &quot;real economy&quot;.  A stated objective of </font>capital markets union<font color="#212100"> is to move closer to US levels of capital markets financing.  It is argued that even if a relatively modest movement in the direction of the US levels can be achieved, EU financial markets will be more efficient and, importantly, more resilient to shocks.</font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">  The general idea of a </font>capital markets union<font color="#212100"> is not new.  The EU has implemented policies to develop and integrate its capital markets for decades, such as through the financial services action plan in the 1990s.  However, EU capital markets today are still characterised by fragmentation, where much trading and securities ownership takes places within national borders.  This is considered to significantly limit the potential of the capital markets to contribute to Europe's high-level objectives of jobs and growth.  From this perspective, </font>capital markets union<font color="#212100"> can be seen as a wide range of initiatives and legislative proposals in different fields, which when taken together aim at ending the fragmentation of European capital markets, as well as providing alternative sources of finance for businesses.</font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">  As we see it, there are two core elements of </font>capital markets union<font color="#212100"> that will need to be addressed, the market segment element and the horizontal integration element.  The market segment approach is concerned with how to advance different types of capital markets, such as individual measures on securitisation, private placement, funds and crowdfunding, etc.</font></p><p>In contrast, the horizontal integration approach is concerned with how to address issues which impede the development of cross-border capital markets generally.  Potentially this could involve greater harmonisation of accountancy, insolvency and tax laws to capital markets and greater supervisory convergence across the EU.  Essentially it would be seeking to remove the barriers of the free movement of capital across borders.</p><p> For the purposes of today&rsquo;s debate I would like to elaborate on what we see as two of the most important thematic areas from the Green Paper, the funding of SMEs and developing the securitisations markets. </p></speech>

The Green Paper explores the ability of capital markets to work better for the small and medium enterprise sector.  The traditional dependency of SMEs on bank finance, in particular lending, is highlighted, and of course this is something with which we in Ireland are familiar.  Different European Union member states have different conceptions of what &ldquo;SME&rdquo; means and, to date, capital markets have tended to focus more on companies in the medium rather than the small enterprise sector.  It is not readily apparent from the Green Paper that many of the proposals will directly benefit the average small business in Ireland.  This is an area we intend to critically review with a view to ensuring that smaller companies are not excluded from the benefits of capital markets union.</p> <p>  The Green Paper does set out ideas and proposals for reducing SME dependency on bank financing.  Before SME markets or instrument types can develop to their potential there are important structural impediments to tackle.  For example, the Green Paper highlights the need for higher quality credit information for SMEs and the potential advantages that may arise from standardised credit data and credit scoring.  Within a national context members will be aware that a central credit registry, under the auspices of the Central Bank, is scheduled to go live next year and should greatly improve the coverage and quality of SME credit information.</p> <p>  Other issues mentioned in the Green Paper include the potential to develop SME growth markets and also a potential role for crowd funding in becoming a viable alternative to bank-based financing for some SMEs.  It would seem to us that crowd funding could potentially play a positive role in financing small and micro businesses.  We are aware of existing crowd funding platforms operating in Ireland and have closely monitored EU developments in this emerging area.</p> <p>  In relation to the proposed priorities for early action, we note the related Commission consultation paper on securitisation.  This paper follows on from recent contributions by other European institutions, for example, the ECB and the Bank of England, which call for a review of this area and set out the potential benefits of a high-quality securitisation market.  This allows for a broader distribution of financial sector risk and can help to free up banks' balance sheets to allow for further lending to the economy.  This may, for example, allow banks to expand their SME loan books.</p> <p>  The Green Paper also recognises the potential risks and seeks to address those by putting forward a framework for safe, simple and transparent securitisations.  We are fully in agreement with the Commission that the development of the securitisation market should only be facilitated by legislators on the basis that such instruments are safe and sustainable.</p> <p>  Within a domestic setting, the recent international financial services, IFS, 2020 strategy anticipates the potential opportunities that CMU may provide for the sector.  It sets out a range of actions which will ensure that Ireland is best placed to attract high quality investment.  I refer in particular to the recommendation to examine the potential to develop Ireland as a securitisation hub should CMU open up opportunities in this regard.</p> <p>  Other important themes surface in the Green Paper, for example, the potential for an increased role for the insurance and pensions industry, the greater participation of retail investors in the capital markets and horizontal integration elements that focus on the "union&rdquo; part of capital markets union.  These will need to be carefully considered as part of our consultation.</p> <p>  It is important to reiterate that the capital markets union initiative is still at a very early phase.  In reality, it will not be until the European Commission's action plan is published later in the year that we have something concrete before us.  Therefore, while the Department is proactively engaging with the subject matter we are not in a position to give definitive views today.  We intend to submit comments on the Green Paper in advance of the 13 May deadline.  Events such as today&rsquo;s Oireachtas finance committee hearing and today&rsquo;s workshop, as well as any submissions received from our open public consultation, will help inform our views and input on the Green Paper.</p> <p>  We support the objectives of sourcing additional capital to businesses to support growth and employment within the EU and our initial position is to welcome the CMU initiative as an opportunity for Ireland.  Our objective is to position ourselves at the EU level to ensure Irish interests are understood and taken into consideration.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today.  I am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Commissioner Hill has reiterated this goal and has highlighted the aim is to build a single market for capital from the bottom up by identifying barriers constraining the movement of capital and eliminating them one by one.  </p><p> The reliance on bank funding in Europe is well documented and is outlined in detail in the green paper and the supporting European Commission staff working document.  The superiority of capital-based financing systems versus bank-based is uncertain.  Academic literature is divided on this point with no clear supporting evidence in support of either side.  There is evidence that the impact of economic shocks on consumption is less pronounced in economies which have more integrated capital markets.  Examples are Canada and the US where the capital market channel allows for a greater diversity of risk sharing than in the EU where the credit market or banking system is the main channel to absorb shocks.  This would imply that having a more diversified funding model is a good thing and this makes intuitive sense as having more alternatives for financing would provide more options for entities looking for financing.  In addition, the provision of equity-based financing is found to be more inherently stable compared to debt financing.</p><p> During the debt crisis in Europe, debt financing had been more prone to capital flight than equity financing.  Part of this is the fundamental structure of such financing as equity financing is longer term in nature than debt with little to no re-financing risks.  Furthermore, greater cross-border holdings of equities across the EU would allow for more effective risk sharing between member states.</p><p> While the provision of more market-based financing will potentially have benefits as outlined above, we need to be clear that reliance by SMEs on bank-based funding will continue.  The European Commission's green paper also states that banking union will provide a "platform of stability to underpin the development of CMU across all Member States."  Therefore, CMU will not replace bank finance but rather supplement it.  </p><p> The Central Bank believes the provision of more diversified funding models in Europe is positive but highlights some caveats.  In the green paper, the European Commission outline its five key priorities, such as lowering barriers to accessing capital markets and building sustainable securitisation and in particular, streamlining the current prospectus regime and proposing a framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisations, which are subject to separate consultations.  Any changes in these areas or others outlined in the paper must take into account the impact on consumers and the level of protections they are afforded.  A balance must be struck between promoting greater diversification of funding channels in Europe while ensuring investors, particularly retail investors, are adequately protected.  Protections that are currently in place must not be unduly diluted.  Supervisory convergence should be considered in some cases as the solution rather than diluting existing protections.  Avoiding dilution of rules related to macro-prudential protections is also important.</p><p> We must remember that macro-prudential policies must also be considered with the implementation of CMU.  CRR/CRD IV has imposed new requirements on financial institutions across the EU which have only been in place since January 2014 and some of these deal with macro-prudential risks.  Market-based financing should not be seen as a way of avoiding macro-prudential risks.  Consideration should be also given to regimes which aim to mitigate macro-prudential risks arising from market-based financing.  For example, last year, the Central Bank introduced a regime that covers loan origination by investment funds.  This regime was introduced post-discussions with industry and, importantly, after discussions with our European counterparts and after receiving advice from the European Systemic Risk Board, ESRB, particularly in the area of mitigating potential macro-prudential risks.  While not replicating bank capital rules in full, the regime does aim to ensure such activity does not result in entities avoiding the macro-prudential requirements found in banking regulation.</p><p> To conclude, the Central Bank welcomes the green paper from the European Commission and the proposed approach, which has a mixture of short, medium and long-term measures, along with legislative and non-legislative tools.  The proposals of the European Commission to promote market-based financing are not, in our view, to replace bank financing but rather to complement it.  They involve providing more options for non-financial corporations to access funding in Europe and as an alternative source of funding for economic growth.</p><p> CMU may also make Europe more like other jurisdictions and limit the negative impacts from economic shocks in the future.  Furthermore, we call for careful consideration of any reduction of protections for investors as loss of investor confidence in financial instruments will impact the ability of entities to raise financing from these instruments and impact the liquidity of them in secondary markets, both of which are key in ensuring market-based financing becomes entrenched and grows as a form of funding for non-financial companies in Europe.</p><p> We are actively involved in this debate at a European level, are engaging with the European Securities Markets Authority in its discussions on this topic and are working with other competent authorities to achieve supervisory convergence across member states regarding the legislation currently in place.  We will continue to be an active participant in this debate in Europe and we will provide advice to the Department of Finance as required on the topic as it develops over the coming years.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

In his presentation, he said that it is not immediately apparent what the benefits to the Irish SME sector may be arising from strengthened CMU.  How do we ensure that our SMEs benefit to the maximum extent?  Some early contributors, particularly Dr. Gurdgiev, said that the Irish market may be too small and that our SMEs are simply too small in comparison to what one might understand an SME to be in other jurisdictions to attract the kind of investment that may be freed up through this kind of instrument.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Carrigan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015033100002#Y00300"><p>That is a valid position to take given our current knowledge of what the proposal entails.  SMEs in Europe are generally far larger organisations than SMEs in Ireland.  I have debated this with my colleagues at European Council meetings and we are not alone in being a smaller country with an economy heavily reliant on smaller enterprises so there is a shared concern among a wide range of members.  We will bring our wish to see benefits to the table.  However, there are already benefits inherent in the proposal.  First, the proposal on securitisation creates stronger financial institutions and provides a wider base of sources of finance for financial institutions.  It allows them capital reliefs from removing moneys off their books and frees up further moneys.  The banks then look for markets to lend to and might begin to be more favourably disposed towards lending to SMEs than before.  There are indirect benefits.</p> <p>  CMU talks about the need to standardise and improve credit information quality.  We have already gone some way in the development of our credit registry, which will commence next year under the Central Bank.  That kind of development around Europe better positions SMEs to access credit from financial institutions.  Part of the problem has been the quality of information the SME can bring to the financial institution.  </p> <p>  I spoke about crowdfunding in my opening statement.  Crowdfunding has the potential to focus on smaller enterprises.  It will not be on a huge scale but it could be very beneficial to start-up companies and new ideas.  We need to see this area develop.  Of course, there are regulatory concerns and consumer protection issues around that and we will work closely with the Central Bank in looking at that but part of this process must draw attention to all these other issues such as mini bonds and crowdfunding.  Within the Department of Finance and as part of this project, we will examine the potential of those in an Irish context to support SME finance.</p></speech>

How does Mr. Carrigan envisage making the crowdfunding model more accessible to Irish SMEs or somehow legitimising it as a funding opportunity for fledgling Irish businesses?  What opportunities does this present to make crowdfunding a more viable option in the future or does it present any?  It is just something the Department has identified where it sees an opportunity?</p></speech>

Mr. Niall O'Sullivan has been attending meetings in Brussels on behalf of the Department that look at developments in other countries where it is happening.  It is happening to a greater extent in some countries.  This debate is being facilitated by the European Commission as part of its CMU programme.  We are looking at the experience in other countries, what is happening in the market here and opportunities.  It does not necessarily mean that the State will intervene.</p><p>This is one of those areas that may or may not benefit from irregulation, it may develop better left to its own resources.  It is an area that we are interested in.  We are aware that there are consumer protection issues but we are also aware of the opportunities.  I know in the UK it is quite developed as a source of financing.  We are looking at the experience of other countries and if we can pull all that together, with the other developments under capital markets union, it is one of these issues that can make part of the package of measures which will help improve financing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015033100002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for the invitation to discuss with them the outcome of the March Energy Council.</p><p>The Council's agenda included the two main discussion points of energy union and energy infrastructure.  Before I address the two main agenda items, let me mention the matter dealt with under the heading of any other business at the meeting.  When the Commission gave an update on energy security, the Czech delegation referred briefly to the 10th plenary meeting of the European Nuclear Energy Forum.  That forum meeting will be held in Prague on 26 and 27 of May next.  The meeting will provide an opportunity to discuss the role of nuclear power and its contribution to the decarbonisation efforts under the umbrella of the developing energy union concept.  While I will be interested to know the outcome of that discussion, I do not propose to attend it or have officials present.</p><p>I shall next discuss the energy union aspect of the deliberations.  Discussions on the first substantive item of energy union began with a presentation by the Commission and was followed by an exchange of views among member states.  In my intervention, I welcomed the communication from the Commission and the concept of energy union, generally.  I emphasised how strongly Ireland supports the five dimensions of the energy union proposals as a way to strengthen the three pillars of European energy policy, namely, the security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness.</p><p>Enhancing Europe's energy security is of particular importance to Ireland and other inadequately connected member states, and those reliant on only one supply source.  It is vital that diversity of routes and sources of energy, together with the appropriate infrastructure, are put in place to address these challenges.  </p><p>I stressed the significance of the roll out of projects of common interest with support, as required, from the EU Connecting Europe Facility and the European Fund for Strategic Investments.  These are important elements to achieve security of supply for Ireland.  In this regard, I reiterated the necessity to provide safeguards and flexibilities for small member states with poorly interconnected markets.</p><p>Ireland is currently almost completely reliant on external sources of gas.  In this regard, I noted that we are looking forward to the Commission's proposals in regard to a revised EU Regulation 994/2010 on gas security of supply.</p><p>I understand that the Commission will seek to enhance co-operation between member states in the revised proposal.  This would strengthen our position, in that the regulation would provide for greater collaboration and sharing of resources in the event of disruption of our gas supply.</p><p>Developing indigenous resources, particularly renewables, is also extremely important for increasing security of supply.  We need to focus on all technologies, including onshore and offshore wind, solar, biomass and geothermal.  In this regard, we need to continue the focus on research and innovation, particularly in regard to ocean energy and developing wave and tidal technologies.  </p><p>I referred to the particular vulnerabilities facing Ireland in terms of dependence on oil, specifically in the heating and transport sectors.<font color="#004080">  </font>We must remember the importance of oil in meeting our energy needs, and consider the contribution to our oil security of refining capacity across the EU.</p><p>Completing the internal energy market is the key to energy union.  I noted the Commission's view that EU-wide decision-making is required from the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, ACER, and the European Networks of Transmission System Operators, ENTSOs, in both electricity and gas.However, we need to avoid imposing one-size-fits-all decisions on all member states.  Instead we should provide safeguards and flexibilities for member states, particularly smaller member states with poorly interconnected markets.  Related to this is the Commission's proposal to present legislation on a new electricity market model.  The emphasis will be on a redesign that links wholesale and retail.  It will increase security of supply and provide for a multitude of producers.  It will also enable the full participation of consumers in the market through better demand response measures.  This is an interesting proposal, but it must be a logical evolution of the current market design.  Customers cannot be expected to pay for constant evolutions in market design.  Industry must have regulatory stability and a clear policy pathway if it is to invest in the infrastructure required to complete the internal energy market.</p><p>On this issue, I reiterated Ireland's position that capacity payments can be appropriate, necessary and EU-compliant in certain circumstances.  While market integration and decarbonisation remain critical targets, principles of national flexibility must also be respected.</p><p>Other member states generally welcomed the Commission's communication on an energy union.  At the end of the debate both Commission Vice-President &Scaron;efovi and Commissioner Ca&ntilde;ete were encouraged by the support.</p><p>The Latvian Presidency confirmed that it would write to President Tusk of the European Council, to reflect the views of the Energy Council and the views of the Environment Council, in preparation for the discussion on energy union at the meeting of Heads of State and Government which took place on 19 and 20<sup></sup>of March.</p><p>As an additional note for information, in preparation for European Council at the General Affairs Council on 17 March, the discussion on energy union indicated divergences among member states on the questions of transparency in the gas market, and the <i>ex ante</i>assessments of intergovernmental agreements.</p><p>There were also calls for stronger language on energy efficiency, energy infrastructure and climate change.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy, repeated the importance of including a reference in the conclusions to the position of poorly connected peripheral regions and the need to have the citizen at the centre of the energy union.</p><p>At the European Council meeting held on 19 March the issues of transparency in the gas market and assessments of intergovernmental agreements arose again.</p><p>In the end, the text proposed by the President was agreed.  From an Irish perspective the Taoiseach was successful in introducing language into the conclusions that recognised the position of peripheral regions in the context of interconnections, as I mentioned.  Positive language was also introduced on ensuring affordability for households and businesses.</p><p> I turn now to the second substantive agenda item, namely, energy infrastructure.  The discussions began with a presentation by the Commission on developments and priorities and this was followed by a policy debate.  I expressed our interest in achieving the 10% electricity interconnections target, which accompanied the communication on energy union.  From Ireland's standpoint as a small member state which has developed one of the first cross-border electricity markets in the EU, I said that poorly interconnected peripheral regions must have additional interconnection for our energy consumers to reap the benefits of the internal energy market.  Our approach to the energy union and collective funding decisions must reflect this goal.  Otherwise the project of the internal energy market runs the risk of being seen as irrelevant or, worse, detrimental to the needs and interests of European consumers in poorly connected markets.</p><p> Second, I welcomed an enhanced regional approach as a stepping stone to delivering full European energy market integration.  Ireland has witnessed the benefits of regional co-operation since the establishment of the single electricity market, SEM, in November 2007.  This combined two separate wholesale markets on the island into a single, cross-jurisdictional and jointly governed and regulated wholesale market on the island of Ireland.  The benefits achieved by the single electricity market include improved security of supply, competitive prices and increased penetration of renewable energy, the key goals of the energy union project.</p><p> On regional co-operation, Ireland continues to participate in the North Sea countries' offshore grid initiative which was formed in 2009 by nine EU member states and Norway.  This is a regional co-operation initiative to facilitate the co-ordinated development of a possible offshore electricity grid in the North Sea.  The work is still at an early stage but it will facilitate the bringing forward of projects in the coming years.  The Commission intends to add to the momentum by bringing forward an action plan for the northern seas regional group.  It will also convene an energy infrastructure forum to facilitate progress.</p><p> I informed our European hosts and my ministerial colleagues that we have also recently explored the possibility of exporting electricity from renewable sources to our near neighbour, the United Kingdom.  Members of the committee will see that some of the projects of common interest, PCIs, listed in the annex to the communication relate to the proposed Ireland-UK energy trading project.  For various reasons this project is not progressing at present, so the related PCIs are unlikely to be developed in the timeframe indicated.  Other important PCIs are being progressed, most notably the North-South transmission line project, an important gas project in south-west Scotland and a feasibility study for an interconnector between Ireland and France.</p><p> The issues of funding and our location as a peripheral, poorly connected member state are key challenges to the development of energy infrastructure.  Having low electricity interconnection levels and also being cut off from the continental oil grid are a high cost burden on a small, energy using population and provide a challenge to private investment.  I welcomed the establishment of the European Fund for Strategic Investments to support and enhance existing funds such as the connecting Europe facility.  I hope that this fund will stimulate investors to develop the infrastructure necessary to complete a fully integrated European energy market.</p><p> To conclude, it was a successful Council and I made full use of the opportunity to stress the importance we attach to key elements of European energy policy.  Following the Council, I read press reports of some very ill-informed criticism of Ireland's energy policy and of our contribution to European measures to tackle climate change.  I hope this report to the committee underlines our active engagement in regional co-operation in this area, including in the North Sea countries' offshore grid initiative.  I also assure the committee that Ireland is fully committed to making its contribution to the overall EU 2030 targets for carbon emission reductions, energy efficiency and the generation of renewable energy.  Measures to help deliver our transformation to a low carbon economy and society will be at the centre of the energy White Paper which I will publish later this year.  The energy agenda has never been fuller.  Its complexity makes many demands on all stakeholders.  Much of what is topical at European level is echoed here in Ireland.  All of the debate is helpful to me as I seek to develop Ireland's energy policy out towards 2030.</p><p> As I have mentioned repeatedly in the Chamber and elsewhere, I will publish a definitive energy policy for this country next September.  Clearly, all of us have a role in developing our future energy policy to support economic development, underpin the social recovery that is clearly gathering momentum and manage the transition to a low carbon economy.</p><p> I thank you, Chairman, for the invitation to the meeting and look forward to hearing the members' views.</p></speech>

What is being discussed at European Council level is one of the more important issues for our country as we move forward.  I wish to discuss a number of issues.  The Minister spoke about nuclear power but perhaps he would discuss his and the Department's views on hydraulic fracturing or fracking as well.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the interconnectors.  A major issue has developed over the last week in respect of the North-South interconnector and the parity of esteem between grid link south, grid link west and the North-South interconnector.  That must be properly discussed because there is a significant amount of opposition locally in Meath, Monaghan and other counties on that issue.</p> <p>  Overall, what is the position of the European Commission regarding wave and tidal power?  What type of investment or what type of technology is the Commission discussing or what type of research has taken place?  In his discussions with his ministerial colleagues, what sense did the Minister get of when that can be achieved?  From a commonsense point of view, Ireland has huge untapped resources in regard to that energy source and it would be less controversial than any of the other forms of energy generation this country has.  In addition, some of our European colleagues have moved massively ahead with biomass, which is carbon neutral and so forth.  I believe this country is somewhat behind the curve in that regard.  The raw material has been growing in this country.  There has been huge afforestation over the last 20 or 25 years and some of it is being thinned or cut now and being sold at knock-down prices.  There is a major issue there and we should tap into it.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister would address the issue of the North-South interconnector and co-funding or funding for inter-country infrastructure.  Will he also talk about the wave or tidal energy resources and biomass?  What were the discussions or the thoughts of his colleagues in that regard?</p><p>I would like to hear the Minister emphatically ruling out fracking in the same way as he has emphatically ruled out nuclear power.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015033100002#E00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his contribution and his support, at least at the general level of the importance of this agenda.  I note Deputy Martin made similar points in reply to the Taoiseach's report on the Council meeting, if I am not mistaken, or at least in one of the recent exchanges in the D&aacute;il.  Politicians may often say it from this side of the House but if there is a single area of policy relating to all our futures that deserves at least a high level of cross-party debate if not agreement, energy policy should be such an area.  It requires decisions to be made that have implications for five, ten or 15 years.  It is not an issue that is closely aligned to the electoral cycle so we should try to work closely on it.  I welcome Deputy Moynihan's sentiments in that regard.</p> <p>  With respect to unconventional gas exploration and extraction, or fracking as it is sometimes know, the position is the same as I have explained to colleagues on a number of occasions in the Chamber and elsewhere.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has been retained to carry out a study on fracking.  That study is under way and I do not expect it to be completed until mid 2016 at the earliest.  People may say there should be a moratorium or a ban but there is nothing to ban.  There will be no consent or actions at all with respect to fracking, at least until that report has been examined by the Minister and conclusions have been made.  I answer questions about a ban in one way by saying there is nothing to ban, as there will not be such an activity at least until that report has been absorbed, with conclusions drawn from it.</p> <p>  Colleagues are aware that last week EirGrid made some announcement on its assessment of the needs of the grid into the future.  Grid25 is the basic EirGrid strategy and it was launched in 2008.  At that time, the projection was a required investment or cost of the order of &euro;4 billion.  That was revised in 2011 and EirGrid has now published its latest assessment as of last Friday.  Colleagues are aware of what that assessment contains.  It is a discussion paper and it reviews the strategy while revisiting the three major projects, which are the North-South interconnecting line, Grid West and Grid Link.  It reaffirms the need for the North-South project and Grid West; it identifies a third option other than a direct current underground cable overhead line of 400 kV.  The draft strategy also confirmed the need to reinforce the transmission system in the south east but suggested an alternative to the original proposal that would involve upgrading some of the existing transmission lines.  Depending on which options are selected for these projects, the new overall cost of Grid25 will be somewhere between &euro;2.7 billion and &euro;3.9 billion, depending on final decisions.  It is a discussion paper that considers each of the three lines separately, as they are separate propositions.  Some of the possibilities for Grid Link are not possible with respect to the North-South context.  That is explained very clearly in the EirGrid discussion paper.</p> <p>  With regard to the North-South line, the current position is that last November, as part of the project of common interest process, EirGrid submitted a draft planning application file to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for review, allowing it to assess the extent of the information provided and, as set out in the relevant regulation, request any missing information that it deemed necessary.  In December, the board informed EirGrid that it had reviewed the draft planning application file and asked for certain specified missing information to be submitted.  In March 2015, EirGrid submitted the requested information to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The position now is that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will draw up a schedule for the permit granting process and EirGrid expects to make a formal application for planning in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  With regard to wave and tidal issues, we are talking about the Energy Council meeting and there would be different levels of commitment across Europe to these technologies.  Some countries are more amenable to wave and tidal energy than others because of geography.  All member states and the Ministers representing them are agreed that there must be a diversity in energy sources, with input extended from renewables.  The menu of renewable energies should also be extensive.  There is much commitment to different forms of energy generation and wave and tidal power feature in the menu for some countries more than others.</p> <p>  The offshore renewable energy development plan, which was published last year, is important.  The Deputy will accept that this country has one of the best offshore renewable resources in the world, particularly wave energy.  We are at the forefront of the development of renewable electricity but we also need to diversify our renewables, just as I mentioned other countries are doing.  I am very committed to extending our research capability in respect of offshore power, and we have done much work in the publication of that plan.  I am very interested in taking that work forward as matters proceed.</p> <p>  We have published a bioenergy draft plan in recent months and had some good responses to it.  I look forward to debating that further with colleagues and seeing how we can develop biomass as well.  The Deputy is right in that we need to have a mix and diversity in sources.  There is much talk and perhaps a little controversy about onshore wind, which has been successful, but it is not the only form of renewable energy.  The Deputy is right in that we must be careful not to confine our interests or attention to a particular source.  A very important measure I am considering is a renewable heat incentive and we are doing much work in developing that idea.  We will publish an environmental impact assessment and appropriate assessment shortly and I hope to have that renewable heat incentive in place in the course of 2016.</p></speech>

I ask about the recent findings on Grid West, which has part of its proposals underground and other parts overhead.  The Grid25 strategy is costed at &euro;4 billion, and it can also cater for increased capacity on existing overhead networks, including pylons, poles and so on, as well as an underground element.  The North-South interconnector, in time, will be part of the overall east-west European grid.  There may be difficulties for the people living where the interconnector will pass.  My understanding is the same possibilities will not present for the North-South interconnector as for Grid West and Grid25.</p><p>The people involved cannot understand why the same cannot happen on the route of that interconnector.  I realise the importance of interconnectors and being part of the overall European grid.<br/><br/>Will the EU help fund a gas interconnector between this country and mainland Europe?  Does Ireland have a greater dependence on imported energy than other EU states, which includes, whether we like it or not, nuclear energy, which is helping us in times of great demand in this country?  Due to our high dependence on imported oil and gas, it is all the more important that oil and gas deposits, whether on land or sea, <i>terra marique</i>,<b></b>should be exploited.  Should we be considering exploiting our facilities around the coast to a greater extent as a substitute for imported infrastructure, so to speak?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015033100002#F00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  I will refer briefly to the North-South interconnector.  Every project is different.  As I mentioned, each of the three main projects has been revisited in the course of EirGrid's assessment of what it put into the discussion paper published last Friday.  In regard to the North-South project, my understanding from my discussions with EirGrid and what it said publicly on Friday is that an additional electricity line, rather than further capacity on our current line, is needed in order to ensure a safe, secure supply of electricity across the island.  The existing infrastructure of GridLink in the south and south east can be developed and enhanced to meet the need.  I understand from EirGrid that, based on its analysis of the North-South project, that cannot be done.  It does not follow that because the infrastructure in the south east can be enhanced in that way, the infrastructure in the North-South scenario is available to be enhanced in a similar way.  What works on one project does not necessarily work on another project.  The new technology I mentioned in regard to the south east works by increasing the amount of electricity that can be carried on the existing line.  The North-South interconnector is required to ensure a secure supply of electricity to Northern Ireland as well.  We have to bear in mind it is a North-South project.  It is not just for our benefit; it is also for the benefit of our friends and colleagues in the North.  What is in place is a 275 kV double-circuit overhead line between Louth station in County Louth and Tandragee in County Armagh.  If that line was to go, there simply would not be enough electricity reaching the north east of the island to keep the lights on.  An additional line, the North-South interconnector, is needed, therefore, to ensure a safe, secure supply of electricity across the island.  Using the new technology would make no difference in this scenario because, even if EirGrid increased the amount of electricity carried on the existing 275 kV line, the risk to the system if that line were to suffer a fault would remain, so it would not solve the problem in the way that EirGrid can solve the problem-----</p></speech>

We are talking about a capacity that is significantly greater than the capacity that exists at the moment.  What needs to be achieved is significantly more than what could be done by what is in place at present or by any possible enhancement of it.</p> <p>  We have three gas interconnectors to the island of Ireland, two to the Republic and one into Northern Ireland.  We have no plans as yet for a gas interconnector to mainland Europe.  I mentioned in my introduction that some research work is taking place in regard to an interconnector with France - not a gas interconnector but an electricity interconnector.  That is very much at the research stage and is one of the projects being worked on with the French.  In terms of gas, there is no current proposal to do that.  Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, has secured EU funding of more than &euro;30 million to address a concern in south west Scotland.  If approved, this will enhance our security of gas supply.  It is another of the PCI projects in the pipeline, so to speak. </p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question, we import 96% of our gas.  Corrib will help us with this and should provide something of the order of 60% of our needs for a period of six years and also a very high contribution to our needs beyond the six years.  We all look forward to that and to the gas coming ashore and being available for use.</p></speech>

All parties and, indeed, most if not all Oireachtas Members fully support the vision of secure, safe, clean, reliable and competitive energy in this country.  Therefore, I would like to know whom the Minister was referring to.  Much of what is contained in the various statements following the Council meeting is good.  There is not much to argue with.  It is a bit like dropping a 100-piece jigsaw out of the box and getting 90 pieces back, as it can be hard to see the whole picture.  I understand it is difficult for somebody who did not attend a series of meetings to be able to get a full and comprehensive picture of what happened during those meetings and discussions.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions, some of which are quite specific.  The Minister stated that many delegations emphasised the need to respect member states' national competencies over their energy mix.  That could be from one of at least two perspectives.  It could be from the perspective that attempts were being made to disrespect member states' national competencies over their energy mix or it could be from the perspective of "Let us work even harder to make sure that member states have responsibility over their energy mix."  It is unclear from the statement here which perspective applied in that case.</p> <p>  There is little hard data in relation to smaller countries like Ireland that need to benefit from more indigenous renewable energy sources.  I do not know the level of detail at those discussions or whether those discussions have started.</p><p> With all the talk about the need for interconnections between states, we have an abysmal record in micro-generation projects.  In particular, we are very far behind in terms of linking smaller generation projects to our national grid.  We are way behind the Six Counties in that regard, and I believe the Six Counties could do a lot more.  It is ironic that we are talking about international and transnational projects when we are not doing enough to examine the potential for micro-generation, not just for individual housing estates, businesses, factories, hospitals and so on but also in terms of the contribution that could make to the national grid.  We are not considering how we can eliminate impediments to getting those surplus energy projects onto the grid.</p><p> I had not intended to mention fracking, but I am glad the Minister did, and I thank him for that.  Will he indicate to the members whether there was any discussion about the possible contribution of hydraulic fracturing to energy independence in Europe?  I saw nothing about that in any of the statements.  The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, indicated that he would seek an interim report from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, on its study on fracking and decide whether that interim report could be put before the committee.  Will the Minister inform us of the position regarding that process and whether an interim report can be expected imminently?</p><p> I want to make an overall point.  I am not sure about timescales with regard to these areas.  We will reach a point at which we will have some certainty about the extent to which Ireland's way forward, in terms of our vision and our strategy, can be matched with the European vision and strategy and the supports from within Europe.  At what stage would the Minister envisage that kind of convergence of strategies and supports?</p><p> Finally, when the Minister spoke about wave energy, I take it he is also thinking about tidal energy.</p></speech>

Regarding the media reportage, the issue was more a lack of understanding of the details of the work being done in the regional groupings in particular.  That is what caught my eye.  I do not make too much of that, because criticism and debate is what this is all about, but it was important for me to have an opportunity to explain to the committee what actually happened and what is happening in the energy Council, and I welcome the opportunity to do that here today.</p> <p>  I do not believe that the member states asserting the importance of retaining national competencies was a reaction to anything.  There was no disrespect displayed that I saw or heard for individual member states and their independence in regard to their decisions on energy.  It is no secret that some countries are very keen to ensure they maximise the use of their resources.  We think of Poland and coal, for example, and the United Kingdom and nuclear energy.  To partly answer one of the Deputy's other questions, some countries have prospects, as they would see it, in terms of fracking and they want to be able to do that if they decide that that is what they want to do.  Those points were made by countries.  Effectively, they were saying that if that is what they decide to do, as with the UK and nuclear power, they will do it.  I do not want to put it in confrontational language, but there is an assertion by countries that already have an approach that they wish to continue that.  France is another country that wishes to continue with its use of nuclear power.  </p> <p>  There was an interesting exchange during the course of the energy Council in which the Vice-Chancellor of Germany touched on the position now being adopted by Germany in regard to nuclear power, reiterating the change in policy that has been adopted in Germany in recent years.  The Austrians took a very strong position against nuclear power, and that was also stated.  One could interpret such remarks as being an assertion of independence in regard to energy policy, but it was not a response-----</p></speech>

It is worth pointing out that the energy mix any country adopts is a national competency, and that is set out clearly in the treaties.  Member states have sole competency to decide on the make-up of their energy mix, whether it is renewables, nuclear energy or anything else.  That applies to us as much as it applies to anyone else.  That having been said, the idea of an energy union is to see what can be brought together in terms of the different strands of policy to which all member states could see their way to agreeing.  It cannot be done other than by agreement.  It cannot be imposed.  Like any of these decisions in Europe, they are collective decisions by the member states and the member states have to move forward together on the basis of agreement.  If we have a deeper set of agreements at the level of the European Union in regard to energy policy, that will emerge in the coming months and years.  It is a priority of the Juncker Commission that the work on the energy union should be progressed, but it can only be done by agreement, and we will be full participants in any of that discussion.</p> <p>  The White Paper will be published in September, and I would hope to have an engagement with the committee on it as it emerges in the early part of the summer to allow the committee have an input at a relatively early stage.  We will take full account of the developments in the EU in the framing of that White Paper so that the context for what we are doing-----</p></speech>

It is something I am very keen to ensure we deal with in the White Paper, and we must investigate how we can promote and bring forward micro-generation, how it could be supported and the kinds of model we could put in place.  I would like to see us doing some work on that.  There is important work to be done there and I would be keen to bring that forward.</p> <p>  In terms of whether there was any discussion on fracking, there was no agenda item or anything like that on fracking.  As to whether any member state may have mentioned it, I frankly cannot remember, but if a member state did mention it, it could well have been in the context of particular prospects our country would see itself as having, and they may have asserted that they were interested in such proposals.  However, it did not take off as a discussion and was not something I remember.  Off the top of my head I cannot even remember which country would have mentioned it.  I do not want to say it did not come up, but I cannot remember it coming up.</p></speech>

Do we have adequate capacity and how many days' reserves exist?  Is there a variation occasionally on this and, if so, I wonder how many days ahead we are.  If an election is called I am sure there will be a big demand for fuel to keep the old bangers ticking over.</p> <p>  I also wish to ask about the Scotland-Ireland gas interconnector.  Some 12 months ago or more, the supplies were very depleted at one stage.  With Britain dependent on those gas supplies as well, I think at one stage it was down to three or four weeks' supplies.  To an extent, therefore, we could have been left high and dry.  </p> <p>  The Minister is well aware of the Shannon liquified natural gas, LNG, proposal for Tarbert.  It is a crucial development that should be pursued further to ensure that it is there in the national economic interest, including the economy of County Kerry.  There are 300 or 400 jobs involved in that proposal in a peripheral region which has been neglected, particularly following the collapse in the construction industry.  The Minister should re-examine this proposal.  Surely there is a mechanism or loopholes whereby we can get around regulatory obstacles.  The LNG proposal would be a godsend for that part of rural Ireland.  County Kerry depends very much on tourism, but that part of north Kerry does not attract a huge amount from the tourist sector.  For the country's competitiveness, it is essential to have large gas reserves readily to hand.</p> <p>  Natural gas supplies come from Kinsale to Cork and Limerick, but Kerry is deprived of that.  There is a preliminary plan to bring the gas pipeline into Kerry, including Listowel, Tralee and Killarney.  This would be a major plus if it were made available.  Does the Minister have any update on that plan and, if so, what is the latest position?  The Government should pursue it vigorously to ensure that it goes ahead.</p> <p>  A Bill went through the Oireachtas concerning various energy research matters.  The Minister referred to offshore wind and wave energy, but at what stage is our research into those programmes?  There is huge potential for such developments off the coast.</p> <p>  Is there any programme for investigating future solar energy potential?  Does the current research programme include solar energy?  There is major potential in that regard.</p> <p>  I support Deputy Colreavy's comments on micro-turbines.  Provision is being made to connect the output of such micro-energy projects to the national grid.  Many companies are being charged rates for erecting a single turbine, however, although they might be employing 100 or 200 people.  I know of one firm that is employing 800 or 900 people, yet it is paying massive rates on two turbines.  There should be an exemption from rates where jobs are being created or there is a potential to create employment.  Such charges are anti-jobs and anti-rural Ireland.  Due to the exorbitant cost of electricity, such firms must develop their own energy sources.  </p> <p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government could be made responsible for collecting rates for local authorities, but an exemption could be considered where jobs are involved as well as a waiver on the public service obligation.  The Minister should examine this matter because self-employed operators with small workshops are being crucified by the PSO obligation and the VAT rate involved.  Those on a higher voltage capacity are being burdened with a high tariff.  </p> <p>  As a matter of national policy, the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, should intervene with the electricity companies over costs.  In addition to small employers, it is also surprising that individual farmers are liable for these type of rates.  It is not right.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1198" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015033100002#H00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation and I have a few questions for him.  By what percentage is Europe self sufficient in gas, compared to what it imports from Russia?  The Minister spoke about Ireland becoming 60% sufficient in gas from Mayo in the coming years.  When I was a gars&uacute;n, and that is neither today nor yesterday, we had found the Kinsale gas field and it was said that we would have supplies for 15 years.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I think it is still going and I am more than 15 years older since then.  Between Kinsale and the Mayo field, what percentage are we hitting?</p> <p>  The Minister is probably aware that Britain has kicked wind energy to touch because it is not cost effective.  Have we done a full cost-based analysis on how much wind energy costs?  I have undertaken some research on this and have visited places where turbines have been erected.  I have spoken to people involved in the industry who say that, but for the subsidies, it is a non-runner.  Down the road, however, businesses will have to be competitive. </p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the northern seas, so can he provide some information on that subject?  Have we looked at ideas such as the spirit of Ireland or hydroelectricity?  Have we gone away from what was pretty simple?</p> <p>  Looking ten or 15 years ahead, the Minister mentioned an electricity interconnector between Ireland and France, but we also have an interconnector to Britain.  France is building a lot of nuclear plants, while five are being installed in Britain.  In this free market, what price will they charge us for electricity?  Does the Minister think that, in ten or 15 years' time, we will not be able to compete with that price?  From what I have seen across Europe, the price of electricity will come down due to other countries doing various things, including deferring wind energy which has a high cost.</p><p>We are looking at wind and it is costing heavily.  With regard to Grid West, some 30 km is supposed to be going underground.  As with anything, if we can tear some of the road we can tear all of the road.  We should look at going underground where there are houses or people involved.</p><p> I heard a reference to biomass.  We must realise, having talked to Bord na M&oacute;na about willow, that the price of doing 30% of Lanesborough with woodchip or biomass involves planting the whole of County Roscommon.  We cannot keep our sawmills going but we are importing timber from Scotland for manufacturing and sending it back to London.  It is great that we are creating jobs but we must take a long, hard look at where we are going and do some cost analysis.  We might find interesting results and I would like a response to that.  </p></speech>

With regard to oil storage capacity, we are required to have 90 days' capacity stored under International Energy Agency, IEA, rules.  Most of it is in the facility at Whitegate and the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, is the body that oversees and manages it for the State.  We also have agreements with other member states to store oil in their jurisdictions on our behalf to ensure we keep to a minimum of 90 days' supply of oil.  The Deputy is referring to a one-off concern with gas following a particularly harsh winter.  Perhaps it also related to the geopolitical concerns with Ukraine over the past two years, where there was a perceived issue about gas.  In so far as it was ever an issue, it is not now an issue in respect of availability of a reliable supply of gas.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015033100002#J00400"><p>Our assessment is that it is not and is unlikely to be an issue.  I know about the Shannon liquified natural gas, LNG, proposal and the Deputy is aware that Shannon LNG applied for the connecting Europe facility funding last year.  The application process was run by the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency, INEA, for the European Commission and the applications were assessed in accordance with different criteria, including ensuring the energy projects had cross-border benefits and strengthened the EU security of energy supply.  The principle of projects of common interest, PCI, is that they cross different jurisdictions and add to the strength and security of supply in the European Union in general.  Each application is adjudicated on its merits.  My Department has no role in that evaluation of applications other than being asked to approve the application.  We approved the Shannon LNG application and my predecessor, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, was supportive of the project in meeting with the promoters of the project and assisting in any way he could.  I have continued that support and met the project promoters.  I have extended my support by letters of support and the Deputy may know that I recently met a delegation from Kerry County Council.  I am willing to assist in any way possible within the remit of my powers as Minister but the decision on projects of common interests are not for the Government but for the Commission.  I am available, as is my Department, to assist Shannon LNG in any way we can.  However, we must respect the independence of the PCI process and regulatory independence.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me about ocean energy research.  I am very keen on this and I have seen terrific work in the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster, IMERC, in Cork where there is a cluster of research interest and excellence.  There is a huge amount going on internationally in ocean energy and research and the prospects for the future.  We have supported the research and the strategic energy technologies plan provides funding for the next generation of renewables, which includes ocean and tidal.  We have set aside some considerable funding for research in that area and I am happy to provide details of the precise sums of money to the members of the committee after the meeting.  I am supportive of the area.  When we read about the potential in our seas, it is remarkable and worthy of our support.  Anything we can do to progress it, we will do.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy's point on solar power, one of a suite of renewable technologies.  As it improves, with the advent of Chinese solar technology the cost is decreasing by the week.  We must keep an eye on it and bring it forward.  I see it as featuring in our thinking when we put together the definitive policy statement in the White Paper.  All of the insight at the committee meeting will help me with that work.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the PSO, which is necessary for security of supply and critically important in terms of renewables.  It is spread across all electricity consumers.  If we do not spread it evenly across all, some will pay more than others.  The correct way to do it in policy terms is to spread it evenly across all consumers.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice asked some exacting questions and I am not sure I can respond to them.  I am quite happy to revert to the Deputy subsequently if I cannot.  With regard to the European energy system, the latest data show the EU imported 53% of its energy at a cost of some &euro;400 billion.  This makes it the largest energy importer in the world.  Some six member states depend on a single external supplier for their entire gas imports and, therefore, remain too vulnerable to supply shocks.  It has been estimated that every additional 1% increase in energy savings cuts gas imports by 2.6%.  We have not spoken much about efficiency in the past hour and the importance of bringing forward policy on energy efficiency.  This is the case for all sorts of reasons, including the positive impact on the need to import fossil fuels.  I can provide more information on this.</p></speech>

Is it not hypothetical to talk about security of energy?  We will not change that 53% figure in one, two or five years because we are looking at ten years or 15 years.  We will not turn around security of energy supplies overnight.  In Europe, we are relying on Russia.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-31a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015033100002#J00600"><p>I agree with that but our policy direction must be to progress our work and incrementally press forward our efforts to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels.  The Deputy is not suggesting it but the fact that it will take a long time is just a measure of how difficult it will be.  This is not a counsel of despair and there is no reason to say that oil and gas will always be around as long as any of us are on the planet, and probably much longer.  That is not an argument that we do not try to change things and progress the agenda.  I respectfully disagree with the direction of the Deputy's remarks about onshore wind.</p><p>All of my reading and analysis of this subject, and not just in terms of the advice I have received, demonstrates to me how cost effective onshore wind has been as a source of renewable energy.  I am not suggesting it is the answer to all of our needs or all of our woes, but it has been cost effective and has proven itself to be cost effective.  As I have said, wind energy is not the answer to everything and we have to bring forward other sources of renewable energy.  The extent to which we can bring forward solar and biomass energy has been mentioned we need to have a proper balance.  We all need to participate in the work on the White Paper to ensure we have a kind of mix that is appropriate.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the Spirit of Ireland project.  I met the promoters of that project.  There have been some changes in terms of the people involved but the promoters of the project still have a very lively interest in it.  Their project is of considerable scale and complexity and I think we should have an open mind on these kinds of proposals.  I have an open mind.  I do not have a closed mind on any aspect of this agenda.  It would not be appropriate to have a closed mind and certainly not until we publish the White Paper, the collective definitive statement on where we want to go.</p><p> I have noted the points raised.  I know what the Deputy states in respect of Grid West.  Obviously he has seen the EirGrid discussion because his remarks are based on it.  The Deputy sees the need to bring biomass forward.  Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na are in the process of attempting to conclude a joint venture at present, to be called bio energy Ireland.  By entering a joint venture they hope to incentivise more supply of sustainable biomass.  NewERA is advising both companies on the development of the joint venture.  I would expect proposals to emerge from that process.</p></speech>

His comments on the Spirit of Ireland were interesting because that concept has been around for about seven or eight years.  In theory it is an excellent suggestion about storing energy for export.  I gather there are sorts of complications surrounding the grant of planning permission and the relationship with local authorities.  I am delighted to hear the Minister say he has an open mind and I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice that the project might be worth pursing.</p><p>Today there is a report in<i>The Irish Times </i>that an Irish offshore energy company has obtained a substantial contract to build the world's largest offshore energy park off the coast of Cornwall in the United Kingdom.  As a Member of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly we have prepared a report on wave energy and visited the Orkneys where there is a major experimental energy storage depot.  We seem to be lagging behind the United Kingdom in this regard, particularly in regard to the vast potential for harnessing wave energy off the west coast.  I believe we have the strongest winds in the world, not just in Europe.  I wonder if the Minister has any observation on that?  The Irish company states it would love to work in Ireland but due to bureaucracy and too much red tape, it would not be able to implement it.  The company operates a Swedish technology and will be involved in a very exciting project that is being funded by the United Kingdom Government.  I know this is coming from the left field, but has the Minister a view on wave energy concepts?</p><p>Deputy Colreavy has raised the issue of fracking.  He and I regularly raise the question of fraking at the committee.  I hope the Government will raise this issue at the next Energy Council.  There is a reference to the issues debated at the Council, it states that others stress the need for greater energy security given the EU's high dependence on energy imports and the exposure of certain member states.  There are mixed views in Europe on fracking.  Some countries have introduced a moratorium, others such as Poland seem to be proceeding with it.  Those of us who have been involved since the very beginning are anxious that there would be a Europe-wide policy position on fracking, which does not seem to have emerged.  I understand that there is no Europe-wide policy position on fracking even though the Commission has published a number of reports.  I think Ireland should have a more proactive approach on this because it is a controversial concept, especially as the UK Government is actively embracing the concept of fracking.  It has introduced very significant tax breaks and concessions.  I would be concerned that pressure would be brought to bear on the Irish Government to do the same.</p><p>I think the Minister might have been alerted in advance to the final point I wish to raise, namely, the Six Nations Rugby Championship being listed for free-to-air terrestrial television.  The committee has had representations from the IRFU on this in the past when it came up under a previous Administration.  Although the Minister has said he has an open mind, my view is that it could prove to be financially devastating for Irish rugby if the Six Nations championship matches were to be listed, but at the same time the vast majority wish to watch these matches on terrestrial television.  Will the Minister clarify his views on this?</p></speech>

I handed the Chairman a petition from the landowners before this meeting requesting that we look again at the matter and ask EirGrid to delay this project and the application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la until such time as specific underground route options are put forward for the North-South interconnector.  The communities affected by Grid Link and Grid West made their submission and changes have taken place.  The people in the north east believe there should be equality of treatment and have asked me to hand the petition to the Chairman.  I organised the petition and more than 95% of landowners have signed it.  They also asked me to request the Chairman to have EirGrid and the County Monaghan Anti-Pylon Committee appear before the committee.</p></speech>

I did not see the report on wave energy in <i>The Irish Times</i>but I will certainly have a look at it when I get a chance.  I share his enthusiasm for this area.  It is something we have taken a close interest in, we are very much involved in supporting research and I mentioned the Beaufort facility in Cork - I performed the topping off ceremony some weeks back.  The Senator will know about the Atlantic marine energy test site, AMETS, in Mayo and the testing work that is going on in Beaufort, which allows devices to be tested.  Those that are successful move on to AMETS in County Mayo.  I absolutely agree with the Senator.  I am disappointed that he met people who thought we were not as enthusiastic as we are.</p><p>If the Deputy has any particular organisation or group with which he has met that he would like me to know about, he can talk to me about it after the meeting.</p></speech>

In relation to raising the issue at the Energy Council, I will have to reflect on what the Senator has said.  I mentioned earlier that it is a competency of member states.  We would not like to be told by others what we should or should not do and I am not sure how well received it would be were we to purport to tell others what they should do in relation to the energy mix.  However, I take the point that the Senator raises.</p> <p>  Before I deal with the designation of sporting events, I note as a courtesy to Deputy Conlan, that he handed me a letter which I understand is accompanied by a petition.  I was literally on the way in the door and I have not had an opportunity to read it.  I note respectfully what he says.  I have the letter and will certainly consider it.</p></speech>

In relation to designated events, I informed my Cabinet colleagues today that I am considering making an order to designate three additional sporting events as so-called &quot;live free-to-air events&quot;.  They are the Six Nations rugby football championship, the all-Ireland senior ladies final and the all-Ireland senior camogie final.  The current list of events has not been changed since 2003, but there will be a consultation process.  No decision has been made.  The consultation process is required under the Act.  I will consult with the relevant sporting bodies, including the IRFU, as well as with the relevant broadcasters.  I will be required to publish a notice in due course of any intended designation and to invite comments from the public and that will be done.  I will consult with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and engage with the European Commission.</p><p>A whole consultation process must be engaged in and I will not share any particular view or conclusion now.  The whole point is that the consultation process must now take place.  What I said was that if one looks at the Act itself, I am required to consider the extent to which an event has a special general resonance for the people of Ireland and the extent to which an event has a generally recognised distinct cultural importance for the people of Ireland.  They are the <i>prima facie</i>issues that must be dealt with.  There is a whole consultation process we must now have.</p></speech>
