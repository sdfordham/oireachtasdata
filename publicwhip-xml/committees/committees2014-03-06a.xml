    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600003#G00300"><p>There is nothing in Standing Orders, but generally the lead speaker gets 20 minutes, the second speaker gets 15 minutes and thereafter the speakers get ten minutes.  In cases, where the speaker is engaged in an exchange with the Accounting Officer, I sometimes let the discussion run because Accounting Officers, as we have seen, often answer in a long-winded fashion.  That eats into the time of the member, so I use my discretion to allow the member in possession some time for questions.  If a member has a number of questions on a particular line with the Accounting Officer, it is fair to let him or her finish out the line of questioning.</p><p>  The first item is the minutes of the meeting of 27 February 2014 with Rehab.  We have received legal advice on the discussion and the papers at that meeting.  Let me make it clear that we have requested a significant amount of information listed under 12 different headings as well as requests for information from the Department of Justice and Equality and SOLAS.  We have requested that this information be provided to the committee within a two-week period.</p><p>  Heading No. 12 is a request for information on the remuneration levels paid to all staff, who are paid a salary equivalent to or above the salary of grade 8 of the consolidated pay scales.  We asked for that information last week and I felt that we had the agreement of Rehab to release that information to us within days.  To date, Rehab has not released the information.  I think we should remind them that they did inform the committee that the details would be made public.  We have taken legal advice on the documents referred to by the HSE and have asked for the material in the correspondence to be made available to us in an unredacted form so that we can view the correspondence between Rehab and the HSE.  I understand that part of that correspondence contains details of salaries and as part of the legal advice this morning, we have requested that as much information as is possible should be given to the committee in an unredacted form.  The work of the committee on Rehab has not concluded.  The information is essential in the context of the examination of section 39 organisations.  Information is required and new information has emerged and we want to examine it in detail.  If we need to have a meeting in public session to do so, so be it.  We have sought legal advice so that we are clear on what we do.  I think members will agree that should be the course of action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600003#G00400"><p>I am not sure if this is the time to raise the following matter in respect of our sitting last week to deal with Rehab.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600003#G00500"><p>Now is the time to deal with matters in respect of Rehab.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600003#G00600"><p>It strikes me that in addition to the request for information under the 12 headings, we should ask if funding from the Department of Social Protection found its way into Rehab.  We have been quoted the figure of &euro;82 million or &euro;83 million but we are clearly missing funding that is coming from another Department.<br />I know the issue concerning the firm Complete Eco Solutions is on this note.  A commitment was given last week to provide the committee with documentation.  It is apparent from a story in <i>The Irish Times </i>that the witness, Ms Kerins, was less than forthcoming in some of the information she clearly had in respect of the relationship a close relative of hers had with that organisation.  I was the member who raised this issue with Ms Kerins and it is deeply unsatisfactory that the CEO of Rehab was evasive or short on the full detail that she clearly must have had when she appeared before the committee.  I hope that when we get a response in respect of this item we get the fullest detailed information from Rehab on Complete Eco Solution and the coffins.<br />Another issue that found its way into media which had been raised in passing at the meeting was in respect of the use of a helicopter by the CEO and potentially by other board members.  At that stage jets were not mentioned but helicopters were.  We did not get a satisfactory account of what was involved.  In fairness to the witness, they were not pressed on the issue, nonetheless it seems that substantial hospitality, at the very least, was afforded to members of the board.  It is in the public interest and in the interest of our consideration of Rehab that we would have information on that matter.  That item is not covered in the 12 headings.</p> <p>I would like to propose that we raise this in additional correspondence and ask for an explanation about this hospitality and the use of these jets and helicopters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600004#H00200"><p>Okay.  Is there any other matter?</p><p>  I received correspondence in the post yesterday which I will pass to the clerk about Complete Eco Solutions.  I think it is of interest to the committee and will have to be examined.  Furthermore, there is anonymous correspondence here which raises a lot of serious questions.  I just opened it before the meeting, and I think the matter will have to be dealt with.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600004#H00400"><p>We have asked for them within two weeks, so there is one week left.</p><p>  There is one other matter which I would like to clear up, because I asked the question of Ms Kerins last week and as far as I recall, there was no answer to it.  I asked whether Mr. Flannery was invited to attend the meeting and whether the remuneration committee was invited to attend the meeting.  There was no answer to either part of that question.  In view of what happened afterwards, where it was said that Mr. Flannery was in the Houses when we were having the meeting, he could very well have been invited.  He may not have been invited; I do not know.  We have to find out.  It is only fair to him and to the committee.  We should write specifically to Ms Kerins and ask for the answer to those two questions, because there is now a third party who has not been before us, and we do not know whether he even knew about the meeting.</p><p>  We need to ask those questions and we also need to ask who decided the make up of the Rehab group that came before the committee.  I think that is also important.  Although Ms Kerins was answering in the context of the remuneration committee, there were certain questions which she simply could not answer because she said that she had no memory of what went on.  If we could get clarity on these issues, it might help to understand what happened on that day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600004#H00500"><p>I think that is a very good suggestion, because you were not given an answer to that line of questioning.  I am working on the assumption that Rehab will furnish us with all of the information, following the 13 points that we have now put to them.  We were very clear that we wished for Mr. Flannery and the remuneration committee to appear before us.  They may or may not have been asked and I take your point, a Chathaoirligh, that we need to clarify that.  In addition, I suggest we reissue the invitation to both Mr. Flannery and the remuneration committee.  We might receive the information first and then invite them in again.  Ms Kerins said last week that she would be in a position to answer any manner of question with equal proficiency to a member of the remuneration committee, but that did not prove to be the case.  She could not even explain an increase in her own salary, so we did not get the answers and we still need to see the people we initially wished to see, namely, Mr. Flannery and the members of the remuneration committee.  The timing of this would of course have to be sequenced with the receipt of the information, but I wish to make that proposal to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600004#H00600"><p>Is that accepted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600004#H00700"><p>I fully agree with Deputy McDonald.  Whether the people were formally invited or not - they should have been - there is no way in hell they did not know they were required here.  If they had read a daily newspaper, or if they were in the Houses at the time and looked at the monitors here, they would clearly have known what we were discussing.  It is quite offensive to the committee that the delegation we sought was not provided, nor was a satisfactory explanation given as to why it was not provided.</p><p>  Any time we have been looking at these section 38 or section 39 agencies, it is quite normal that the chair of the board would attend with the chief executive.  At the end of the day, the chief executive is an employee.  The chairman of the board could also have provided significant light.   The fact that the chairman of the board was not here is wholly inappropriate, so I concur with Deputy McDonald.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600004#H00800"><p>It may be unfair to Mr. Flannery to say that he was here in the House and should have been here in the committee.  Maybe he was not invited; that is why clarification is needed.  The clerk made it clear to Ms Kerins as to who should be here.  We have agreed on the proposition from Deputy McDonald, and there would have to be a sequence in terms of the receipt of the information and whether or not we should have a further meeting with Ms Kerins.  All of that can be considered, but we accept that Mr. Flannery and the remuneration committee will be invited, as well as others, depending on the response from Rehab.</p><p>  I understand there was a perfectly valid reason the chairman of the group was not here.  That was made known to me after the meeting, or perhaps just before.  I am not sure.  We can check that and ensure that we have a response from the chairman of the board.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>  I will move on to correspondence from Mr. Nicholas Jermyn of St. Vincent's University Hospital, which is a response regarding follow-up information requested at the meeting of 16 January 2014, from an anonymous letter dated 4 January 2014.  This is to be noted and published.  We have to set dates for that, and we can deal with it under a work programme for St. Michael's Hospital and other places.</p><p>  The next piece of correspondence from Eileen Quinlivan on 25 February 2014, which deals with further information requested at a meeting on 2014, which is to be noted and  published.  This is about the DDDA.</p></speech>

She sent further credit card statements from 2009 to 2013, but can we get clarity that we now have all statements for the DDDA during its existence?  The last time we were sent records for the period 2004 to 2008, and there was a question mark as to whether they were all the credit cards from that time.  The information that has come in is from a different period, so I would like to get clarification from the authority that we now have all the statements from 2004.</p></speech>

We want an early date and we said that the last day.  The suggestion was that Professor Brennan was abroad and that she would not be available until August.

We will send an e-mail again today reminding her of our interest and our expectation that she will appear sooner rather than later before the committee.</p></speech>

Some of the content is specific to questions I asked.  The correspondence was sent from the State Claims Agency, which handles, among other things, the clinical indemnity scheme and that was the main focus of our discussion at the last meeting.  The longer the meeting went on, the less clear it became with regard to the number of cases settled in court, by mediation or out of court, that is, before the parties went into the court and, perhaps, the settlement was noted.  I had asked for some details because the agency could not give us any realistic figures on the day.  I asked how many cases were finalised in the courts in 2013.  The document relates only to the clinical indemnity scheme, which is under the remit of the State Claims Agency.  It states that six cases were settled in 2013.  The settlements for the people concerned, that is, the plaintiffs, in four of the cases where the judgments were in their favour came to &euro;1,053,178.  That was the information I was seeking.  In addition there were legal and professional costs of &euro;1,465,470.  Whatever about the poor plaintiffs, the barristers got 150% of what the plaintiffs received.  Whereas the plaintiffs received approximately &euro;1 million, the barristers received approximately &euro;1.5 million.  There is something wrong in how the Irish taxpayer has himself in this situation.  People go to court after catastrophic injuries.  We should rename the agency the State barristers fund rather than the State Claims Agency.  There is something outrageous in 60% of the total payment going to barristers.</p><p>  I have raised the matter at successive meetings with the State Claims Agency in the past two years.  In its accounts the agency has a commitment of approximately &euro;1 billion for cases to be settled.  Based on the figures we have received, well in excess of &euro;500 million and possibly up to 60% of the total could be for legal fees to the barrister profession.  We do a good deal of talking at this committee and in the House about public pay scale rates and so on but this is an issue that we must address.</p><p>  Let us consider the chart.  I specifically asked for this information because I could not get a handle on it.  I asked for details - this is only in respect of the clinical injuries scheme - of the payments in 2013 to senior counsel and who received the highest payments.  The Chairman has just agreed to publish the document and it is pursuant to the public session of the committee.  I do not know any of these people personally but the payments to senior counsel are outrageous.  Murray McGrath received &euro;757,728 in 2013 only in respect of his work on the clinical indemnity scheme.  I do know what else he received and he may have received nothing else.  Emily Egan received &euro;694,841.  It is all on the chart.  Patrick Hanratty received &euro;468,413.  Declan Buckley received &euro;363,911 and R&oacute;n&aacute;n Dolan received &euro;227,333.  These five people received well in excess of &euro;2.5 million.  I will not go on to the junior counsel fees, which are for lower amounts.</p><p>  I am not getting into how the figures arose but it is simply wrong.  The Taoiseach is paid a salary as are Ministers but that money is more than the entire Cabinet gets paid.  I have not done the tot but I believe it is more than the entire Cabinet gets paid.  There is something wrong with the legal fees that the Irish taxpayer is paying.  The money should be going to the people who have suffered medical negligence.  Whatever about the private sector being prepared to pay these fees, the Irish taxpayer should not be paying these fees.  I want this issue revisited.  I have asked for the information and it is now on the public record.  The State Claims Agency put it to us at the last meeting that because barristers are sole traders the agency puts the work out to tender and it cannot take on in-house barristers.  If it requires a change in legislation then so be it.  If an organisation like the State Claims Agency is prevented by law from employing barristers then we need to change that law.  I imagine some of these barristers would be happy to work for substantially less than these figures.</p><p>  Pursuant to this I am asking for some follow-up because I am outraged that &euro;2.5 million was spent on these five people under this scheme alone.  We should write back to the State Claims Agency seeking the figures paid to the top ten senior counsel for each of the past five years.  The agency will come back and put it to the committee that the figure of &euro;757,728 represented work over several years and the case was then finalised.  I imagine some of those people may well be working on cases today and that they will be paid next year when the cases are finalised.  We got one little snapshot for one particular year but it has not given us a proper broad view of what has been paid out.  Now that we have seen this information and it is in the public arena the committee should ask for the information for the past five years for the top ten barristers.  This will let us see what is happening in the State Claims Agency because it is an agency for paying barristers, it is not an agency for settling claims for people who have had clinical difficulties.</p></speech>

The activities and running costs of the Department are funded under Vote 27 and Vote 28.</p> <p>Gross expenditure under Vote 28 for Foreign Affairs and Trade amounted to &euro;208 million in 2012.   Administration subheads accounted for just over 70% of that expenditure.  The largest element of this was the salary costs of some 1,260 staff which came to &euro;77 million.  Office premises expenses of &euro;22 million included costs associated with Ireland&rsquo;s network of embassies and missions abroad.  The bulk of the non-administrative expenditure related to contributions to international organisations and grants for support services for Irish emigrants.  Receipts into the Vote comprised mainly fees related to issue of passports and visas, and other consular services.<br />The net supply grant for the Vote in 2012 was &euro;182.2 million.  The outturn for the year was &euro;160.4 million.  The surplus of over &euro;21 million was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.<br />In the course of audit it was noted that the Department paid Ireland&rsquo;s subscriptions for membership of the UN for both 2012 and 2013 in 2012.  The invoice for the 2013 subscription, amounting to $10.65 million, was issued on 27 December 2012, with 30 days to pay.  Full payment was made on 31 December 2012.<br />Members may wish to note that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Public Finance Procedures<i></i>require that payments charged to appropriation accounts should be made only where a liability has matured for payment.  This principle is designed to ensure that the accounts properly present payments that have come in course of payment in the year of account.  The rules also state that Departments should take optimum advantage of credit terms when making payments.  If that payment to the UN had not been made so promptly, the amount liable for surrender from the Vote would have been &euro;8.1 million higher.<br />Vote 27 for international co-operation is administered by the Department&rsquo;s development co-operation division and funds the majority of Ireland&rsquo;s programme of assistance to developing countries.  Spending under that Vote came to &euro;509 million, accounting for over 80% of the development aid provided by Ireland in 2012.<br />Chapter 13 was compiled to provide an overview of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance programme, and of how it is delivered, monitored and reported.  The total programme spend in 2012 was &euro;629 million.  As the committee is aware, the UN has a long-standing target for developed countries to contribute development aid equivalent to 0.7% of GNP annually.  Ireland&rsquo;s programme expenditure was 0.47% of GNP in 2012, down from a peak level of 0.59%.  Only five countries met or exceeded the UN target in 2012.<br />Development aid is channelled through a variety of partner organisations including Government bodies, non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations and multilateral aid agencies.  The delivery channel used in each partner country depends on the type of assistance required and the political and administrative conditions that exist in the country.<br />Given the nature of development aid and the context in which it is delivered, the risk of fraud, corruption and misappropriation will always be significant factors to be taken into account in devising an aid delivery strategy.  For that reason, the chapter examines the key controls in operation in respect of the development aid programme.<br />The Department has in place a specialist evaluation and audit unit that aims to provide assurance that funds are used for their intended purpose and that value for money is achieved.  The primary focus of the unit&rsquo;s audit work is on assessment of the appropriateness and reliability of the accounting and financial management systems of the partner organisations through which aid is delivered.  The work of the unit is overseen by the Department&rsquo;s Audit Committee.<br />A key element of the Irish Aid programme is targeted delivery of assistance to a small number of selected partner countries.<b></b>Since 2011, the unit has carried out formal assessments of the public financial management systems in the partner countries.  These assessments encompass all elements of governance, including accounting, auditing, reporting and local parliamentary oversight, and with a particular emphasis on assessing the status, independence and capacity of the national audit office.  The policy is to carry out two such assessments during each five year strategic plan for partner countries.  The first assessment is carried out at the planning stage, concentrating on the risks associated with channelling funds through government systems.  The second assessment is carried out at the mid-point of the five year plan, focusing in particular on any changes to the public financial management environment.<br />Audit coverage in regard to annual expenditure in partner countries is achieved through a combination of work carried out by the Department&rsquo;s own internal auditors, audits commissioned by Irish Aid or by partner organisations, and reports produced by national audit offices in recipient countries.  The Department examines all the audit reports as they become available to identify issues relevant to Irish aid expenditure, but the reports vary in content, approach and timing.  As a result it can be challenging to compile a comprehensive and timely view of how well Irish funding is controlled and applied.<br />The evaluation and audit unit also carries out formal evaluations of aid programmes on a cyclical basis, co-ordinated with its strategic planning and with formal procedures to track and follow up on recommendations.  Formal evaluations were completed in 2012 of the country strategy papers for Ethiopia, Lesotho and South Africa.<br />Following on from the identification in October 2012 of misappropriation of &euro;11.6 million in donor funding in Uganda, including &euro;4 million from Irish Aid, the chapter also considered the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s control systems in that country, and its response to the case.<br />The misappropriation came to public attention through a report of the Ugandan Auditor General.  We concluded that, given the Department&rsquo;s presence on the ground in Uganda and the scope for information sharing with other donors, the Department should have been aware of concerns in regard to funding provided through government systems prior to the publication of the auditor general&rsquo;s report.<br />More generally, there appears to be scope for improvement in the Department&rsquo;s capacity to identify early signs of a deteriorating risk environment in a partner country.  For that purpose, I recommended that the Department should implement a risk dashboard system for key partner countries, based on key risk indicators.  This should assist the Department to identify emerging risks and to take appropriate action at an early stage.<br />Since the discovery of the fraud in Uganda, the Department has undertaken a number of initiatives aimed at improving the controls in key partner countries.  Those initiatives included carrying out a review of the systems in place in all partner countries and appointing a chief risk officer within the Department.  At an overall level, the Department&rsquo;s response to the fraud in Uganda appears to have been appropriate and proportionate.  The Department was refunded the full amount of the loss by the Government of Uganda, before the end of 2012.</p></speech>

I introduced them earlier but I am joined by colleagues who have particular knowledge of the aspects of the Department's work that may be helpful to the committee.</p><p>  As I said earlier, I want to place on record my appreciation for the support of the committee in the appointment of a chief financial officer, which is a very positive development for the Department.  I would like to thank also the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for facilitating the creation of this post.  Mr. Conlon will head an integrated departmental finance unit covering Votes 27 and 28, and I am confident that his engagement will improve the coherence, continuity and efficiency of the finance function across the Department.</p><p>  I know the committee has been supplied with some general briefing on the Department and its activities.  This material provides a factual summary of the main areas of departmental expenditure and receipts in 2012, and I do not propose to introduce it orally.  Instead, it might be helpful if I briefly address some important developments since I last appeared before the committee in December 2012.</p><p>  The Department has prioritised the national effort to rebuild Ireland's international standing after the financial crisis.  Considerable progress has been made since we last met.  Our successful EU Presidency in the first half of last year, together with our exit from the EU-IMF programme, was a major milestone.</p> <p>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in its recently published report on the contribution of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to economic recovery kindly acknowledged our efforts.  To maintain this positive momentum internationally, the Government has decided to expand the diplomatic network with the addition of eight new missions, including five new embassies and three new consulates general to be established in locations across south-east Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas.  The expansion is designed specifically to assist in promoting our economic and commercial interests abroad and takes account of the recently published review of the Government's trade, tourism and investment strategy.</p><p> The recently announced year-long programme of ministerial-led events targeting trade and investment for Ireland in 2014 will be supported strongly by the Department.  The programme includes the Government's St. Patrick's Day Promote Ireland programme of international activity which will see 27 Ministers taking part in more than 100 business events and 80 high level political meetings in 35 cities across 23 countries.</p><p> Since our last meeting, we have seen the successful conclusion of Ireland's chairmanship in office of the OSCE, which culminated in the hosting of the OSCE ministerial council meeting in Dublin in December 2012 and the commencement of our term on the United Nations Human Rights Council.  The budgetary and human resources situation facing the Department continues to be challenging, as is the case throughout the public service.  The combined allocation of the Foreign Affairs Votes 27 and 28 continues to decline.  It was more than &euro;1 billion in 2008 and is &euro;691 million in 2014, which is a reduction of 36%.  We continue to face severe difficulties due to staff reductions.  I am pleased to report that we have recently concluded a successful recruitment competition for third secretaries, which is the entry level grade for the diplomatic service.  This is a welcome development which will assist us greatly to meet the challenge of establishing the eight new missions in the course of the year.</p><p> Vote 27 is directed to international co-operation.  The annual overseas development aid allocation represents an ongoing and very significant Irish contribution to international development.  Our last discussion with the committee took place against the background of a serious case of misappropriation of Irish Aid funds in Uganda, which was uncovered by the Auditor General of that state.  A team of auditors from the Department's independent evaluation and audit unit was sent to investigate, and its report was subsequently made public.  A key finding of the investigation was that the fraud was sophisticated and elaborate, involving an exceptionally high level of collusion at senior level which could not reasonably or normally have been anticipated.  The report also highlighted a number of important areas in which Irish Aid's own management control systems needed to be strengthened.</p><p> This led to my request early last year for the conduct by the Department's evaluation and audit unit of a full review of all our internal control and risk management systems across the bilateral aid programme to ensure risks were being identified and managed appropriately.  This was a major undertaking.  It has been completed in respect of all nine key priority countries.  All of the recommendations made in the report of these audits have been accepted by management.  The report and management's response have been published online in compliance with good practice.  The report was positive overall but highlighted a number of areas in which improvements are necessary to strengthen further our systems of management and financial control.  I am pleased that actions have already been taken by us to strengthen our systems.  This process will continue.</p><p> I am pleased to note that the final report into the misappropriation in Uganda has been published on our website.  The report concludes that all of the recommendations made at the interim report stage have either been fully met or are the subject of satisfactory progress to address issues.  The report also includes an assessment of systems and internal controls now in place in our mission in Uganda and concludes that these are good and appropriate for the programme.  I visited Africa twice last year in follow-up to the reported fraud.  I went to Zambia in February where I met heads of our development missions to discuss the lessons of the fraud for the development programme and stress the need for vigilance.  In July, I visited Uganda itself where I met local officials and embassy staff and looked at aspects of the programme.</p><p> During the first half of this year, our aid programme is undergoing a searching peer review by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee.  This arises approximately every five years and provides a valuable internationally benchmarked and independent assessment of the programme against best international practice.  It also serves as a mechanism of public accountability and institutional learning.  The result of the review will be published later in the year.  The committee will have a great interest in its findings.  I appreciate the committee's involvement with the programme and its visit to another programme country, which provided great support.  The committee's interrogation is an added aspect of our efforts to ensure our programme incorporates best possible practice.  It is absolutely right that our aid programme, which is paid for by the people, is subject to intense scrutiny.  The committee's work is central to that.  That level of examination enables our work programme to continue to make a real and tangible difference to the lives of millions of the poorest people in the world.  I will do my best with colleagues to respond to any questions posed by members of the committee.</p></speech>

He said the centre of economic gravity is shifting to the east.  He spoke about the further development of our presence in the Untied States of America and a reconfiguration of our approach in Africa.  He spoke about new missions in, for example, Indonesia.  Can we go through the continents?  It relates to the Vote.  Mr. Cooney mentioned that we will have five new embassies and three new consulates.  Where are we going to have them?  That would be interesting to know.  Where are we shutting down?  That would also be interesting to know.  What is the rationale for the shift?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Cooney" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014030600008#M00500"><p>The Government decided to open eight new missions which comprised five embassies and three consulates general.  We have 73 missions with a further two in Armagh and Belfast.  In addition to the eight openings, the Government decided to close the embassy in Lesotho.  The rationale behind that closure is that while we have had a programme there of very long standing, there are absorption capacities in Lesotho.  It has become a middle income country and is the most wealthy country <i>per capita</i>among those in which we have aid missions.  The assessment after consideration was that the remaining programme in Lesotho could be handled effectively from South Africa.  Pretoria is very close.  We will maintain a small office but it will not be staffed by headquarters staff.  It will be staffed by a local employee.  The rationale is sound although it is never a happy occasion to close an embassy or to pull out of a country with which we have had a long relationship.  In terms of rationalisation, we felt the resources could be used better elsewhere.<br />In terms of the embassies we are opening, the emphasis is on Asia where three of the missions will be located.  We will have embassies in Indonesia and Thailand and a consulate general in Hong Kong.  The lack of embassies in Indonesia and Thailand has represented a significant gap in our service.  Certainly, pressure has been applied through the Global Irish Network and the three meetings of the forum have all pointed to this absence.  I am delighted to be able to plug that gap.  Indonesia is a huge country with enormous potential.  Thailand is a very significant economy.  Having missions on the ground in those states will allow us to exploit to a much greater extent the economic potential there.  The decisions to open the missions have been welcomed greatly by the Irish communities in those countries but also by the agencies.  The absence to date of a consulate general in Hong Kong has been a significant gap in our network of missions.  There is huge potential there.</p> <p>We feel we will be able to exploit that considerably working with the agencies, which are in Hong Kong.  We think that having an embassy will assist in dealing with Chinese authorities.  They are very focused on the state.  It is very difficult for companies to do business in China even in a place like Hong Kong without the backing and presence of the state.  </p><p> Moving on to the US, we have been very pleased with the activities of the consulate general we opened in Atlanta a few years ago.  It has made a real difference on a very small budget.  One career consul is in that consulate.</p></speech>

Atlanta is a very significant hub for business.  Certainly, the feedback we have got from the agencies and business presence on the ground is that this has made a big difference to the profile of Ireland.  Texas is the same.  It is a very significant economy that is bigger than many national economies around the world.  Putting someone into Austin, which is the political capital of Texas, will help us significantly.  We decided on Austin rather than Houston.  Other countries have gone to Houston but they tend to be countries that have a significant interest in the oil business which, unfortunately, is not a business in which we have a high profile.  Our analysis was that we would be better focused on Austin.  Again, for a very small outlay, we expect to get a decent return from that.</p><p>  We have an embassy in Brasilia.  Brazil is a huge country but S&atilde;o Paulo is the economic capital.  The agencies do not have a particularly big presence there.  Enterprise Ireland has a part-time presence.  I think it is a Portuguese national who is operating on the ground in S&atilde;o Paulo.  We think this will make a significant difference in establishing an Irish profile in S&atilde;o Paulo, which is non-existent at the moment.  Brazil is a huge country with a huge and growing economy.  One cannot operate consulates without first having a embassy, which we have.  However, the embassy is in the centre of the country and is some distance from S&atilde;o Paulo so we think having a small mission on the ground will make a significant difference for us.  </p><p>  Kenya is the economic powerhouse of east Africa.  We do not have an embassy in Kenya.  We are re-opening one that closed many years ago.  I think it was back in the 1980s.</p></speech>

Clearly, it will be different in profile compared to our embassies in Tanzania or Uganda, which are mainly development-focused.  We see the Kenya mission as looking at development and having a significant role in promoting business with the region.  As we can see in a country like Kenya, promoting business is a significant aspect of development.  People who suggest that development and business are totally separate are making a big mistake.  We have seen from this country that we only really achieved significant social and economic development when our economy grew.  One can pour all the money in the world into-----</p></speech>

However, the fact that we have opened an embassy in Africa for that reason is a pretty significant shift when one considers our recent history and the reasons that we set up missions in our programme countries.  It is a significant shift to do it for those reasons.</p></speech>

It reflects the Africa strategy and the work we have been doing.  If one looks at the different stages, with an absolute disaster, humanitarian aid is going in to keep people alive.  One then moves on to development where one is trying to get basic development going but then one moves on to trying to stimulate and assist with economic development.  We also have a mission in Nigeria which is mainly focused on economic matters.</p><p> Croatia is completing our network of missions in EU countries which I said here before is absolutely crucial to Ireland.  Every EU member state has a vote in the EU institutions - a vote that has a direct impact on the lives of Irish people.  We need to be in contact with the institutions, parliaments and government departments in those countries to intervene.  We had a value-for-money review of our missions in EU countries over the course of the last year.  The report is available.  It involved our own evaluation.  An audit unit was chaired by an independent chairman and included representatives of various Government Departments, including the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Taoiseach and Finance.  That report, which is a quite thorough and a very good piece of work, came to the conclusion that our missions in EU countries were value for money and that we should have a mission in every EU state.</p></speech>

That is a separate case.  Croatia will have a small one-diplomat mission.  We are at the cutting edge of trying to develop new forms of diplomatic representation at a low cost.  Our one-person missions have attracted quite a lot of interest from other EU member states who are interested in seeing how we can operate them.  The report on the EU missions pointed out that another one-person mission is not all good news.  There are stresses and pressures on a one-person mission and expectations that are difficult to achieve.  We are looking at the one-person missions network to ensure we can maintain it at an effective level and provide the necessary support.  It is a good idea that is working but, understandably, these missions need a bit more support from home than if they were larger missions.</p><p>  I know why the embassy to the Holy See was closed.  It was genuinely closed for cost reasons but it is interesting that nobody in the world believes me so I am very happy to go on the record to explain why it was closed and re-opened.  It is very interesting.  People are very reluctant to believe something if it does not conform with their beliefs or prejudices or the need for a good story.  It was closed for cost-cutting reasons in 2011.  We carried out an analysis of how we could find savings.  Every Government Department was required to find savings at the time.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade only has two ways of making savings.  We either cut the aid budget or we close embassies.  I believe very firmly that had we offered significant cuts in the aid budget at that time, it would have been an ongoing process of significant cuts.  The T&aacute;naiste was very keen to protect the aid programme.  I think he had considerable support for that so, therefore, we had to look at closing embassies.  There were those who suggested that we should close embassies in EU countries.  Again, I believe that had we closed embassies in EU countries, I do not know how many we would have lost by now.  We needed to protect that network which left very few alternatives.  The embassy to the Holy See was closed because it was genuinely believed, and I believe this is right, that the relationship could be most effectively handled on a non-residential and care and maintenance basis.  I hoped that it could be re-opened in due course when the situation improved and that has been the case.</p> <p>We have reopened it.  I think there is a considerable attachment to the relationship with the Holy See among a considerable portion of the population; that was made clear.  Also the direction and the leadership of Pope Francis in relation to issues of hunger and poverty very much chime with our own policy.  The T&aacute;naiste recommended to the Government that we reopen the Embassy to the Holy See.  Again it will be on a very modest basis.  It will be a one-diplomat mission.</p><p> We have saved, in the meantime, a considerable amount of money.  The Villa Spada, which was one of our biggest embassies and which was the location for the residence and the chancery to the Holy See, is now the residence and the chancery for the Embassy to the Italian Republic, to Italy.  It contains a much larger number of staff members.  It is used far more intensively.  It is now used very thoroughly.  Ironically, of course, the Villa Spada is where Garibaldi made his last stand against the French at the time of the Roman Republic.  It is an iconic building from the point of view of the Italian Republic and perhaps more appropriately hosts that embassy.</p></speech>

However, we have not been able to identify any Irish citizen resident in Ukraine.  It does not mean to say they might not be there, but we are not aware of anybody.  Nobody has been notified to us.  Nobody has notified themselves to us.  We have an ambassador to Ukraine.  It is a non-resident ambassador, based in Prague.  They have been going to Kiev on a regular basis over the last few weeks.</p><p>  We have an online system where we ask citizens to register to us in all countries so that we have as good an idea as possible of how many citizens we have in each country.  At the moment we have no special arrangement in place.  We co-operate very closely with our EU partners and there is no move under way to arrange for the evacuation of citizens at the moment.</p></speech>

As I understand the process after what happened in Uganda, the heads of mission reviewed their own programmes; there was a meeting and they dealt with common themes.  After what the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on in 2012 with regard to a risk dashboard, this is the report and recommendations we arrived at.  Some of these recommendations are pretty obvious and one would question whether we should not have been doing these anyway.  Point 5.4 states: "The overall finding is that there are weaknesses in this area with insufficient elaboration of the flow of funds and structures around the management of complex modalities".  Did we find anything else when these missions undertook their own internal reviews, when there were comparisons?  While we were investigating for this report, published in February, did we find anything else about which we should be worried within our systems and procedures in any programme country? </p></speech>

When we came here in December 2012, we had all been very shaken by what had happened in Uganda.  We put our hand up at the time and said we had already identified areas where things could have been done better by ourselves.  We followed up very robustly.  When we came here the last time, the interim report of the evaluation audit unit had already been published.  Following that, the first thing to say is that we got the money back, very significantly due to the efforts of Mr. Brendan Rogers and our ambassador.</p></speech>

However, we got more back than we gave them; that is true.</p><p>  We got the money back.  We asked the embassies to review their risks situation and their procedures.  We had a meeting with the heads of mission in Lusaka.  Mr. Rogers, Mr. Carlos and I went through it and emphasised the need for vigilance.  We effectively pointed out that we needed to make sure that we upped our game in terms of vigilance.  The evaluation on audit unit carried out its inspections of the various missions.  We had the nine missions and that has arrived at the Synthesis report, which is before us.</p><p>  I went out, as I said earlier, to Kampala in July where I met the Attorney General and the Minister at the department of foreign affairs.  In addition to the Synthesis report, we have also had the final report of the evaluation and audit unit into the fraud in Uganda.  The two reports that have just appeared and which members of the committee have, the Synthesis report and the final report of the evaluation and audit unit into the fraud in Uganda, represent an impressive piece of work.  Our evaluation and audit unit is independent of the development co-operation division and independent of Irish Aid.  It is important that it can call it as it finds it and that it points out failings.  As I said when I was here the last time, if there are failings, I am much happier that they are pointed out and I do not mind them being pointed out because if we do not face up to them, confront them and deal with them, we surely will fail again.</p></speech>

I refer to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  He picked us up on the fact that in his view we should have been informed earlier of the reports of the deterioration of the situation in Uganda.  I cannot argue with that.  I fully accept the Comptroller and Auditor General's proposal that we should have a risk dashboard put in place and we are working on that.  I agree that perhaps we should have had systems in place before.  That is the value of these reports.  I refer to paragraph 6 of the Synthesis report which sets out a number of proposals, some of which one might legitimately say we should have had in place.  I do not mind accepting that there were weaknesses and if there were, I am glad they have been pointed out and we will put them right.  Mr. Brendan Rogers is responsible for this area and he may have a different perspective to me.</p></speech>

I agree that those questions are fair.  The Synthesis report is a summary of nine reports, reflecting the significant work carried out since we last met in December 2013.  Uganda has been visited approximately 12 times.  I have been to Uganda three times.  It has been very intensive work.  The reports cover the nine programme countries and they conclude that the systems are fairly strong and pretty adequate in a lot of cases but like every forensic audit, there are all kinds of gaps and areas that need to be strengthened.</p><p>  The Department has accepted all those recommendations.  Standardisation of the management systems is where the greatest gap occurs.  The management systems were reasonably strong but they had grown separately under different heads of missions and different personnel.  We have to implement a standardised system.  These recommendations are telling us to standardise the management systems, the floor funds, the MOUs and the work with NGOs.  As a result we have established a task group which is chaired by the head of our programme-country section.  Over the next few months we will be working very hard to ensure that when we next meet the committee, there will be a very high-level strong and standardised system in place.  Some of this will involve cross-learning because some of the missions have done excellent work and we need to cross-fertilise that learning into the other systems.</p></speech>

Apart from &euro;300,000 which is being examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, there is a misconception that Ireland has suspended aid to Uganda but this is not the case.

We are on the ground talking to our donors and there are various rumours and views.  We should be transmitting them more quickly to headquarters.  That is what the dashboard system will do.  However, we were picking up issues and we made a decision a few years ago that we should begin to move away somewhat from government systems.  We were on that course and it was not a case of having to change the ship.  We are now managing our major school-building programme in Karamoja for ourselves, using management agents.  The schools are still needed by the system and they were to be built in the national system but we intend to build them ourselves and we will put an Irish flag on them.  This was a major change of policy.</p></speech>

I have been involved in this area for a good few years and it has been beaten into me that the best way of spending our money is by means of the governmental systems.  There is a reason we are not doing this in Uganda.  Has the Synthesis report changed the Department's view with regard to that approach anywhere else?  It has always been the policy mantra that this is the most effective, sustainable way of achieving a bang for our buck.  There are inherent dangers in using this system but has there been a change?</p></speech>

The best way that we can exit from provision of aid is when these factors are in place.  There has been a major hit in Uganda because of corruption and fraud.  As a result we have had to carry out a forensic and detailed analysis on our other countries.  The Deputy has visited Mozambique and Ethiopia.  We are still working through government systems in those countries to a greater or lesser extent because there are different levels of governance.  I do not think our core belief in the need for creating good democratic institutions of state has been fundamentally shifted.  However, on a practical level, if we cannot trust the systems we cannot take part.  We have taken a clear decision with regard to Uganda and I do not foresee us returning soon.</p></speech>

For example, budget support was very important a few years ago when taxation revenues and remittances in Africa were very low.  However, government systems are much improved now compared to when I started in this business 20 years ago.  Taxation revenues are coming in and governments have capacity.  As a result we have to slightly change the way we do business and look at how to do business differently.

The Department condemns it because it is not helpful and will act to the detriment of Uganda in attracting foreign investment.  International companies will not find it easy to attract workers to Uganda, in particular, workers who are gay.  It is a very bad move from the point of view of Uganda.  However, we are not in Uganda to assist the parliament or the President but to assist some of the poorest people on the planet.  Last July I visited Karamoja where the society is not dissimilar to that in Ireland at the time of the settlement of Ulster.  It is a society of nomadic cattle owners who are making the transition to being a more settled society.  Whatever about the actions of the Ugandan Government, we do not believe it would be appropriate to cut off our assistance which is going directly to the people mentioned.</p><p>  On how to deal with the Ugandan anti-gay law, it is a question of education.  It is worth recalling that when Albert Reynolds left the Edinburgh meeting of the European Council in December 1992 to announce that Ireland would receive &euro;8 billion from the European Union, same-sex sexual acts were still criminal offences in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is a matter of education and convincing people to move on.  If we can make transitions of that nature, we must hope people elsewhere in the world will be able to find similar enlightenment over a short period.  I do not think our reaction should be to cease aid.  In fact, much of it is going to help people in Uganda who are suffering from conditions such as AIDS-HIV.</p></speech>

We assisted in some ways, but the impetus came from both sides of the link.  Louth County Council is doing some work in Malawi and a number of institutions in Ireland have links with Vietnam.  We encourage such arrangements and individual contacts.  The missionaries have left these countries and we want to ensure the connection and empathy with Ireland remain, which means people connecting with each other rather than simply providing aid programmes.  Dublin City Council is interested in doing similar work.  I refer to the volunteering initiative for senior people to spend some time in Africa.

The Department alone spent &euro;10 million less than had been estimated.  I have the figures to hand.  This was as a result of the very good work done across government.  I pay particular tribute to staff in my Department and my colleague, Mr. Tim Moore, who previously worked in Dublin but is now with the permanent mission in New York.  Because of the very sensitive, frugal way in which we approached the Presidency we saved a significant amount.  All events were hosted in Dublin Castle and all efforts at making savings were pursued.  We achieved very good value compared to the cost of any previous Presidency, although the Danes might believe they vie with us, but they have different accounting arrangements.  The underspend on the EU Presidency in 2012 was &euro;6.432 million, which was significant.  The savings were even more significant across government, although a good proportion were made in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p> <p>The saving in my Department alone over the two years for which funding was provided - 2012 and 2013 - was &euro;10.6 million out of an Estimate of &euro;18.4 million.  That demonstrates the saving.  For the whole of Government, the total amount estimated for the Presidency was &euro;67.3 million and the total spend was &euro;44 million, which was a saving of &euro;25.3 million over the whole of the EU Presidency.</p></speech>

Most of the money was spent hosting meetings, of which there were more than 100 in Ireland.  We centralised everything.  All the meetings were held in Dublin Castle whereas during previous Presidencies we had meetings around the country.  There was real restraint as to costs of catering and we attracted sponsorship for the provision of transport.  It was something we could feel a genuine sense of achievement about.</p></speech>

When the Secretary General was here in April 2012, I was not a member of the committee.  He mentioned at that meeting an intention to examine co-operation across a range of agencies, including the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, under an initiative called "Houses of Ireland".  Has there been progress on that and what is its status?  It seems to have been a good idea for trying to promote Ireland.  We could get a bigger bang from our buck if we could combine our efforts from different sectors.</p></speech>

It is very important that we maximise our resources.  Our is a small country with limited resources and should avoid duplication.  We work closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on a number of fronts.  My Department's responsibility in the trade area is one of trade promotion.  We are responsible for the Export Trade Council which meets periodically during the year under the chairmanship of the T&aacute;naiste and brings together all Ministers involved in the trade area, representatives of private enterprise and other Departments.  My Department also looks after the joint trade commissions we have with a number of countries including Russia and Saudi Arabia, the St. Patrick's Day programme and we task our missions with particular actions.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is responsible for the two largest agencies engaged in trade and investment promotion, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  We co-operate with those agencies directly as well as with Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and others.</p></speech>

Where there is an embassy, consulate and an agency, a co-ordination committee is established, chaired by the ambassador.  It seeks to co-ordinate strategy on the ground.  Where possible and in a considerable number of locations, we have Ireland-house arrangements.  We have that in New York.  Everybody is located in the same premises.  That has a benefit from the perspective of rent costs as well as in terms of synergies and daily communication.  In some cases, it is not possible as the embassy is in an administrative capital such as Brasilia or Canberra.  In Italy, our embassy is in Rome whereas the agencies are based in Milan.  Where it can be done, we do it.  We will always endeavour to do it where possible.</p><p>  We work closely with agencies in the field although we do not have a line relationship with them.  We cannot control them.  They do not report to us.  Recently, the Government agreed that my Department will seek to liaise with the agencies to ensure that we co-ordinate on choosing how and where to locate.  It is something we do already, but we will make additional efforts to see if more can be done.  On the ground, we work closely together, including in Africa where Brendan Rogers was recently talking to local representatives in Pretoria.  It is something that has changed very much from the time I joined the Department when trade was seen as something out there.  We were diplomats and we focused on diplomacy.  Now, trade is front and centre of our work.  It is not just the most important work we do, although much of our other work is also important, it is - for those who get the opportunity to do it - the most rewarding aspect of our work.  There is a real sense of return where one is able to help to bring jobs and investment to the country.</p></speech>

We have introduced an appointments service for customers attending the Molesworth Street office.  If one visits that office, one will no longer find queues.  People are in and out from their appointments in a very short period of time.  We have rolled out a service which allows people who need to travel at short notice to get a passport within three days and we are hoping within the next month to improve that service to provide a same-day service to those in emergencies who need to travel, subject to certain criteria, in particular in relation to children.  We must be extremely vigilant with regard to children.</p><p>  The incidents of fraud were discovered by the Passport Service itself.  An incident of fraud came to light in the middle of last year.  We called in the Garda and an investigation took place, which resulted in the interview of a number of officials.  There are two officials who are no longer in the employ of the Department as a direct result.  I understand the Garda will be sending files to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As part of the same exercise, we discovered another incident.</p> <p>Again, it is related to a small number of staff being interviewed by the Garda.  As of now, two members of staff are suspended.  We are conducting our own internal investigation into the two members of staff concerned and obviously I cannot say what the outcome of that investigation will be.</p></speech>

What checks and balances are in place to ensure there is no illegality in the issuance of passports?  Clearly, an Irish passport as an EU passport is a valuable commodity; therefore, it is important that there be checks.  I thank the officials.</p></speech>

It has become difficult because the booklet has become so sophisticated.  It won an award recently.  I do not know if members have seen our new attractive booklet.  It is a handsome document and statement of identity and it won an award recently as the best European document.  Those who wish to obtain passports are looking for fraudulently obtained genuine passports.  The group I established has reported back with a number of proposals for actions we should take.  These are actions we wish to take.  We are rolling out an ambitious programme which involves upgrading our systems.  When they were introduced ten years ago, they were state-of-the-art, but things have moved on.  We are under way and Mr. Nugent will tell the committee a little more about what we are doing on that front.</p></speech>

Passports have become incredibly valuable documents not just for the purposes of travel but, equally, for getting a bank account and other activities.  For that reason, they clearly attract the attention of those who would like to use for them unlawful purposes.  There are two broad aspects.  The Secretary General has discussed the changes we have made to the security features of the book to make it more resistant to attack for forgery purposes.  The second part is that people internationally are moving towards trying to obtain what are called fraudulently obtained genuine passports, in essence, assuming the identity of others.  The systems we need to put in place, therefore, clearly have to keep track of and a focus on the more particular attacks we have seen of late.  That means changes to the application processes we have in place, the technology systems and, from an internal point of view, looking at the way we monitor the processing of applications and assessing whether we are seeing potential threats from the point of view of how documents are handled and who is handling them.  We have made a series of moves in making short-term, immediate changes; equally, we are looking at long-term changes to processes in the coming years.</p><p>  In addition to the review referred to by the Secretary General, we also undertook a look-back process where we took applications received in 2013 and undertook a thorough examination of their processing to establish whether there were other matters that would be of concern to us, either specifically in respect of unusual applications or more generally around our broad approaches.  The evaluation and audit unit is in the process of finalising a report on that process, but I am satisfied that the findings will show our processes are good.  The reputation of the passport is well respected internationally.  Irish people should realise that our document gets us into as many countries without a visa as most other countries.  People from five or six countries may be able to access more countries than us.  Our challenge is to make sure it stays that way and we make it easy for people to travel to countries without any administrative burden.</p></speech>

I presume this refers to the fact that somebody is working part time.  Of that number, 764 are at home, 585 are abroad and 17 are in Northern Ireland.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's answer went through the allowances payable by the Department, starting with allowances that are common to more than one Department and to which every civil servant would be entitled.  Then it listed some that are specific to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and then allowances paid to officers serving at missions abroad.  That includes the cost of living, local post and representation allowances.  Are those figures all included in the &euro;77 million?</p></speech>

That subhead, salaries and allowances (non-pay), includes representation allowance, rent allowance and school fees but the foreign service allowance is included in the salary element.  There are two elements: salaries and allowances (pay), which includes the foreign service allowance, and salaries and allowances (non-pay), which includes representation, medical and school fees allowances, etc.</p></speech>

I wanted to be sure of that.  I thank Mr. Cooney.  The figures from the answer to the parliamentary question add the cost of living allowance to the local post allowance, child foreign allowance, other foreign service allowance, rent, furniture, school fee, assistant, representation, health insurance and medical expenses, detention, disturbance and temporary accommodation costs allowances.  I am not saying any of these are invalid.  In 2012 this total came to &euro;21.5 million, which represents 28% of the Department's total pay costs.  That seems extremely high.</p></speech>

Others are based on a formula agreed with the Department of Finance.  The local post allowance allows a certain amount of additional expenditure which one requires when living abroad.  When living abroad there is a need to expend more on various aspects of one's life to keep up with representational aspects and additional aspects of life, for instance the need to travel on a not very regular basis to see one's family.  There is a cost of living-----</p></speech>

I just want to tease out some of the details.  May I go through each of the headings and get an understanding of what they are and the basis behind them?  I apologise if Mr. Cooney does not have the parliamentary question before him.  It says the estimated cost of living allowance was &euro;2.4 million in 2012 and was paid to 335 people who served abroad.  We have fewer than 300 serving abroad now, so it looks like everybody who was serving abroad at the time got it.  Does everybody get it?</p></speech>

It is not a significant figure.  It is affected by the changes in salaries here.  When salaries decrease here, the allowances decrease too.  The cost of living element is applied to a combination of the allowance and salary to try to ensure the officer enjoys the same standard of living abroad as at home.  In countries where the cost of living is higher than in Ireland, this allowance is given to bring the income up to an equivalent level.  That allowance is calculated on the basis of research done by an independent international company in the same way as most foreign services in Europe and North America do.  That cost of living allowance exists simply to compensate for a higher cost of living in some countries abroad.  It is not meant to bring any additional remunerative benefit to the officer concerned.</p></speech>

It is paid as an amount based on rent to compensate people because they incur additional expenditure by living abroad.  It is not simply to cover rent but additional expenditure.  I do not own a property, for example.  If I was sent to Berlin for three years, I would not keep my home but rather let the lease run out and move to Berlin.  If I got a rent payment, I would not be compensated but rather rewarded.  The basis of the taxation code - where allowances can be given without being taxed - is that these payments are compensatory.  Therefore, it is very much within Mr. Cooney's remit to be worried about whether people are making a profit if the payments are meant to be compensatory.</p></speech>

In the business case put forward to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to justify the expenses allowances, it was noted that a deal was done with the Department of Finance in 2005 that the allowances would not be taxable on the basis that they were purely compensatory for additional costs incurred by people on the back of their going abroad.  If I surrender a lease at home or have a mortgage repaid so I do not incur additional rental costs, there is no extra cost and the payment is not compensatory.</p></speech>

Even if somebody decides to rent a property or owns half a dozen properties, I cannot get into individual circumstances.  I cannot decide it is fine if a property is not rented but it is not fine if somebody decides to rent half a dozen properties they own.  It would be impossible to start interrogating people about whether they rent a property or sell when they go abroad.  The Deputy is basically asking that if somebody goes abroad and decides to rent their property, that person should not get an allowance.</p></speech>

Presumably if somebody has a property here and is renting it, he or she is liable for tax on the rental income.  The tax would be collected on that side rather than taxing the allowance.</p></speech>

I may be on a salary and when I move abroad, I get paid a cost of living allowance because it is more expensive to live in that place.  The local post allowance compensates me.  If I do not own a property and I cancel my lease, having had my salary adjusted for cost of living expenses and a local post allowance, would rent be paid on top of that, although there is no extra cost to me?  To be pernickety about this, according to Mr. Cooney's business case, section 25 of the Finance Act 2005 includes a provision for the tax treatment of foreign services allowances.  The measure provides that the Minister for Finance, in agreement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or another relevant Minister, may certify as exempt from taxation certain allowances which provide compensation to officers of the State for the extra costs arising in being obliged to live outside the State and performing the duties of employment.  That is my point.  If Mr. Cooney wishes to revert with a note detailing legal advice or correspondence with the Department of Finance, that is fair enough.</p></speech>

It also represents 28% of the expenses element of the Department's budget for staff in 2012.  All I am trying to get at is whether we are getting value for money, which is the remit of this committee.  We must ask these questions and seek information to be satisfied, as the public watchdog, that we are getting value for money.

The Deputy is fully entitled to seek value for money and this is what the committee is supposed to do.  I am happy to answer any questions.  I am simply making the point to the Deputy that his expectation in the pursuit of officers regarding private circumstances before they can qualify for an allowance is untenable.  I do not see how one can insist that an officer handles private effects in a certain way before he or she can be considered for an allowance.  I do not know the private circumstances and residential status of officers.  I am certainly prepared to return with the business cases we made regarding allowances, their value and why we paid them.</p></speech>

There are considerable inconveniences and costs in going abroad, and it is by no means the case that the financial package for going abroad is so attractive that we are inundated with offers from people wishing to do so.  I hope I have never shown any disrespect to this committee and that I have not shown disrespect to the Deputy.  Nevertheless, what he suggests would involve considerable intrusion into the private affairs of officials working in the Department.</p></speech>

Do the 325 officials automatically get all the allowances outlined by Deputy Nolan or do they have to make a case under each heading to get the allowance?  Do they make the application or does the Department apply the allowances across the board without question?</p></speech>

One has to apply for school fees.  An amount for representational allowance is allocated to each embassy for the year and is then allocated to the officers in the embassy.

Is that based on a basket of goods that includes rent?  If it does include rent they are being doubly compensated.  If not, it is quite fair.  The local post allowance averaged approximately &euro;17,000 per annum per person in 2012, and many other costs for which compensation is fair.  If education costs are included in the cost of living increase, why do we pay education costs individually?  If medical costs are included in the cost of living bundle, why do we compensate for those separately and so on?</p><p>  I raised a legal point about the rent allowance, based on the Department&rsquo;s business case for the deal done with the Department of Finance on extra costs, and not simply additional costs.  It has to be extra.  That was the legal requirement for calculating that.  I would like to see the analysis behind that.  What exactly is the representation allowance for?</p></speech>

That is how we promote, make contacts and build relationships with businessmen.  It is not spent on private entertainment, such as going out for pizza with one&rsquo;s wife.  The head of mission goes through these things and allocates them to the members of staff.</p></speech>

At the beginning of the year there is a responsibility not to overspend.  A provisional allocation is made between members of staff.  They are told that for their work they each have access to specific amounts.  That gives them an idea of how much they can spend over the course of the year.  They cannot splurge it in one go.  It is not a competition between members of the embassy to see who can use up the most.  It is allocated on that basis.  As the year goes on, it can be adjusted between different offices, as needs require.  It is just good business practice.</p></speech>

There are costs involved in moving home and making one&rsquo;s home fit for habitation, if one has a home.  The disturbance allowance has been eliminated as a result of the review of allowances.</p></speech>

We are extremely scrupulous about these allowances and their allocation.  We went through them to ensure we genuinely compensate an officer for the additional costs of being abroad.  They are not intended as additional income.  They are to allow officers do their job and enjoy an income that is not lower than it would be had they stayed at home.  I am comfortable standing over this.  The Deputy has raised a couple of legitimate points about the contents of the basket on which the cost of living index is based.  We will examine that and reply later to the Deputy.  Generally, these are not there to give people a good life.  There are considerable costs involved in moving and living abroad and trying to maintain a reasonable life a long way from home.</p></speech>

I have a small team of eight to ten people who work 24-7 on allowances.  Nothing is given away as a right.  Everything is checked, assessed and reviewed.  We have just carried out an annual review of allowances, which resulted in several cutbacks across the world which has not been well received but we base it on hard facts, data and analysis which we receive from the independent consultancy firm.  It is very rigorous and thorough, and nothing is given away as of right.</p><p>  It is not simply a matter of looking at the numbers serving in missions and dividing the money accordingly.  There are children involved.  For example, I had four children in Brussels.  The numbers assessed in this calculation are greater than the number of officers working in the mission.  I absolutely guarantee we are as thorough as can be and will continue to be so, to ensure value for money and to ensure people are compensated as per our guidelines.  We have reduced our administration fees and costs by millions over the past four years.  We have reduced the rent allowance in every location around the globe.  That has affected people.  Some individuals have not been able to get accommodation in certain cities because we have set the bar quite low.  We do not do this lightly.  We review it and make sure we are always driving down costs without imposing burdens on our staff who move their families abroad.</p></speech>

That would be very interesting.</p><p>  I am interested in the other services that may be provided to heads of mission or ambassadors to help them with their cost of living.  For example, is the ambassador&rsquo;s food covered by the embassy?  Do full-time chefs work in the embassies?  Are drivers provided to ambassadors?  Are there other supports and costs associated with ambassadors that would ease their cost of living costs?</p></speech>

There are full-time chefs in several embassies.</p> <p>They are employed in order that the ambassadors can do their jobs in terms of networking and entertaining from home.  When I was the ambassador in London, I had a full-time chef because we did so much entertaining that we were almost running a restaurant.  These supports are provided to allow people to do their jobs.  They are not offered to allow certain people to have a good time.</p><p> Running an embassy is a big responsibility for an ambassador and his or her spouse.  They often inhabit an elaborate and old premises that requires considerable care and maintenance.  The ambassador and his or spouse are often like janitors.  The spouses get no compensation for the work they do of their own volition and on behalf of the State.  In regard to the suggestion that ambassadors live a pampered lifestyle, frankly I could take it or leave it.  There are pros and but also a lot of cons.  Having responsibility for looking after a premises abroad is one of the big cons.</p><p> I sense that the Deputy is trying to probe whether these people are living a good life at the State's expense.  That is not the way my family or I found the experience.  There is a huge amount of dislocation, with children being dragged around the world and their education disrupted.  We pay school fees for children because they cannot access state schools abroad.  That does not work for everybody, however.  It is a moot point whether these children would have been better off staying at home and going through the normal school process.  It is no picnic.  I would prefer to be at home with a beer on a Saturday watching "Match of the Day" than going to some reception or dinner.  It can be hard work and disruptive for families.  A considerable amount is expected from families and spouses, who get no remuneration.  I recognise that the Deputy is doing his job in exploring this area but I am putting the case for the opposition.  It is not an easy life.</p></speech>

Some embassies employ live-in staff who do the cleaning.  When I was in London and New York, there were no live-in staff but cleaners came in.  It depends on which arrangement is the most convenient.  It does not make a difference in terms of cost.  Out of the 73 missions abroad, 21 have full-time cooks.  The cost of these 21 cooks is &euro;430,000, which works out at not much more than &euro;20,000 per head.  That is not bad value.  If one does not have a full-time cook, one has to hire in cooks, which is much more expensive in many cases because the individual concerned will usually be a professional chef.  In my experience, there is better value in having a full-time cook.  One can certainly get more output from a full-time cook than from spending the same amount of money hiring people on an occasional basis.</p></speech>

The OSCE chairmanship was in many ways a dry run for the European Presidency.  Many of the efficiencies we achieved in respect of the latter were initiated during the OSCE chairmanship.  Another factor in the significant underspend was that we originally estimated the costs based not so much our own previous Presidency in 2004 but on what other members states had been spending in recent years.  Our 2004 Presidency cost &euro;110 million, compared with &euro;42 million this time, which is a significant difference.  In fact, we came in significantly lower than most other member states in recent times.</p></speech>

I can probably speak for the T&aacute;naiste when I say it is an issue he would like to revisit.  We gave it careful consideration in the context of the improved situation in that country.  The main reason behind our decision to close the embassy in Tehran in 2011 was the impact of sanctions, which meant we were not really able to do the type of business we wanted to do.  Things are now improving in Iran and the reopening of the embassy in Tehran certainly will be to the forefront of our consideration as the situation develops.  The view on this occasion, however, was that the situation had not moved on sufficiently to justify its reopening.</p></speech>

Mr. Cooney indicated that eight openings were approved by Government.  Were Mr. Cooney and his colleagues asked to select a draft list of, say, 20 countries for submission to Government?  Is that how it was done?</p></speech>

There is not only an issue of financing here but also the requirement for additional personnel to staff these new missions.  Agreement was reached with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on how we should proceed.  In an ideal world, we would have liked to reopen the embassy in Tehran, but in a context where we were obliged to focus on priorities, it did not make our final list in this instance.  As I said, however, it is very much under consideration.</p></speech>

Was cost one of the criteria in drawing up the list?  More specifically, was cost a significant issue in respect of the decision on Tehran?</p></speech>

Our Department could not be exempt from the general cost cutting that was going on and we had to be seen to do something to contribute to that effort.  The reason we decided on Tehran at the time was that the embassy had been there for some time but the returns in terms of trade were disappointing.  We were in a difficult situation in that we were unable to exploit that representation effectively because of the effect of sanctions.  If and as the situation in Iran improves - it is going in the right direction - we would be very keen, if we have the resources, to reopen the embassy.</p></speech>

One can easily check whether an applicant really has been on X number of monitoring missions.  In respect of language skills, I assume applicants provided some documentation, but they are not tested.  If it is subsequently found, when they are assigned to a particular monitoring mission, that they do not have the desired language skills, there is potential embarrassment there for the Department.</p></speech>

We would meet people before we send them out and they must provide the relevant documentation.

We are monitoring this issue closely.  As for the European Union side, the Department does not have lead responsibility for European Union matters, as that now is handled in the Department of the Taoiseach but obviously, we take a keen interest in what is happening in respect of British membership of the European Union.  Again, the Anglo-Irish division is keeping a close eye to that, as is the Europe division, which looks after more general European matters in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  As to whether we have contingencies, the issue of British membership in particular is discussed and considered across the whole Government apparatus, because were that to evolve, we believe it would have serious negative implications for Ireland.  Consequently, that issue is discussed at the economic management committee and elsewhere across the board.</p></speech>

When I heard about this after the event, I thought it was a good bit of business because it is very difficult to predict the size of our contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping budget and back in 2010, we had a shortfall of &euro;15 million and had been obliged to get permission from the Oireachtas to move money around between subheads.  However, I accept that it appears as though we infringed public service requirements.  I accept the rebuke and we will not do it again.  However, as I stated, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  We only paid it three weeks earlier than we would have done anyway and consequently, I do not think it would have made any difference.

While we had this unspent money, a United Nations bill came in that fell to be paid within 30 days.  It just seemed like a good idea.  It was not but I do not think any great harm was done.

Why do we not participate with other European Union countries which have a presence in Taiwan in a single office?  European Union countries are represented in a single office in Taiwan, but not Ireland.  Out of this office they have considerable networking databases and meetings to promote business.  Ireland is not represented in the group.  Is there a way within the new arrangements in Asia that someone could participate in this group looking after Irish business interests?  Is there a cost issue?  It is not a policy issue with China because other European Union countries are doing it.</p></speech>

I met Members of the Oireachtas recently.  We do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.  Nevertheless it is a significant economic entity.  There is no problem in developing economic relations with Taiwan and it has an office here.  The way our external economic relations are normally handled in this regard is through the agencies.  There was an agency office there, but for reasons of its own the agency decided to close it.  In some other countries Enterprise Ireland and the IDA integrate this into their foreign service.  It may be some of the representatives in Taiwan are representatives of this nature.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would not have a representative there because of the political connotations.</p></speech>

I am interested in the policy, but it is not for this committee.  There are new developments with regard to Taiwan and China with regard to cross-strait agreements and economic agreements.  There is an interest in the route to Asia through Taipei and back into China.  The EU has a presence there.  Many of the countries there do not have diplomatic relationships with Taiwan, but through this office they have a presence there which facilitates trade with these European countries, our competitors, and we do not have a representative there.  Separate to this, an individual was there who was funded through Enterprise Ireland but this stopped. The Department is now responsible for trade.  This seems to contradict our ambition to have a presence in greater China and Asia, when there are business interests, be it in the food sector through Glanbia and others, which are discussing having a presence in Taiwan.  Could a continuation of the Enterprise Ireland presence be investigated?  Perhaps the same person could be used to have a presence with our competitors, the other European countries, using an office funded by Europe.</p></speech>

I want to make it clear there is absolutely no objection from the Department to doing this.  I wish Enterprise Ireland did have a representative in Taipei.  The office there is a European Commission office.  The European Commission has responsibility for trade in the European Union and it is entirely appropriate. I suspect the people coming through are trade attaches for these other countries.  We do not have a system of trade attaches.  This work is done by Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  It is really about who might do it.  We have taken responsibility for trade promotion, but in the way it works we have not taken on responsibility for the agencies.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General, Deputy Deasy and I visited Mozambique and we were greatly impressed by the work being done by the various NGOs, the Government representatives and by the many people participating at base level to make things happen.  I am sure the Government parties here would have been very impressed that there was only member of the opposition there and that he was chairman of the public accounts committee.  I am sure that would impress Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  That is the case.</p><p>  I was glad to hear Mr. Rogers explain the funding through Governments separately.  The work being done there, including by the embassy, is very positive and helpful, not only to those working there at the coalface but to people potentially looking for business, contacts and so on.</p><p>  In explaining some of the workings of the embassy to Deputy Nolan, Mr. Cooney sold himself short.  The people there do substantially more than what we understand them to do and they need to be recognised for that.  I would not classify them as temporary janitors or anything else.  I think they do an exceptional job.  One has to experience it to understand it.  </p><p>  I mention the embassy in London, where Mr. Cooney was ambassador, and the co-operation with business people in the context of setting up a consortium to do business in Dubai, for example, because of the downturn in our economy.  Substantial efforts were made in that regard.  I have seen that happen in many embassies.  Much more work is being done and it is not being counted.  That is why I raised some of the questions on the workings of embassies.  Perhaps Mr. Cooney might get an opportunity to expand a bit more on that some time.  </p><p>  I thank Mr. Cooney for his appearance today.  Will this be his last appearance before us?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1089" speakername="Tom Hayes" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014030600003#B00100"><p>I move amendment No. 56:<blockquote><br />In page 13, to delete lines 21 to 30 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(a) the owner or manager of a forest, requiring him or her to furnish to the Minister within 28 days or such longer period as may be specified in the notice, such particulars in relation to the forest, including the area, species, numbers and volumes of trees felled during a specified period, and such other information as may be specified in the notice;&rdquo;.</blockquote>This section is important for the collection of statistics and information on the national forest estate and it will complement national and European Union reporting requirements.  The collection of information on forests will also provide information to the Minister on how forests are being managed and will help to determine the direction of future policy, including the provision of financial support and incentives.</p><p>  I have listened to stakeholders' comments and I am introducing amendment No. 56, which highlights the main information that forest owners may be required to supply.  The collection of data will mainly relate to information on timber felled.  I believe that the amendment while not addressing all the issues of concern to landowners does go some way to reducing the burden on them.  I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 57 and 58.  I reiterate the importance of the legislative provision in this regard for the collection of statistical information on the national forestry estate which complements national and EU reporting requirements.  For this reason I cannot agree to the removal of the section.  Although owners or managers may be required to furnish such information within 28 days, a longer period will be specified in such notices depending on the practicality of complying with such information.  For example, when a licence is issued to fell timber the forest owners may be required to provide information on the trees actually felled and confirm that replanting has taken place as specified in the licence.  This information is important to determine the level of felling activity and replanting that has taken place in connection with the licences that have issued.  The timelines required to provide such information will depend on several factors, such as the level of felling activity or the size of the property.  I emphasise that any timelines specified in any notice will provide sufficient time for forest owners to compile such information.</p><p>  I acknowledge the Deputy's intention in amendments Nos. 59 and 60 to limit the 28 day requirement to investigate the alleged offences.  My preference is to stick with my amended wording for the section.  Although owners or managers may be required to furnish information within 28 days, I assure Deputies that a longer period will be specified in notices where the practicality of complying with such information demand it.  It is not my intention to place unreasonable demands on anyone and the timescale for receipt of information will reflect the complexity and the need to collate the information required.</p><p>  I believe the proposal in amendment No. 61 to limit the requirements to information that is readily available is far too loose and would make the provision of information discretionary rather than mandatory.  Under the proposed wording a person could, at any time, claim that the information was not available.</p><p>  The amendment in respect of commercial sensitivity of information supplied is also subjective and could obstruct the investigation of alleged offences or compliance with the relevant statutory provisions by authorised officers.  In the circumstances I cannot agree to this amendment.</p><p>  Under amendment No. 62, I am reducing the fine which applies to a person who fails to comply with a request under the section from a class A fine to a class E fine, that is, a reduction from &euro;5,000 to &euro;500.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014030600003#B00200"><p>My amendments are Nos. 58 and 61.  I often wonder what happens to all the statistics collected and whether decisions really get changed based on all the mounds of statistics collected.  I also often wonder whether the Minister has the staff to deal with all the statistics collected or has the information become something that gathers in rooms and dark places and keeps mounting more and more as more and more detailed information is sought?</p><p>  It is interesting that when the State wants something there is a time limit but when a person wants something from the State there is rarely a time limit.  There are times limits on some things.  One must appeal within 28 days but the appeal may not be decided on by the Department for a year.  One must provide information within 28 days but when one is looking for a decision on a felling licence or whatever it is not half as time-limited.</p><p>  Will the Minister of State get me some detail on the absolute minimum European requirements that a person must collect before Report Stage?  He may tell me that I could find it myself and I probably could but he knows where it is.  It is rather like looking for a particular tree in the forest in that if the Minister of State knows where the tree is, he may as well save me the time of examining every tree in the forest.</p><p>  The Minister of State said that the my proposed provision regarding commercially sensitive information is too loosely worded.  However, it seems strange that he will know the volume, the potential end product and the variety of timber sawn, converted, processed, bought, sold or otherwise disposed of within a specific period.  Sections 13(1) states that the Minister "may" do such and such.  However, what will happen is that every relevant person, whether the owner or manager of a forest or the owner or manager of a timber mill, will have to provide all of this information as a matter of routine.  I often wonder what the Department will do with all of it.  Does the Department have the staff to collate all of this and use it in any meaningful way?  I take it that the provisions mean the information will have to be provided and that it is not only a question of how frequently the Department seeks all the information but that it will demand it.</p><p>  The Minister of State said something that every Minister in his position tends to say.  He said that he has no intention of doing X, Y and Z.  We pass laws in the House on the basis that we do not know who will be in the Minister of State's position in future or what attitude that person will take to the legal provisions.  Therefore, the attitude of a particular Minister who might be before the committee does not really count when we are making legislation because we are legislating for the eventuality that different people will hold ministerial office and they might do what it is legally possible to do although it may not be the Minister of State's intention to do those things.  Therefore, it is not any defence for the Minister of State to say he will not do it.  I accept the good faith of the Minster of State but that is irrelevant because this is law, it is not simply what the Minister of State might do.</p></speech>

The Minister should have the authority to carry out ecological surveys of forests to ensure the ecological integrity of forests with a particular focus on ancient woodlands and native species.  There should be a provision to allow citizens who are concerned about the ecological integrity of forests to petition the Minister for such surveys to be carried out if they are concerned that ancient woodlands, native species or biodiversity are being adversely impacted upon in any way.  I am proposing an environmental protection measure and a public consultation measure.</p></speech>

The purpose of legislation is to bind future Ministers and citizens alike; that is why we pass laws here.  We live in a republic and Ministers are bound the same as officials and ordinary citizens.  It is important to bear this in mind.</p><p>  Is firewood included in the provisions of section 13(1)(b)?  There is a big market for firewood in Ireland.  We are very careful to ensure that the beef market in Ireland is regulated and is supplied by people who engage actively in the beef industry.  The same applies to the milk industry.  This committee debated whether raw milk should be allowed to be sold.  Many people have wood-burning stoves and the market for firewood has increased dramatically across the country.  That market should be supplied by active wood-farmers, people who grow a crop and want to sell it.  Does the definition of an owner-manager of a timber processing business or a dealer in timber, include a dealer in firewood?  It would be very wrong if people who go to the trouble of growing a commercial crop - thinnings can be sold for a number of purposes including firewood - were to be put on the back foot by unlawful or illegal felling.</p><p>  With regard to the amendment which changes a class A fine to a class E fine, a fine of &euro;500 is not a lot of money.  It will entail a criminal conviction but people might make a commercial decision just as people make a commercial decision under the 1946 Act to cut now and ask later and pay the relatively derisory fine that can be imposed by a District Court.  I am sure that will happen in the future with regard to the fine of &euro;500.  My question is whether the definition of a dealer of timber includes a dealer in firewood.</p></speech>

The European Communities Forest Consent and Assessment Regulations 2010 is the established framework.  It is the responsibility of the inspectors to decide on the necessity for an ecological survey.  It is not possible for a citizen to decide he or she wants an ecological survey because this would make the process very cumbersome.  The Bill is designed to encourage people to work in forestry.</p> <p>The answer to that is "Yes".</p><p> I take the point with regard to the &euro;500.  In our consultations with those in the industry, however, they made a very strong case for the reduction.  I made by decision on the matter in view of what they stated and by virtue of the fact that the case they made stood up to scrutiny.</p></speech>

What we are seeking is that people should be allowed to petition for such surveys if they have concerns.  Ultimately, the decision on whether a survey would be carried out would lie with the Minister.  There should a procedure whereby people with concerns would have the opportunity to indicate that they want action to be taken.  The details of what would be involved in the context of the criteria relating to petitions, etc., could be discussed but provision should be made to allow people to seek surveys.  There are many individuals who have concerns about the environment in general and, in the context of this matter, adverse impacts on ancient woodlands and problems relating to biodiversity.  These people should have an avenue whereby they could petition the Minister to have surveys carried out in circumstances where they raise legitimate concerns.  I am of the view that the amendment is very reasonable.</p></speech>

I have similar doubts with regard to this section in the context of the removal of vegetation.  I am not arguing that the removal of vegetation is for the common good.  It is obviously a legitimate exercise, particularly in view of the fact that it protects forests.  In order to be lawful at all, any interference with private property must be for the common good.  The removal of vegetation, as envisaged, would be for the common good, but I am concerned about the absence of compensation.  I accept that what is contained in the Bill mirrors the provisions of the 1946 Act and that there is a presumption of constitutionality in both instruments.  However, there have been such presumptions in respect of many matters and these have been overturned by the Supreme Court.  I flagged this matter on the previous occasion.  When the Minister of State is seeking advice from the Office of the Attorney General on whether it is possible to refuse a felling licence and not offer compensation, perhaps he might also have section 14 examined.</p></speech>

It allows the Minister to serve a notice on a landowner requiring him or her to take specified action to protect trees from damage by vermin.  Where land is unoccupied or the owner fails to comply with such notice, the Minister may authorise a person to enter the land and deal with the particular species.  In the majority of cases landowners behave responsibly and do not need to be compelled to remove vermin from their land.  The purpose of this provision is to deal with situations where either the owner does not co-operate or where the land is unoccupied.</p><p>  A number of stakeholders have questioned the practicality of removing vermin and amendment No. 63, which inserts the words &quot;so far as it is reasonably practicable to do so&quot;, is an acknowledgement of that difficulty.  It is important that the power to remove vermin which present a threat to forestry remains within the legislation, but such power should also be reasonably applied and recognise the difficulties involved in removing the threat completely.  The remaining amendments are technical changes designed to ensure the removal of protected species such as deer, which pose a threat to the forest, will be controlled in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p></speech>

Many stakeholders stressed the importance for their industry of short response times that would facilitate the flow of wood onto the market.  I note the proposals made by Deputies for response times of varying lengths and I appreciate their input in this regard.</p> <p>However, I am bringing forward my own amendment, No. 79, which I believe goes some way to addressing the issue raised by stakeholders.  For this reason, I am not in a position to accept amendments Nos. 66, 74, 75 or 76.</p><p> Regarding amendments Nos. 74 and 75, these will restrict the period within which the Minister may consult third parties.  The Minister must be empowered to consult any persons who may be affected or have an interest in a matter for which an approval or licence is being sought.  If an issue comes to the Minister's attention during the course of his consideration of an application and the Minister believes consultation on the issue is warranted, the Minister should not be restricted in this regard.  While the Minister has an obligation to treat the applicant in a fair and reasonable manner, the Minister has the same obligation to all citizens of the State, especially those who may be directly affected by forestry operations for which approval and licences are being sought.</p><p> Amendment No. 79 provides for the introduction of a timeline of four months within which the Department must process a felling licence application.  This timeline reflects the need to consult other environmental authorities such as the National Monuments Service and Inland Fisheries Ireland.  If the Department is not going to meet the deadline, it must provide the applicant with an explanation before the expiry of that period.  This amendment must be viewed in conjunction with the amendment of section 17 in amendment No. 68.  This allows for the doubling of the length of licence from five to ten years, with provision for further extensions of up to five years.  Both of these amendments are intended to facilitate the timely and speedy processing of applications.  I am confident the contribution of these two measures will contribute to a much-improved turnaround time for the processing of felling licences.</p></speech>

It is about having a speedy timeline for getting the licence, and Deputy Pringle believes there are too many get-out clauses in the Minister's amendment.  There are qualifications on his requirement to grant or refuse the licence within a particular timeline.  His amendment is straightforward in that it states the timeline and that the licence will either be granted or refused within that period.</p></speech>

If we look at what the Minister is doing here, there are two approaches.  The first is what I would call the legislative approach to which county councils have to adhere in planning.  It is the eight weeks approach, that is, eight weeks from the time one put in the last information.  If there is a further information request, it is eight weeks from the time the further information is submitted.  That works.  If the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, or anyone else wants to make an observation, they simply have to get it in on time.  It is not a big deal.  The citizen is owed that duty from the State, namely, people can come back in a timely manner and give their opinion.  If it can be done for all planning permission applications, I cannot understand why it cannot be done here for a felling licence application.</p><p>  The second approach is what I would call the An Bord Plean&aacute;la approach.  As the Minister is probably aware, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has a statutory objective, similar to the Minister's proposal, to do this within four months but that is observed assiduously in the breach on every occasion.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la appeals, even on a single house, can take up to a year or more to decide and there is no sense of urgency on its part.  It sends out a letter stating it cannot do it within the guidelines of the statutory objective, that it is sorry, and that it will take as long as a piece of string, so to speak, before it is addressed.  After six months it might send out another letter stating it still cannot do it within the statutory objective, that it cannot do it without the statutory objective and that it will extend the period again.  I understand the Minister's good intention in this measure but in legal terms what he is proposing is worthless because it adds more to the bureaucracy and people will continue to get these letters stating the period will be extended again.</p><p>  I am opposed to this and I will table an amendment to my amendment No. 78 on Report Stage stating that all licence decisions will issue within eight weeks of the required information being provided by the applicant.  I cannot understand why it is not possible within a two month period to make such a decision if it is possible to grant all the planning applications in the country within that timeframe.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.538" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1089" speakername="Tom Hayes" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2014030600006#E00800"><p>Regarding amendment No. 68, a number of stakeholders in submissions have stated that the duration of a felling licence should extend beyond five years and questioned the need to apply for an extension.  I have considered the submissions made by the stakeholders and I am tabling an amendment to increase the duration of a felling licence from five to ten years.  The Bill will still allow for further extensions of up to five years in effect providing the possibility to have a licence for a period of 15 years in total.  That will allow a number of thinning operations to take place.  This is a significant change to the Bill and will provide greater flexibility for forest owners to carry out multiple harvesting events over a longer period in accordance with good forest practice.  I am also conscious of the need to strike a balance between long-term forest management and the need for sufficient safeguards to cater for a change in environmental circumstances.  Other sections of the Bill, such as section 7(2), provide these safeguards.  In extreme cases a licence could be suspended where unforeseen circumstances have occurred, for example, a large siltation event impacting negatively on a water course.  However, as I have stated previously, forest owners who require the flexibility to manage their forest over a long period would need to adopt changes if required.  I believe the provision in this Bill provides these safeguards to allow felling licence duration to be extended as proposed.</p><p>  All forestry harvesting operations, including thinning, have the capacity to cause significant environmental damage and some level of control over such activities must be in place.  I believe my amendment to this section allowing the Minister to issue a felling licence for up to ten years is fair.  In addition, the provision of licences for thinning and clearfell will facilitate growers in forest certification and other traceability systems.  I therefore reject amendment No. 69.</p></speech>

There are safety issues where trees are close to roads.  One cannot have an extensive bureaucratic obstacle where a tree near a road raises health and safety issues.  It is a practical consideration but it need not be 10 m.  When one goes that far in from the road, one is talking about giving a free hand to cut down trees which should not be cut down and where protections should apply.</p></speech>

It is a necessary provision.  The Bill proposes that no felling licence would be required where in the opinion of the planning authority a tree is dangerous on account of its age, condition or location.  That is very sensible.  There is a further provision that no felling licence is required where a tree is removed by a public authority in the performance of its statutory duties.  That is also sensible.  However, I do not accept that every read within 10 m of a public road poses a risk to the public.  If that is the case, the NRA has wasted a great deal of money over the last ten years.  If one drives from Galway to Dublin on the M6 or from Limerick to Dublin on the M7, one sees a great many trees which have been planted at taxpayers' expense along the motorways.  Every tree within 10 m of a public road either poses a risk or it does not.  Some trees clearly poses risks.  Many trees which are standing should be got rid of.  However, as I said on Second Stage, I have seen many trees cut down beside public roads in Clare which posed no risk to anyone.</p><p>  I question the purpose of the provision.  Are we talking about cutting down trees because they pose a risk to the public or are we talking about cutting down trees for firewood?  I have seen many more trees cut down for firewood near public roads than have been cut down because of a risk to the public.  I have no qualms about the fact that trees must be cut down if they are dangerous.  I do not consider, however, that every tree within 10 m of a public road poses a risk.</p></speech>

It is important that a landowner can fell trees without a licence where they are dangerous because of their age or condition in the interests of public safety.  The 10 m width criterion takes into consideration that the majority of roadside trees are found within this zone and the potential of a tall, mature tree to fall across a public road creating a dangerous hazard.  In all afforestation schemes, it is a requirement of grant aid not to plant within 10 metres of a public road.  While I accept that roadside trees have a landscape and amenity value, I must balance the needs of landowners to manage roadside trees in the interests of public safety.  One cannot have a situation where a landowner who must remove a dangerous tree urgently is forced to wait for a felling licence before he or she can proceed.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The point has been made.  However, what we have here does not capture the balance.  Deputy McNamara made the point well.  It is not simply an issue of distance.  I might raise something that was mentioned to me by someone from a different constituency who happened to be passing through D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Where trees are overhanging a road and there is a requirement on the property owner to cut them down on foot of a health and safety risk, it is virtually impossible for that property owner to act.  He or she would have to stop the whole road.  It should really be the local authority which has the responsibility for doing it.  A complicated balance is involved.  Certainly, the idea that one could have free rein to cut down any tree within 10 m of a public road means trees that should not be cut down will be.  They will not be cut down just for legitimate health and safety reasons but potentially for other reasons.  I have further amendments in the same vein with respect to hedgerows.  We must reconsider the provision.</p></speech>

I could not possibly argue with that.  This section, however, does not facilitate landowners to cut down trees which are dangerous because of their age or condition; it facilitates them to cut down all trees within 10 metres of a public road whether they are dangerous or not or young or old.  A tree could be 800 years old, 1,000 years old or 10 years old.  It would not matter that it was planted for commercial purposes or by Brian Boru on the way to the Battle of Clontarf.  It applies to every single tree within 10 m of a public road.  I have no doubt that the great majority of trees which will be cut down pursuant to the legislation will not be due to dangers on foot of age or condition.  I agree that every tree beside a public road which poses any risk due to age or condition should be cut down.  We have no dispute on that.  My problem is that the legislation applies to every tree.  The majority of trees that will be cut down will be cut for firewood to compete with legitimate, active farmers who grow a crop for money.  The majority of dangerous trees will still be left standing.</p></speech>

There are trees along the roads beside which we all live that have been there for generations and they have not been cut down.  People cut them down.  I have trees on my own land at home which I will not cut down unless they are a danger.  I was very fearful that some of them would fall during the last storm.</p></speech>

I am happy to leave them there and that is the general view among people who have trees.  One can pick out extreme cases.</p><p>  This is about road safety.  We all saw the large trees that fell around the country recently.</p> <p>There were cars parked in the car park of the Hotel Minella in Clonmel during coursing week, and the night of the bad storm, trees crashed down and badly damaged those cars.

Under amendment No. 82, a farmer or other landowner can still remove 15 cu. m of timber in any period of 12 months but the size of any individual tree must not exceed 3 cu.m.  To remove a tree larger than 3 cu. m will require a felling licence.</p><p>  Despite the restrictions introduced in this amendment, this provision remains a major benefit to farmers.  A tree of 3 cu. m is still a very large tree and I believe amendment No. 82 achieves a balance between meeting the needs of landowners and protecting larger established or veteran trees.  In the circumstances, I do not see a need for amendment No. 83.</p></speech>

The exemption of these species also takes into account the natural capacity of these species to produce vigorous growth when cut.  Tabling an amendment to limit the exemption to below a certain size of these species would prove impractical for landowners who periodically cut thousands of kilometres of hedgerow each year.  Good practice encourages the retention of individual trees in hedgerows, and landowners take this into account in their management.  Hawthorn hedges and individual trees provide an important contribution to our countryside and this exemption allows farmers to manage hedgerows in accordance with good agricultural practices.</p></speech>

He said that good practice requires the retention of individual trees and hedgerows, and that is reflected in section 18(1)(<i>m</i>)(v) which states: &quot;in a hedgerow and felled for the purposes of its trimming, provided that the tree does not exceed 20 centimetres in diameter when measured 1.3 metres from the ground&quot;.  If the tree is more than 20 centimetres in diameter and is measured more than 1.3 metres from the ground, it is not exempt because good practice requires the retention of individual trees in hedgerows.  We all agree with that, yet hedgerows are usually beside public roads and if it is within 10 metres of a public road, it can be cut down.  Where is the balance?  There is a contradiction inherent in the Bill, although the Minister of State might say otherwise.  I am reiterating what I said earlier.  It is very important that hedgerows can be cut and that trees of a certain size can be cut as part of a hedgerow.  Otherwise, it is not possible to do it, and farmers have a problem in that when they are cutting a hedgerow, if there is a sapling that has been growing for four or five years, they might be in trouble for cutting it.  I do not believe they should be in trouble.  They should be allowed manage hedgerows, but they should not be allowed to cut trees if they are not a danger to the public.</p></speech>

As someone who uses large machinery on roads, we are finding the hedgerows are growing in.  It may be difficult to picture that if one lives in Dublin but we deal with roads that might be only 13 ft. wide and operate machines that are 13 ft. wide also.</p> <p>Our main problem is that hedgerows are encroaching on top of the roads.  They are keeping the roads damp, which leads to the roads deteriorating.  We need the latitude to cut those trees for our safety and that of other road users.  We should not get too pedantic about saving the odd bush or tree.  Not doing so is causing major problems.  We need to be able to tackle roadways that are narrow, yet vital, if we are to be able to move equipment.  Some landowners who are not farmers are not maintaining their hedges at all.  This needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

The most common call I receive on this issue is from school bus services that use small, rural back roads.  As the hedges are overgrown, some services refuse to take those roads to pick up children.  Everyone's hands seem to be tied.</p></speech>

Traditionally, farmers cut the hedges, folded them back onto themselves and made them bushy and thick.  They did that by hand.  It was every year's winter work and, therefore, was within the cycle of nature of nesting birds.  There is an idea that the kinds of hedge we have now are the same that we had 100 years ago but according to all of the old people I know they are not.  It was only in more recent times that people stopped trimming hedges every year and keeping them at reasonable levels.</p><p>  I concur with Deputy Barry.  Negotiating minor rural roads is causing a major problem in terms of road and vehicular damage.  Anyone who has experience of running trucks or other vehicles knows that they could be driven up and down a motorway and there would not be a dent in them, but they would burst tyres and so forth on rural roads.  As the Deputy mentioned, roads are getting damp.</p></speech>

What has emerged from this discussion is that size might not be the right criterion.  It is a question of practicality.  If something is a danger, blocks school buses or damages the road or if it has the potential to pose such dangers, cutting it down should be possible.  Proximity to the road or size is not a good criterion, as it would allow hedges or something that is environmentally important or sensitive to be cut down unnecessarily.  There is a problem with the criteria for making decisions on what can be cut down and it needs to be examined.  Perhaps there is no perfect solution.  The person in question is from Mullingar and the issue never even occurred to me beforehand.  That said, some roads near the edge of my constituency towards the mountains experience these problems.  Clearly the local authority must have a role in assessing what is dangerous and a responsibility to assist property owners on the basis of the common good.</p><p>  The Minister of State should take all of these points on board.  I certainly must consider some of them.  I will revert to the people I have spoken to and consider which amendments can be tabled on Report Stage to try to get the balance right.</p></speech>

The effect of placing a 20 cm threshold means that a farmer can manage hedgerows in accordance with good agricultural practice without being required to apply for a licence.  Reducing the threshold to 10 cm, which is 4 in., would result in a significant number of felling licence applications each year as farmers plan to cut their hedges outside the bird nesting season.  This would be an unnecessary application process, as most licences would be granted.  Therefore, I will not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

This is a large tree and should remain within the licensing system.  It is important to understand that the Bill's primary purpose is forestry, the sustainable management of forests and, in appropriate circumstances, the protection of other important trees in the wider landscape.</p><p>  I have listened to the concerns raised by environmental stakeholders and will table an amendment to address some of them in so far as that is practical, possible and appropriate to a forestry Bill.  However, I must stress that the Bill is not about regulating the alteration or removal of hedgerows in general.  Other legislation addresses that issue, in particular the Wildlife Acts and the 2011 European Communities regulation.  The qualification in the amendment proposed by the Deputy has also been proposed to me and elaborated upon when my Department consulted the Environmental Pillar and the Woodland League of Ireland.</p><p>  I presume that Deputy Ferris intended to include the word "significance" in his amendment No. 86.  Such a qualification would require the inclusion of a long list of additional criteria by which a landowner could determine whether the tree in question was in hedgerow deemed to be of historical, ecological or landscape significance.  I have examined one set of criteria proposed to me by the environmental stakeholders and found them to be unnecessarily complex, subjective in part and likely to place an unwarranted administrative burden on landowners and my Department.</p> <p>They are also predicated on the assumption that the Bill allows for the removal of hedgerows, which it does not.  The amendment that I shall move later sufficiently addresses these concerns in a manner that is more compatible with the existing statutory designations and protection processes used in Ireland for built heritage and the landscape.  Therefore, I cannot agree to these amendments.</p></speech>

The legislation is not about regulating the alteration or removal of hedgerows more generally.  There is other legislation to address this issue, particularly the Wildlife Acts and the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Agriculture) Regulations 2011.  Under a previous amendment, a farmer or other landowner can still remove 15 m<sup>3</sup> of timber in any period of 12 months but the size of any individual tree must not exceed 3 m<sup>3</sup>.  </p><p>  The purpose of amendment No. 88 is to exclude from the exempted list certain important trees in the wider landscape and other important old or veteran trees.  These are trees which, by virtue of their occurrence in areas designated by a relevant local authority under the Planning and Development Acts, contribute to the value of buildings of special architectural or historical interest, are within areas of outstanding natural beauty or special recreational value, or form part of a landscape or natural elements deemed worthy of preservation.</p><p>  It is my intent that my amendment will provide an appropriate and workable balance.  In particular, I do not wish to preclude farmers or other landowners from felling, for example, a tree in a dangerous condition or from continuing to manage or maintain hedgerows on the lands in accordance with good agricultural practice.  To that end, pending advice from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, I wish to indicate the possibility of proposing further minor amendments on Report Stage to this section, which is more restricted than intended.</p></speech>

Areas such as historical and landscape significance can have a subjective element.  I feel - and I suspect that the Environmental Pillar people will feel the same - that there needs to be a little bit more than the criteria proposed in the amendment, which refers to the curtilage of a protected structure, a special amenity area or a conservation area.  I support the amendment but suggest that additional criteria should be included to provide protections against trees being cut down that should not be cut down.</p></speech>

I suspect not, and I suspect the practice varies widely from one local authority to another.  Local authorities may have a number of landscape conservation areas while county councils may only have a few.  That is not because the landscape in one council is more worthy of protection than another but is due merely to practice.</p><p>  What happens in SACs, SPAs and NHAs and areas that are proposed to be designated as such?  Are they included?  These are just a couple of issues.  As the Minister of State has said, he will examine the matter on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Scrub should be designated as agroforestry.&rdquo;.</blockquote>The amendment is pretty self-evident and I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

It is a tree's natural instinct to colonise open space and if fields are managed less intensively they will become woodland eventually.  I recognise the importance of scrub woodland and its role as a reservoir of species and an area of biodiversity.  If scrub woodland with trees meets the definition of a forest as described in the Bill, trees will require a felling licence and they are not exempt.  The term agro-forestry can be described as the integration and management of trees in conjunction with agriculture to produce multiple benefits.  It is not the intention of the Bill to categorise or define scrub as agro-forestry, as that would imply that all such woodlands and habitats would have an element of agricultural production as an objective.  Landowners already acknowledge the benefit of trees in the provision of shelter for livestock but they must be allowed to choose if they want a field to become woodland through natural scrub encroachment.</p> <p>The exemption in this Bill to allow trees less than five years of age to be removed from a field without a licence recognises the importance of agriculture and farmers' requirements in managing fields.  I do not accept this amendment.</p></speech>

The spirt of the amendment and the theme of my amendments is Ireland's underperformance in developing its natural potential for forestry in general, afforestation using native species and the creation of biodiversity.  It is a tragedy that we have performed so badly when our conditions are so well suited to forestry.  Our forests are a significant attraction and one of the reasons people love our landscape and countryside.  We are failing absolutely to utilise our potential in this area.  This amendment proposes that we encourage the natural development of native forests from scrub and seek out the means to do that.  It is not about targeting farmers negatively but alerting them to a major untapped potential that has not been recognised.  This could be good for the farmers, for the country and for the environment.</p><p>  I do not understand the reason the Minister of State has a problem with this amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to felling trees of 15 cubic metres.  We are all assuming that firewood is cut to be sold, but farmers use large amounts of timber.  I do not see that reflected in the Bill.</p><p>  This might not be the place to raise my concern, but whereas we appreciate the value of our timber, wood gasification boilers use a great deal of timber which could be used more productively.  I would like the Minister to consider that point.</p></speech>

The amount of timber in 15 cubic metres is very little.  We have to distinguish between active and passive farming.  If one is growing trees as a crop, one should be able to thin out the forest and use the timber for firewood and also for sale as firewood.  This Bill is unique in terms of Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine policy in that it does not differentiate between active and passive farmers.  Farmers who grow a crop should have as little as possible to limit what they can do with the crop.  In terms of forestry, this should mean that they can cut down trees for use as firewood, either for themselves or for sale.  That is one element of the Bill.  The Bill is limited to trees outside afforestation.  If one goes to the trouble of planting a forest, one cannot cut the trees for one's own use, but if one has an oak tree that is 800 years old on the farm, it can be cut and put into the wood burner.  In my view, that is nonsensical.  It is allowing people who have mature beech, oak, or ash on the land to cut it to supply a firewood market in the local town while a person who has 200 acres of forestry cannot cut trees or even use the thinnings to supply the firewood market.</p></speech>

Section 18 deals with exempted trees.  Subsection (1)(m) applies to trees outside a forest, whereas I believe it should apply to trees inside a forest .  The provision in section 18(1)(m)(iii) should be changed to specify 25 m3 rather than 15 m3.  That would enable people who are active farmers to use their crop, as opposed to passive farmers being allowed to go around the hedgerows and lop down every old tree for the wood burner or sell the wood at the local grocery shop.  I am raising these issues with a view to tabling an amendment on Report Stage to the effect that paragraph (m) will apply to trees in a forest and that we increase the volume from 15 m3 to 25 m3 in paragraph (m)(iii).  It is logical that one should be able to bring one's crop to market to sell it.</p></speech>

It states the following:<blockquote><br />(1) The Minister may charge such fees as may be prescribed for the following:(<i>a</i>) an application for a licence, approval or registration, or<br />(<i>b</i>) any other service provided under the relevant statutory provisions, and different fees may be charged for different classes of such licences, approvals, registrations or other services.<br />(2) The Minister may recover as a simple contract debt, in any court of competent jurisdiction, any amount owed in respect of a fee charged under this section.</blockquote>This will open a Pandora's box because everything done with the forestry department will now be paid for by the punter.  It is kind of funny to be paying grants to people for afforestation and then to charge them.  It is a habit that the State tends to have, and I am opposed to it.</p></speech>

This issue was raised on Second Stage.  At the time, I stressed that the inclusion of this provision within the Bill should not be interpreted as a statement of intent.  I also reminded Deputies that the Department does not charge for forestry licences or for any of its scheme applications, and this remains the position.  It is a matter of policy whether the Minister should charge for such services and it would be remiss not to include for such eventuality in this legislation.  While I must allow for that possibility in the future, I myself do not foresee any need for such charges.</p></speech>

He knows that once the provision is there, sooner or later somebody will use it to raise a bit of cash.  If I had the time, I would love to be able to trawl through all the Bills passed by the Oireachtas since the 1920s and count the number of times a provision like this was introduced.  A Minister would come into the House and say that he does not intend doing this, but is just creating a possibility that it might happen, although not on his watch.  I would love to find out how many fees were introduced because of a legislative provision introduced in this nice soft way.  A Minister would ask if he was being accused of putting a charge on something and would claim he was not doing so.</p><p> To protect the Minister of State's position in order that we will not have a change like this, we should oppose this section.  We should ensure that not only will the Minister or the Minister or State or their officials not succumb to temptation, no future Minister will succumb to the temptation.  For most Administrations, this is too big a temptation to resist in the long term when the pressure comes on.</p></speech>

The Minister may direct or authorise the destruction of any such articles or direct their expulsion from the State.  In addition the Minister may regulate to ensure the traceability of forestry-related material from the propagation stage to timber and timber products.  I assure the Deputy that adequate provision is included in the Bill to regulate for actions to combat the landing of diseased or invasive species in the State and to provide for traceability systems for imported or locally-produced timber.

The question of Coillte and its centrality to Irish forestry has been discussed at the committee before as well as in the D&aacute;il in the context of the discussions that took place there recently.

This does not mean that all is rosy in the Coillte garden.  There are concerns about Coillte, its objectives and the fact that it has failed in the area of afforestation.  I imagine the company will give reasons and justifications for that but when the largest owner and the public owner of our forests has not assisted in our reaching our targets and, consequently, we have fallen far short of them, then the matter must be addressed.  There are many other questions relating to objectives, priorities, governance, conflicts of interest and the sale of some public forests, all of which need to be examined.  We cannot properly address the question of Irish forestry without bringing Coillte into the frame.</p><p>  The Act that established Coillte predated the Rio declaration and the principles of sustainable forest management that are supposed to inform this Bill as well as our approach to forestry generally and that is a problem.  It is problematic that we are dealing with this Bill at a time when the long-promised review of Coillte has never materialised.  It was never published, it was started and abandoned somewhere along the line.</p><p>  There is something of a veil of secrecy around Coillte.  It is insulated from proper scrutiny and accountability.  For all these reasons we believe it is imperative to have a review of the Forestry Act 1988, which is out of date in so far as it informs the position of Coillte.  We have moved on to Rio and all of the things that flow out of the declaration.  Therefore, Coillte must be brought into that frame.  We need a review of Coillte to inform proper forest policy in the country.</p></speech>

It is intended to support the development of a modern forestry sector that can operate in accordance with good forestry practice and with a view to protection of the environment.  The Bill is about forestry and good forestry practice; it is not about Coillte.  I emphasised that point at the beginning of Second Stage.  The provisions are applicable to public and private forest owners, who are growing in numbers, as we all know.</p><p>  As members will be aware, on foot of a Government decision in June 2013, an analysis is currently being undertaken in respect of a merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.  The analysis is being overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholders Departments.  It will include financial analysis of the identified costs and benefits that could arise from the merger of the two entities.  It will consider legal and technical issues arising from the merger of the entities.  It will set out the structures, the merger options available and the advantages or disadvantages associated with each and consider an integrated approach to a merged entity.</p><p>  It was also decided in June 2013 that a restructuring of Coillte overseen by NewERA and the relevant stakeholder Departments should be undertaken.  Proposals in respect of restructuring are currently being considered and evaluated by NewERA.  The Government will consider all options to maximise value from Coillte when restructuring is complete.  Pending receipt of the report of the analysis from NewERA and the outcome of the restructuring of the company, it is premature to suggest that there is a need for a review of the 1988 Act to redefine Coillte's objectives and operations.  Consequently, I am not in a position to agree to the amendment.</p></speech>

Half of forestry would be left out of the frame which is just not right or sustainable.  I will certainly be pressing the amendment and raising it again on Report Stage.</p></speech>

We are engaged in an evaluation process to see what NewERA comes up with.  As I said earlier, it would not be right to introduce provisions in legislation when decisions have not been made.  This is about forestry, forest practice and encouraging people, particularly in the private sector.  A significant amount of consultation took place on the Bill and the private forest owners were actively engaged in it.  To fulfil the potential of this sector and deliver jobs we need to involve the private sector.  The Bill is about dealing with underutilised land.  I know Coillte will be used to the taxpayers' best benefit and we will come to an agreement that will be amenable to everyone.</p></speech>

The Minister has huge powers to change or refuse forest management plans applying to private property or to do whatever he wants with them, while at the same time the Minister is one of two shareholders in Coillte.

I know it will be argued that trees grow for 20 years etc.  However, I have had farmers come in 12 or 13 years after the land was checked and a grant awarded only for the Department to claim it had changed the way it does its calculation of ecological areas and so on and, even though the whole thing was done professionally from the very beginning, looking to get money back.  That undermined the bank's confidence in the grant because the accumulation of even a very small amount of money over 20 years amounts to a considerable amount of money.  The banks then get concerned as to whether these grants are worth the paper they are written on given that the Department can come after the person who got the grant well into the future.  The five-year retrospection on the LPIS is a warning to all of us as to what can happen.</p><p>  The Bill allows for up to 20 years for somebody to come back with a better measuring tape on something that was approved for a grant, claim there was a miscalculation and ask for the money back.  It is outrageous and will undermine not only the confidence of farmers investing in forestry but will also undermine the confidence of financial institutions lending money to people to invest because banks are always worried that a grant might be clawed back.  If somebody is overpaid by &euro;500 each year for 20 years, the person can suddenly get a bill for &euro;10,000.  In the greater scheme of things that would be a very small joint error because when the application is made there is a chance to check that everything in the application is correct.</p><p>  I believe this section should be deleted.</p></speech>

No. 558 of 2010) Regulation 3 of the European Communities (Aerial Fertilisation) (Forestry) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 125 of 2012)&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>This amendment - to sections 5 and 7 of the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 - involves technical changes to allow for the ongoing updating of the list of schemes that come within the remit of the agriculture appeals office and to extend the office's remit to include, in a new Schedule 2, appeals against felling and aerial fertilisation licence decisions and consents that are not covered by the various forestry schemes.  While this is a lengthy amendment to the original text of the Bill, it is important to stress that it does not alter in any way the purpose of the original provision which is to have all forestry appeals dealt with by the independent agriculture appeals office.</p><p>  The only distinction being made is that scheme applications - including afforestation, roads and woodland improvement - will be dealt with by the agriculture appeals office in the very same way as most other agriculture scheme appeals, while appeals against licence and consent decisions will be dealt with by a forestry appeals committee appointed by the Minister, as provided for under section 14A, under the auspices of the agriculture appeals office.  Similar committee systems already operate on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis to deal with various aspects of the single payment and disadvantaged areas schemes.  This committee system has worked effectively and efficiently for such appeals and I envisage that the forestry appeals committee will operate equally well.  The chairman and members of the forestry appeals committee will be appointed by the Minister and while it is not specified as to who should be chairman or who should serve on the committee, the appointment of officers of the Department is not precluded.  The composition of the committee may comprise a mix of departmental and private individuals as was the case with the single payment appeals and disadvantaged areas scheme appeals committees.  Decisions on such appointments will be made at the appropriate time and I will keep an open mind as to the composition of the membership of the committee and the appointment of its chairman.</p><p>  Members may ask why we are distinguishing between scheme applications and such licence applications.  The reason for this relates to the original purpose for which the appeals office was established, which was to consider and make determinations on appeals in respect of applications for entitlement under various schemes operated by the Department.  The extension of the Agriculture Appeals Act proposed in the amendment will for the first time bring under the remit of the appeals office the consideration - on appeal - of licence applications.  It is the view of the appeals office, in light of its experience with the operation of committees, that these appeals would best be considered within the context of a committee which can deal efficiently and effectively with complex issues and draw on the necessary expertise from other resources.</p><p>  As regards amendment number 99, section 6 of the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 provides that &quot;Appeals Officers shall, subject to this Act, be independent in the performance of their functions&quot;.  As a result, there is no need for the amendment because the matter to which it refers it is already adequately provided for in the 2001 Act.</p></speech>

However, independence and composition are two important considerations in that regard.  In light of what the Minister of State just said and in view of what is concerned in the amendment, I am of the view that it should be stipulated that stakeholders should be involved.  Given that we are dealing with issues which affect farmers, they should be represented.  In addition and given that there are also issues relating to the environment involved here, why is it not stipulated that environmental experts should serve on the appeals committee?  There are probably other stakeholders who should also be involved.  The Minister should not have a free hand.  What is proposed somewhat resembles an insider appeals mechanism.  In other words, the appeals committee will comprise individuals similar to those who will make the decisions in the first instance.  That would not be great.</p></speech>

In order for the system to work, it is necessary to include people - be they farmers or whomever - who know what they are doing.  The general thrust of the amendment reflects this.</p></speech>

N&iacute;lim ag r&aacute; n&aacute;r cheart do Sh&iacute;le de Valera a bheith ina hAire, ach dar liomsa gur ceart d'Aire na Gaeltachta a bheith ina Aire sinsearach.

T&aacute; an-d&iacute;om&aacute; orm nach bhfuil aon aird tugtha sa ch&oacute;ras nua ar Chomhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge, at&aacute; ag saothr&uacute; ar son na Gaeilge ar feadh 70 bliain.  Tuigim go bhfuil an fhreagracht as an gcinneadh sin ag Foras na Gaeilge.  Taobh istigh de mh&iacute; n&oacute; dh&oacute;, beidh d&iacute;shealbh&uacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar Chomhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge as an ardoifig at&aacute; acu.  Beidh d&iacute;om&aacute; agus n&aacute;ire orainn nuair a tharl&oacute;idh s&eacute; sin.  Is fi&uacute; a r&aacute; freisin go bhfuil ochtar ar an bhfoireann ag an gcomhdh&aacute;il.  T&aacute; na daoine seo thar a bheith gn&iacute;omhach.  N&iacute; bheidh post acu taobh istigh de mh&iacute; n&oacute; dh&oacute;.  Bheadh an-&aacute;thas orm d&aacute; mbeadh an tAire St&aacute;it in ann machnamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar an &aacute;bhar seo.  An bhfuil aon leigheas ar an sc&eacute;al?  T&aacute; an-chuid daoine m&oacute;r le r&aacute;, at&aacute; ag saothr&uacute; ar son na Gaeilge, tar &eacute;is labhairt liom i dtaobh na comhdh&aacute;la.  N&iacute;or thuig siad ag an am go raibh s&eacute; seo ag tarl&uacute;.  T&aacute;imid go l&eacute;ir i nd&uacute;iseacht anois.  Tuigimid go bhfuil r&eacute; na comhdh&aacute;la beagnach thart m&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; ag brath ar mhaoini&uacute; &oacute;n St&aacute;t.  Beidh gr&uacute;pa&iacute; den chine&aacute;l seo ag teast&aacute;il uainn i gcomhth&eacute;acs na strait&eacute;ise.</p><p> T&aacute; an ghaelscola&iacute;ocht luaite sa strait&eacute;is 20 bliain.  Cos&uacute;il le TG4 agus Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta, tugann an obair iontach a dh&eacute;anann na gaelscoileanna spreagadh d&uacute;inn.  B&iacute;onn saghas eagla orm &oacute; am go ch&eacute;ile go bhfuil br&uacute; B&eacute;arla &aacute; chur ar na gaelscoileanna - s&eacute; sin le r&aacute;, go bhfuil baol ann go mbeidh orthu an B&eacute;arla a &uacute;s&aacute;id sa ghaelscola&iacute;ocht.  Ceapann an-chuid daoine a bhaineann le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge go nd&eacute;anfadh s&eacute; sin d&iacute;obh&aacute;il don ch&oacute;ras iontach at&aacute; ar bun sna gaelscoileanna.  N&iacute;or bhunaigh an St&aacute;t na gaelscoileanna.  Daoine deonacha, a bh&iacute; f&iacute;s acu don Ghaeilge, a dhein &eacute; sin.</p><p> Bh&iacute; gach &eacute;inne thar a bheith s&aacute;sta nuair a bh&iacute; nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge cl&oacute;ite ar f&aacute;il.  Deirtear liom anois gur ar an Idirl&iacute;on amh&aacute;in a bheidh a leith&eacute;id ar f&aacute;il amach anseo.  Nuair a deineadh suirbh&eacute; suimi&uacute;il go leor maidir leis an gceist seo, d&uacute;irt 85% d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a fhreagair gurb fhearr leo go mbeadh nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge cl&oacute;ite go rialta.  N&iacute; hionann &eacute; sin agus a r&aacute; nach nglacaimid leis go bhfuil athr&uacute; ag teacht ar an saol de bharr na ruda&iacute; iontacha at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il san earn&aacute;il IT.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&oacute;-thapa agus r&oacute;-luath, &aacute;fach, f&aacute;il r&eacute;idh go hioml&aacute;n le nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge at&aacute; cl&oacute;ite n&oacute; cl&oacute;bhuailte a fhoilsi&uacute; go rialta.  Tuigim gur f&eacute;idir a r&aacute; go mbaineann na tr&iacute; cheist at&aacute; curtha agam le Foras na Gaeilge, ach is d&oacute;igh liom go mbaineann siad leis an strait&eacute;is chomh maith.  An bhfuil aon dul as i gceist i dtaobh na point&iacute; a luaigh m&eacute;?</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; ag pl&eacute; leo le fada an l&aacute;, fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in sular th&aacute;inig siad go dt&iacute; Sr&aacute;id Chill Dara.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag pl&eacute; leo nuair a bh&iacute; siad ar Shr&aacute;id U&iacute; Chonaill &Iacute;ochtarach na blianta fada &oacute; shin.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil cuimhne ag an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach ar Dhonnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire, a bh&iacute; mar sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir ar an gcomhdh&aacute;il ag an am, agus ar dhaoine eile a bh&iacute; bainteach leis an ngr&uacute;pa sin.  Mar a tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute;, s&iacute;lim go raibh an nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge a bh&iacute; ann ag an am, Inniu, lonnaithe san oifig ch&eacute;anna.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, rinne an Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh-Theas cinneadh gur cheart comhord&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge.  T&aacute; s&eacute; socraithe go nd&eacute;anfar laghd&uacute; ar l&iacute;on na n-eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; &oacute; 19 gcinn go dt&iacute; s&eacute; cinn.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na cinn at&aacute; roghnaithe.  Mar a d&uacute;irt an Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach, n&iacute;l Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge roghnaithe agus is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil &aacute;r ndearcadh f&eacute;in againn uilig ar sin.  Ar an l&aacute;mh eile, ba mh&oacute;r an trua &eacute; d&aacute; n-imeodh Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge.  N&iacute; sh&iacute;lim go gcuireadh aon rud cosc ar an gcomhdh&aacute;il lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh ar bhonn deonach.  B'fh&eacute;idir go dtarl&oacute;idh s&eacute; sin.  Is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil s&eacute; sin le socr&uacute; go f&oacute;ill.</p><p>  Labhair an Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach mar gheall ar na gaelscoileanna.  B&iacute;onn gach &eacute;inne in &iacute;sle br&iacute; anois is ar&iacute;s i dtaobh c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras n&oacute; sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute;imid ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar na pleananna teanga i l&aacute;thair na huaire.  Chaith muid cuid mh&oacute;r ama ag pl&eacute; le ruda&iacute; &aacute;irithe anseo inniu.  T&aacute; ruda&iacute; m&oacute;ra ag tarl&uacute; a raibh muid ag s&uacute;il leo le blianta fada.  T&aacute; s&eacute; cinn as na 20 ceantar plean&aacute;la teanga aimsithe.  T&aacute; tr&iacute; cinn eile &aacute; n-eagr&uacute; i l&aacute;thair na huaire, ceann amh&aacute;in acu thiar i gCois Fharraige.  Chuir s&eacute; &aacute;thas orm gur th&aacute;inig na gluaiseachta&iacute; agus na heagrais go l&eacute;ir le ch&eacute;ile ansin.  T&aacute; siad aontaithe ar phlean teanga a chur chun tosaigh anois.  T&aacute; an rud c&eacute;anna &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh i mo cheantar f&eacute;in thuas i nGaoth Dobhair agus th&iacute;os i mBaile an Fheirt&eacute;araigh.  Beifear &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh i deich gceantar eile.  T&aacute; na ruda&iacute; sin ag dul ar aghaidh mar ph&aacute;irt r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach den strait&eacute;is.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil duine i bhfeidhm anseo n&oacute; ansi&uacute;d, ach t&aacute; s&eacute; ag dul ar aghaidh.  Chuir muid an reachta&iacute;ocht tr&iacute;d ionas go mbeadh s&eacute; ar &aacute;r gcumas &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ghlac s&eacute; am na d&uacute;shraitheanna a leagan s&iacute;os, ach t&aacute; siad leagtha s&iacute;os.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin ag dul ar aghaidh.  T&aacute; m&eacute; d&oacute;chasach go mbeidh 13 ceantar Gaeltachta tar &eacute;is sc&eacute;imeanna teanga a chur ar f&aacute;il faoi dheireadh na bliana seo.  Tagann na sc&eacute;imeanna sin &oacute; na pobail f&eacute;in, le cabhair, taca&iacute;ocht agus comhairle &oacute; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, an Roinn agus gr&uacute;pa&iacute; eile.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach mbeidh siad ag r&aacute; nach bhfuil an l&iacute;ne sin n&oacute; an l&iacute;ne si&uacute;d i gceart anseo n&oacute; ansi&uacute;d.</p><p>  Caithfimid &aacute;r n-intinn agus &aacute;r n-aire a choinne&aacute;il ar an m&oacute;rphicti&uacute;r.  D'fh&eacute;adfaimis 20 bliain a chaitheamh anseo ag pl&eacute; an l&iacute;ne seo agus an l&iacute;ne si&uacute;d, ach n&iacute; dh&eacute;anfadh s&eacute; aon rud chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun tosaigh.  T&aacute;imid ag cur na pleananna teanga le ch&eacute;ile sna Gaeltachta&iacute; anois agus le tamall anuas.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sa strait&eacute;is gurb &eacute; seo an phr&iacute;omhrud at&aacute; le d&eacute;anamh m&aacute; t&aacute;imid chun an Ghaeilge a choinne&aacute;il beo sa Ghaeltacht.  Is fear Gaeltachta m&eacute;.  Feicim cad at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge ag meath sna Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Caithfidh an Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Domhnaill aont&uacute; liom go bhfuil s&eacute; seo ag tarl&uacute; ina phar&oacute;iste f&eacute;in.  T&aacute; bailte fearthainn ina raibh an Ghaeilge i ngach teach 30 n&oacute; 40 bliain &oacute; shin, ach is beag de na teaghlaigh sin a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge leis an aos &oacute;g anois.  Is &eacute; sin an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n at&aacute; againn.  Is f&eacute;idir linn bheith anseo ag arg&oacute;int faoi phoint&iacute; ghramada&iacute; agus faoi fhocail anseo is ansi&uacute;d.</p> <p>D&iacute;r&iacute;mis isteach ar mh&oacute;robair na strait&eacute;ise, uimhir a haon, an Ghaeltacht a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il agus taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt do na pobail taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, na l&iacute;onra&iacute; Gaeilge.  T&aacute; an foras ag obair orthu i l&aacute;thair na huaire agus beidh tr&eacute;imhse chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in aige agus beidh s&eacute; ag aimsi&uacute; agus ag ainmni&uacute; na l&iacute;onra&iacute; seo gan mhoill.  Tuigim go nd&eacute;anfaidh s&eacute; sin an bhliain seo chugainn agus go n-ainmneoidh s&eacute; na bailte seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeltachta.  Caithfimid d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar seo.  Is &eacute; an chiall a bhainim as an strait&eacute;is 20 bliain n&aacute; go gcaithfidh muid an Ghaeltacht a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il ar dt&uacute;s.  T&aacute; sin &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn.  T&aacute;imid ag dul ar aghaidh leis an bplean le sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Freisin, caithfidh muid taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Caithfidh muid d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an nGaeilge sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; agus mar sin de fosta. </p><p> Nuair a fheicim cad at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh sna gaelscoileanna, tugann sin d&oacute;chas agus misneach dom.  Chuirfeadh s&eacute; isteach go m&oacute;r orm d&aacute; mbeadh aon truailli&uacute; ar an Ghaeilge sna gaelscoileanna.  Aonta&iacute;m ar fad leis an gcathaoirleach agus ba bhre&aacute; liom iad a oscailt go hoifigi&uacute;il &oacute; seo go Corcaigh.  Feicim an obair iontach at&aacute; ag dul ar aghaidh ansin.  In ionad truailli&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an teanga ansin, caithfimid taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don teanga.  Nuair a bheidh mo Roinn agus Roinn eile ag caint ar cad &eacute; at&aacute; siadsan ag d&eacute;anamh maidir le cur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise, is f&eacute;idir an pointe seo a dh&eacute;anamh.  N&iacute;l aon deacracht agam le sin.</p><p> Maidir le nuacht&aacute;n cl&oacute;ite, ba dheas an rud &eacute; d&aacute; mbeadh nuacht&aacute;n cl&oacute;ite againn.  Bh&iacute; nuacht&aacute;n cl&oacute;ite againn le blianta.  Is cuimhin liom <i>Am&aacute;rach, Inniu, Foinse </i>agus mar sin de.  Bh&iacute; deacracht an uair dheireanach a bh&iacute; nuacht&aacute;n cl&oacute;ite againn.  Ar an drochuair, n&iacute; raibh aon d&iacute;ola&iacute;ocht air, thart faoi 1,400 c&oacute;ip in aghaidh na seachtaine.  Bh&iacute; fordheontas maith le f&aacute;il, ach t&aacute; cinneadh d&eacute;anta i l&aacute;thair na huaire, i bhfianaise an m&eacute;id airgid agus acmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; againn, go mbeidh an nuacht&aacute;n cl&oacute;ite ar l&iacute;ne.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann s&eacute; liomsa, is maith liom nuacht&aacute;n a bheith i mo l&aacute;mh agam, ach t&aacute; aithne agam ar dhaoine, b'fh&eacute;idir daoine &oacute;ige n&aacute; m&eacute;, n&aacute;r cheannaigh nuacht&aacute;n le blianta.  Caithfimid amharc ar sin.  D&aacute; mbeadh an saol i gceart agus d&aacute; mbeadh gach rud foirfe, bheadh s&eacute; go deas d&aacute; mbeadh nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge againn.  Sin mo dhearcadh f&eacute;in, ach caithfimid amharc ar cad iad na hacmhainn&iacute; at&aacute; againn agus an d&oacute;igh is fearr le dul i bhfeidhm ar phobal na Gaeilge.</p><p> T&aacute; mo mhacasamhail measartha t&aacute;bhachtach, ach is iad na daoine is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; ar fad &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge de n&aacute; an ghl&uacute;in at&aacute; le teacht.  T&aacute; s&eacute; iontach t&aacute;bhachtach go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; freastal orthusan.  Ar a laghad, t&aacute; an rud at&aacute; i gceist ag Foras na Gaeilge ar an idirl&iacute;on chun freastal orthu si&uacute;d.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam cad iad na f&eacute;idearthachta&iacute; maidir le gn&aacute;th nuacht&aacute;n traidisi&uacute;nta a chur ar f&aacute;il, ach ba mhaith liom d&aacute; mbeadh s&eacute; ann.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; foilsithe sa leabhar Irish Dialects and Irish-Speaking Districts, at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il &oacute;n Institi&uacute;id Ard-L&eacute;inn.  &Oacute; bharr mo chloigeann, mheas s&eacute; go raibh 30,000 cainteoir laeth&uacute;il Gaeilge f&aacute;gtha sa Ghaeltacht ag an am sin.  Tar &eacute;is an m&eacute;id athr&uacute; at&aacute; tagtha sa saol &oacute; shin i leith - mar shampla, imirce na 1950&iacute; agus forbairt na blianta at&aacute; imithe - n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom go gcuireann s&eacute; droch-chuma ar pholasaithe an St&aacute;it go bhfuil 24,000 cainteoir laeth&uacute;il f&aacute;gtha sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; tuair d&oacute;chais ann.  Th&aacute;inig m&eacute;ad&uacute; ar l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la sa t&iacute;r ar fad, agus sa Ghaeltacht, idir an d&aacute; daon&aacute;irimh dheiridh.</p> <p>Faraor g&eacute;ar, n&iacute;l figi&uacute;ir&iacute; cruinn ann m&oacute;r&aacute;n roimhe sin, mar n&iacute; raibh an chompar&aacute;id cheart dh&aacute; dh&eacute;anamh.

Bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag teacht leis an smaoineamh go raibh go leor lochta&iacute; agus go leor buanna leis an strait&eacute;is a bh&iacute; againn go dt&iacute; seo.  Bh&iacute; go leor ruda&iacute; maithe d&eacute;anta le c&eacute;ad bliain anuas, ach nuair a buna&iacute;odh Conradh na Gaeilge, mura nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; rud &eacute;igin ag an am, bheadh an Ghaeilge mharbh i bhfad &oacute; shin.  Mar sin, d'&eacute;irigh r&eacute;as&uacute;nta maith le polasa&iacute; an St&aacute;it, tar &eacute;is chomh lochtach agus a bh&iacute; s&eacute;, ach an smaoineamh a bh&iacute; taobh thiar den strait&eacute;is n&aacute; go bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr a dh&eacute;anamh agus anail&iacute;s a dh&eacute;anamh ar na h&aacute;iteanna ina raibh na laincis&iacute; taobh istigh den ch&oacute;ras agus rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh f&uacute;thu.  Bh&iacute; muid ar fad aontaithe go raibh drochruda&iacute; agus ruda&iacute; maithe d&eacute;anta suas go dt&iacute; sin.</p><p> T&aacute; an strait&eacute;is f&iacute;or-shoil&eacute;ir faoi c&eacute;ard &eacute; an aidhm.  Is &eacute; aidhm polasa&iacute; an Rialtais i leith na Gaeilge n&aacute; h&uacute;s&aacute;id agus eolas ar an nGaeilge a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; mar theanga phobail ar bhonn c&eacute;imi&uacute;il.  &Eacute; sin d&eacute;anta, is &eacute; an aidhm n&aacute; tagairt faoi leith a dh&eacute;anamh don Ghaeltacht.  Deirtear go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; c&uacute;ram agus sol&aacute;thar ar leith don teanga sa Ghaeltacht, go h&aacute;irithe i bhfianaise an taighde a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn go bhfuil g&eacute;arch&eacute;im ann maidir le hinmharthanacht na Gaeilge mar theanga phobail agus theaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar sin, t&aacute; aidhm na strait&eacute;ise f&iacute;or-shoil&eacute;ir agus t&aacute; s&eacute; ar an gc&eacute;ad leathanach den strait&eacute;is c&eacute;ard at&aacute; i gceist a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p> T&aacute; casaoid d&eacute;anta ag an Teachta Kyne go raibh muid g&eacute;ar ar an Aire St&aacute;it inniu.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, d&aacute; mba rud &eacute; go raibh muid istigh ag an gcoiste a dh&eacute;anann ini&uacute;chadh ar na cuntais phoibl&iacute;, bheadh iontas ar dhaoine agus muid ag caint faoi airgead.  Agus d&aacute; mbeadh tuarasc&aacute;il os &aacute;r gcomhair ag r&aacute; nach raibh aire cheart &aacute; thabhairt d'airgead an St&aacute;it, go raibh s&eacute; &aacute; chur am&uacute; agus nach raibh polasaithe &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm leis an airgead, n&iacute; cheapfadh aon duine go br&aacute;ch na breithe go raibh s&eacute; aisteach go dtiocfaimis g&eacute;ar, l&iacute;ne ar l&iacute;ne, ag r&aacute; gur seo an rud a bh&iacute; r&aacute;ite a bh&iacute; le d&eacute;anamh agus gur seo an rud a at&aacute; d&eacute;anta.  Ach nuair a thagann s&eacute; chuig an Ghaeilge, nuair a chuireann muid chuige ar an me&aacute;n proifisi&uacute;nta c&eacute;anna, ag d&eacute;anamh anail&iacute;se focal ar fhocal ar c&eacute;ard at&aacute; d&eacute;anta agus c&eacute;ard nach bhfuil d&eacute;anta, go tobann, n&iacute; ceart &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  N&iacute; ceart don Oireachtas seo feidhmi&uacute; mar Oireachtas.</p><p> D&uacute;irt an Teachta Kyne go raibh muid ag imirt cluich&iacute; polaiti&uacute;la.  T&aacute; mise ag iarraidh ar an Teachta Kyne &eacute; sin a tharraingt siar.  &Oacute; d'fh&aacute;g mise an scoil, t&aacute; mo shaol caite go deonach, go proifisi&uacute;nta agus ar bhonn teaghlaigh leis an nGaeilge.  Nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar an ollscoil, bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar choiste gn&oacute; Chonradh na Gaeilge agus in iliomad eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; eile.  Nuair a d'fh&aacute;g m&eacute; an ollscoil, chuaigh m&eacute; ag obair le Conradh na Gaeilge agus ansin le Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge agus ansin chuaigh m&eacute; siar go dt&iacute; an Ghaeltacht mar bhainisteoir ar chomharchumann.  N&iacute; as an nGaeltacht m&eacute;, ach thug m&eacute; faoi ch&oacute;na&iacute; sa nGaeltacht.  T&aacute; mo chlann t&oacute;gtha le Gaeilge agus t&aacute; mo gharchlann dh&aacute; th&oacute;g&aacute;il le Gaeilge.  T&aacute; gach l&aacute; de mo shaol, pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach agus poibl&iacute;, caite agam leis an nGaeilge.  </p><p> Is c&aacute;s liom an Ghaeilge agus aon chasaoid at&aacute; agam n&oacute; aon ch&aacute;ineadh at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh agam ar pholasa&iacute; an Rialtais, t&aacute; s&eacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh mar go gcreidim i mo chro&iacute; istigh go bhfuil faill&iacute; aisteach dh&aacute; dh&eacute;anamh go ci&uacute;in r&eacute;idh maidir leis an strait&eacute;is.  T&aacute;thar tar &eacute;is a dhul, gan a r&aacute; go hoscailte go bhfuil s&eacute; d&eacute;anta, agus an strait&eacute;is a str&oacute;iceadh &oacute; ch&eacute;ile.  Cheana f&eacute;in inniu, fuair muid amach go bhfuil an bun ailtireacht ar a raibh an strait&eacute;is bunaithe curtha &oacute; mhaith ar fad ag an Rialtas seo, agus ba mh&oacute;r ab fhi&uacute; go bhfuair muid &eacute; sin amach inniu.</p><p> Creidim go bhfuil s&eacute; de dhualgas orainn, mar Bhaill den Oireachtas, ini&uacute;chadh g&eacute;ar a dh&eacute;anamh ar gach rud at&aacute; an Rialtas ag d&eacute;anamh.  Sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil an tOireachtas ann.  L&iacute;ne ar l&iacute;ne, caithfimid gach polasa&iacute; a sheice&aacute;il in &eacute;adan na spriocanna at&aacute; leagtha amach acu f&eacute;in.  M&aacute; cheapann an tAire St&aacute;it nach &iacute; seo an strait&eacute;is ar cheart a bheith ann, deireadh s&eacute; &eacute; sin, ach go dt&iacute; go n-athr&oacute;idh an Rialtas an strait&eacute;is, seo &iacute; an strait&eacute;is agus t&aacute; dualgas ar an gcoiste seo obair an Rialtais a theist, bunaithe ar an strait&eacute;is seo.</p><p> N&iacute; ghlacaim leis &oacute; dhuine ar bith go bhfuil m&eacute; ag imirt polait&iacute;ochta anseo.  T&aacute; an iomarca de bhlianta de mo shaol caite agam ag obair ar son na c&uacute;ise.  Ag &eacute;ir&iacute; as an gcruinni&uacute; seo, molaim don choiste seo lean&uacute;int leis an ngrinnstaid&eacute;ar at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh againn l&iacute;ne ar l&iacute;ne agus tuarasc&aacute;il a chur amach ag an deireadh ag taispe&aacute;int gach m&iacute;r at&aacute; curtha i bhfeidhm agus gach m&iacute;r nach bhfuil curtha i bhfeidhm agus na c&uacute;iseanna a tugadh d&uacute;inn n&aacute;r cuireadh i bhfeidhm iad.  Molaim don ch&eacute;ad l&aacute; eile, go nd&iacute;reoidh muid isteach ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais agus go dtabharfar cuireadh don Aire St&aacute;it, don Aire sinsearach Gaeltachta at&aacute; freagrach as an nGaeilge agus don Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna teacht os &aacute;r gcomhair.</p><p>T&aacute; an chaibidil den strait&eacute;is at&aacute; i gceist againn, ach sula dtiocfaidh siad os &aacute;r gcomhair, is c&oacute;ir go gcuirfear ar f&aacute;il an plean forfheidhme &oacute;n Roinn le gur f&eacute;idir linn &eacute; a chur i gcompar&aacute;id leis an strait&eacute;is.  Chomh maith le sin, is c&oacute;ir go mbeidh os &aacute;r gcomhair le pl&eacute; an tuarasc&aacute;il a chuireadh ar f&aacute;il de dhul chun cinn i gcur i bhfeidhm na strait&eacute;ise ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna.

I welcome the following: Mr. Colm O'Gorman, director of Amnesty International Ireland; Mr. Patrick Corrigan, Northern Ireland programme director of Amnesty International UK; and Mr. Kartik Raj, campaigner, EU team, Amnesty International.</p><p>  The timing of this meeting is quite appropriate.  We have had a challenging week in Northern Ireland relating to legacy issues dealing OTRs and other difficult challenges still need to be dealt with.  We are delighted that the witnesses are here today to add value to this committee's deliberations on the past.  Witnesses at recent committee meetings have included Ms Kathryn Stone, the victims' commissioner, ex-prisoners, former combatants, and victims groups.  It is a complex mix.  The members are very well aware of the difficulties and challenges.  We very much look forward to the witnesses' contribution today and we will have a good open session after their initial statements.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your remarks.  You are directed that only comments and evidence in relation to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Mr. O'Gorman to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We carried out the research as we approached the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, the Belfast Agreement, to examine what had been put in place in Northern Ireland to investigate past human rights abuses and violations.  Separately from presenting on the research and its findings, we also wish to give a view of recent developments, particularly the Haass proposals and other issues that have arisen in recent months.</p><p>  Mr. Kartik Raj, a campaigner with our EU team based at our international secretariat in London, who was one of the authors of the research, will now present on the research and its findings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1057" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kartik Raj" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600003#E00400"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us.  Our research assessed the investigatory mechanisms that exist in Northern Ireland in light of international human rights law and standards, and the degree to which they are delivering for victims.  We recognise that not all victims seek the same things or speak with one voice; they simply cannot.  Some 3,600 people were killed and more than 40,000 people were injured.  However, we did hear clearly a common call among the majority of those to whom we spoke for political leaders, wherever they may be, to give greater priority to victims' quest for truth, justice, acknowledgment and support.</p><p>  The central overarching finding from our research is that the approach to dealing with the past in Northern Ireland is inadequate.  It too often lets victims down and falls short of the UK&rsquo;s human rights obligations.  Our report identifies two key problems with the current approach.  The first looks at the individual mechanisms that have been established, the Historical Enquires Team, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, coroner inquests, public inquiries and criminal investigations carried out by the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p><p>  We found that victims and families who engaged with these mechanisms reported a range of experiences.  Some of them found they worked well; in some instances they delivered a measure of satisfaction and some reports that were good.  However, by and large our research found that the individual mechanisms were either falling short or had fallen short of human rights standards because of their failure to conduct prompt, thorough and effective independent investigations in an impartial manner.  I would be happy to discuss further during questions the specific findings on those five types of investigative mechanisms.</p> <p>Of more concern is the second finding, namely, that even if all these mechanisms operated fully in compliance with their mandates and design, the piecemeal and fragmented approach to investigations characteristic of Northern Ireland in this regard is too incomplete to provide a comprehensive picture of the violations and abuses suffered during the three decades.  The mechanisms have inherent limitations by design.  They are discrete and have an individualised nature, and as a result much of the truth about what happened remains hidden.  This has contributed to a failure to develop shared public understanding and recognition of the abuses and violations committed by all sides.  By "truth" I mean facts and information about human rights violations and abuses and not "truth" in a philosophical or metaphysical sense.</p><p>  I wish to highlight a number of key points for the committee arising from the research.  The accountability mechanisms in Northern Ireland focus primarily on killings and suspicious deaths and mostly exclude people who were injured in life-threatening attacks and those subject to torture and ill-treatment.  This exclusion means the full truth about the past cannot be established and this needs to be remedied.  As a result of their design the mechanisms focus on individual cases, which has limited the possibility of examining patterns of abuses and violations.  This has limited wider public understanding of the wrongs perpetrated by all sides.  This applies to the armed groups responsible for the vast majority of deaths and other human rights abuses during the three decades.  The patterns, policies, practices, institutional culture and knowledge and responsibility of those in high-level positions of authority in these groups remain altogether unclear and underinvestigated.  The role and actions of particular UK state bodies, agencies and Government departments have not been subject to effective investigation in a systematic fashion.  Substantial questions remain about the degree of collusion that took place, the responsibility of various state actors and agencies, and what those in senior levels of government knew.</p><p> Based on this research we call for an overarching mechanism to be established to comprehensively address the past.  The concluding pages of the report set out specific human rights guidelines which could inform the establishment of such a mechanism, which should be victim-focused and able to investigate individual cases and patterns of abuses and violations.  Where sufficient evidence exists there should be the possibility of bringing those responsible to justice with the guarantee of a fair trial.  It should have powers to compel witnesses and documents.  It should be able to draft recommendations so victims can enjoy full reparation.  We believe such a mechanism would be an important step towards ending impunity for human rights violations and abuses in Northern Ireland, and allow for public recognition about the harm inflicted by all sides, and I keep emphasising "by all sides".</p><p> Our report also highlights that any mechanism established to investigate human rights abuses and violations in Northern Ireland must be able to effectively investigate connections with Ireland.  The committee is aware of the long-standing allegations that Irish authorities turned a blind eye to arms smuggling across the Border and to members of republican armed groups fleeing back to the Republic of Ireland.  There are also allegations concerning collusion by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a number of cases concerning collusion between authorities in Northern Ireland and loyalist armed groups who carried out attacks and killings in counties Armagh, Louth, Monaghan and Dublin.   Given these connections, we urge not only that the Irish Government supports the establishment of a comprehensive mechanism to address the past in Northern Ireland, but once established to provide it with full co-operation regarding alleged links to the Republic of Ireland and events here.  This may require Ireland to enact legislation to ensure the powers of compulsion of any body extend here and work effectively here.  It will require the support of Deputies and Senators across the political spectrum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1059" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Corrigan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600004#F00200"><p>I will pick up on the events of recent months.  As members are aware in September 2013, when Amnesty published this research, the five Executive parties in Northern Ireland met in earnest under the auspices of Dr. Richard Haass and Professor Meghan O'Sullivan.  With regard to these talks, Amnesty&rsquo;s focus was on the strand dealing with the past.  We have provided the committee with our full official response to the proposals in the draft Haass agreement of 31 December 2013.  Our response focuses on the proposed establishment of an historical investigations unit, HIU, and an independent commission for information retrieval, ICIR.  I will comment on particular aspects of the draft proposals.</p><p>  We believe the Haass talks draft agreement provides a solid basis on which progress can, and should, be made.  With respect to the HIU, the Haass proposals importantly highlight the need for a mechanism capable of carrying out investigations compliant with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights in an independent manner and, crucially, which can command the confidence of the entire community in Northern Ireland.  We therefore believe efforts should now be made to introduce legislation to finally establish an effective investigatory mechanism capable of securing a measure of truth and justice for victims of human rights violations and abuses.  Furthermore, as a number of cases have cross-Border implications and connections, it is important that any bodies established have the full support and co-operation of the Irish Government and its agencies, including if necessary through the drafting of legislation.</p><p>  There are some areas where further clarification or perhaps changes to the Haass proposals should be considered by the parties.  For example, there should be explicit guarantees of sufficient resources to such a process.  The importance of guaranteeing sufficient resources is starkly highlighted by the caveat in the Haass draft agreement that the HIU would conduct reviews and investigations into cases involving serious injuries only "if resources permit".  There must be an effective procedure to guarantee that all relevant intelligence, including from the UK Ministry of Defence, the security services, and other government departments, is made available to the HIU.  There is some uncertainty about this as the draft stands.</p><p>  Amnesty International considers the proposals in the draft agreement for a separate truth or information recovery process, the ICIR, provide a good basis on which to pursue further discussions.  However, we believe the powers and remit of the ICIR as conceived in the agreement need to be strengthened in a number of areas.  For instance, powers of compulsion are entirely absent from the proposals for the ICIR.  This means it would be left to operate on the basis of purely voluntary co-operation of persons willing to give testimony.  This is particularly important with respect to the role of the ICIR in the examination of patterns and policies, where its lack of powers to compel witnesses or the production of documents would significantly undermine its ability to come to informed conclusions.  With regard to exposing a wider narrative of what happened and wider analysis we may be left short yet again.</p><p>  The key point is that at present these draft proposals remain just that, draft proposals.  It is important we do not let another opportunity slip by where sensible proposals which have achieved a measure of cross-party support and which could be developed, brought into existence and have the capacity to deliver for victims and their families, come to nothing because of a lack of sufficient political will to bring them over the line.  We are deeply concerned the Haass proposals on the past may be held hostage to the lack of agreement on flags and parades, or fall victim to the recent row about the UK Government&rsquo;s scheme for so-called "on the runs".</p> <p>The Downey case is a stark example of how the on-the-runs scheme has the potential to perpetuate impunity.  We are concerned that there may be other cases where similar errors have been made and where the prosecution of members of armed groups suspected of committing abuses may fail for the same or similar reasons.  The announcement by the UK Prime Minister of a judge-led inquiry to examine the scheme is a positive development.  It must be made clear that the assurances contained in the letters received by those on the run cannot be a bar to further investigation or the possibility of bringing fresh prosecutions.</p><p> These recent revelations show precisely why a new comprehensive approach to dealing with the past &ndash; rather than the fragmented, piecemeal approach adopted to date &ndash; is needed in order for victims of human rights abuses and violations across the board to secure truth and justice.  We urge the Northern Ireland political parties and the UK and Irish Governments to play their part in taking forward the proposals.  As the draft agreement emphasises, the time to rise to the challenge of the past is now, as &ldquo;Northern Ireland does not have the luxury of putting off this difficult, but potentially transformative, task any longer.&rdquo;  Amnesty International asks this committee to support our calls.  We urge the committee to encourage the Irish Government to work towards the establishment of a comprehensive mechanism to address the past in Northern Ireland and, if it is established, to provide full co-operation with its work and investigations.</p></speech>

I thank Amnesty International for the report and for its efforts.  It has been a great help.  I am glad that Amnesty International believes the Haass process was useful, because people such as Mark Durkan, MP, and Alex Attwood, MLA, put a lot of effort into making it useful.</p><p>  Regarding thematic matters, does Amnesty International feel we were demanding too much or too little?  Did the document known as Haass 7 produce enough on thematic matters?  It is the big point of political contention, which has been ongoing in subsequent discussions.  How important are thematic matters?  How do we balance individual satisfaction, individually tailored results or packages for the individual victims <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the thematic matters?  Do we set thematic matters at a higher level or is it more relevant or less relevant than individual satisfaction for the victims?  The current situation is all individualised and much of the resistance to dealing with the past on Haass continues to be around thematic matters.</p></speech>

There is a clich&eacute; that we cannot change the past but there is agreement that our attitudes to the past can change.  That is important.  We all accept we have been changed and hurt by the conflict but also by the peace process.  It is an important message about this report.  The witnesses say there is failure to agree on aspects of the Haass proposals.  Where is the problem?  The Unionists have problems with it but they have not said publicly what the problem is.  How do the witnesses believe we can move beyond Haass on this point?  Sinn F&eacute;in shares the belief that the Haass proposals provide a further step to move things forward through recovery for survivors.  We believe the process proposed should be enacted.  In the view of the SDLP and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, there is potential for agreement, but the Unionists have stalled it.</p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement, the Weston Park agreement, the St. Andrews agreement and other agreements include the rights and entitlements of victims.  Does Amnesty International have a view on the failure of the governments, as guarantors of the agreement, to have a public inquiry into the Pat Finucane murder and the refusal of the British Government to provide evidence and information on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the delivery of a bill of rights, the Irish language, the civic forum and the lack of powers in respect of human rights?  The witnesses talked about the difficulties of the piecemeal approach to victims in the North.  Do the witnesses accept there is also a piecemeal approach to victims in the South and victims in Britain?  How do we approach that?  Should there be an all-encompassing agreement in respect of how we approach victims of the conflict?  People were bereaved and injured in this State and elsewhere, yet there is a disparity.  Families in the State have initiated investigations by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland in respect of the failings of the RUC, yet there is no similar system for a GSOC investigation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The same applies to historic inquiries.  People have difficulties with that.  There is a lack of support to victims and victims' advocates.  Should we look at the issue of victims and truth overall?  I do not see why we cannot have truth recovery in respect of people in Britain.  Will the Brits open up their political and military archives in respect of their involvement?  I cannot see that happening.</p><p>  The on-the-runs were mentioned in respect of the John Downey case.  My understanding is that letters of impunity were not an amnesty and only mean the person is not wanted on the basis of the evidence available at that time.  It is not an amnesty.  The witness said there was difficulty with the Downey case and people are saying this was a secret deal.  The Unionists claimed they were not aware of it, but it was discussed with Unionists and they were fully aware of it.  People are playing games.  It was one of the outstanding aspects of the Weston Park agreement and there was acceptance that we had to address the issue and move on.  No one is talking about an amnesty.  The letters mean that when the letters were published, no information could implicate these people through the courts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1063" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600005#G00400"><p>I welcome Amnesty International's work on the past and the authority, consideration, sensitivity and seriousness it brings.  The report produced, "Northern Ireland: Time to Deal with the Past", coincided with the Haass process and provided much useful thought for people who must grapple with these issues.</p> <p>Richard Haass and Meghan O'Sullivan particularly appreciated it because it helped them navigate some of the issues and considerations involved.  A few of us have picked up on the point about the deficit, inadequacies or inequalities among some of the provisions for dealing with the past, which are quite unsatisfactory.  Some people appear to be able to get satisfaction out of aspects of the work of the historical enquiries team, HET, while others cannot because of its poor character in respect of army deaths.  Even where people were satisfied with the HET's report on their individual cases, the wider public and future generations did not necessarily benefit if the report was deemed to be the private property of the families.</p><p> The publication of the book <i>Lethal Allies</i>and the great work of Anne Cadwallader and the Pat Finucane Centre showed the difference it makes when somebody takes several cases the HET has examined together and supplements them with other investigative and research work in national archives.  They were able to produce a much bigger and more compelling narrative which awakened public interest and concern in important ways.  The work told some of those families for the first time that their loved ones had been killed by the same weapons and, in effect, the same network.  It showed that no matter how good the HET&rsquo;s work, there was still a deficit in the truth given to the families, and certainly in the truth given to the public.  That is all the more reason it is important that these patterns, lessons, thematics - whatever generic term we put on them - must be part of the further approach to dealing with the past.  As well as continuing high-quality individual investigations, if people want to call them that, and making sure they are robustly compliant with Article 2, unlike some of the HET&rsquo;s previous work, this is the best way to deal with the past.</p><p> I welcome what Amnesty International said here today and what is in its post-Haass paper, which points out that while the Haass report's draft proposals are very strong, there are wrinkles to be ironed out, such as the reference only to PSNI intelligence files.  It is vacant and oblique on whether it covers intelligence in this jurisdiction and in Britain.  Why should it be confined to intelligence held by the PSNI?  The scope of victimhood, conflict and atrocity is wider than Northern Ireland and than what would be contained in PSNI files.</p><p> Amnesty International feels the terms for recovery from the Independent Commission for Information are too loose, and it is a case of awaiting information.  Maybe it is not proactive enough.  We want to make it more proactive in several ways and have argued for that during and since the discussions.  It might be more difficult to agree on the powers of compellability we would give it.  I am not sure all parties would go the same distance.  We have to get a balance and a perspective there.</p><p> Whatever else the parties disagree on, and whatever sensitivities are involved, the report of the Consultative Group on the Past in Northern Ireland, known as the Eames Bradley report, and all parties in the Haass talks, agree that amnesty is not a basis for dealing with the past.  Several people seem to be have been quite confused about that recently, Peter Hain among them.  In interviews he recommends amnesty on the back of the recent case.  He says the recent case was not about an amnesty, but public knowledge of it means that we should move to amnesty for soldiers, police, Loyalists and everybody, which is a peculiar argument.  He also says that, rather than being concerned about what has happened, people should move on, look to the future and move forward with Haass and Eames Bradley, but he ignores the fact that Haass and Eames Bradley made the fundamental point that amnesty was not a basis for dealing with the past.  That is backlit in a very important and cogent way by Amnesty International&rsquo;s documents, and what we have heard today.</p><p> People were aware that there was an arrangement by which people outside the jurisdiction could find out whether they would be in peril of arrest if they came back in.  Whenever the so-called on-the-runs Bill, which was not about on-the-runs but was about a general secret amnesty scheme, was on the go, some of us said surely there could be a means by which people or their lawyers could find out and be told of the peril.  The British Government and Sinn F&eacute;in told us that would not be possible and would not be enough.  Now we are told the scheme put in place after the Bill had to be pulled is exactly that.  Now that we can read the letters, we can see that is what they purport to say.  Deputy Crowe is right about that.  The difference is that that is not what the court in London was told.  The court decided that there was in effect impunity, that the sky would fall in if the prosecution proceeded on the basis of any other evidence or reasons for justice, because of Peter Hain&rsquo;s and Jonathan Powell&rsquo;s evidence.  The letters are less the problem than the import attributed to them in a court.  The like of that would not, and could not, happen in this jurisdiction.  A court of this Republic would not say all the evidence is dismissed because of other evidence and affidavits from some politicians or a former political adviser.  That would not override and undermine everything else.  It would not happen.  That is the problem.  There is confusion about where the problem, the issue and the questions lie.</p></speech>

I will not delay the meeting as I have had the opportunity to engage directly with the guests, but I welcome the research, the report and the proposals it contains.</p><p>  I understand the HET has been practically stood down.  From its research and engagement with different stakeholders, would Amnesty International think a re-established HET with an enhanced role could provide a worthwhile framework to move the issues around dealing with the past forward?  Mr. Durkan referred to Anne Cadwallader&rsquo;s very good book, <i>Lethal Allies</i>, dealing with extremely difficult issues.  It brought facts into the open for many families.  Margaret Irwin of Justice for the Forgotten is here today and I would like to compliment her, Ms Cadwallader and their colleagues in the Pat Finucane Centre on continuing to work as strong advocates for so many bereaved families.</p> <p>There is another issue on which I would like a public pronouncement, namely, the failure of the British Government to respond positively to the all-party unanimous request of this Parliament to seek British co-operation in handing over all original documents on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974.  We will soon reach the 40th anniversary of those atrocities, the largest single slaughter of innocent people on our island during that very difficult period referred to as the Troubles.  An all-party motion was moved in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in July 2008 by the then Government Chief Whip and it received the unanimous support of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The request was reiterated by a unanimous motion in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in July 2011 but unfortunately there has been no response from the British Government to our request that the documentation be provided to allow proper inquiries to be followed up.  Will Amnesty International, in whatever channel it communicates with the British Government, support the request of a sovereign Parliament to another sovereign Government?</p><p> I commend the witnesses on their work.  A range of issues has been covered and they are all extremely important.  Will the witnesses revert on the potential for an enhanced historical enquiries team, HET?</p></speech>

It is instructive to have pointed out to us the limitations of the work of the historical investigations team and particularly the failure to get a handle on collusion on state involvement, as well as the institutional culture of the armed groups.  There is also the failure to establish complete trust across the community and among victims.  The witnesses have also pointed out the difficulty arising from the Haass recommendations not being implemented.</p><p>  I am interested in the take on the Downey case and its implications.  Until it is resolved by the judge's report, the matter is effectively on hold and nothing can happen.  Deputy Crowe's variation is that if there were investigations of victims' requests, new prosecutions could ensue on new evidence.  It is a grey area between old and new evidence.  It is an interesting conundrum that may bring about an operational cul-de-sac.  I presume that and the non-implementation of the Haass process create the biggest difficulties.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Smith, asked if a revised HET could do the business.  I am fascinated by the gap between the witnesses' interpretation of the Downey issue and Deputy Crowe's interpretation, as they seem different.</p></speech>

When we consider the absolutes inherent in the dirty war for 30 years, as people had a fixed position and one group was right and another was wrong, bar stool conversations meant everybody had a fixed opinion.  We have had many groups before us and some want justice, others want truth and yet others want acknowledgement.  Some groups want closure but others disagree with that term.  It is such a complex issue and people are not having the conversation around absolutes in dealing with the past.  How can we marry the conversation when people have a fixed position on how to deal with the past and when there is a complex mix of opinions?  The witnesses may not be able to answer the question specifically but in coming together we are highlighting the need for a mechanism to deal with the past.</p></speech>

That, combined with the piecemeal approach adopted thus far, is part of what creates the difficulty.  As a human rights organisation the committee should not be surprised that we think there is a rather good framework that could be applied in dealing with the past, namely, the framework of international human rights law.  At the state level we want a framework to be put in place that is fully compliant with international human rights standards, as that is the framework that needs to be applied.  In doing so, the process must consider, primarily and centrally, the needs and rights of victims of violations.</p><p>  This theme emerges strongly from research.  There was an event in Dublin last night at which victims groups like Justice for the Forgotten presented.  Members are aware of this because they met victims and victims groups.  Deputy Crowe referred to the notion that we cannot change the past, and we can all agree on that.  We must deal with the way in which the past is people's present; we are not talking about looking at history but rather considering the impact of past events on people's lives today.  It is a real issue for many people, as the committee is aware.  The international human rights law framework provides for clear obligations on the part of states and a framework that should be applied.  Processes and systems which are developed must comply with those international obligations, and that can guide people objectively.</p><p>  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Raj, to speak to the question of conflict in how to address these issues or the priority to be applied to broad thematic matters.</p></speech>

The positive work in the Haass draft proposal 7 on thematics was the acknowledgment that there was a series of thematics that needed addressing, including alleged collusion between governments and loyalist and republican armed groups, and reported targeting of off-duty Ulster Defence Regiment soldiers, prison officers and Royal Ulster Constabulary officers.  There is also the question of whether the Republic of Ireland or any of its authorities provided a safe haven to members of republican armed groups and the mistreatment of detainees and prisoners.  It is really important that Mr. Durkan, MP, has highlighted the work of the Pat Finucane Centre, for example, in joining the dots of the Glennane series and the work of a particular constellation of armed group members working across the Border with relative impunity over a long period.  It is not so much an issue of ascribing a higher or lower level of importance to individual satisfaction and the broader thematic examination as it is to say that those individuals whose families suffered a loss of life deserve in their individual case an Article 2 compliant mechanism.  Society, more broadly, requires a mechanism that is not constrained by that sort of tunnel vision so it can look across and find patterns.  It should not be left to individual families and the non-governmental organisations advocating for them to speak to each other across cases based on private reports handed to them or pick up things in the media on a report handed to family X or family Y to say "that sounds familiar to something that happened in the report I was given."</p> <p>For there to be public confidence and trust in believing the mechanism is adequately addressing systemic violations and abuses in the past there needs to be the joining of these dots.  If the HIU is able to do some of these things, that would be an incredibly welcome step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1074" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Corrigan" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600008#K00200"><p>I will pick up on some of the questions on the responsibilities of the UK and Irish Governments to deliver in terms of what happened the past and whether it seems to us that they are prepared to fulfil that role.  When we met the Haass team at the beginning of September just at the point where we were about to publish our report &ndash; we provided it with an advance copy &ndash; we wished it well with its endeavours, but we noted at that stage that there were two crucial actors missing from the Haass talks, namely, the UK Government and the Irish Government.  Whatever one might say about delivery on flags and parades being very much a devolved issue, dealing with the past is an issue that spreads across the jurisdictions and responsibility for delivering the powers, resources and co-operation to make these mechanisms work for victims is shared in Belfast, Dublin and London.  One of the weaknesses of the outcome of the Haass process is that there is a lack of clarity about where the UK and Irish Governments now sit and the degree to which they are in a position to deliver fully.  We must take at face value the public commitment that has since come from Ministers in both the UK and Irish Governments that they broadly endorse the Haass proposals and that they stand prepared to deliver.  What we think is missing is a more proactive leadership role.  That is a shared responsibility in dealing with the past and it will be important &ndash; as we said in our full response to the Haass document &ndash; that authorities and archives in the Republic of Ireland and the UK are made available to the investigative units, the HIU and the ICIR.  Work could now be done, without waiting necessarily for the Northern Ireland party discussions to pick up again, to scope out, in particular, in terms of legislation or other commitments from government that could be made by Westminster and the Oireachtas.</p><p>  It is clear that work will be required on the delivery of the Haass proposals.  More than lip service could be paid to this and work could be under way.  That shows more than a sitting back and a waiting for the process to take its course.  We very much welcome the verbal commitments given by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach in response to the Haass proposals, but there is more work to be done.  It was correct to identify that we had seen shortcomings elsewhere.  We have not seen an inquiry for which we and the Finucane family have called into the murder of Pat Finucane.  We have not seen a public inquiry established into the circumstances leading up to and following the Omagh bombing.  We have seen shortcomings elsewhere, including in the delivery of other parts of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Bill of Rights still remains an undelivered part of the commitments given by the two sovereign Governments in 1998 and Amnesty International, with hundreds of other civil society groups in Northern Ireland, still want to see delivery on it.  We think it would play a useful role in establishing a human rights framework to tackle some of the other contentious decisions that Northern Ireland faces all of the time.  It might be flags and parades on the agenda at the moment, but it might be other issues in a year&rsquo;s time.  Until we have that long-term human rights framework in place, we will continue to be faced with short-term crises and crisis discussions about how we find short-term mechanisms or solutions to these issues.</p><p>  We urge the UK and Irish Governments to play a very active role in trying to bring agreement and show their bona fides in delivering on the Haass proposals and ironing out these wrinkles, as Mr. Durkan identified, and in also considering what else they might need to do outside of the confines of the Haass proposals to deliver for victims in other jurisdictions.  We are aware that there are victims in both the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain and elsewhere who also appeal for truth and justice in their cases.  The UK and Irish Governments clearly have responsibilities to them.</p></speech>

It is very clear that we want to see meaningful, effective investigations and inquiries of violations, wherever they have occurred.  The obligation on state parties is to ensure that happens.</p><p>  Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Reilly has left the meeting, but I wish to make a quick comment in response to his question about the conflict between what he saw as our take on the Downey case and its implications and the position presented by Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe.  Our take, if we can describe it as such, is only based on what we are aware of from what is already in the public domain on the issue.  That speaks to the general concern about the piecemeal approach, lack of clarity, information, transparency and effective, cohesive processes to deal with the past and the complications that arise because of this.</p></speech>

Does he have any concern that the Secretary of State seemed to only be particular about the fact that the Haass proposals might entail legislation in Westminster on devolving responsibility for parades and that she conspicuously avoided any indication that there might need to be legislation in respect of provisions to provide for qualified-purpose immunity and other things for the arrangements set up under the Haass proposals?  It is not only legislative authorisations that are needed or sufficient to help to make the Haass proposals work on the rounded basis to which Mr. Corrigan referred.</p></speech>

While a broad welcome has been given by the Secretary of State and there has been an endorsement of the work done during the Haass process, we have lacked detail in terms of commitments from the UK Government to ensure delivery and a full acknowledgement of its role and responsibilities.  More work needs to be done by both the UK Government and the authorities in Dublin.  It seems to us that the process is most effective when the UK and Irish Governments are able to work in concert in delivering on their sovereign Government responsibilities both in their own right but also as co-guarantors of the Agreement of 1998.  We urge the Secretary of State and the wider UK Government to be more active in their leadership and indicate what it is they are willing to do beyond broad welcomes and endorsement.</p></speech>

It was a way of trying to move matters forward.  I agree entirely with what has been said about the two Governments needing to scope out the situation.  Reference was made to victims in the North, but what about victims in the South?  What would the argument be if the delegates were to meet the Government?  I have mentioned that there is a commission and a forum in the North.  There is support and a mechanism for historical inquiries or people going to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office that are not available in this jurisdiction.</p> <p>That is an anomaly within the system.  The Good Friday Agreement was supposed to be about moving forward and best practice for the future, but we still have not got this.  Mention was made of a scoping exercise, but what could be done if Amnesty International could meet the Government?  The Government is not paralysed and the two Governments could move the situation forward.  If there cannot be an agreement on human rights in the North, there is nothing to stop the two Governments in pushing ahead with simple issues such as support for victims, their advocates and organisations.  What would Amnesty International advise in that regard?  It states the approach is piecemeal, but what is being suggested is piecemeal also.  We do not look at that bigger picture and at those in Britain and so on.  What would Amnesty International state and what are its proposals in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1082" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kartik Raj" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600009#L00200"><p>What we come back to is the research on the basis of which we make our recommendations.  Our research focused on the existing investigative mechanisms in Northern Ireland and we found them to be fragmented and piecemeal.  That is not to say we are not aware or cognisant of the fact that there is a lack of effective mechanisms across the board or that families of people suffering human rights abuses in Britain do not have recourse to parallel mechanisms.  As the Deputy pointed out, this has created anomalies, where families in one jurisdiction must reach out to a mechanism in another.</p><p>  In general, the recommendations we make are based on the research we have conducted.  We encourage the Irish State to ensure adequate provision of support and comply with inquiries where they are needed.  These mechanisms require co-operation from the authorities and agencies on both sides of the Border, but as we know from the most recent high profile tribunal, this was a particular stumbling block in the provision and disclosure of information.  These are difficult issues, but they are precisely the kind of questions that need to be addressed in taking forward the Haass proposals.</p><p>  I will return to two earlier questions.  Mr. Durkan made a point on intelligence files, not just PSNI intelligence files.  This is something I highlight in terms of the work of the proposed Historic Investigations Unit, HIU.  A serious amount of clarity is required in terms of how any post-Haass investigative body would access intelligence information held beyond the PSNI such as that held by other police forces in the United Kingdom, security services, Government Departments, the Ministry of Defence and law enforcement agencies in Ireland and how it might request information held by law enforcement agencies in other states.  What is absolutely necessary is a discussion from this moment, rather than a day on which the Haass proposals will begin to be implemented, of what precise legislation would be needed here in Ireland, Westminster and Stormont to enable that provision of information in order for these investigations to be effective.  Non-access to intelligence information cannot be the stumbling block every investigation hits at some point.  I encourage members, across the board, to focus on this issue, but it has repeatedly been the obstacle to accountability.</p><p>  The second question was put to us by Deputy Brendan Smith and reiterated by the Vice Chairman.  It concerned our views on an enhanced historical enquiries team, HET, or an HET+.  We have spoken to the Northern policing board about this and, as things stand, have not, to date, seen a proposal for a historical enquiries team that would satisfy international human rights law and standards.  We have not seen such a proposal and none has been put forward.  What was put forward following the latest crisis and the report of Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary was an HET that appeared, on all points, to be less independent than the one before it in terms of its answerability in the chain of command.  This is not a positive development and I cannot say we have seen any proposal for one that might be better, but the historical investigations unit may well offer the way forward in this regard.</p></speech>

The Eames-Bradley recommendation of a &pound;12,000 reconciliation payment was controversial and failed.  As we have not mentioned money or economics today, I think I should throw it into the mix.  Some 3,600 people were killed during the Troubles and 40,000 injured, not to mention those affected psychologically or the relatives of those who were physically hurt or died.  We engage in significant outreach work.  We visit Northern Ireland and have visited east Belfast.  Recently we were in parts of Derry visiting the Nationalist community and have visited Loyalist and Unionist communities in Belfast.  The people are talking about the peace dividend, not necessarily on an individual basis but in communities.  They are asking what has been achieved since 1998, whether there are jobs or extra benefits as a result of the peace process.  What weight does Amnesty International place on the economic dividend for communities?  The committee constantly raises issues about the A5 and Narrow Water bridge projects which would bring tangible economic benefits to regions and generate greater economic and societal prosperity.  What weight does Amnesty International place on the economic dividend as a way of dealing with past neglect in communities that have been hurt and left out of prosperity in the past?  What weight does it place on it, not on an individual level - I do not want go into specific payments such as that included in the Eames-Bradley recommendation - but at the collective level for communities that have lost out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1084" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Corrigan" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600009#L00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for that question.  We make reference to resources and the cost of putting these mechanisms in place and call on the relevant Government authorities, including those in London and Dublin, in addition to Stormont, to deliver adequate resources to ensure we have effective mechanisms that can address what happened in the past in delivering on victims' rights to access truth and justice.  The mechanisms we have in place which are flawed and sometimes fail cost a significant amount.  We believe they should be brought together in a single overarching mechanism as a way of doing the job properly and ensuring the resources being spent on failing initiatives are spent on an effective mechanism.</p><p>  On the wider question of the peace dividend post-1994 or 1998, there has been economic improvement in some respects in Northern Ireland, in addition to the huge gains made owing to the relative lack of violence and disorder compared to the previous period.  However, it is clear from the research that the economic dividend has not been spread equally across all communities in Northern Ireland and that those who were poorest during the period of the conflict and suffered the most violence are still the poorest and in the most deprived regions.</p> <p>There has been a dogged blockage of the transformation of those communities.  We fear that the systems and decision making in terms of resource allocation are still not there yet.  We would argue that a human rights based approach to resource allocation and political decision making in Northern Ireland would be beneficial in the context of addressing the needs of the most deprived communities.  That is why we would advocate the development of a bill of rights, not only in order to address some of the civil and political injustices of the past which persist into the present but also the economic and social rights deprivations from the past which also remain today.  We think there is a very powerful case for putting in place a framework that would assist politicians in making decisions that would improve the lives of the most vulnerable and the poorest in Northern Ireland; not to tie their hands or to make decisions for them but to enable them to make key decisions which are transformative and which will help to embed the peace.  These are interlinked issues and we should not just focus on short term measures and mechanisms or indeed, on the formal mechanisms for addressing the past but try to develop a human rights based society in Northern Ireland which has been lacking in the past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1086" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600010#M00200"><p>I note the emphasis in that last answer on the importance of the bill of rights which, of course, was a key promise of the Agreement.  A number of promises in the Agreement, including those dealing with victims and with the past, have not been properly fulfilled.  In the context of the very strong message that we got from former US President Bill Clinton about finishing the job, it is important to point out that finishing the job does not mean not dealing with the past.  It actually means delivering on the promises made to victims in the Agreement in respect of the past.  It also means the development of a bill of rights, among other measures.  One of the things that struck me about the recent case in London was that the court based its decision primarily on the evidence of Jonathan Powell and Peter Hain to the effect that it would be critical and fundamental if the word of a State official was not upheld, even if that word was in a letter that was issued by mistake or that contained a mistake.  They suggested that the sky would fall in if the promise of the State in a negotiated process was not upheld.  The fact is that the State has made many promises that have not been upheld, including promises to the Finucane family and the to the general public about the conditions and circumstances under which a public inquiry would be held and so forth.  The Hain and Powell evidence also drew on Weston Park quite a bit.  They said that this was agreed by all parties in Weston Park when actually there was no agreement in Weston Park about this or indeed about anything else.  We did get agreed papers from the two Governments after Weston Park to which parties could respond but not all parties agreed with the priorities therein.  It was suggested that there was an all-party agreement and as a result, the State gave its word.  As we heard from Deputy Brendan Smith, there was clearly a united, all-party demand from the D&aacute;il to the British Government but it is not respecting that.  It is a question of double standards where there is an absolute about the word of the State and therefore a promise has to be upheld, even if it was given privately and in an arrangement that was only agreed with one party.  At the same time, elements that are actually part of the Agreement or solemn promises given in the process since the Agreement are not being upheld.  For all of us involved politically in the process, that should be an added consideration, over and above the particular sensitivities that were voiced in the aftermath of the court decision last week.</p></speech>

Clearly, the continuing relative deprivation in the worst affected areas was an important foundational context for the research we undertook.  In that context, we must acknowledge the work of the late Inez McCormack through the Participation and Practice of Rights Project in highlighting that aspect of the failure to come to terms with the past.  As an international human rights group examining the issue of dealing with the past through the lens of the right to effective remedy, I would point the committee to pages 18 and 19 of our full report where we lay out the five recognised forms of reparation that include a range of measures that would allow for the repair of the harm caused to survivors and victims, including individual restitution, compensation and rehabilitation as well as more general societal guarantees of non-repetition or recurrence.  The latter refers to broader societal initiatives, institutional reforms, increasing trust in the rule of law, fostering a society that has greater respect for human rights and restoring public trust in authority.  We are seeing some tangible results in that context, as part of the peace dividend.</p></speech>

That is where the bill of rights becomes fundamentally important.  In this jurisdiction we have just had a debate at the Constitutional Convention on the question of constitutional protection for economic, social and cultural rights.  We argue for that protection because, as Mr. Patrick Corrigan said, it does not bind the hands of governments.  Instead, it provides for an objective framework through which difficult and complex decisions are made about resource allocation, service delivery and guiding principles for social policy; a framework that is transparent, where there is accountability and clarity of responsibility.  In that way, people can have confidence in the decisions made by governments.  It also ensures that governments can make decisions that are outcomes focused, evidence based and so forth.  In the context of the conflict and the view of various communities in Northern Ireland that they have been left behind, it is even more important.  That is why, for us, the bill of rights is so fundamentally important.</p><p>  This research is part of work carried out by Amnesty International at the global level.  My colleagues, Mr. Kartik Raj and Mr. Patrick Corrigan, have been leading this work and have been engaged in Ireland in advocacy and other work following on from the publication of the report.  Looking at it from this part of this island, one of the things that struck me was a comment by Mr. Paul Gallagher who said that there was a feeling that people are waiting for the victims to die out.  We do not have a great history on this island of dealing with our past.  Surely, one of the things we can learn is that when we do not deal with the past, it lives on.  If Mr. Gallagher and other victims eventually die out and we fail to deliver justice, truth and reparation for them, the past will not go away.  These are issues which are cross-generational and which, to make a philosophical point, live in the stones of places.</p><p>  Many of us on this side of the Border will remember that after the Good Friday Agreement, conversations suddenly started about things that happened in earlier generations including, for example, during the Civil War.  I remember growing up in rural Wexford and stories were told but never told about the fact that three Free State soldiers had been shot dead outside what became the back door of the house in which I grew up.  I never heard anything more than the fact that it happened.  We talked about it but did not talk about it.  Then, in 2004, I was contacted by someone who wanted to raise money to erect a memorial to those three soldiers because they had died a bad death.  Gradually that story emerged and came out.  It is extraordinary the things we do not talk about.  There was nobody still alive who was involved in that incident.  </p> <p>This was not something that was dealt with even by the descendants of those individual victims but lived on and resonated within that small community.</p><p> Dealing with the past needs to be victim-centred but we also need to recognise the importance and value of doing it on a much broader scale.  Our focus is on the international human rights law framework and the need for effective justice and reparations for victims of violations, wherever they might be.  In the context of this research, we are looking at mechanisms in Northern Ireland.  All of us need to reflect on the vital importance of learning from the mistakes of failing to deal with the recent past and to think about the level of courage that is required for us to do it better in the future.</p><p> I thank the committee for giving us so much time today.</p></speech>

It is an all-island sporting and voluntary organisation with more than 10,000 registered athletes supported by 25,000 registered and vetted volunteers.  Their activities compliment other services and supports provided by Governments on both sides for the benefit of people with an intellectual disability.  Over a quarter of the population on the island with an intellectual disability have the opportunity to avail of and are participants in the Special Olympics programme.  This makes it the largest programme that caters for and involves persons with an intellectual or learning disability.</p><p>  Special Olympics is most frequently identified for the major events it hosts.  The world games, for example, that we hosted in 2003 spring to mind.  However, the strength of Special Olympics is what it delivers every week in sport and training activities and much more.  It is administered through the five regions - Connacht, Munster, Leinster, Ulster and the greater Dublin area.</p><p>  Special Olympics is a global programme with 220 registered national programmes.  About 2% of the world population with an intellectual disability avails of the programme, while here on the island of Ireland it is 25%.  We have the strongest programme and the highest level of participation, with just under 400 community-based clubs run on a voluntary basis.  It is a multi-sport organisation offering training and competition in 15 Olympic-type sports.  We are always looking to add other sports as resources become available.  Special Olympics is focused on promoting individual integration into local communities and giving as much an opportunity as possible for our athletes to develop and achieve.  It is a professionally run organisation with a strong board and adheres to best practice in codes of governance.  We leverage our volunteers so much.  If a government tried to deliver this programme without the support of such a wide volunteer group, it would be at significant cost.</p><p>  Our programmes recognise a range of issues for people with intellectual disabilities and their families.  Sports provision is key but we are focused on issues such as health promotion and education.  Our vision is simple.  We want to ensure that every person with an intellectual disability or learning difficulty has the opportunity to participate in a community club and achieve life-changing experiences, increased skills, confidence and joy.</p> <p> The Irish Government has provided support over a long period of time and we would not be where we are as an organisation without it.  Since 2008 the core funding we receive from the Irish Government through the Irish Sports Council has been cut from &euro;3 million to &euro;1.2 million.  This represents a 59% cut in core funding.  This reduction, along with the macroeconomic conditions and the difficulty of fund-raising in the current environment, means the programme we offer is not sustainable in the long term and we are significantly dipping into reserves that were built up in better times.</p><p> By contrast, since 2011 the Northern Ireland Executive has provided significant funding and funds 68% of the programme costs of Special Olympics Ireland in Northern Ireland.  Given the contribution Special Olympics makes to State policies on both sides of the Border in respect of sport, health, education, social inclusion and the promotion of volunteering, it is time for the Irish Government to widen the funding base to support SOI, similar to the provision in Northern Ireland.  This will better reflect the role SOI plays in ensuring our athletes with an intellectual disability reach their full potential.</p><p> In this presentation my colleagues will set out how in 2011 they convinced the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the relevant Departments in Northern Ireland that Special Olympics is about much more than just sport and why athletes with an intellectual disability deserved their support.  I introduce Mr. Liam McGarry, who has a sister with an intellectual disability and is a long-time volunteer with Special Olympics, to briefly outline how the case was established for cross-departmental multi-annual funding for Special Olympics in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1097" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam McGarry" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600012#O00200"><p>The focus is on athletes, and rightly so.  However, I will give my experience as a non-athlete.  My sister was born in 1987 with Down's syndrome and that changed things for us.  It was a learning experience and a very beneficial experience.  In 2002 I understood what Special Olympics was for the first time, although I knew my sister, Una, went to gymnastics every Tuesday night.  I went to the Dublin games and began to see the extent of it.  It involves families and volunteers, and I began to see the sense of occasion and the social elements.</p><p>  I went to the Special Olympics World Games as a volunteer.  I was involved in other sports organisations.  Although Belfast played a small part, it was still a key part of the towns programme.  In Belfast we had a team of 400 and it was probably one of the best weeks of my life.  That spirit that was gained there was crucial and it came back again when the Special Olympics National Games came to Belfast in 2006.  That was the first time Belfast has held such a big multi-sport event.  Last year we hosted the World Police and Fire Games.  That was down to the Special Olympics originally creating events there.</p><p>  For the 2006 games we looked for volunteers.  The first time we went for volunteers we had 30 at the event.  We held five events at the City Hall.  At the penultimate event we had to shut the doors of the main room because we had too many people.  At the last event we had to shut the doors of City Hall because there were so many people, building on the goodwill.  There was a momentum there.  After the 2003 games this momentum had been lost.  Some people were keen and got involved in clubs, but the movement in Ulster was very small so there was no model to facilitate all this goodwill.</p><p>  In 2006 we had built up 6,000 volunteers.  There was such goodwill and there is an obvious need - I will not go through the statistics - but there was a need not to let the opportunity go, as we had done in 2003.  There was momentum with Special Olympics Ulster.  It was very clear in Ulster that Special Olympics Ireland was doing a great job at the world games and had a good structure.  As has been mentioned, it is world-class.  Northern Ireland was severely under-represented.  We have this goodwill and these large numbers of volunteers but we need some mechanism to utilise all these strengths.  A strategy was evolved for Special Olympics Ulster to plan how it will work.  This became a plan people could get behind.</p><p>  We started approaching the various governing bodies and it quickly became apparent that this is bigger than sport, with aspects including goodwill, visitors, volunteers and education.  We went to the Department with responsibility for sport initially and, speaking to politicians, there was an opportunity to present to various Ministers.  In a first for Northern Ireland, five Departments came to witness a presentation.  We started in 2007 after the national games.  The presentation to Ministers was in 2008 and in May 2009 we began a business case process.  A business case is a document that allows the Government to fund above a certain amount, and that is standard across all Departments.  Once one Department had taken the lead, it allowed us to create the business case which other Departments would then accept.</p><p>  Further analysis of the business case brought us to 2011, when there was funding.  As with every other aspect of public funding, our business case had to show clear targets, a clear plan and value for money.  Sport had to take the lead, and once the case was proved it went to other Departments for a contribution.  Five Departments decided to contribute on an equal basis.  That model has been in place for four years.</p><p>  I will hand over to my colleague Mr. John McKiernan, who has been involved with Special Olympics since 2006 and is chairperson of Special Olympics Ulster.</p></speech>

It feels a little strange for me to be here because up to approximately a year ago I was a civil servant, a principal officer in the Northern Ireland Civil Service, so I have some sympathy with my colleagues over on this side of the Chamber.  I retired a year ago and that has given me much more time to be involved in Special Olympics.  I got involved in 2006 when the games came to Belfast, as Mr. McGarry said.  In 2007 I started a basketball club in Newtownards.  Since then my wife has become involved as club secretary and my daughter has become involved in a help-the-athlete programme.  It has become a family affair for us.</p><p>  I will talk about the impact the funding has had on Special Olympics in Ulster and how we manage that funding.  I will try not to go into too much detail.  We have an athlete leadership programme.  Special Olympics is not just about sports.  It is about building a better person in the community.  Athlete leadership is about giving them an opportunity to become involved in other things - for example, speaking at public events.  At our AGM in Dublin an athlete does a speech.  Athletes can also get involved in other small committees.  One of the quotes I got from an athlete in conversation was: "I now have the confidence to speak in front of a crowded room.  Before Special Olympics I would never have been able to do this."  That is the difference the athlete leadership programme has made for our athletes.  We also have a families programme and that is very important because Special Olympics is a family.  It is very important that we do what we can for the families.  We run social events for the families and share various things with them.  It is important that families get involved, and they do.  In my club we provide tea, coffee and biscuits for the family members who come along.  Some of them see it as an opportunity for a bit of respite because they can leave their athletes with us in safe hands for an hour or so and go away and do a bit of shopping or whatever.  However, quite a few of them stay and have a cup of tea or coffee and a biscuit.  That gives the parents an opportunity to talk to each other and learn from each other's experiences, something they do not often have the opportunity to do.</p> <p>Families are a very important part of it.  We also have a families representative on the regional committee who can bring forward ideas from the families on developing the programme.  Our volunteers are an important part of what we do.  Mr. McGarry and I are both volunteers.  We are developing our volunteers all the time and we have a huge database of volunteers.  Many volunteers run our clubs and help to run our events.  It is a time commitment.  Some volunteers cannot give up time to run a club every week but they can give up time to run an event on a Saturday.  A number of volunteers are trained in club management.  We have extended the Clubmark NI scheme, which is supported by Sport NI, to the volunteers and we are also extending it to the clubs.  It is a standard they can achieve.</p><p> Since we received our funding 376 volunteers have qualified as coaches through recognised bodies such as Swim Ireland and Basketball Northern Ireland, and we have recruited 450 volunteers which is approximately 150 a year.  We have a volunteer support centre in the Special Olympics Ulster office.  Volunteers come along on a Wednesday or Thursday at whatever time suits and help organise events through making phone calls to other volunteers.  We depend very much on our volunteers and do what we can to bring them to the required standard.</p><p> Education is an important part of what we do.  We have a programme whereby we visit schools to tell people about Special Olympics and what it does and engage with second level pupils some of whom have become volunteers because of the education programme.  We also have 11 clubs which operate within the schools which is great to see.  Towards the end of last year we had an awareness week in which 12 schools took part.  Another important part of education which may not come to mind is we have part of a module on the Police Service of Northern Ireland recruitment course in which we tell new recruits about Special Olympics.  It is not just to tell them Special Olympics exists and what we do; it means when they finish college and become constables on the beat they know something about intellectual disabilities, and if they come across people with intellectual disabilities they are better prepared to deal with the situation.</p><p> A total of 28 clubs are involved in health promotion.  This is more than telling people what they should and should not eat, and there has been much in the news recently about avoiding sugar.  It is also about personal hygiene and looking after eyesight.  When one hears about health promotion one thinks of diets but it is much more than this.  We have planned a number of events to support Team Ulster, which will go to the Limerick games in June, with regard to health promotion and how they can look after themselves.  Two doctors from the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast work with us.  They are doing a study on mental health.  They will attend some of our events and will speak to family members about how to recognise certain conditions in mental health.</p><p> It goes without saying we are developing our clubs.  We have ten new clubs and three more in the pipeline.  We are raising standards through the Clubmark NI process..  It is all about sport and 336 athletes take part in development days.  Not all athletes when they start Special Olympics can immediately play the game and compete.  Some of them have a very low skill level.  We have development days to develop these skills.  We have a motor activities training programme as some athletes cannot even dribble a ball properly.  We get them to sit down to lift beanbags to develop and eye co-ordination.  We develop them from there to a point they can play a game and eventually be part of a team.  This is all very important.</p><p> With regard to events, we have focused on our volunteers and trained them on event management.  We have become more professional about organising events, equipment, signage, training people to use PA systems, and health and safety.  This all came about as a result of the funding we received.  We could not have done much of this without the funding.  Mr. McGarry spoke about how we obtained funding and I want to give a brief overview of how it is managed.  Five departments are involved which come together in the interdepartmental oversight group, which also includes Mr. English, Mr. Cassidy and me from Special Olympics.  We meet twice a year.  The group has set a number of key performance indicators for us and we have been working on them over the three years we have received funding.  I am glad to state that at this point in time all of the indicators are green under the traffic light system.  We had a number of amber indicators, and one or two in the red when we started, but I am glad to say they are now all green.  We are meeting all of our key performance indicators.  These include indicators on the quality of what we do and extending our reach, which is important with regard to the old community divide issue.  We now have clubs in east Belfast which, for an organisation based in Dublin is quite an achievement.  Athletes travel from as far as Letterkenny to Belfast take part in some of our sports.  We have extended the reach quite considerably.</p><p> Other key performance indicators are with regard to families, who are much more involved in what we do, and volunteers, who play a very important part of what we do.  We not alone get young people involved as athletes but also as volunteers through schools.  We also have key performance indicators with regard to the health programme and operating in a safe and secure environment with people who have learning disabilities.</p><p> The funding we received from the departments has allowed us not only to sustain the programme, which we could not have done before, but also to grow it in Ulster.  To give an indication of the level of trust we have, when we started working with the departments they did not know that much about Special Olympics Ireland, what it was and how we manage our finances.  In the initial year of funding we received 40% of the funding up-front after which we received a further 50% and 10% was held back until the end.  At the time Special Olympics was unknown and there was a high risk in the view of the departments.  I am pleased to state we have developed trust and a very good relationship with the departments through the interdepartmental oversight group meetings.  For the year 2014 to 2015 and we have received 90% of our funding up-front and 10% has been held back.  This is an indication of our relationship and the confidence the Departments now has in us and the programme we deliver.  This gives us the ability to plan ahead.  One cannot plan unless one knows one has funding.  It is four year funding and we are able to plan to develop our programme over the four years.  We are very hopeful the departments will extend the funding for a further year and they have asked us to start work on a business case for the next four years.  It all looks as positive as it can be.</p><p> There are huge benefits North and South, not only for Special Olympics but also for other organisations in the communities.  Mr. McGarry mentioned the World Police and Fire Games.  Quite a number of our volunteers also volunteered at the games.  Our athletes carried the torch for the opening ceremony, which was a great PR exercise for us and worked very well.  A film was made following the torch from Dublin through the North where it was handed over to Dame Mary Peters in the arena for the opening ceremony.  There are also benefits for health, education, social development and cross-community issues.  Athletes do not care from where they come from or what they do, they just get on with their sport, which committee members will see if they have an opportunity to visit any of our clubs.</p><p> The athletes tell a far better story than any of us.  They state Special Olympics has changed their lives and given them much more than sport.  They state it has given them confidence and self-belief and moments they will remember forever.</p> <p>One says, "The healthy athlete programme saved my life.  I have become fit and developed true friends".</p><p> Special Olympics is much more than sport and should be recognised for that.  When a parent brought their child along when we started the club, the child hung onto his mother and would not let go of her.  He was very nervous, but he gradually developed and started to take part in basketball.  His mother said to me one night, "Jordan would never have done that before.  I could not get him to do anything at school."  He went to a special needs school and would not do anything else in the school, but the Special Olympics just clicked with him and he got going.  There is an inter-club basketball competition on Saturday in Derry and my team is travelling there to take part in it.  I received a text from that mother recently saying that she and one of her friends had a really difficult decision to make because they had been invited to afternoon tea at the Titanic in Belfast and they had the basketball in Derry on Saturday.  I will leave the committee to think on which they chose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600014#Q00200"><p>I welcome Mr. English and his colleagues and thank them for their detailed presentation.  They outlined a vision - which is not just confined to sport, although that is obviously very important - of the wider benefits that accrue from participation in Special Olympics.  When we think of the Special Olympics, all of us think of the iconic event in Croke Park in 2003 and the huge buy-in and positivity that was generated in towns and villages throughout the island.  If I recall correctly, approximately 30,000 volunteers participated and assisted the participants from 150 countries.  It was a really fabulous time for all of the participants and for all Irish people when the event was hosted here.  However, it is not just about identification with the major events, but the work that goes on each day in so many parishes, towns and villages throughout the country.  The people who are both participating in the sport and helping in a voluntary capacity deserve great credit.</p><p>  Is there good access to public sporting facilities and recreational facilities that are in public ownership or the ownership of other sporting organisations?  The witness mentioned the more challenging environment with regard to raising funds in society generally, and the reduction in the Irish Sports Council grant.  Does Special Olympics Ireland get funding in this State from the local sports partnerships?  They were established five or six years ago on a county basis.</p><p>  The witnesses outlined the broader educational and community remit very well.  The education and training boards have replaced the vocational education committees, VECs.  To my knowledge, over the years the VECs had a sporting and youth grants element in their expenditure each year.  Does Special Olympics Ireland manage to get support from the local sports partnerships, which are under the remit of the local authorities, and from the sporting grants disbursed by the education and training boards?</p><p>  The vision the witnesses outlined is very commendable and I compliment them on their excellent work and the great support they give to so many worthy people throughout this island and, indeed, internationally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2014030600014#Q00300"><p>Like Deputy Smith, I welcome the witnesses and thank them for attending and divulging the excellent work that is done across the island.  It is a great example to have representatives from both Ulster and the South present.  Following the previous debate, it is brilliant to see that the common good is central and that both organisations are working for that.  The reason we are here today is to consider how we can develop that further and how the witnesses believe we can be of benefit in progressing it.</p><p>  It is important to note the difference in the way the organisations are funded in the North and South and the much higher percentage of the funding that is covered in the North compared with the South.  Last year I proposed a motion in the Seanad on the tenth anniversary of the Special Olympics.  As Deputy Smith said, that was a landmark and it is something everybody in the country will always remember.  However, that was ten years ago, and we must look beyond that to the future.  One of the initial subjects we discussed when the witnesses appeared before the committee two years ago was the origin of the funding in the South and the fact that it is directed through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Irish Sports Council.</p><p>  There is a huge need for cross-departmental funding.  It is not simply the responsibility of one Department.  When I put down the motion for debate in the Seanad, there was a discussion as to whether it should be taken by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Health or the Department of Education and Skills.  Everybody debated the issue, but I see this as the responsibility of every Department.  That is an area, Chairman, that I would like the committee to take further if possible.</p><p>  With regard to North-South co-operation, which we are discussing today, and where it can proceed, the Departments involved in the North include the offices of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the Departments of Education, Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Social Development, and Culture, Arts and Leisure.  It is co-ordinated by Sport Northern Ireland.  There are many more Departments involved in it and it is a far wider process.  We should examine that model and try to introduce it here so we can have a similar funding model, given that it is so successful in the North.  Has Mr. English had discussions with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport about spreading the responsibility further and bringing it into the Department of Health?  Have initiatives been made?  I have made representations on it.  What type of reaction or response did he get?  As regards bringing it to the North-South Ministerial Council, I have spoken about this to the T&aacute;naiste, who has voiced his support for it.  How do the witnesses suggest we progress this further?</p><p>  I could speak on this all day.  I have a vested interest in that I was involved with the Special Olympics long before I became a Member of the Seanad, so I can vouch for the excellent work that is done each day and week.  I wish the witnesses every success with the forthcoming national games in Limerick and the world games next year.  I would love to see more coverage of Special Olympics games.  The team last year in the Winter Olympics did exceptional work, but much of that was hidden because there was not the same media coverage as is given to the Olympics.</p><p>  Finally, the one thing that is most common to the North and South is the volunteers.  There is the same amount of effort and dedication North and South of the Border, which shows that the country is united in helping people with a disability.</p></speech>

The Good Friday Agreement, Weston Park and the other agreements were about building an inclusive society, and clearly the work the witnesses are doing is of huge importance in that regard.  We are also talking about building on the full potential of people.</p> <p>The previous speaker referred to cross-departmental funding.  Relying on different Departments creates problems.  I know from experience that many Departments try to direct requests for funding to another Department.  That is the nature of the way things are at present.  The organisation is creating a safe, inclusive environment which will develop friendships and eliminate sectarianism.</p><p> The Government funding of &euro;3 million for Special Olympics Ireland was cut to &euro;1.2 million.  While the organisation has managed, it must have caused major difficulties.  Will Mr. English outline in detail how the cuts have affected its work?  There seems to be a disparity in the funding North and South.</p><p> My memories of the Special Olympics are associated with Nelson Mandela's involvement.  A friend of mine, Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Farrell from Tallaght, who has since died, was involved in Special Olympics Ireland.  One of the proudest days of my life was the fantastic night in Croke Park at the Special Olympics, and those who were there will never forget it for the length of their days.</p><p> I congratulate the team from Special Olympics Ireland on the great work they do.  How do we turn goodwill into action?  How can we as a committee help them in their work?</p></speech>

I can remember coming to Dublin, driving behind a growing phalanx of police motorcycles.  They were not escorting me but I happened to be in the queue of traffic, and as we passed each town more and more cars joined the line of traffic.  They were assisting those who were involved in that spectacular night.  Other speakers have referred to the quality, ethic and strong commitment of the volunteers.  I have seen athletes in the Special Olympics who have gone on to become volunteers, and do so very effectively, during Derry's year as UK City of Culture.  Some of them were ambassadors for the city of culture.  It is clear that these volunteers gained the confidence, experience and social capacity to do that work from their experience at the Special Olympics.  In so many ways the Special Olympics provided not just a physical outlet and pastime for people but was part of their emancipation.  It has equipped and involved them and made them able to represent the civic representatives in different capacities.  That is of major importance.</p><p>  In the run-up to the Special Olympics in 2003, I was the then Minister for Finance and Personnel and was asked if there would be funding from the Northern authorities.  I got into some trouble by more or less pre-indicating that there would be money in the executive programme fund and as far as I was concerned at least &euro;1 million would be allocated to the Special Olympics.  The good thing was that we were able to make commitments at that stage at the level of the Executive rather than waiting for an allocation from various Departments.  A few years ago, I spoke on the case for funding on the Northern side for the current phase.  The discussion was on how to frame the task and Special Olympics Ireland answered that very much by framing the offer to the various Departments, avoiding the problem of having to busk around the different Departments hoping to catch a bit of money here, a wee bit there and a bit of slippage somewhere else.  The idea of having pre-agreement on the contributors to the basket is a very important model.  I think many others will be jealous, not just in this House but also in the North.  It is not easy to get cross-departmental funding.  In this case, the worth of the work the Special Olympics is able to do and the outcomes it is able to show is compelling and is in the policy interests of so many different Departments.</p></speech>

I understand that funding from Northern Ireland amounted to &pound;2.5 million over the four-year period, equating to &pound;625,000 per annum.  I understand that funding from the Government in the Republic has increased this year from &euro;1.2 million to &euro;1.4 million.  Is that correct?</p><p>  In terms of the reserves of Special Olympics Ireland, is there a large reserve in place, or are there financial difficulties?  The cross-Border element is very important to me as I am a Deputy for Monaghan.  Can the chairman of the Ulster Special Olympics, Mr. John McKernan, expand into Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal, as is the case with Ulster Rugby and various other organisations, or are these Ulster counties dependent on the input from Special Olympics Ireland?  It was mentioned that clubs from Letterkenny go to Belfast; does Special Olympics in Ulster have an outreach programme in the Border counties?</p></speech>

I too am interested in the response to Deputy Conlan's question on Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.  Are these counties in Ulster or not in Ulster?  I would appreciate specific clarification.</p></speech>

Deputy Smith raised the use of facilities.  We are very fortunate that we do not invest in capital facilities outside the programme.  We get to utilise local facilities in the community, North and South.  Some of the clubs may pay a small charge for the use of the facilities but, by and large, when we host area, regional or national events the charge is heavily discounted when we pay for the use of the facilities.</p><p>  The local sports partnerships work very closely in developing the programme with our regional development officers.  They may give funding to local clubs such as the GAA or the rugby club when they are raising money for their own local clubs.  That is very well integrated.  </p><p>  Special Olympics Ireland must always look at the opportunity to apply for grants.  To paraphrase Mark Durkan, MP, we have to busk around.  That is not ideal because we would prefer to put our energy into the delivery of the programme rather than continually looking for small pockets of funds here and there.  We must, however, do that.</p><p>  Senator Moran raised the issue of multi-departmental funding.  Again, the model has worked so well in Northern Ireland.  We recognise that we deal with the lead Department in this regard, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.  The other Departments effectively channel the funding through the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure because they recognise that we deliver much more than sport.</p> <p>We are always reaching out - as we have done through Senator Moran, who has been a great advocate for Special Olympics Ireland - through this opportunity and other opportunities in various forums to explain that we need funding from other Departments.  We are constantly reaching out in that regard.  We simply do not get enough coverage, particularly with the national games due to take place in June.  Any help we can get in that regard is really important. </p><p> With regard to reserves and funding, the Northern Ireland Executive has given a four-year commitment of &pound;2.3 million, which works out at over &pound;600,000 per annum.  Costs vary from year to year because the cost base moves up and down.  The core funding comes from the Irish Sport Council and amounts to &euro;1.2 million.  We have been given an additional allocation of &euro;200,000 towards the cost of the Ireland games, which is an additional cost.  The Ireland games will cost roughly &euro;2 million in total, so the council has contributed 10% to the additional cost of hosting the games.</p><p> The organisation is fortunate to have reserves due to years of good management, but that reserve has been depleted by under &euro;1 million in 2012.  We are currently preparing the draft accounts for 2013 and expect, based on estimates, that the reserves will be depleted by a further &euro;1 million.  The accounts are available on our website and the reserve is quoted.  The board of Special Olympics Ireland wants us to retain one year's costs in reserve.  We work in a four-year programme so we have already committed to sending athletes to the world games in Los Angeles next year.  The current reserves are equivalent to the cost of running the programme for one year, but we make strategic decisions all the time.  Therefore, we always reach out to ensure that we can sustain the programme and continue to expand it, because there is definite demand from stakeholders to do so. </p><p> The board is in the process of conducting a review of the organisation because the current cost base will have to downsize unless we get further funding in the medium term.  Downsizing will have a significant impact across a range of levels, including our ability to reach out, open new clubs and deliver the help programme and the athlete leadership programme that Mr. McKernan spoke about.  Mr. Mark Durkan, MP, mentioned the athlete volunteer programme, which is a great development.  It would not have been possible without investment in an athlete leadership programme.  Those are benefits which are outside the core area of sport.  We simply will not be able to give energy and time to those benefits if we do not have funding.</p><p> I am not sure if I have dealt will all of the queries raised.  Deputy Crowe also mentioned reserves and restructuring.  I wish to refer to a relevant point he raised about multi-departmental funding.  Such funding is a challenge and adds extra administration.  The Northern Ireland Executive has got around the problem by having its Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure as the lead agent.  It is really about Departments recognising that they have an obligation to support what is delivered by the Special Olympics programme and assessing how to make the processes as efficient as possible for everyone involved.</p><p> I shall hand over to Mr. McKernan regarding other elements.</p></speech>

We support the Ulster programme across the nine counties and we have 1,300 volunteers and 15 clubs that span the three counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan.  All of the programmes and benefits from the funding, including Sport Northern Ireland, coach education and courses for volunteers, take place on a Ulster-wide basis.  We do not differentiate between the Six Counties and the three counties.</p></speech>

I thank all of them for attending.  The purpose of the meeting is to hear from the Minister and the chief medical officer in the light of the report on perinatal deaths at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  The committee has been concerned about this issue and we agree that the revelations in the report are shocking.  The report which was commissioned by the Minister and carried out by Dr. Holohan has many sobering statistics and interesting observations to make.  I hope all committee members will join me in congratulating the families on their bravery, in sympathising with them on their loss and hoping the report will in some way allow for a new and better day for many families as a result of what will happen not just in this hospital but others also.</p><p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I will keep my introductory statement as brief as possible and will be happy to reply to comments and questions.  As the Chairman pointed out, we are joined by the chief medical officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and the chief of the clinical effectiveness unit, Ms Kathleen MacLellan, not to mention our other friends from the HSE, Ms Laverne McGuinness, Mr. Ian Carter and Mr. David Walsh.</p><p>  I reiterate my thanks, as the Chairman has done, to the families concerned who, in the face of their individual tragedies, had the courage and tenacity to ensure their babies&rsquo; stories were heard.  I assure them that we have listened and learned and are fully committed to embedding that learning in all health services.  Families and patients at Portlaoise hospital maternity services, PHMS, were not treated with an acceptable level of care, compassion and respect.  I was so distressed by the experiences of the families I had met that I immediately requested the chief medical officer to conduct a review of safety at PHMS.  This review was completed in three weeks and highlighted some critical issues for the health service.</p><p>  The chief medical officer&rsquo;s report is far-reaching.  It makes 11 overall and 42 specific recommendations, all of which I have accepted.  It not only sets out the immediate requirements for assuring safety for women attending PHMS but it also provides the strategic direction for maternity services in Ireland generally.  Clear failures were identified in this preliminary risk and patient safety assessment of PHMS.  This conclusion is drawn from Portlaoise hospital&rsquo;s own assessment of its risk management processes; current risk management arrangements in place; monitoring of the implementation of recommendations in various investigations of adverse events in Portlaoise hospital; and findings made by the chief medical officer regarding patient safety and care.  These failures were at both local and national level.</p><p>  The critical initial question which the report addresses is whether the service provided by PHMS can be considered safe now and into the future, given the events reported in public and Portlaoise hospital&rsquo;s response to them.  I understand the significance of these patient safety failures and I am clear about the next steps that need to be taken.  I have decided on a twin-track approach, providing specific directions and requests for both HIQA and the HSE.  In addition, I will be requiring a number of assurances from my Department.</p><p>  I reiterate a statement that I made to the families and the public last Friday.  Portlaoise hospital maternity services could not be regarded as safe and sustainable within the existing governance arrangements, as they lacked many of the important criteria required to deliver, on a stand-alone basis, a safe and sustainable maternity service.  On this basis and with immediate effect, I requested the HSE last Friday, 28 February, to put in place a transition team to assume control of the maternity service at Portlaoise hospital.  This team, consisting of appropriate clinical and managerial expertise, will oversee the planning and execution of an orderly integration of PHMS within a managed clinical network under a singular governance model with Coombe Women and Infant University Hospital.</p> <p>The HSE responded to my request immediately and a new general manager and director of midwifery were appointed to the hospital the same day.  This interim management team will remain in place until a new governance arrangement is put in place for PHMS.  Dialogue has also commenced with the Coombe Women and Infant University Hospital about how best to provide support to PHMS in a collaborative working arrangement into the future.  I met some members of the board yesterday.  Furthermore, I have requested the HSE to conduct a review of PHMS in respect of services for the infant and the family following a perinatal death. </p><p> The HSE must ensure effective systems are in place, including the provision of training where necessary, to ensure senior clinicians are competent to take responsibility for dealing with serious adverse events when they occur, including dealing appropriately with patients in such circumstances.  The chief medical officer&rsquo;s findings cannot be restricted to the maternity services at Portlaoise hospital; there are also ramifications for other services at the hospital and, to this end, I have requested the HSE to address the implications of this report for these services.  In addition, I have asked that the HSE also look at other similar sized maternity services around the country and consider their incorporation into managed clinical networks within their relevant hospital group.</p><p> The HSE is about to commence a midwifery workload and workforce review in maternity services in Ireland.  This project has been jointly commissioned by the HSE office of nursing and midwifery services director and the joint standing maternity committee of the Dublin maternity hospitals with the approval of the director of the HSE&rsquo;s obstetrics and gynaecology programme, national director clinical strategy and programmes division, national director of quality and patient safety and the support of the chief nursing officer in the Department of Health.</p><p> The failures identified in this report were at both local and national level.  I am acutely conscious that there is enormous pressure on the staff of the PHMS and of the need to rebuild their morale and confidence so that they can rise to the challenge of providing a safe and quality service.  I have, therefore, requested the HSE to provide support to the Portlaoise hospital senior management team.  This should lead to a wider programme of support for front-line leaders, particularly in smaller hospitals, to ensure they can, and do, provide safe and effective care.  I want the HSE to ensure, in the first instance, every maternity service, and, thereafter, every health care service provider, is required to complete a patient safety statement, which is published and updated monthly.  The statement will include information such as birth rates, adverse events and others and should be a requirement of hospital licensing. </p><p> However, this is not enough.  I consider that a thorough investigation is required and in accordance with section 9(2) of the Health Act 2007, I have directed HIQA to undertake an immediate investigation of PHMS and to report to me by the end of 2014.  I anticipate that many of the as yet unanswered questions will be addressed in the course of the HIQA investigation.</p><p> A culture of quality and of safe care is one in which there is open, kind, transparent, compassionate and sensitive care, effective team communications and a commitment to prevention of harm.  A positive patient safety culture is focused on enhancing every aspect of the experience of a patient.  It is well established in evidence that culture and behaviour are critical components of safe and effective care.  To this end, I have requested that HIQA should also conduct an immediate assessment of the patient safety culture at Portlaoise hospital.  I have also requested HIQA to adopt a standard tool for the assessment of patient safety culture and team working and to use its independent monitoring role to ensure it is implemented throughout the health care system.</p><p> In addition, I have asked HIQA to develop national standards for the conduct of reviews of adverse incidents.  In this context, I have also requested that the HSE should issue a directive to all providers to require them to notify the director of quality and patient safety and HIQA of all "never events".  In this case "never events" will include perinatal deaths from low risk pregnancies.  A "never event" by its nature cannot always be prevented, but the very fact that it happens should mean an urgent examination by the hospital in question of all its systems.  My Department will, through the forthcoming health information Bill, make the notification of "never events" a mandatory requirement. </p><p> An outline of the patient safety risk profile of hospitals in general and for PHMS specifically was not available in the preparation of this report.  The requirement to pool information that may exist across agencies to create better risk and safety profiling of services is a critical gap in our patient safety functions nationally.  To this end, I have recommended the establishment of a national patient safety surveillance system by HIQA.  HIQA will use this information for risk stratification and guiding the targeting of their standards monitoring programme.  My Department will examine any amendments to the Health Act 2007 that may be required. </p><p> A broader finding identified in this report was the systematic under-reporting of perinatal deaths due to inconsistencies in Ireland's perinatal data collection.  Specifically, this requires a single definition of a perinatal death for the Irish system.  This will require changes to the Civil Registration Act 2004 and in this regard, my Department will work closely with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that all official perinatal mortality rates are calculated using a common definition.  I have asked my Department to immediately actively pursue all actions identified for it in this report.  I will require regular patient safety assurance reports from both the HSE and HIQA to inform me of the progress on the implementation of all recommendations in this and all other reports.  I will not tolerate any delays in progressing the critical patient safety issues that have been identified.</p><p> The report into perinatal deaths at the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise is far reaching.  It not only sets out the immediate requirements for assuring safety for women attending PHMS but also provides strategic direction for maternity services in Ireland generally.  The report will not only inform, but underpin the planned development of a national maternity service strategy which will be delivered this year.  This strategy will provide the strategic direction for the optimal development of our maternity services to ensure all women have access to safe, high quality maternity care in a setting most appropriate to their needs and it is my intention to publish the strategy this year.  We need to learn from past mistakes and move on to rebuild confidence in the safety of our maternity services.  The new strategy will determine the future model of our maternity services to ensure they are fit for purpose and in accordance with best available national and international evidence.</p><p> The report shows that the planned patient safety agency, PSA, has a vital place in our health service, which is why it is included in this year&rsquo;s HSE service plan.  The agency will be established shortly and applications for a chief executive officer will be invited.  The PSA will be a "patients&rsquo; champion" supporting patients to ensure they receive an appropriate response to the safety issues they raise.  The PSA will also promote and disseminate learning on how we can build and enhance a safety culture in all our health care services.</p><p> As Minister, I am acutely conscious of the importance of patient safety.  The stories of babies Katelyn Keenan, Joshua Keyes-Cornally, Mark Molloy and Nathan Molyneaux made a significant impression on me and I am sure everybody present.  I would like once again thank their parents Sharon, Thomas, Natasha, Shauna, Joey, Roisin and Mark who brought the serious failures identified in this report to light.  I listened to the parents when they said they wanted their local services to be safe and I assure them and other parents that the Department, HSE and I will do everything within my remit as Minister to ensure every step is taken to prevent such events occurring in the future. </p><p> I will hand over to Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer of my Department who will give a brief presentation and overview of the report he prepared on the perinatal deaths at Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise.  I would like to express my thanks to the Chairman and the committee members for listening.</p></speech>

The Minister has covered some of the ground and, therefore, I will try to be as brief as I can.  The report is set out in a number of sections and it is not available on the Department's website.  I have one or two hard copies but I believe copies have been distributed to members.</p> <p> The report outlines the background, the methodology we used, describes the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, maternity service and sets out our analysis under two headings: first, quantitative findings which are set out in section 4; and, second, qualitative findings which are set out under seven themes in section 5.  It then sets out some overall conclusions and recommendations.  There are 42 recommendations throughout the report regarding the section 4 quantitative findings and the section 5 qualitative findings.  They are summarised in a sense by the 11 overall recommendations.  It is important that all of the recommendations be taken together.  We are all aware of the context.  </p><p> Moving on to the section on methodology, the key question we set for ourselves to try to address and the one which was on everybody's lips was: was the service safe?  While we could not answer that question in an absolute sense, we set out to examine the extent to which there was verifiable implementation of the recommendations from the investigations the hospital had conducted into its own declared incidents over a number of years and other relevant national policies.  The further along we could say it was in verifiable implementation of these matters, the more satisfied we could be about safety on a continuing basis.  That was the approach we took.</p><p> We had meetings with a number of organisations as set out in detail in the report in one of the tables in the section on methodology.  We met a number of national organisations, including the Medical Council, HIQA, the State Claims Agency and An Bord Altranais.  We met representatives of a number of sections within the HSE.  In particular, we met representatives of the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, on three separate occasions, over eight to nine hours in total.  We were facilitated significantly by Mr. David Walsh who is present.  If it were not for his involvement, we would not have been able to gain access to the information and the response as quickly as we were.  We would not have had the report as quickly.</p><p> We requested a considerable amount of data from the hospital to give us the basis for some of what we set out in the report.  We received all of it in a timely fashion.  We also made an examination of national perinatal mortality reporting systems and took a walk around the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, which I had never seen previously.  I will not spend too long describing the services at the hospital, as I imagine members are quite familiar with it and its services.  It is a three-consultant service.  It is not a training location for the SPR programme in obstetrics and gynaecology or for midwives.  It has an agency dependency level of 25% for both medical and nursing staff and, as I will cover, a high vacancy rate, particularly in leadership positions for midwifery.</p><p> The slide on section 4 presents national birth numbers.  They show a significant increase in national birth numbers between 2000 and the present, in particular between 2000 and 2007.  During that time period there was an increase of approximately 30% in the total number of births.  It was particularly acute in a two year period when it increased by 17% nationally.  The picture in Portlaoise is quite different, with a much more significant increase in the total number of births.  In the seven years to 2007, the hospital experienced an increase of approximately 100% in the total number of births, with 50% of that increase occurring in a two year period between 2005 and 2007.  That is an interesting and relevant finding.</p><p> The next slide shows some of the analytical work we did on the numbers of perinatal deaths at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, as derived from its own direct account, from what the national perinatal reporting system states about it and from what the National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre system states about it.  Let me take one minute to explain.  There are a number of reporting and data collection systems relating to perinatal events, both mortality and morbidity.  We have the national perinatal reporting system which was compiled, managed and reported on by the ESRI until the recent health reform changes resulted in that function moving from the ESRI to the HSE.  Another is the relatively recently established National Perinatal Epidemiology Centre under the direction of Professor Richard Greene in Cork which gathers its data directly from the individual hospitals and makes reports on both maternal mortality and morbidity rates.  We have the General Register Office under the auspices of the Department of Social Protection and he CSO that makes reports in the form of vital statistics.  Between each of these systems we see some inconsistencies in reporting and some systematic errors in reporting such that we believe there is an under-reporting of total perinatal mortality rates.  It is not sufficiently significant to change our overall ranking on an international basis in terms of how we fare relative to other countries, but it is significant in so far as we believe the correct and absolute measure, the one set out in blue on the slide, would the highest.  That is the one we believe would be the best and the one to which the report recommends moving towards.</p><p> We are recommending that each national reporting system report on essentially the same definition.  That will require changes to the existing definitions set out in the Civil Registration Act and we are in discussions with the Department of Social Protection on the matter.  It will also require some consolidation of both the NPEC in Cork and the NPRS that has come into the HSE from the ESRI.  They are two broadly similar systems, collecting similar data and reporting differently.  There is room, not just from the point of view of commonality of reporting but also from the point of view of avoiding duplication and the obvious difficulty that arises when two systems give two slightly different answers to the same question.  It also reduces the workload for staff on the ground having to report to different systems.  Therefore, we have made specific recommendations in that regard.</p><p> On the available data we sought and received from the hospital, the next slide shows the numbers of transfers per 1,000 births.  These data given to us from the hospital show both paediatric, that is, neonatal, and maternal transfers to other centres, mostly in the Dublin region in the perinatal period.  We can see the number increased significantly over time.  The increase is not explained by the number of births because these figures are per 1,000 births.  That is a relevant finding.</p><p> The next slide shows information we received from the hospital on adverse incident reports.  Members may be aware that the State Claims Agency requires that each adverse incident that occurs in the health service be reported to it and it compiles and collates the data.  We sought all reports from 2006 reported by the hospital.  We have set out a graph showing that, overall, it follows the same trend that we can see regarding transfers.  Something unusual and different was happening in 2007, which explains that peak and I am happy to talk about it during members' questions, if they so wish.</p><p> Figure 4.6 on the same slide shows the number of claims per 1,000 births for the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, as compared with the average for six similarly sized units in the country.  We can see that over the period of time there was a higher number of claims.  Overall, the number of claims is not very large - one would not necessarily expect it to be, but there is a significant difference between the two.  There would be a lag time in the reporting because of the nature of claims and when they are submitted.  That might explain some of the tail-off shown in the graph.</p><p> The other thing which is not set out in the slide on which we have reported in the report in the area of quantitative data is the concept the Minister mentioned of "never events".  There is a listing which is contained in our forthcoming health information Bill - it is the subject of a recommendation in the report.  We know that six such events took place over the time period, four of which related to deaths or significant perinatal injuries that resulted ultimately in the deaths of babies who were essentially normally formed in low-risk pregnancies.  There were two others that related to retention of foreign bodies following surgical procedures in that unit over the time period.  This is set out in the report.  The nature of what is a "never event" and the discipline of patient safety internationally suggests each of these events needs to be treated as though it should not have happened.  It is the opportunity to stop and re-examine all procedures to ensure it never happens again.</p><p> The qualitative findings are set out in some detail in the report and we have organised them under seven themes, the first of which we deal with is that of patient-centredness.  We dealt first with the culture at the hospital.  We talked to the families at some length.  We met them on a number of occasions through the conduct of this work, as well as at the beginning, with the Minister.  Their powerful testimony of their treatment - the things said to them, the behaviour of staff, the interaction of staff with them and each other - and some of the things we heard from staff give us considerable cause for concern about the nature of the culture in the unit.</p><p> Members will see much in the literature about the importance of culture in health services and its ability to shape the safety of the service people are receiving.  There are ways in which culture can be measured and there are tools that can be used to assess it.</p> <p>It is important for services to be aware of the culture from a patient safety point of view as it has a big impact on the quality and safety of the service people receive.  We have made a specific recommendation, as the Minister stated, on the need for HIQA to conduct an assessment of the culture in the remainder of the hospital.  Some of the services dealing with perinatal deaths, in other words, dealing with the family after a death had occurred and dealing with the infant who had died, fell very far short of a reasonable standard of care.  This was down to issues as important as the ability to hold or interact with infants after they had died to dress and wash them.  This added significantly to the grief of the families and their inability to reach a point of closure on what had happened.  Some of this was among the most harrowing evidence we heard about the service.</p><p> With regard to the response to patients and families following adverse events, without going on at length about it, we see this as an opportunity for senior clinicians and nursing staff to step up and take additional responsibility in circumstances where something unforeseeable has gone wrong.  In these situations families were left significantly on their own in the hands of risk managers not involved in clinical care for the purpose of conducting investigations.  Families had questions which were not addressed or answered.  At the very moment when senior staff were needed most they were absent in some of the incidents.</p><p> With regard to open disclosure, we know from the original programme aired that a number of families were not, even until the programme aired, told about significant adverse events they or their babies had experienced.  This is not consistent with the HSE's open disclosure policy, to say the very least.  We have examined the HSE's open disclosure policy through the lens of what we have seen and it is a very good policy which stands up.  The issue is to ensure it is appropriately and consistently implemented.</p><p> Clinical governance describes the arrangements in place for risk management, identifying adverse incidents and appropriately investigating them.  Suffice it to say, the extent to which good risk management and adverse incident investigation practices were applied was highly variable.  The quality of incident reports completed was highly variable.  In some cases, the investigation of incidents did not start until a significant period of time after the incident had taken place, which creates a challenge in making findings on the basis that staff would not clearly remember what had happened.  We make recommendations on the need to develop national standards and for HIQA to have national standards for the conduct of investigations.  Desktop reviews or more significant investigations differ in their purpose and the period of time within which they must be completed.  These will be the subject of the standards we recommend.</p><p> The systems in place to provide proper verifiable assurance on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the reports were weak.  We believe this explains why many of the same recommendations came up in the hospital's reports without any audit-type information to examine the extent to which they had been implemented.  Issues and themes which are set out in the report came up as explaining recurring events and this suggests a weakness in the arrangements and procedures.</p><p> Clinical effectiveness relates to clinical guidelines, clinical standards and audit arrangements.  Following the HIQA report on the death of Savita Halappanavar, work has started on clinical practice guidance on clinical handovers and the escalation of care to complement much of what has already happened with regard to early warning scores for maternity services and adult and paediatric services.  We have made an additional recommendation arising from the recurrence of concerns about the use of oxytocin in the hospital's investigations.  We have not second-guessed this finding.  We need a national standard on the induction of labour which may include a protocol on the use of oxytocin.</p><p> With regard to the escalation of incidents and the role of the HSE, we reflected on the system put in place following what had happened in Portlaoise in 2007.  A significant number of missed breast cancer diagnoses had been uncovered as result of an investigation at the time.  The system enabled reporting to take place from local to national level, but this requires the local level to realise there was a difficulty.  Other than one individual case, we have not been able to find any other escalation of incidents.  The hospital did not know it had a difficulty.  This is a passive system of reporting.  Beyond this, it appears no other system has been in place since 2007 to detect problems or monitor the extent to which there are ongoing difficulties in the unit.</p><p> A number of specific recommendations are made on leadership, staffing and workforce planning.  The importance of leadership is recognised from a clinical and midwifery point of view in the delivery of a safe and sustainable service.  There are a number of leadership positions in the midwifery unit, the most senior of which is the CNM3 post, a clinical nurse management post, which was approved in 2007 and has never been filled.  A CNM2 post has also been vacant for a period of time due to long-standing sick leave and of seven shift leader positions, clinical supervisory positions in midwifery, only one is filled on a permanent basis.  This leads us to conclude the officer corps of the midwifery service was largely missing during the time period.  This is relevant in the context of some of the hospital's own reports which identified difficulties with clinical supervision during the time period.</p><p> We examined a number of issues with regard to infrastructure and equipment.  We examined the capital facility, in which we are not experts by any stretch, and identified a challenge posed by the fact that the operating theatre and labour ward are on different floors.  This is particularly the case in situations where significant foetal distress requires an emergency Caesarean section.  It requires the unit to have arrangements in place to practise evacuation procedures to ensure patients are brought to the operating theatre in a short period of time.  It requires teams to put in place arrangements to practise these evacuations.  This evacuation is not subject to practise but should be, given the infrastructural deficit.  </p><p> Another dimension is hospital records.  We have made recommendations to ensure implementation of the HSE's national chart and maternity record arrangements.</p><p> We heard much about medical devices from families, in particular about deficiencies as they saw them in the way in which equipment was used or the response to alarms on individual machines.  We do not doubt any of what we have heard.  We do not pass judgment and are not in a position to validate any of it, but we have made a recommendation on national medical devices standards and for assurance to be provided by the HSE for the Department on this issue.</p><p> With regard to legal and ethical issues, the coroner process formed a significant element of what families stated to us.  The adversarial nature of the process was a big challenge for them.  They found that it added to their grief and commented on the extent to which there was significant representation on the service side relative to their own.  From our point of view, without any criticism of any individual coroner, the coroner system is operated through local authorities.  Reports are collated and collected in local authority offices for the most part.  Perhaps the extent to which intelligence is derived from each of these by analysing them at national level to try to identify patterns is more limited than it should be.  We have started a discussion with the Department of Justice and Equality on this issue.  It is already working on updating a draft 2007 Bill to update the Coroners Act 1962, to which an amendment was made in 2005.</p><p> Two other issues we dealt with are consent and confidentiality.  Without going on at length about them, some of the dimensions of informed consent, a continuing challenge for health services generally, were deficient.</p> <p>Without breaking confidences, one of the families we dealt with was under the impression that, as its members entered the operating theatre for an emergency caesarean section, they were signing a waiver, not a consent form.  Until we were in a position to correct them, they continued in that belief for a number of years.</p><p> The other issue is that of confidentiality, in respect of which we have some findings or recommendations.</p><p> The Minister has covered a number of the conclusions, but I will read them as they are set out in the report's summary, section 6.  We set out six overall conclusions that relate to the families first, then the service and finally the oversight.  Two conclusions relate to each.</p><p> Families and patients were treated in a poor and, at times, appalling manner with limited respect, courtesy and consideration.  Information that should have been given to families was withheld for no justifiable reason.</p><p> Regarding the service, poor outcomes that could likely have been prevented were identified and known by the hospital but not adequately and satisfactorily acted upon.  We concluded that the service could not be regarded as safe and sustainable within its current governance arrangements, as it lacked many of the important criteria that were required to deliver, on a stand-alone basis, a safe and sustainable maternity service.</p><p> In terms of oversight, many organisations, including the service itself, had partial information regarding its safety that could have led to earlier intervention had that information been brought together.  The external support and oversight from the HSE should have been stronger and more proactive, given the issues identified in 2007.</p><p> We have set out 11 overall recommendations, which are described over the course of three slides.  Since the Minister has covered a number of them, perhaps it would be best if, instead of my reading them all out, members peruse them.  I am happy to take questions on them and to explain the background rationale, if doing so would be of interest.</p><p> I do not propose to go into detail on the legislative and policy implications, but this report and its findings will have some implications for our ongoing work in both regards.  Some examples are set out in the final two slides.  In the interests of time, I will conclude now.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laverne McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014030600007#G00300"><p>I thank the committee for its invitation to attend this meeting.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Ian Carter, national director of acute hospital services, and Mr. David Walsh, regional director for performance and integration in Dublin-mid-Leinster.</p><p>  The HSE welcomes in full the findings and recommendations of the report of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, Dr. Tony Holohan, regarding perinatal deaths and related matters in Portlaoise hospital's maternity services from 2006 to the present.  As members will be aware, the CMO prepared this report at the request of the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  It recognises clear failures in how risk and patient safety were managed in Portlaoise hospital during the period in question.  It concludes that, under the previous governance arrangements, the maternity services could not be considered safe and sustainable.  A new management team was put in place last Friday to address this matter.</p><p>  The HSE accepts that there were significant shortcomings in the cases referred to in the report, particularly regarding the level and quality of care afforded to the patients in question and to the substandard communications with their families.  The staff of Portlaoise hospital apologised unreservedly to any family that experienced care below the expected standard in the past number of years.  On behalf of the HSE, I wish to repeat this unreserved apology for the failings in the care outcomes experienced by the families concerned and for failing to ensure that prompt incident investigations were undertaken.  I also wish to apologise unreservedly for the unacceptable communications with the families at a time when they most needed honesty, compassion and kindness.  The fact that timely investigations did not happen is unacceptable.</p><p>  The report makes 11 summary recommendations and Mr. Carter has overall responsibility for their implementation.  Three relate to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and eight to the HSE.  Steps have already been taken by the HSE to implement these eight, with three already implemented.  Work has commenced to progress the other five.  The HSE welcomes the involvement of HIQA in respect of three of the recommendations and looks forward to its input.</p><p>  A new management team was appointed last Friday on an interim basis in order to run the service.  This team consists of Mr. Michael Knowles, who has taken up the position of general manager at the hospital.  Previously, he was general manager in Naas General Hospital.  Ms Angela Dunne takes up the post of director of midwifery.  She was previously the assistant director of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.  This management team will remain until a new governance arrangement is put in place.  Dialogue has already commenced with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital in order to provide support to Portlaoise in a collaborative working arrangement for the future.  The new governance arrangements will bring the appropriate vigour to maternity services in Portlaoise hospital.  This is essential to restore quickly any loss of confidence that has arisen among mothers, fathers, families and the wider community that it serves.</p><p>  The report concludes that families and patients were treated in a poor and, at times, appalling manner with limited respect, kindness, courtesy and consideration.  The director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, has recently written to all staff within the health services highlighting the importance of honestly communicating with patients and families.  In his letter, he wrote that communication failures, such as those experienced by the families referenced in the report, "erodes public confidence in Health Services, lets down the public and lets down the service as a whole".  He asked all staff to address together the fundamental issues of culture that lead to such communication failures.  In this regard, the HSE has recently published its policy on open disclosure.  The policy ensures that services embrace and support an open, timely and consistent approach to communicating with service users and their families when things go wrong in health care.</p><p>  The HSE shares the concern of the CMO regarding the promptness of incident investigation.  An incident management policy, which is currently being updated by the HSE's quality and safety directorate, intends to reinforce the importance of speedy incident investigations.  Furthermore, the HSE is conducting its own review into many of the concerns detailed in the report.  While we await completion of that review, the HSE wishes to make it clear that it will take appropriate disciplinary action against staff members should the review deem that such action is warranted.</p><p>  This report has revealed unacceptable failings.  I reassure the committee and the community served by Portlaoise hospital that we will work with the new management and staff to ensure that these failings do not recur.  This concludes my opening statement and, together with my colleagues, I will take any question members may have.</p></speech>

I wish to bring to members' attention the fact that Mr. O'Brien was invited but, unfortunately, could not attend.  He has sent his apologies, but he has had a long-standing work commitment to a trip outside the country.  This is why Ms McGuinness is attending.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014030600007#G00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending and for their presentations on the report.  I compliment Dr. Holohan on his report and on his professional handling of same.  I also compliment the Minister on meeting the families.  It showed that what is often lacking for families in a time of crisis is a human face.  The families appreciated it.</p><p>  This is just the initiation of a longer and more in-depth review by HIQA.  Although we will await the outcome of that report, there were clearly difficulties in Portlaoise hospital.  For example, misdiagnoses in the context of breast cancer screening had already been identified.  Since 2007, the HSE had been concerned.  Dr. Holohan's report points out that other organisations were aware of difficulties within the hospital and that, if the information had been collated, alarm bells might have rang sooner, preventing some outcomes.  We will never know.  What are those organisations?  Are they the HSE, worker representative bodies, clinical professional organisations and so on?</p><p>  When launching the report in Portlaoise and meeting the families, Dr. Holohan stated that the number of staff was not specifically the issue of concern.</p> <p>Even though there may not have been staffing problems on the day in question, given the increase in the number of births at the hospital over a sustained period, staff are under pressure all of the time.  This suggests that corners start to get frayed, shortcuts are taken and management is challenged.  It is a concern if clinicians do not have the time to question and to fill in their reports properly.  There appears to be a problem with reportage.</p><p> One must conclude that, on the clinical side, people were beginning to indicate that there had been problems with patient safety in the maternity services for some time.  From what I can gather from discussions with people involved in the hospital, concerns were relayed by nurses and front-line staff to management several times.  That they brought them to local politicians as well is a written fact.  While we must hold to account those who should be accountable, it seems that the maternity service was almost operating in isolation of managerial oversight.  Will the witnesses comment on this point?</p><p> Committee members met the families and saw their emotion at the report's publication in Portlaoise.  They were treated in an appalling manner.  That such a thing could happen is incomprehensible on a level of basic human compassion and kindness.  If a system becomes reactive, insular and sensitive when families face these circumstances, it must be changed.</p><p> Was the culture of a lack of openness and co-operation ingrained in all of the staff or just some management?  How did it come about?  Is it in other maternity hospitals and the health service in general?  We have discussed whistleblowers in other forums, but when people, particularly front-line clinicians and patients, raise issues of concern, I have found there to be a resistance in the system to accepting the veracity of those claims and to investigating in more detail as to whether the complaints have merit.  At times, we dismiss clinicians who highlight issues of patient safety.  Consider the new contracts for general practitioners, GPs, and consultants and the clauses on prejudicing the name of the HSE.  Is everything becoming more secretive?  If so, it puts more pressure on contract employees of the HSE who want to be open and honest if they believe there are problems.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a disciplined force, but it looks like the HSE is one as well.  Never should one question authority up the line.</p><p> An open disclosure policy would be a major step in the right direction.  I am not just referring to cases where the clinicians accept that they got it wrong.  Rather, management and the entire system should be open about addressing problems instead of hoping they will go away or can be avoided.  I am not making a criticism of any individual.  The system just appears to be resistant to any form of accountability.  We should not start witch hunts, but if someone is clearly unable to do his or her job, questions must be asked of that person regardless of whether he or she is a manager, a clinician or anything else.  I hope that the policy of open disclosure will begin to permeate the organisation as a whole.</p><p> Has my time concluded?</p></speech>

The issues of the coronial process must be viewed seriously, in that there seems to have been an effort not to co-operate fully with investigations.  Statements made at the coronial process may not correlate with written notes, etc.  This is a serious charge and, if true, must be put right quickly.  One could argue that, if people are not co-operating with their statutory obligations under the coronial process, the matter is so serious that others should be examining it.</p><p>  We must not launch a witch-hunt, only find out the facts.  If some people are genuinely not up to doing their jobs, be it in Portlaoise or anywhere else, they must be held to account.  If they cannot be supported, they should be moved elsewhere.  We cannot jeopardise life-and-death services.</p><p>  When information is brought to local management and senior management at national level is concerned about problems at a hospital, who oversees the former or does the issue just stop at that level without any oversight?  In this case, it had been evident since 2007 that management and governance structures were weak.  Issues were brought to the attention of the authorities.  Perhaps we should have a system of reporting that is more efficient than merely contacting a local Deputy who writes a letter to someone else who then writes a letter to someone else and so on before it eventually falls into no-man's-land.  Perhaps there should be a clear demarcation of responsibilities so that, when a complaint is reported, someone must act on it and ensure it is investigated.  If concerns arise from that process, they can be addressed.  If they do not, the complaint can be dismissed.</p></speech>

At the outset, it is important to say that this is not a presumption - I am certain that it is the case that what we all want to see is a safe, highest standard maternity service for women who need that service, not only at Portlaoise, but at all maternity units throughout the country.  Anything that helps to ensure that is the case and guarantees it to women is welcome.  It is very sad, however, that we have had to see all of this focus and light shone on failures and inconsistencies as a result of tragic outcomes.  That is always very sad indeed.</p><p>  I would welcome and highlight many parts of Dr. Holohan's report, but I have to ask a question.  It does not anywhere in any serious way reflect on staffing levels at the Midland Regional Hospital's maternity service.  It does not focus on the fact that maternity-midwifery staff had highlighted back in 2006 the serious understaffing at the Portlaoise hospital maternity service, PHMS.  Why is that the case?  While even the Minister acknowledged in his address this morning that failures were identified at both local and national levels, there is no doubt but that there is a failure at national level to heed the concerns of front-line maternity-midwifery staff, and those working with them in obstetrics, over a series of years and a series of Governments.  We cannot simply focus in on failures of individuals or the hospital system to the exclusion of a failure to not only address a problem highlighted a number of years ago, but one that has been compounded over the period since by a continual drain on staffing provision and resourcing.</p> <p>The Minister stated that had the data obtained been collated and examined it would have pointed to there being a good reason to suspect an ongoing problem with outcomes of care.  The Minister also stated that birth rates had risen very quickly over a short period.  How does that sit with concerns in relation to staffing levels having been raised as far back as 2006?  There clearly was a cry from staff in that regard?  I do not believe it is sufficient to say, as Ms McGuinness did in her concluding remarks, that in the event the HSE's review establishes that certain actions may be warranted, appropriate disciplinary action would be taken.  I do not for one moment excuse any failures of the highest conduct and behaviour on the part of our hospital staff at any location.  Nothing excuses it.  We cannot look at this in isolation and say that is the problem while ignoring the elephant in the room, which at the end of the day must be the fact that there was inadequate staff provision.  That point has been made point after time.  </p><p> The INMO response to the report highlights a factual position.  It is not a case of the INMO doing its business representing its members, which job it does very well, rather it is a fact of life that we have a midwife to births ratio at the Portlaoise site of 1 to 55.  The recommended ratio is 1 to 29.5 births.  The INMO has called for the immediate recruitment of 33 additional midwives at the Portlaoise hospital site.  I would like the Minister to comment on those points and would welcome his reaction to the INMO position in relation to the need for 33 new staff.  The Minister in an exchange between us in the D&aacute;il on 13 February on this issue stated that the hospital had approval to recruit additional midwives up to the approved complement.  Will he advise what that complement is?  While I put that question to the Minister on the day in question he did not respond.  When did approval to recruit additional midwives issue and what is the approved complement?  Does it come close to the identified need of 33 additional midwives at Portlaoise hospital?</p><p> The Minister spoke in his contribution of the commencement of a midwifery workload and workforce review by the HSE.  Can he advise what the timeframe is for that review and when the report will present?  I note that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is to undertake an immediate investigation of Portlaoise hospital maternity services and to report by the end of the year.  Why in this instance is a timeframe of up to nine months provided when no timeframe is set out in respect of the HSE review?  The Minister has indicated that a planned development of a national maternity service strategy will be delivered this year.  I am trying to put each of these pieces of the jigsaw into some order.  Is it possible that a national maternity strategy would be delivered in advance of some of these reviews and reports or does the Minister see it as a natural lead of one informing the other?  I would welcome if the Minister could clarify that situation.</p><p> In relation to the inconsistencies referred to by the Minister in relation to perinatal data collection, will he outline exactly what inconsistencies have now been identified that have given rise to an under-reporting of perinatal deaths across this State?</p></speech>

It is also important to thank the Minister for the manner in which he has dealt with the situation and to welcome the report of Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer, in relation to this matter.</p><p>  There appears to be unprecedented failures here.  It is truly shocking to learn of the lack of respect and due care for families at such a sensitive time.  They were treated appallingly.  As someone who worked in the hospital services for more than 20 years I am at a loss to understand that.  I also find the culture outlined in the report completely foreign to my experience.  It appears from the report that there was a breakdown at every level of responsibility and authority not only at Portlaoise hospital, but at national level.  I have listened to the commentary on this issue and have read various reports on it.  It is not clear from those reports why this happened.  It appears to me that the significant reductions in expenditure nationally, including the 11,000 reduction in staff, has put enormous pressures on staff, in particular at Portlaoise hospital.  There is no excuse for any staff member at any hospital not treating people with due care and respect or providing quality service.  However, there is no doubt that staff are under constant pressure.  </p><p>  I understand that a number of posts at senior level in Portlaoise hospital were filled on a temporary basis only and that 25% of staff, nursing and medical, are agency staff.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred earlier to the ratio of midwife to births at the hospital being 1 to 55 despite that nationally it is 1 to 29.5.  This coupled with the aforementioned staffing issues suggests to me that there are serious pressures on staff in that hospital.  Another significant matter highlighted in the report is that of the concerns raised by staff at a number of levels.  What action was taken as a result of those concerns being raised?  It is not clear from the report what happened in that regard.  Also, what procedures are in place now to address future concerns raised by staff?</p><p>  I welcome the HSE statement in regard to the open disclosure policy.  I hope it will not be only a policy but will be acted upon on a daily basis within and throughout the service.</p></speech>

Other members have raised the issue of staffing levels being extremely low, particularly with regard to midwives.  Has the reason for this been identified, as the report does not seem to indicate it?  Why were levels so low and why did vacancies continue?  Is it a continuing issue within the hospital system, as I am sure there are plenty of qualified people out there?  Were qualified people not prepared to work there?  What is the turnover of staff?  The report did not deal with the numbers passing through over the past six to seven years.</p><p>  The second issue relates to medical consultants.  The birth rate has gone from approximately 1,000 births to in excess of 2,000 births per year, meaning there is one consultant for every 800 deliveries approximately.  I understand in some English hospitals the recommended ratio is one consultant to 350 or 400 deliveries, so we are at double that rate.  There are three consultants and six registrars in the facility.  They operate a so-called one in three call, which is being on call every day, every third night and every third weekend.  Every third weekend the consultant would be on call from 9 a.m. on Friday to 5 p.m. on Monday, and we have withdrawn rest days in some units.  There would have been a rest day for each weekend worked but they have been withdrawn.  We are talking about understaffing in real terms but we have withdrawn a rest day provision for people working those kinds of hours.  What is the current position of the Department and the HSE in that regard?</p><p>  One of the big complaints I have heard from both nurses and other medical practitioners concerns turnover of managerial staff, but the report does not deal with how many different people were in charge of management between 2005 to the current time in the hospital.  If the same people are not in charge, new people must start over and issues get put to one side.</p><p>  I came across a case where a death occurred in a hospital but 18 months later a coroner's inquest had not been held.  In fairness, the hospital did everything by the book and contacted the State Claims Agency to investigate if pressure could be put on the coroner to hold an inquest.  The families were concerned about a potential cover-up because the inquest had not been held.  There was no reason given by the coroner for not holding the inquest.  What are we doing about that and ensuring inquests are held in a timely manner for everybody concerned, including hospital staff, medical and managerial people and, most important, the families involved?</p></speech>

The very basic rights of care - compassion and respect - are very important, whether one is going to a GP or a hospital and whether one is pregnant or going for any other reason.  There seemed to a be a failure in this case.  The report made me very angry, sad and, above all, made me believe something broke down in a hospital that is meant to care for people.  I am not fully convinced it was anything to do with staffing levels, as we do not need 20 or 40 people to have a bit of compassion in a room.  Only one person is required to put an arm around another and say "sorry".  It takes one nurse or doctor to hand a dead child back to a mother to allow her hold it.  It does not take 20 people to do this.  When we consider numbers and staff levels, it does not mean much with this report.</p><p>  The words that stick out most are the conclusion of the report, which indicates that families and patients were treated in a poor and at times appalling manner, with limited respect, kindness, courtesy and consideration.  These are the basic rights of any normal human being going about his or her work.  Politicians are at times said to be heartless and without feelings, but if I did not have compassion and respect, among other qualities, in dealing with people on a daily basis, I would not be in this job.  I would not have the right to be in it.</p><p>  I am glad Ms McGuinness has indicated there will be disciplinary action when the report is finished.  I do not believe that, any time of any day, people have the right not to do the job they are asked to do, particularly to care for people.  The most devastating consequence is to lose a child, either during a pregnancy or at birth, as it leaves a parent with a terrible void.  There is a constant question of whether things were done correctly and if the mother did everything right during pregnancy.  These women will ask if they could have done anything before the birth of the baby that would have saved it.</p><p>  The findings of the report are appalling and make for very sad reading.  There is real reluctance for some to do their job right and in a compassionate manner.  I hope when the report is published and people are identified as unable or unqualified in their job, they will be disciplined severely.  A lady beside me is expecting a baby in a few weeks and I have a daughter and a niece expecting a baby, so I hope that staff in the hospitals they use will treat them with, above all, compassion and some dignity.  It is a tough and anxious time for expectant mothers and fathers, as well as grandparents.  We must see some compassion.  God almighty, a parent holding a dead baby is a sad occasion and people should rally to do as much as possible.  We failed these people dreadfully.  The HSE has failed them, but most of all, staff have failed in a duty to perform as medical care workers.</p></speech>

I will try to act in a fashion becoming of the Parliament but I must be harsh.  All I can say is this room reeks of whitewash, and I am sorry this report does not address core issues.  I mean no personal disrespect to anybody but people employed in the Department and HSE have grown up in a certain culture with a method of dealing with matters in a corporate fashion that colours the way in which they see the service and its customers.</p><p>  We can go through some facts.  As my colleague, Senator Burke, has pointed out, the number of births increased from 1,000 to somewhere between 2,000 and 2,500.  The number of consultants, already fairly ludicrously low at three, stayed at three.  This was a time when this region had an influx, for unusual demographic reasons related to the real estate market, of young couples occupying pseudo-dormitory commuter communities.  There was a disproportionate number of young people coming in at a time in life when they would be starting a family.  The national birth rate in these years went up by 17% but in Portlaoise it went up by 50%.  To reiterate the point, the number of consultants - which was inadequate at three - stayed at three.  When Dr. Holohan states his belief that staffing issues had nothing to do with this, I must ask him why the Department of Health and the HSE allowed this place to be overstaffed when there were only 1,000 births per year if three consultants was the appropriate number when there were 2,500 births per year.</p><p>  Added to this are the non-consultant hospital doctors, or to call them what they are, trainees.  As I stated before, if an engagement ring is dropped down a drain, one would not expect an apprentice plumber to fix it but we are quite happy to let precious children, our wives, husbands, spouses and parents to go to hospital every day and be treated by non-consultant hospital doctors.</p> <p>The reason is that by fiat of successive Governments, the permanent government, the Department of Health and its more recent offspring, the HSE, there was a policy of having a ludicrously low level of career level posts in our country.  Recently, applications were invited for specialist registrar positions in obstetrics.  I will put my cards on the table.  I do not believe those people should be regarded as anything other than trainees.  I do not care how senior or qualified they are, they are trainees.  However, even for this level of training, there were 13 applicants for the 16 jobs and only nine were considered to have met the minimum educational requirements to do it.</p><p> Portlaoise hospital was not even recognised for training, so why was it employing NCHDs?  Why are trainees working in a hospital which is not recognised for training?  From where did they come?  Were these people the well-meaning, good people who are often trained in other countries and come to this country seeking experience and are then exploited by being put into jobs which are not recognised for training, to provide cheap labour for a system which will not employ the appropriate number of career level consultants?  Were any of them part of the process of us recruiting in medically under-served countries to poach their doctors to come and work here?  This is not an isolated matter.  We have discussed it previously and I was less than impressed with the response that was given when I pointed this out following the tragedy that occurred in Galway 16 months ago.  Galway is the region not just in Ireland but in the entire OECD that has the lowest number of consultant obstetricians per head of population, yet we are told it is entirely coincidental that these types of tragedy occur.</p><p> We have been whitewashed over the years with the reassurance that at least our perinatal mortality figures are good.  My mind has been blown away by this report.  Now we do not know what they are.  We might have miserable perinatal mortality rates because the witness is telling us that nobody is recording them appropriately.  I am not impressed by this and, with great respect to the undoubtedly genuine human sympathies of the people from the HSE and the Department of Health and their interactions with these poor families who suffered such tragic losses and, it would appear, were treated poorly, if they really wish to be sincere in their sympathy and not shed crocodile tears to mix with the whitewash, they will fix the problem.</p><p> I have another question.  Were consultants involved in the two episodes of foreign bodies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1056" speakername="Dan Neville" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014030600011#L00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  For somebody who is quite distant from this, one's first concern is whether this is happening in isolation or in other places.  Hopefully, it is rare but I would be surprised if it is isolated.  The Minister said that other maternity services are being examined.  When are we likely to get the results of that examination?  That would ease many of the concerns among the public about the maternity service.  Undoubtedly, this has put a question mark over all the maternity services, regardless of how unfair that might be.  How long was the governance and system of delivery of service, as the investigation found it, taking place?  Was it recent, ongoing or historical?  If it was not historical, what triggered it?  Did events trigger it?  Was it a change in staff?  What change occurred to trigger what happened?</p><p>  What is the reason for not informing the family of what happened?  Was there a reason or was it just neglect?  We find this in other parts of the health service.  There is a reluctance to inform families and carers when people are in need of care.</p><p>  Finally, in most sections of the old health boards, including the health board in the mid-west, there was a clear complaints procedure.  We all used it from time to time in respect of people who had complaints about the service they were given.  Was a complaints procedure available to the people and families who suffered so much in this instance?  Was it operating or were they made aware of such a procedure?  What was the response if they did use the complaints procedure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014030600011#L00300"><p>I thank the members for their contributions.  Nobody here does not wish to have this problem fixed.  In the past there was a sense that when hospitals became unsafe, reports were carried out to confirm the fact that they were unsafe, and to use that to close them down.  That will not be the case here.  This report will be used to fix the service.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher raised a number of issues.  Some of his questions are better directed towards Dr. Holohan, such as what are the other organisations alluded to in respect of having information.  I am acutely concerned about the issue of bringing concerns and patients' concerns to the fore.  That is the reason I wish to set up a patient safety agency this year, in order that people will have a patients' champion and advocate who is clearly on their side to pursue their issue, whether it is something dreadful and tragic as happened in Portlaoise or just a small matter.  It will be there to support the patient, to pursue their issue with them and to direct them how best to get satisfaction.  I have stated on the record many times that what most patients want, in my experience, is an acknowledgement that something went wrong, an apology for what went wrong and an assurance that it will not happen again because things will change.  That is at the root of the problem in Portlaoise.  Reports were produced and recommendations were made, but they were ignored.</p><p>  That brings me to a broader point, which the report addresses.  It is the fact we do not have an outside monitoring system for the implementation of recommendations of various reports throughout the country.  One of the recommendations in the report is that HIQA should engage in such a monitoring process.  The patient safety statement and patient surveillance will aid that.  What Deputy Kelleher alluded to and what Dr. Holohan discovered is that the information was available if one went looking for it in different places, but nobody was collating it and putting it together in order that they could see there might be a problem and it should be checked.  What we are depending upon is the bravery and tenacity of parents in this case or somebody in the hospital to put up their hand.  That is not a good system.  We must have a monitoring system whereby we can objectively identify something.  It is like a fire alarm.  It might be nothing or it might be something really serious, but we must have a system in place that alerts us to it.</p><p>  I welcome open disclosure.  We opened a conference on it and it is running on a pilot basis.  Dr. Holohan was there that day with the HSE.  There is great acceptance of this throughout the system and people see the value of it.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the GP contract and the line that is being interpreted by GPs with some concern about what they see as a gagging clause.  I wish to put it on the record that, as Minister for Health, I would not preside over a situation where people could not voice their concerns.  However, I am equally aware that many employers have a line in their contracts which ask people not to bring the organisation into disrepute.  That is more about behaviour, not about not voicing one's concerns.  I point out that the wording in that area can be changed in order that it does what it is supposed to do, which is remind people of their responsibility to the organisation in terms of not bringing it into disrepute, but by no means does it infer that they are gagged or cannot speak out if they are concerned about what they see as wrong, unsafe or any other concern.</p><p>  In these situations a balancing act is required.  On the one hand we must hold to account individuals who have failed in their duty.  On the other hand we do not wish to have a witch hunt.  We certainly do not want the morale of the staff in Portlaoise, many of whom are excellent people, to be further damaged.  We must support them to grow and give of themselves, in a way they had always intended, to the local people.  All the parents were very clear with me.</p> <p>They did not want the service closed but made safe and I support their wish 100%.  That is what the report is about.  </p><p> I regret that some people feel the report is a whitewash, but I do not think it is.  If one listens to the parents - and I have listened to one on the radio who made it very clear - they had all of their concerns written down and when they read through the report they were able to tick every box because each concern had been addressed.  Notwithstanding the cynicism that sometimes surrounds this House, we listened, we heard and we took things on board.  As I said in my opening remarks, we must ensure that we do not fail parents and patients again by not ensuring that the lessons learned here are learned not just in Portlaoise but right throughout the health service.  That is what HIQA monitoring will ensure.</p><p> Members also asked about local complaints procedures, and Dr. Holohan will address the matter in a more cogent way than I could, but I will simply say that people do get frustrated.  Most hospitals have a complaints officer.  If people do not get satisfaction they will resort to the law, because that is the only way for them to get satisfaction.  What the parents had to endure was shocking; there is no other way put it.  It is astonishing that one must go to court to get one's notes.  We now have an opportunity to change the culture completely.  I am at pains to point out that this is our health service - everybody's - and it behoves us all to be engaged and to change it to one that we would want for ourselves.  Tony O'Brien sent a letter to staff two weeks ago and made it clear to them that people should be treated with respect and compassion in the same way they would want their loved ones to be treated.  Deputy Catherine Byrne mentioned - and I agree with her - that it must be key, and everybody here is in agreement about that issue.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of staffing levels.  In response to his query and that of Senator Crown, nobody is saying that staffing levels might not have had an impact in this case.  We are saying that it does not explain it all.  It does not explain, when there was nobody else in that unit on a given night, how the failures occurred; it does not explain the culture and attitude.  What was done was unacceptable at a human level and we must change that.  Nobody here would disagree with my wish.  </p><p> I shall pass a few specific questions to Dr. Holohan.  I have addressed the issue of the early warning signs and HIQA reporting and monitoring.  Dr. Holohan can talk about the approved complement of the HSE, because I do not have that information to hand.  The workforce planning will be finished by the end of the second quarter of this year.  The plan will inform all of the national maternity strategy, as will other reports that are available to us.</p><p> Obviously everybody is very concerned about the perinatal death statistics if they are not accurate.  We have found that to be the case and so we will improve the situation.  We must have evidence in order to make proper decisions on health care, and information technology will help.  However, information technology is only as good as the information that is fed into it.  There was the old acronym GIGO, which means "garbage in, garbage out".  We must ensure that information is collected properly.</p><p> Deputy Healy raised the issue of nursing concerns and staffing levels, which will be addressed by Dr. Holohan.  Senator Colm Burke talked about low staffing levels and wondered whether that was still the case.  He asked for the ratio of consultants to patients and deliveries, and asked what were the normal or internationally recommended ratios and how much managerial change has taken place since 2005.  Perhaps the HSE will address these matters.</p><p> Obviously the coroner delays are of great concern.  We want to see changes in the coroner's approach.  Sometimes we do not need to legislate but we must outline definitions, and there must be a willingness to change.  My view is very clear: there should be an inquest in respect of any baby that dies once labour begins.  This will deal with what some parents felt was an attempt to label deaths as stillbirths so that they would not require an inquest.  There has been a huge breach of trust at so many different levels here.  We will rebuild the trust.  We will turn Portlaoise into an exemplary hospital over the next number of years.  </p><p> I have already addressed the issues raised by Deputy Catherine Byrne.  She did mention that patients should be treated with compassion, kindness, care and safety.  No amount of kindness and compassion can make up for incompetence.  </p><p> I will let Dr. Holohan deal with Senator Crown's assertions.  Deputy Neville asked the pertinent question of whether this is happening elsewhere.  I want to be assured that it is not happening elsewhere but I cannot be assured of that at the moment.  That is why we are reviewing other maternity hospitals of a similar size, and all maternity hospitals, to ensure that the recommendations that came out of the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar will be and are being implemented.  I cannot be sure that this has happened.  With no disrespect to the HSE or the people who work in hospitals, it is not good enough for us to just accept it when a hospital says it is doing something and that is the end of it.  We must satisfy ourselves that hospitals are doing what they say they are, and so we must have outside monitoring.  A question was asked about whether something triggered this case.  Back in 2005 it was a cultural thing that seemed to grow at the hospital.  I will ask the chief medical officer to address the remainder of the questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014030600012#M00600"><p>Deputy Kelleher asked about the other organisations involved.  As I said at the beginning, we interacted with a number of organisations at a national level.  In particular, we know that the State Claims Agency and HIQA had information that gave them cause for concern about the service and they shared their information with us.  Some of that data is now in the report, and figure 4.6 is an example.</p><p>  We also asked some of our national regulators.  We asked the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais because they have a relationship with services on the ground and sometimes deal with complaints, so that would give them a perspective on what may be happening in a given service.  Also, they have an inspecting role in education and training in services, which would also give them a window on what is happening.  We asked them about all issues of this kind.  We did get information that allowed us to say that certain organisations at national level had information that gave them cause for concern and that they were raising them with the hospital at a local level.</p><p>  With regard to staffing in general, I will provide information to complement what the Minister has said.  He was correct when he said the report did not say that the staffing issue was an explanation for what happened here.  It was saying that it was not the only explanation, which is far more complex.  Frankly, staffing cannot explain the situations that we discovered - individual cases that occurred in isolation with no other patients on the ward and with a full complement of staff at that time.  It does not explain the behaviours or the way in which staff spoke to, treated or interacted with staff or patients in a given situation.</p><p>  We do know that there was good reporting.  The level of adverse incident reporting was comprehensive in the sense that staff were completing reports, but we think that was part of the overall culture.</p> <p>The response to patient safety issues was one of completing a form and sending it away to the State Claims Agency.  Frankly, it is my personal view that it is not sufficient for a health care professional to discharge his or her obligations to patients in terms of patient safety by writing letters to Ministers or others about staffing levels.  That does not mean, however, that it is not appropriate for staff to raise issues at a local level.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in specifically asked me for my view on what the INMO has said.  I have seen what that organisation has said about staffing levels but I am not aware that the INMO has made any comment whatsoever on the behaviour of staff, which, in my view, was central to the findings and central to the issues before us.  While I am not accusing anybody of trying to simplify things, the INMO's interpretation would be, for me, an oversimplification of a very complex story.  Deputy Catherine Byrne's analysis is much closer to ours in terms of explaining what happened.  We make clear in our report that there was an increase in the number of births which was not matched by an increase in the number of staff.  We also make clear that there were difficulties in recruiting staff and that there were leadership positions vacant which, in my view, are very important in explaining some of the findings that were set out in the HSE's own individual reports about supervision, handover, escalation and so forth.  We make clear recommendations with regard to Birthrate Plus and a number of other measures that must now be used as a benchmark.  There are certainly issues with regard to staffing - I am not saying that staffing is not an issue - but it is not the sole explanation for what happened here.  We cannot allow ourselves to conclude that a problem with staffing allows people to abdicate their responsibilities in terms of looking after patients sensitively, kindly and compassionately or reporting harm to patients honestly and openly when it happens, because that is an inevitable consequence of health service delivery.  </p><p> Deputy Kelleher and others asked whether this is happening elsewhere.  As the Minister has said, that is part of the reason for saying that the implications of this report must be examined by the HSE in the context of other similar-sized services.  That is also reflected in the recommendations on the investigation that HIQA will conduct.  In particular, it is reflected in the recommendation that the hospital groups mechanism should be the direction of travel in the reorganisation of hospital services.  There is enough reason for us to say that we should get on with the linking of smaller units into larger units within the hospital group areas.</p></speech>

We do not need to have another investigation of this kind or another report of this kind to tell us that we need to get on with that reform.  It was already part of the direction of travel and we are saying that it needs to happen forthwith.  There are similar-sized units in other parts of the country.  We did not investigate them so we cannot say that any of the problems we found in Portlaoise are happening there but some of the ingredients that are important in explaining what happened are evident in some of those smaller units.  In that context, there is a justification for proceeding quickly with the direction of travel.</p><p>  The coronial process was mentioned a number of times and questions were raised about the timeliness of it.  In one case a family was waiting for a number of years for a coroner's inquest to take place, while another family, for whom the incident took place at a much later date, went through the inquest at more or less the same time.  That added to the family's distress.  As I said earlier, we have already commenced a process of engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality regarding this issue.  A report was published in 2000 on the coroner process which provided the basis for amendments to the 1962 Act in 2005.  A draft Bill was prepared and it was recommended at the time that a national coroner service be established, along with other measures which are still being examined by the Department of Justice and Equality.  We want to engage with the Department to make sure that some of our findings are reflected in its review and its plans to update the legislation.</p><p>  Senator Colm Burke asked a specific question about management turnover; the HSE might be in a better position to answer that.  Without getting into semantics, it is important to point out, in the context of what Senator Crown had to say, that this was not a training location on the specialist registrar, SpR, training programme in obstetrics and gynaecology, although at least one individual was part of basic specialist training, BST, training in obstetrics.  It is a training location in both obstetrics and paediatrics as part of the local GP training scheme but there was no specialty-specific training happening in Portlaoise.  These people were not trainees.  The junior hospital doctors were in service posts.  I should have added, in what I said about staffing, that the report sets out the data very clearly on what has been a fairly recent trend towards increasing dependence on agency staffing in both medical and junior hospital doctor provision, whereby the expenditure on agencies for that service is somewhere in the region of &euro;1 million now as against an expenditure of zero in 2007-08. </p><p>  I hope I have answered Deputy Neville's question about whether what happened at Portlaoise is happening elsewhere.  I may have missed a question or two along the way and am happy to be reminded of them if so.</p></speech>

There are potentially many reasons these posts were not filled but we did not attempt to analyse the reason in that regard.</p><p>  Another question I overlooked concerned whether there was a trigger for all of this.

We talked to patients and families who were users of the service and we talked to the staff and those who had leadership responsibilities.  It appears that a complex culture developed over time and, without wishing to sensationalise, it is very similar to the findings that were set out in the Mid Staffordshire investigation in the UK.  That same sort of culture that has been the subject of a lot of writing in the UK was evident here.</p></speech>

What recruitment process was used to recruit the junior doctors who were in these unrecognised non-training positions, whose very existence I would question?</p></speech>

On the first question, I cannot say whether the actual incidents were directly the responsibility of consultants, but each of the two patients - the subject of these "never events" - was under the clinical care of a consultant who had overall responsibility for the care delivered to that patient.  In that sense, the consultants have a responsibility.</p><p>  I left out Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question regarding perinatal death data, for which I apologise.  There is a paragraph in the report that tries to summarise or explain the gaps in the data.  It says that the General Registrar Office, GRO, receives a higher number of stillbirth notifications than the National Perinatal Reporting System, NPRS.  Even though such notifications come from the same location, the GRO gets a higher number of stillbirths notified to it and it reports on them.  With regard to the other component of perinatal deaths, known as early neonatal deaths, covering death up to seven days of life, the NPRS gets more early neonatal death notifications than the GRO.  There is under-reporting and under-registration of early neonatal deaths to the GRO.  That finding in the report is one that I am not sure anyone was aware of.  A statistician from the CSO who works with us in the Department and a public health specialist worked solidly for seven days analysing all of the different sets of data, and their work provides the basis for the eight-page analysis set out in the report.</p> <p>We have made it available to the Department of Social Protection and we will be in discussion with the Department in respect of what needs to be done to tighten it up and ensure we are reporting on the same, and the correct, definition.  Our recommendation is that the hybrid, which corrects the two under-reporting factors, is used but it will not make any difference to our overall ranking.  The idea that this is a complete misrepresentation of what our perinatal mortality rates says about the safety of our system is not the case.  What we observe in respect of perinatal mortality is that, given that information available in units is not being looked at, perhaps an undue over-reliance on the perinatal system, referred to as the "burglar alarm" by the Minister, is not appropriate to be examined in isolation.</p></speech>

While it will not make a huge difference to our overall ranking, it is extremely important to patients and to parents who have had a stillbirth or lost a baby that it is recorded.  It diminishes hugely their trust in the whole system and our statistics if their baby has not been properly recorded.  While it will not make a huge difference in terms of statistics, it makes an enormous difference at the human level for parents.</p></speech>

In July 2013, approval was given for up to a complement of 38 midwives and two additional shift leaders and a clinical nurse manager, grade 3.  A renewal campaign is under way to recruit over and above the 38.  Mr. Ian Carter will provide more detail on this.</p><p>  A question raised by Deputy Neville concerned the management and administrative staff turnover.  There have been changes at a number of levels, at hospital level and above, since 2006.  A new general manager went to post last Friday and a new director of midwifery services also went in last Friday.  Dialogue has already commenced with the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital regarding collaboration.  Mr. Ian Carter can expand on this point.</p><p>  The last question concerned NCHDs and what is being done in respect of Senator Crown's question on the recruitment of NCHDs.

It involves working with the new director of nursing in trying to fill the basic grade of midwives and, as the CMO identified, to fill shift leader posts.  I will take advice from the director of midwifery in the post at the end of this week to see how we shape the final skill mix.  She is the best person to advise me.</p><p>  With regard to consultant staff, we stand at four consultants.  The locum deployed over the past few weeks will be the maintained for the remainder of the year.  With regard to the review being undertaken by me and the clinical management team in Portlaoise, it is under way and I hope to conclude it within the coming few weeks.</p><p>  Two specific points were raised about whether there was a rationale for families not being informed of incidents or reports.  From talking to the staff, no rationale was given.  That is at variance to the policy on complaints or clinical incidents.  No reason was cited but it is totally against the complaints procedure.  In terms of retention of foreign bodies, there were two incidents relating to swabs, one of which directly involved a consultant and one directly involving an NCHD.</p><p>  The last question referred to the overall audit of maternity services.  That will be done within the framework of looking at forming groups but the exercise will be completed.  It will look at maternity hospitals and small hospitals over the coming two months.</p></speech>

Out of this, surely we will see people who are meant to be in charge being held to account here and in general.  I do not want to pre-empt any inquiry.  We are talking about restoring confidence, which we want to do in respect of this issue and this hospital.  We acknowledge the tremendous work done by many wonderful staff.  Surely there comes a point where we cannot allow the same people to be in charge after what has happened.</p></speech>

Every year, a significant number of staff go through the disciplinary stages 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Stage 4 is the most significant, where the staff are dismissed from the service.  We have a full report on the statistics and it is a matter of holding people to account.  It is very serious when it gets to stage 4.  We bring in an independent person from outside the region to carry out the process.  There is also an appeals procedure and we can provide statistics on this in respect of the people who have had to leave office.  It does not get published widely but we do have it.  When serious issues arise, which may involve fraud or clinical or various other matters, disciplinary measures are taken.</p></speech>

The amount of work consultants in these units are required to do has doubled over the past eight to ten years.  We have now withdrawn rest days for working weekends, with one in three on call in 11 units around the country.  The second issue risk refers to the changeover of managerial staff in the smaller hospitals around the country, which is causing problems.  It is something the HSE should examine.  It cannot be dealt with in this report but it is a major factor in accountability and ensuring patients' genuine concerns are followed through.</p></speech>

I welcome the report and the fact that HIQA will carry out an inquiry.  I am familiar with the hospital as my two children were born there and I was present.  My grandchild was also born there.  One of the things that concerned me, particularly in recent years, is that at a time when many people came into the area and the demographics changed as it became a dormer area on the outer ring of the commuter belt, many people came from eastern Europe.  Eastern European constituents came to me throughout the 2000s and told me they were going home to have their babies because of concern about maternity practices in general, not just in Portlaoise.  I mention that for what it is worth because it raised concerns.</p><p>  We do not have a national policy on the use of syntocinon.  I am not a medic but I have followed the issue of the use of the drug.  It is used in the active management of the birth to shorten labour time.  My concern is that the average induction levels are at 31%, whereas the WHO reports that it should be below 10%.  The gap is a major concern and there is international concern reported about the overuse of this artificial induction drug. </p> <p>It is reported that the Minister is looking for a standardised protocol; however, the issues arising from the use of induction drugs are not covered in the overall recommendations.  We can see from the cases in Portlaoise hospital that a major issue was the pumping of induction drugs into the mother's blood stream, even when the baby was showing signs of foetal distress.  These drugs make the contractions more frequent and stronger, putting too much strain on the heart of the little baby.  That is a concern that I would like to see addressed.</p><p> In reply to Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, the Minister has said 38 midwifery posts were approved.  When were they approved?  At what stage of the recruitment process are the approved posts?  At this time do we have sufficient midwifery staff in Portlaoise hospital such that I, as a local Deputy, can assure constituents that it is a safe hospital?</p></speech>

I very much welcome the recommendations made in the report and the speed of Dr. Tony Holohan in compiling it.  The content is not surprising and, in essence, what the families concerned have been seeking.  It is meritorious and the recommendations must be implemented in full.  The concern of everybody in this room is the potential lack of confidence that all of these recommendations will be carried out.  As the Minister said, reports have already been compiled on these specific cases, but they were concealed or kept from the families.  They make for shocking reading.  I have looked at the desktop incident review form for one of the babies.  The parents were told it was a stillbirth, but the resuscitation of the child had been discontinued at 22 minutes.  It is difficult to have faith in the capacity of the Department of Health and the HSE to fulfil its commitments and the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.</p><p>  The Minister referred to recommendation No. 11, the new national patient safety surveillance department, which I know Dr. Holohan has strongly recommended.  One of the current concerns that I share with the families is that it will be dominated by high level staff in the HSE who have already failed in their duties.  It is important that there be a strong degree of independence in order that patients throughout the country can trust in the process.  That is very important, both for the parents and the public at large.</p><p>  I am a little bemused by the assertion that we can continue to have full faith in the perinatal fatality figures, while at the same time accepting that the documentation and the collation of the figures have been flawed.  The process has been flawed.  When babies who have died are not recorded, that is a flawed system.  I worry when I hear assertions being made by delegates before the committee that the statistics overall will not change and that we will continue to be one of the safest providers of maternity services.  It is important to acknowledge that we do not know this.  </p><p>  Professor John Crown has described the ridiculously low level of consultant posts.  That does not only affect maternity services; it also affects services across the board and this must be acknowledged.</p><p>  I must accept the Minister's sincerity.  He expresses regret and remorse and there has been tear shedding in the past couple of weeks in the D&aacute;il Chamber, at the committee and elsewhere in the past.  The reality is that senior figures in the HSE and the Department of Health were well aware of this issue having been approached by and met family members but nothing happened.  The Minister has spoken repeatedly about accepting responsibility for the delivery of health services, saying the buck stops with him.  I find it hard to reconcile that senior figures in the Department and the HSE were approached by and met the families, yet none of these staff brought the issue to the Minister's attention.  Is that acceptable when the buck stops with him?</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his input.  He is dealing with the issue in an upfront and proper manner.  I have never spoken to Dr. Tony Holohan, but I admire his report.  It is good to see a professional public servant giving a hard hitting report.  Let it offend those whom it has offended because that is how it has to be.  It is a template for how issues in the public service should be dealt with.</p><p>  We offer our sympathy to the families concerned.  Their courage in coming forward must be admired.  Given that these issues were well known at senior levels in the HSE and the Department of Health, did it take the television programme "Prime Time" to embarrass somebody into doing something about them?  Are other issues, known at senior level, not being dealt with?  Will the Minister comment on how the staff dealt with the inquests?  There are issues about evidence given at inquests.  I am sorry if this point was made earlier.  </p><p>  We all agree that we hope this will be automatic, but it is not automatic in the way the public service works.  The families have been through enough.  Should these cases go before the State Claims Agency?  I hope the Minister will instruct the agency to settle them and not drag the families through the courts.  The HSE has a legal team, the sole function of which is to get cases into the legal process.  There should be no further torturing of the families.  If the cases go to the State Claim Agency, please do not drag the families through the legal process, as they have been through enough.</p></speech>

I do not think the statistics, even though we have had a discussion on them, bear this out.  As a doctor, I know there are many reasons people go back to their home countries to give birth, as they like to be near their parents, families and friends.  That is not to say, however, that I am going to rely on statistics because they do not reveal incidents like the ones we have seen in Portlaoise hospital.  I remind members of the best case involving the three-in-one vaccine in which some children suffered brain damage.  Statistically, one could not prove the vaccine had caused the damage, but a whistleblower in the company blew the lid and told about the bad batch.  When that batch was looked at, one was able to determine that it had been the cause of the problem.  Statistics can only tell us so much.  What else do we have to compare ourselves with other countries?  We cannot use anecdotal evidence all the time; we need a much more sensitive measure to monitor what is going on in hospitals, not only in maternity services but everywhere else.  We are developing such a measure through HIQA.</p><p>  Deputy Brian Stanley mentioned an independent recommendation on the use of the artificial oxytocin hormone or Syntocinon, as it is known.  Recommendation No. 20 is a national guideline on the induction of labour and should be developed by the HSE.  That will be done.  </p><p>  Deputy Lucinda Creighton asked several questions.  I am not happy as Minister for Health to take people's word; I need validation and evidence-based decision-making.  The same applies to section rates, in respect of which there are significant variations.  The Deputy may have mentioned the WHO rates for sections, but we must remember that the World Health Organization looks at all countries in the Third World, Second World and First World.</p> <p>When I met the Institute of Obstetricians, it was at pains to point out that while the section rate worldwide was around 15%, that was not the case in First World countries such as Ireland.  Here the rate is 27% or 28%, which still means that we have some hospitals that are outliers with rates of 38%.  I want that matter to be investigated and a report on it.  </p><p> Deputy Lucinda Creighton has mentioned the need for an independent body, which is in referred to in recommendation No. 11.  That monitoring is to be carried out by HIQA which, we would all agree, has been independent in the manner in which it has carried out its investigations in an even-handed way.  I should take the opportunity to inform the committee that Dr. Tracey Cooper, the CEO of HIQA, is leaving to take up a new job in the public health sector in Wales, her home country.  I wish her well and thank her for all of the work she has done in shepherding HIQA into the space it is in where it is considered to be fair, independent and unafraid to say it like it is.</p><p> I will let Dr. Holohan deal with the perinatal statistics.  The Deputy asked if I considered it acceptable that complaints could be in the system for that length of time.  I do not.  </p><p> Deputy Sean Fleming asked if it had taken the "Prime Time" programme to prompt us into taking action.  While I had received a letter in relation to an incident, when I watched the "Prime Time" programme and saw that there had been four or five incidents, obviously, we had to take action immediately.  </p><p> I am aware that the Deputy was concerned about the inquests, an issue we have discussed here.  The adversarial nature of inquests needs to change, as well as the expense involved.  Sometimes parents have to dig deep into their financial resources to get through an inquest, given its adversarial nature.  That is not right.  I agree with the Deputy 100% in terms of the manner in which the HSE has historically dealt with some of these cases which continued for several years before then being settled on the doorstep of the court.  There is a better way and we will have a better way because it is not fair that parents should have to remortgage their homes to get justice for their children.</p></speech>

I will deal with perinatal statistics and the flaws we found in the reporting system, an issue raised by Deputy Lucinda Creighton.  It is not an assertion we are making.  We have set out the actual gaps and their scale and what the differences or discrepancies are.  There is a graph that shows we have a higher level or reporting and its quantity, if we were to define our perinatal reporting rate according to the definition we are recommending.  That would allow us to say this is the impact we think it would have on our international league table assessment of our perinatal reporting rate.  We know that there are variations in all reporting systems.  I daresay that if other countries were to make the kind of analysis we have now made of our perinatal reporting systems, they would probably find similar weaknesses.  There is an issue about comparing like with like when one gets into talking about the detail of perinatal reporting in different countries.  </p><p>  I think the Minister has dealt with all of the other questions asked, unless I have missed one.</p></speech>

The issue of the number of consultants has been raised.  I am aware of a report presented to me, which was out of date, which showed Ireland at the bottom of the list.  In fact, in the Netherlands and Canada there are fewer obstetricians per head of population.  They have developed new models of care, which is what we need to look at because it is not always about the number of doctors, nurses and the number of billions of euro spent.  During a period of 12 to 14 years we saw a quadrupling of the health budget - I am not being political - which led to 569 patients being on trolleys on one day.  We need to reform the system and look at the models of care in association and consultation with obstetricians and midwives to see how we can best deliver from what we all know is a very limited resource.</p></speech>

They are completed and sent to the State Claims Agency which makes them available to hospitals.  I know that the agency has participated in some learning and feedback arrangements to obstetric units, particularly where there are concerns about the levels of obstetric claims generally, as a way of trying to extract learning from adverse incidents.  We know that the level of reporting is variable as between services and professionals.  Frankly, in general terms, nurses are much better at reporting than doctors who are not necessarily always good at reporting comprehensively on adverse incidents.  We have made a recommendation in the report which the HSE has accepted and is in the process of implementing, that what are called "never events" become the subject of mandatory reporting to both the national director of quality and patient safety and the HSE and HIQA.  Therefore, it will create visibility immediately around the serious events that we saw in Portlaoise hospital, the six about which we have spoken.</p></speech>

I am aware the committee is tied for time.  I would like to put the work of the expert advisory group into context.

Toby Wolfe from Start Strong was a member of the group and he and I are available to answer questions.</p><p>  The early years strategy, which was the focus of advice provided by the expert group, will fit within the overall children and young people's policy framework being developed by the Government.  Rather than devise a strategy for young children based in specific service silos, for example, early care and education, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs announced at the outset that the early years strategy would take a holistic approach to the development of services for children under the age of six.  This means that within this strategy there will be commitments to the development of services that relate to children&rsquo;s health, their education and support for their parents and families.</p> <p>We commend the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, for adopting this approach because young children do not live and develop in silos, so policies and services need to focus on their holistic needs and on integrating services to meet those needs.</p><p> Over the course of 18 months the expert advisory group met regularly and with expert input from the Centre for Effective Services came up with a series of 54 recommendations on what should be included within the early years strategy.  Every one of these recommendations is grounded within scientific evidence about children's developmental needs and how best to fulfil them.  These these recommendations, together with the scientific evidence from the Centre for Effective Services, in the Right from the Start report that has been circulated to committee members.</p><p> Time does not permit me to go into each of those recommendations today so I will focus instead on five key points that we believe policymakers need to address over the next five years.  In the report we refer to them as five peaks, because we see them as challenges, but as challenges that can be surmounted in the best interests of children.  Focusing on these peaks is not to minimise the importance of any of our other recommendations and I hope that members will have an opportunity to read the report in its entirety.<br /><i></i>I will give a brief outline of each of those peaks.  The first peak is increasing investment in early care and education services, with investment rising incrementally each year from the current 0.4% to achieve the international benchmark of 1% of GDP within ten years.  Within the next five years we believe the strategy should ensure investment reaches the OECD average of 0.7% of GDP.  The increased investment is necessary to achieve higher quality more accessible and more affordable services, particularly through the training and professional development of those working at all levels of the early care and education system.</p><p> Our second peak is the provision of a significantly longer period of paid leave for parents, introduced by each year and incrementally extending paid parental leave at the end of the current period of paid maternity leave.  The aim should be within five years to achieve one year's paid parental leave after the birth of each child, and two weeks' paid paternity leave around the birth of a child.  This has several important advantages for children and families.  A child's first year is a critical time for establishing attachment relationships between children and their parents and for the development of caring roles.  These attachment relationships which children develop with their care-givers are very significant for their long-term mental, emotional and social well-being.  A year's paid leave would also support breast-feeding beyond six months should the mother choose to extend her time at home beyond the six months of maternity leave.  In addition, both paternity leave and paid parental leave would introduce the option for fathers to play a significant role in the care of infants during the important first weeks and months.</p><p> Our third peak is strengthening child and family support.  In order to do this we believe that what is needed is a dedicated service, led by specialist child and family public health nurses to provide integrated support for parents and children spanning the antenatal period through to the early years.  We welcome the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency and we believe that there should be dedicated child and family public health nurses working within the agency but also these nurses should be integrated and co-located with primary care teams, working with GPs, as envisioned in the 2012 task force report.  This service should allow for more intensive support for first-time parents who are clearly in need of additional support and for children and families with more complex needs.  It must ensure that all children receive the five core visits at home by public health nurses.</p><p> Our fourth peak relates to ensuring that all services for children have strong governance, are accountable and provide high quality services.  In the past, too many children have been let down by the absence of clear and consistent governance, poor communication and low accountability.  The establishment of a Cabinet-level Department of Children and Youth Affairs, is an opportunity to drive significantly higher standards for all our children.  We hope that at the end of the strategy's time period of ten years, no child should be in a low-quality early care and education service and that no public money should be allocated to services that fail to achieve quality standards.</p><p> We believe that one of the best ways to transform the lives of young children is to enhance and extend quality early childhood care and education services.  While Ireland has made significant advances in providing child care and preschool services in recent years it is unfortunately clear that the quality is not consistently high.  We welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, that she will allocate &euro;4.5 million to support implementation of her eight-point preschool quality agenda which includes the recruitment of additional staff for the preschool inspectorate, a mentoring service for preschool services and the provision of training support for staff already in the sector.  All of these initiatives are very welcome developments, but the expert advisory group concluded that ensuring high quality remains the foremost policy challenge in early care and education today.  As I mentioned earlier, spending on these services in Ireland is significantly below the OECD average, so much more attention and investment is needed.</p><p> Once we have achieved a higher standard of care, the fifth peak that we strongly recommend is the extension of the entitlement to free preschool provision so that a free part-time place is available from every child's third birthday until such time as they enter primary school.  Depending on the age at which a child begins school, many children should then benefit from about two years' free preschool provision before entering the junior infant primary school class.</p><p> We believe that the proposed early years strategy could significantly transform the lives of children in Ireland.  However, to achieve this transformation will require leadership and collaboration across Departments, organisations and services.  The expert advisory group of which I was the chairperson, has played its part by giving careful consideration to what we believe should be contained within the strategy and by presenting those recommendations to the Minister in the form of our report.  Now we need politicians and policymakers such as the committee members to take up the challenge.  In the first instance, we urge the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to include in her early years strategy all the recommendations we have set out in our report.  In addition, we believe that if the strategy is to be effective, its implementation will require a high level cross-departmental committee charged with its implementation and with monitoring its progress.  We will need politicians to press for such an implementation committee.  We believe that the committee should be led by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, but should also include all the other Departments whose policies affect the lives of young children.  We hope this will include representatives from this committee, from the Departments of Finance; Public Expenditure and Reform; Education and Skills; Health; Social Protection; Justice and Equality; and Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p> In order to ensure that right from the start all our children have the best possible chance, it will be crucial to have a major statement of political purpose, along with a radical re-orientation of structures, organisations, resources and policy priorities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nuala Doherty" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014030600018#T00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to address the committee meeting today.  Our job in the Centre for Effective Services is to bring good quality evidence to policymakers in the area of services to children, families and communities.  We translate the learning from research into messages that are usable for policymakers and practitioners.</p><p>  There is a synergy between our work and that of the previous speaker.  We will focus in our presentation on new emerging evidence with regard to prevention and early intervention and how this can be applied to an early years policy.</p> <p>Members will be familiar with the concept of prevention and early intervention to address problems when they arise.  There is compelling international evidence, contained in enough reports to fill the room from floor to ceiling, for the importance of reorienting services away from later to earlier intervention in order to achieve better outcomes for children.</p><p> This morning, however, I propose to focus on the significant body of Irish research and evidence we have collected in the past decade to support prevention and early intervention.  Investment in this area has come primarily from Atlantic Philanthropies, but also from successive governments.  Some &euro;127 million has been invested over the past ten years or so in 52 programmes, and the lessons from that are now emerging.  Our job was to synthesise those lessons and make them usable for the committee and other interested parties.  As members can see, we have structured our findings into seven areas and given 12 recommendations.  We will test members' memory later.  We are saying that if we want to ensure better outcomes for children and families, intervening in these seven areas will make a difference.  Our first three points relate to who we need to focus on, namely, parents, very young children from birth to three years, and the professionals who work with children.  The second bundle concerns the areas we need to focus on, which are transitions for children and children's learning.  The third category relates to how we need to work.</p><p> I will begin with the role of parents, an issue that was also highlighted by the previous speaker.  We now know that the relationship between parent and child is the most important factor in terms of child outcomes, more important than issues such as income or family structure.  Indeed, one of the key lessons is that if we work in supporting parents, we will achieve better outcomes for children.  The research under the prevention and early intervention programme showed significant decreases in stress and depression among parents, significant increases in their confidence in their parenting skills and significant improvements in children's behaviour.  The lesson is that with the right support, it is possible to achieve these types of improvement in outcomes.  In that context, we are calling, as did the previous speaker, for a national approach to parenting and a national parenting action plan to co-ordinate the range of good work that is being done in supporting parents.</p><p> The second issue we highlighted relates to focusing on children from pre-birth to three years of age.  We now know that this period is the most significant period in a child's development, when brain development is at its strongest.  A safe nurturing environment and secure relationships during this period can deliver very good long-term outcomes.  Reference was made to the importance of nutrition.  We now have evidence, derived in this country, that breastfeeding is directly linked to a reduced likelihood of obesity at age three, something which has become a major public health concern.  Findings from the programmes have shown that support in the form of home visits, for example, led to improvements in nutrition, a lower rate of hospital stays and better uptake of immunisation programmes.</p><p> The third issue we have identified, support for health professionals, also links very well with what the previous speaker said.  We know that professionals working with children play a hugely important role in their well-being and development.  They must, of course, be adequately trained, but that is not enough.  We want them not only to have the necessary skills but also the suitability and aptitudes to do the job.  The evidence is pointing to the need for a much more active type of training for professionals, with more skills-based learning, coaching and mentoring in addition to formal learning.</p><p> The fourth area we highlight relates to the key transitions in a child's development.  Children go from home to preschool to primary school to post-primary school and on to the world of further education and work.  While most children make those transitions without difficulty, children who are vulnerable can fall through the cracks at these times.  The projects show that if we focus on the transitions, such as preparing children to transition from home to school and from primary to secondary level, we can achieve significantly better outcomes for them.  School mentoring, for instance, can be of great help in supporting children through what can be the difficult transition from primary to secondary school.</p><p> In terms of supporting children's learning, which is the fifth issue we deal with, we know that the social and economic costs of poor school attainment are very high.  There are many reasons children do not do well in school.  There is a significant emphasis on literacy and numeracy in the programmes and many have achieved significant improvements in that regard.  There is also, however, a focus on love of learning.  One of the findings was that promoting a love of learning, in addition to focusing on literacy and numeracy, will make a difference.  There is a linkage here with supporting parents in order to enable them to help their children at home.</p><p> The final two issues we have identified focus on how all this work should be done.  It will come as no surprise to members that the programmes showed that parachuting initiatives and projects into communities does not work.  Instead, there must be consultation with communities - finding out what they want, understanding what life is like for them and determining how the programmes can best meet their needs.  The final point we make, under the same heading of how the work should be done, relates to the issue of inter-agency work, which is again very well matched with the point made by the previous speaker.  Inter-agency co-operation is like the glue that makes the whole thing hang together.  What we want to see, essentially, is the various bodies and agencies in the areas of education, health and justice working together.  The local mechanism for doing that at county level is the children's services committee.  That is already Government policy and we are recommending that it be given nationwide coverage this year.</p><p> In conclusion, there is substantial empirical evidence that intervening early in children's lives - a prevention and early intervention approach - offers substantial benefits not only in preventing a great deal of suffering for children and their families and the associated negative social consequences but also in so far as it is cost-effective.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, who is the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on children, conveys his apologies for being unable to attend.  As spokesperson on health, I will do my best to step into the breach.</p><p>  As a father of three young children, all of whom are in national school, I am well aware of the pressures and strains on many parents.  One need only stand at the junction of any busy estate on any weekday morning to see the frantic routine involved in bundling children into cars to get them to school or child care before their parents go on to work.  In many cases, families require dual incomes in order to sustain mortgages.  The witnesses referred to regulation of all paid non-relative childminders.  Is there any room in the future for Mrs. Murphy at the top of the road to mind one's child now and again or even on a full-time basis?  When the existing regulations were introduced some years ago, my peers and I found that the first thing to happen was that child care became cripplingly expensive.  We all are in favour of high-quality services and early intervention, but for the average family, regulation equals increased costs, either through taxation or front-line charges.  Of that there is no doubt.  The reality, of course, is that many childminders are still paid in cash and under the counter.  That is what happens in the real world.  In stripping that out, who is going to pick up the slack?  If we amend the Child Care Act as the delegates are recommending, very few of the Mrs. Murphys will be able to comply with the regulations.  Who then will look after all those children?</p><p>  Regarding the reference to funding of 1% of GDP, international comparators from the OECD and so on, what we really need to know is how much any proposed changes will cost families.  That is the critical issue.  Parents are already burdened with significant financial pressures, as we know from empirical evidence and simply from living in communities.</p> <p>When we opted for a child-care system, it was reasonable.  However, for people living in Dublin, it was extremely expensive and there were those who found it impossible to use.  That is my personal point of view and not necessarily that of my party, but universality is all very well if one has access to the profits from oil wells and gold mines.  We live in a state which has limited financial capacity.  In the context of universality of entitlement, it has been my experience that those at the bottom suffer most.  Let us be clear about it - there is a need to devote more resources to those who need them most.  If we give a universal entitlement without ensuring the full complement of resources is available, effectively we will give children who already have an advantage an even greater one.  On the other side of the coin, those who are already under pressure in realising their full potential will have even less chance of doing so.</p><p> The report refers to the investment required in respect of universal entitlement.  We will need a number of stepping stones to get to that point.  If these stepping stones are not put in place, those who most need our help will suffer.  Reference was made to early intervention.  Some of the children in question cannot wait another week, not to mention a number of years.  We need to intervene at a very early stage, particularly in the case of children who are vulnerable.  Our guests should not misunderstand me - that to which they refer is the point we all want to reach.  What can we do in the meantime to address the problems of children who are vulnerable and require assistance?</p><p> Will the Chairman indicate the amount of time I have left?</p></speech>

However, the services available from agencies throughout the country remain disparate in nature.  For example, some are provided by the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health, while others are provided by local authorities.  Is there a need to streamline the system even further in order that there might be greater accountability and transparency, particularly in research and the development of policy?  As stated, I am merely outlining my experiences on this issue and I do not have in-depth knowledge of it.  We are all aware, however, of children who are dropped to someone's house to be minded and whose parents pay cash for the privilege.  Their parents collect them at the end of the day.  I may be wrong, but this generally seems to work.  Most of the problems in this area have arisen in organised child-minding services.  Will our guests comment on that issue?</p><p>  Are public health nurses responsible for carrying out inspections?  Most members will agree that public health nurses already have enough to do.  I accept, however, that they are eminently qualified to perform many duties.  Is there a need to look elsewhere for people to carry out inspections?  There is already a dearth of public health nurses throughout the country and those we have are under huge pressure.  They are not able to cover the areas for which they are responsible because there are not enough of them available to do so.  Should we look to others to carry out inspections of child-care facilities?</p><p>  Like most Deputies, I knock on doors for a living.  In that context, one can quickly establish whether a household is under pressure.  Referendums have been held on this matter, particularly in the context of when the State should intervene.  There were tragic cases of garda&iacute; intervening too soon in cases that had been brought to their attention and before they had carried out sufficient background research.  I refer to instances where children were taken into care for short periods and where this had a very negative impact on the families involved.  Are there sufficient front-line staff to interact with parents and children?  Alarm bells should immediately sound in the case of children who regularly play truant from school.  This probably indicates that there is a problem within the relevant household.  There is no framework in place for the gathering of the necessary information from the school involved or the school inspectorate and feeding it into the system.  If this were to happen, perhaps we could identify the households which might be in trouble.  Reference is made to putting systems in place and there were very tragic cases where matters ended up in court.  In such instances it should have been patently obvious to an individual professional who had access either to the parents, in social settings, or the children, in school settings, that there was a problem.  However, it was not possible for those within the system to correlate all of the available evidence and determine whether there was a problem.  </p><p>  I accept that my comments may not be directly related to the report.  However, I am strongly of the view that there is a need for early intervention in the case of children who need it.</p></speech>

The Chairman has probably explained that the opportunity to hold this meeting came so late that many members cannot be present to engage with them.  Other matters presented in respect of the tragic cases involving perinatal deaths at Portlaoise which created the need to reorder our business.  I have no doubt that this impacted on the attendance of members at this meeting.  Their absence should not be taken in any way as indicating a lack of interest in the subject under discussion.</p><p>  In the context of Ms McLoughlin's presentation and for the Department's information, earlier in this meeting which began at 9.30 a.m. I welcomed the approval of the heads of the Bill on aftercare for children who have been in care.  I accept that this is not particularly relevant to the matter under discussion.  However, it is nice to be able to compliment a Minister and his Department on progressing matters in a very specific area.  That said, the two matters may be related.  In that context, we are discussing early years preparation.  Far fewer people might be obliged to use care services if the level of investment in such preparation was greater.  The framework is due to be submitted to the Government in the coming weeks with a view to publication sometime thereafter.  What will be the position thereafter?  Approval must issue and, as Ms McLoughlin pointed out, the early years strategy is a constituent strategy in the national policy framework and cannot be finalised until the framework has been agreed to by the Government.  Will she indicate what the envisaged timeline is in this regard?</p><p>  I thank Dr. Hennessy for her presentation and all the work done by the expert advisory group.  I welcome Mr. Wolfe from Start Strong who made a presentation at the same meeting as the Donegal county child care committee a couple of weeks ago.  I recently made a contribution in the D&aacute;il, in respect of which colleagues addressed several queries to me.  For the purposes of clarification, will our guests from the expert advisory group comment on the issue of the second peak - the provision of a significantly longer period of paid leave for parents and the aim to achieve one year's paid parental leave following the birth of each child and the introduction of two weeks paid paternity leave?  Some of the smart Deputies who ticked both boxes, that is, those of <i>pater</i> and parent, were wondering if they would qualify for both.</p> <p>Paid parental leave is an entitlement of one or other of the two parents, not both.  I would like to get clarification on that.  It may seem a silly point but it is not, and not everybody is on board across this argument, even in the singular, never mind in the dual.  I was taken aback by some of the reaction to my making this very point. </p><p> The two weeks' paternity leave around the birth of a child can be timed in that it does not have to be contemporaneous with the birth date of the child and can be taken at a later stage.  Could the delegates comment on that?  It was stated that this would introduce the option for fathers to play a significant role in the care of infants during the important first weeks and months.  Could Dr. Hennessy elaborate on that?  We are talking about two weeks' paternity leave and the likelihood is that we are looking at one year's paid parental leave, which is most likely to be, but is not always, the mother's choice.  Can it be shared?  Dr. Hennessy might elaborate on that.  Am I almost addressing the fifth peak outlined in the submission?</p></speech>

That is a good place.  The fifth peak is the recommendation of the extension of the entitlement to free preschool provision.  This was the subject of a debate that was attended by both the Donegal County Childcare Committee, with regard to the Indecon report, and Start Strong, with regard to universal provision.  I want to get a sense from the expert advisory group on this.  The Minister is wrestling with this in terms of access to resourcing.  In the absence of the monetary capacity to roll out a second year of free preschool, does the expert advisory group accept the finding of the Indecon report commissioned by Donegal County Childcare Committee that it should be provided for a second year?  One-year universal provision is provided across the board as it stands, but it was proposed that the further roll-out be targeted at parents and communities struggling on the margins with economic challenges if we do not have the wherewithal to roll out a second year of universal provision, which would be my natural inclination.  If that were not achievable, would the expert advisory group be prepared to support such a targeted provision, and how would it see it being rolled out?</p><p>  In regard to Ms Nuala Doherty's presentation, the national parenting action plan is very important.  All the information is there to warrant that.  Could she give us more information on where the plan is and how she expects it can be progressed in the period ahead?</p></speech>

I am probably old-fashioned in that I believe the longer one spends at home with one's children the better chance one has of connecting with them, but sadly, that it is not possible for many young people, particularly when they have mortgages and have found themselves in negative equity.  I would agree with the point made by Deputy Kelleher in that I have passed many a housing estate where children are being bundled into the cars at 7.30 a.m. to be dropped off either at the homes of friends or family or at cr&egrave;ches.  I have only one question regarding shared parental leave.  I honestly believe it is the way to go.  There should be an opportunity for a father to take longer extended leave to be able to look after his child, if possible.  Sometimes the mother can be better off financially in her position in work and it might make more sense for the father to share that leave.</p><p>  The owners of many private cr&egrave;ches and playschools find it difficult to manage.  They are trying to earn an income from the business and they have large overheads and staff costs.  I have found many of them that I visited to be very competent and their staff are very well trained.  They sometimes get an unfriendly knocking from some of us about making a business out of the service, but it is an essential service for many parents who go out to work.</p><p>  I want to concentrate on young mothers who live in less-well-off communities who drop their children into some type of cr&egrave;che locally, particularly family resource centres, after-school projects and other such places.  I am worried about the connection between those young mothers and their children.  Young mothers drop their children to school in the morning and probably do not see them until late afternoon, as some children go from school to an after-school project and it does not end until 6 p.m.  It is a long time for mothers to be away from their children.  I am not talking about mothers who go out to work but young mothers who are not working.  I am concerned about those young mothers in terms of the time they have from when they drop their children to a cr&egrave;che or playschool in their early years and pick them up from an after-school project.  Many young mothers in the area I represent go home having dropped their child to school and then do their everyday chores, which mothers would have done in the past when they were at home with their children.  The children are out of the home from early morning until late in the evening when they come out of after-school projects.  As a result of that, there does not seem to be a mother-child connection.  That connection is being lost.    </p><p>  We need to examine how parenting is done.  Information is provided on parenting skills.  A parenting programme was provided in the local school in my parish in the past.  It was targeted at young mothers and it covered the feeding, bathing, minding and caring of children.  It was a wonderful programme.  It did not cost the parents who attended it a penny.  It was provided on a voluntary basis by older mothers who had time to go to the schools.  We need to examine this area again.  In terms of the many young women who do not have educational skills and do not want to return to education, there is a gap that needs to be filled.  We do not want to start baby-minding places because that is not what this is about.  If parents want to put their children into cr&egrave;ches and playschools, they should be a follow-on for young mothers in the community to take up courses.  However, many of them do not do so.</p><p>  Have the delegates an opinion on the cost of cr&egrave;ches, particularly private cr&egrave;ches?  Some people have told me that the cost of putting their children into a private cr&egrave;che is nearly the cost of their mortgage repayment, and they find it very difficult to meet those costs.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being here but I have read the presentations.  I thank the delegates for the work they are doing in this important area.</p><p>  I want to raise an issue concerning a programme in which the delegates may not be directly involved.  In 1996 we introduced the Breaking the Cycle scheme whereby we increased the number of teachers per number of students and we brought the ratio down from 1:28 to 1:15.  Have there been any reports on the benefits of that and, if so, what have they been?  Has the programme made as big a difference as we thought it would? </p><p>  The second issue relates to support in poorer areas, where, despite the changes that have occurred in the pupil-teacher ratio, we still have a big problem with literacy and numeracy skills.  I recently spoke to the principal of a secondary school who encounters a high rate of literacy and numeracy problems among first-year students.  What progress has been made in that respect in poorer areas?  In the context of establishing schemes involving both parents and children, in one area in my constituency, &euro;1.5 million is being invested in a well-drafted joint programme.</p> <p>Is this the best way of dealing with it and is there enough research to support this type of system?  In many poorer areas, thus far there has not been a huge impact over the past 15 years in getting people from primary to secondary school and on to third-level education.  The percentage going on to third-level education in such areas still has not changed dramatically.  Similarly, huge progress has not been made regarding people from such areas getting into the workforce in any way.  Do the witnesses think enough is being done at the very early stages with parents in particular?  Should the focus on this issue be changed?  The programme in my home area to which I referred pertains to a very early stage before the children start school.  Do the witnesses think much more must be done in this area?</p></speech>

However, the Minister has made the point a number of times that it is a challenge.  Ten years ago, arrangements were put in place whereby a tax relief and training were available for those who were childminders and who registered or were notified.  This did not attract many childminders.  As the Minister has stated a number of times, there is a cultural issue in this regard.  There is a need to ensure quality when people are childminding in order that parents can have confidence that the person to whom they are going is a suitable person to mind children.  However, as to how one regulates that within what traditionally has been a highly informal sector is a challenge for the Department.  While we must address it, I do not believe we have come to the solution as yet.</p><p>  Both Deputies Kelleher and Catherine Byrne raised the issue of cost to families.  To be fair, there is no great difference between the cost to families of community and private child care.  The issue is that the cost to parents is high, and this came up at the discussion about the Indecon report.  The costs of child care in Ireland are actually very low because we pay our staff very low wages.  The issue is that in countries in which child care is cheaper, that is due to the level of Government subvention.  Consequently, it is only fair to the sector to make the point that it is not that its costs are particularly high.</p><p>  On the issue of universal versus targeted child care, obviously, in times of scarce resources, one is more likely to target services towards people who are particularly in need of them.  However, there is much evidence that children from disadvantaged backgrounds benefit more from universal services.  Consequently, the challenge for us as policy makers pertains to what is the best thing to do if a block of funding is available.  At present, we have one year of part-time universal service and then we have targeted schemes.  If only small amounts of money are available, obviously one would probably increase the targeted schemes.  However, it is known that in the longer term the benefit is from universal services, despite the fact that this means that some people who perhaps do not need the financial support will receive it.  According to the research, I think the overall outcome probably is that it is better for children.</p></speech>

Ms Hennessy might pick up on that point.</p><p>  As for the inspections, they are conducted by public health nurses at present, but they are separate in that they do not carry out other public health nurse work.  However, the last time the Department appeared before this committee, the Minister stated that the intention was to expand this.  Public health nurses have huge strengths with regard to their understanding of the development of small children, but with other people, particularly with newer qualifications, one could have a variety of action.  However, it is not that public health nurses are trying to do what would be traditional public health nurse work.  A number of members raised the inter-agency issue, and while the agency is part of the response thereto, I acknowledge there still is a long way to go.  The National Education Welfare Board is now part of the new Child and Family Agency, and hopefully these links will build up.</p><p>  On parenting, the Minister has already stated that she will prepare a parenting and family support policy because it has come from a number of areas.  One issue she has raised a number of times is that the State spends a great deal of money on parenting.  Many people run parenting programmes supported by the State, some of which are evidence-based and some of which perhaps are less so.  Consequently, there is an important issue with regard to making sure the parenting programmes supported by the State are the right ones for the parents.</p></speech>

It was not just about the more vulnerable families but also was about putting together all those resources, whether they were originally from the Health Service Executive or the Family Support Agency, and examining the policy for commissioning and providing family support and trying to do this consistently nationwide.</p><p>  In response to Senator Burke's question on the issue of early intervention, as the person with responsibility for early years, I of course would reply that there is never enough money put into the early years.  However, in respect of literacy, numeracy and children going on to third level, the early years are key.  Some of this is about helping parents to understand that it is not necessarily about books, but the first piece is about talking to children.  To revert to the point made by Deputy Catherine Byrne, children whose parents talk to them are more likely to read.  Therefore, one must start with the simple things.  For those who do not read or do not have a tradition of reading, reading children a book can be quite challenging, and people can be quite afraid of it.  Simply talking to children or to babies from the very outset is of key importance and is a much simpler message to give to people.  Part of the development of the strategy concerns what those messages are and how they can be disseminated without either patronising or frightening the parents, because many people are very nervous about what they ought to do.  Every parent wants to do the right thing and we must find ways to help them to do that, albeit not necessarily highly complicated ways.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher asked about the evidence.  Some of the main evidence comes from studies by Professors Kathy Sylva and Edward Melhuish, who were part of the evaluation team that examined some of the early child care provision in the United Kingdom.  These studies were carried out at multiple sites right across the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and it was found that while high quality is absolutely essential for children to benefit, children also did better in the services that were mixed - in other words, those that had children from a variety of backgrounds.  Consequently, there is quite specific evidence to support this, and that is the reason the expert advisory group recommended it.</p><p>  I will clarify what Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Catherine Byrne asked about in respect of parental, maternity and paternity leave.  Maternity leave is leave that we intend to be taken solely by the mother.  At present, such leave is paid for six months, and it is known from evidence that the majority of women go back to work at that point.  We believe it is important to extend this, and our suggestion is that the extension should be made available to either the mother or the father.  We are calling this parental leave.  However, we do not mean it is available to both parents at the same time if they wish; we mean that the parents choose.  We think that the six-month point is probably a good time to allow parents to consider it themselves.  By using the term "paternity leave" we are referring specifically to leave that can only be taken by the father, and that is two weeks.  I completely agree it would be nice not to put too tight a timeframe on it because, depending on the circumstances of the parents, two weeks may be very valuable at different periods.  I completely agree on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Toby Wolfe" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014030600022#X00800"><p>I certainly will comment on the childminding question and might pick up on some of the other questions that were raised as well, if that is all right.  On the specific issue of childminding regulation, I should state clearly at the outset that the expert group's recommendation concerned the regulation of non-relative childminders.  It clearly was not making any comment on grandparents and so on, who probably are the most common form of childminding in this country.  The context for the expert group's recommendations on the regulation of childminding was that at present, if one is doing voluntary work in any of a wide range of voluntary organisations, one must be Garda vetted.  This is accepted as being essential for child protection reasons.</p> <p>That is not a requirement to be a childminder.  I understand the Deputy's comments on the stress that families are under and their need to find solutions.  Childminding is regulated in some other countries.  Scotland is a good example.  It is similar in size to Ireland and is not that dissimilar culturally.  Scotland has a fully regulated childminding system, including 6,000 childminders who are regulated and inspected.  From speaking to people involved in the Scottish system, I understand that it works.  Families like the security of knowing that childminders they turn to are the equivalent of Garda-vetted and have high-quality supports.  They like to know that they can trust childminders.  Childminders themselves like the extra status they get from being recognised as professionals, rather than babysitters.  In addition, it benefits children through additional high-quality supports.  We know the system works, which was the backdrop to the expert group's recommendation.</p><p> I will briefly deal with a couple of the other questions to add to what Ms Hennessy has said.  I agree with what Ms McLoughlin said about the costs to families and the stresses they are under.  The reason the cost of early care in education is so high for families in Ireland is simply that the State does not invest in those services to the same degree as in other countries.  The expert group's report is clear that if we are talking, for example, about measures to raise the quality of early care in education, parents should not foot the bill for higher quality or tightening regulations.  Additional public investment is required, so the Government needs to step in.</p><p> A question was asked about how the State could afford a universal approach in a time of tight budgets.  Ms Hennessy answered that as regards the evidence.  To add to what she said, one of the great benefits of a universal approach is that it reaches all children and one can guarantee that every child benefits.  With targeted solutions - particularly in the context that most disadvantaged children in Ireland do not live in disadvantaged areas - solutions for those who are disadvantaged often do not hit everybody who ought to benefit from them.  </p><p> Concerns about universal provision are understandable in a time of tight finances, but it is worth drawing an analogy with schools.  We do not say that the State should stop providing primary school on a universal basis because we are in a time of financial difficulty.  We say instead that school is something absolutely fundamental and should be available to every child.  Additional resources may be needed, such as through the DEIS scheme in areas of disadvantage, but it is a fundamental universal provision.  The expert group is saying that the same applies to high-quality preschool provision.</p></speech>

It does do so, however, in problematic areas of disadvantage.  That is the question we are trying to clarify.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Toby Wolfe" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014030600023#Y00300"><p>One of the core principles in the expert group's report was what we call progressive universalism.  That means that one provides services universally, but additional supports are provided for families with additional needs on that universal base.  The DEIS model is exactly that.  One is saying that primary school is a universal service for all children, but in disadvantaged areas one provides additional supports on that universal base.  The expert group said that that principle should be applied across the board in terms of health, education and early care in education.</p><p>  What is the priority in times of tight finances?  Is a second free preschool year a priority, or should it be something else?  The expert group's clear recommendation is that, while it called for an extension of preschool provision, quality must be raised first.  That is the clear priority.  The expert group said that quality is the foremost policy challenge facing early care in education in Ireland today.  It is an issue that links to the question of good use of public spending because of the research evidence that says that children only benefit from early care in education if it is of high quality.  If it is of low quality children do not benefit.  The State is putting &euro;170 million annually into the free preschool year as it stands.  That is only benefiting children in those high-quality services.  Where it is of low quality, it is not benefiting them.  The money is only well spent if the services are of high quality.  That is why the expert group has a clear position that quality comes first.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher mentioned things being disparate and not joined up, as well as the truancy issue.  He wondered whether organisations and agencies were aligned.  One of the recommendations from our work is that the local county structure that has been established - the children's services committees - is a mechanism for joining up the various local agencies in a county for planning and co-ordinating services for children.  At the moment there are 16 of those in 16 different counties.  Our recommendation is that they will be brought out nationwide, which is the Government's policy.  Health, education and justice agencies and local authorities are getting together to figure out what is required by way of children's services in a county.  They also consider how information can be shared to get more streamlined services.</p><p>  Parenting programmes are being examined by many children's services committees to see if they meet the needs of a county.  They are ensuring that there is good coverage for both universal and targeted services so there is enough for young parents and parents of teenagers.  In addition, they seek to avoid duplication, which is one of the core purposes of a structure such as the children's services committees.  </p><p> My colleague, Dr. Stella Owens, will pick up on the national parenting action plan.  Deputy Byrne mentioned the family resource centres and young mothers.  How to engage young mothers while their children are being minded is a real challenge.  Some of the programmes in the prevention and early intervention initiative had some really good ideas about how to undertake such engagement.  Working with parents and their children is seen to be particularly effective in achieving change for children.  They had some creative and ingenious ways of engaging with parents.  The use of peers can be effective, as opposed to the very professional approach, which can be off-putting.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne spoke about the Breaking the Cycle scheme.  The sequel to that was the school completion and DEIS programmes, which have been fairly well evaluated.  They have recognised and shown improvements in literacy and numeracy in the DEIS schools as a result of the decreased numbers and additional supports in schools.  In addition, there have been increases in school retention, which have been copperfastened by the recent figures.  We compare very favourably with other European countries with regard to the number of children who finish school.  There is always room for improvement, but increases have occurred, particularly in DEIS schools.</p></speech>

We now have unequivocal evidence, nationally and internationally, that supporting parents produces good outcomes for children.  That might seem slight, but we have not had that evidence previously and we were always focused on providing services to children.  It is great to see that in the forthcoming national policy framework, supporting parents will be one of the key enablers.  It is a key commitment from the whole-of-Government approach to supporting parents.</p> <p>We also have a great evidence base from a range of programmes and approaches.  It is not just based on programmes but also approaches to parenting which have been replicated and evaluated nationally.  There are also programmes and approaches which have been around for a great deal of time including the community mothers programme, which is an inexpensive programme focusing on new young mothers.  We also have a programme which has been delivered through the HSE since the early 1990s.  An important point about parenting programmes is that while they can be expensive, the costs of not having them in terms of poorer outcomes for young people and adults are borne by a range of agencies at a later time.  It is important that we encourage partnership approaches through children's services committees to ensure that statutory and community voluntary agencies work together to fund and co-ordinate services to support parents.</p><p> Dr. Eilis Hennessy was discussing a focus on public health nurses to provide early support and intervention for parents.  It is also about sharing that support among other practitioners in disciplines, including early childhood professionals, speech and language therapists and child-care professionals, to ensure the provision of a community wraparound service for parents to support them ante-natally and post-natally, right through the early years to the age of six.  The thinking behind the national parenting action plan is to gather together those who have responsibility in policy making and decision making around parenting with those providing services on the ground to action what we have been talking about.  If we have evidence, how to do we action it in such a way as to have good co-ordination from early years intervention right through?  Parents should get a menu of options on approaches.  Oftentimes, there has been an importing of a particular programme approach that has been given to or done unto parents in the community.  It is not the right approach.  This will provide parents in the community, whether disadvantaged or otherwise, with a choice of how they want to be supported in bringing up their children.</p></speech>

It is a question of weeks rather than months.  A great deal of work has been done and this gives us a huge start.  There has been a great deal of discussion and consultation but the final approval by Government must have an impact on the final shape of the strategy.  Once the framework has been published, it will be a question of weeks rather than months.</p></speech>

It is not so much a hypothetical but a reality we face.  We have a universal access to one year preschool.  I support the case for rolling out a second year universally.  I hold the same position on child benefit.  It is not a difficult position for me to come to.  If a situation is presenting and a Minister has been partially successful in relation to additional moneys, is it the case that rather than adopt a piecemeal or partial roll out of second-year access, it would be preferred to see the additional moneys invested in improving the quality of the existing one-year provision across the board?  Can the witnesses confirm if that is the case?  It seems like a hypothetical, but it is probably not.</p></speech>

I take the opportunity to compliment the witnesses on the work they have done.  There are many positives in the report.</p><p>  There was reference earlier to the potential for a comprehensive early years strategy - backed up with a national commitment - to shape a stronger and healthier society, strengthen families and break cycles of poverty and disadvantage while removing barriers of inequality.  I do not see any tangible recommendations to address the inaccessibility of child care for low-income working parents.  Do the witnesses feel that is an omission or something that will be dealt with in the early years strategy itself?</p><p>  The report refers regularly to progressive universalism.  That would be utopia.  If we were to get to 0.7% of GDP, it would amount to extra spending of &euro;1 billion in this area.  In the absence of that utopia, should we focus on a targeted approach - leading to universalism - to help families caught in cycles of deprivation and poverty now?  What do the witnesses advise doing in the interim to get to the universalism of which they speak?</p><p>  Maternity benefit is something in which I am interested.  The witnesses may be aware that a colleague in the Seanad produced legislation, which the Government accepted, to provide for a transfer by a mother of some of her maternity benefit to a father.  It is a measure which will not cost anything and could be implemented now.  Do the witnesses support that?  I imagine they do.  I will not ask them to comment on the budgetary change to maternity benefit last week.  It would not be fair as it is a political matter.</p><p>  The report refers to access and inclusion, about which I have a concern.  My concern relates to special education, on which there is insufficient emphasis or focus.  Special education is dealt with currently across a number of Departments, which leads to fragmentation and a disjointed approach.  Would it be better to advocate the full implementation of the special education legislation to ensure we have a fair, equitable system for children with special educational needs?</p><p>  What level of public consultation will take place before the final strategy is adopted?  Can the witnesses give any indication of how much the recommendations will cost?  To be realistic about proposals, we must have them costed.  Will the strategy include a clear, unambiguous timeframe and objectives so we know what is to be achieved each year?  That would allow us to check off whether objectives have been met.</p></speech>

The expert advisory group was asked to make recommendations about how things should work better.  The Minister did not expect the group to make recommendations about the cost, which is a Government issue.  However, the cost to parents is one of the major issues in the early years strategy which we discussed on foot of the Indecon report.</p><p>  There has already been extensive public consultation on the framework generally, of which approximately 20% related to the early years strategy.  There was a great deal of take-up of that.  Following the publication of the report of the expert advisory group in December, we held a sectoral but broad consultation.  We brought in many people and the members of the group facilitated a series of workshops.</p> <p>We got feedback from them.  I do not think the Minister intends to engage in further public consultation.  There may be some discussion, particularly with the group, but there has been extensive public consultation and at this point, it is a question of moving ahead.  The cost of measures will have to be considered.  That is part of the work we have been doing and there will be timeframes.  Reference was made to an implementation plan, for which there are very clear outcomes.  </p><p> A lot of work is ongoing in the area of special education.  In terms of early years education, there is some very good practice around the country; therefore, some children are well supported.  It must be said and it is not often recognised that the majority of children with special needs are participating in the free preschool year.  It is not the case that a huge block of children are not participating.  Our concern is that for some of them, the quality they are experiencing is not what we would like it to be.  A lot of work is ongoing between us, the Department of Health, the HSE and, to some extent, the Department of Education and Science to make sure children can access supports to make the service work effectively in order that parents do not have to go to many different places.  From the early years education perspective, we would like to see not so much a bio-diagnosis but support provided if children need it in order that one does not need to go through a process of diagnosis or assessment.  That is what we are trying to work towards with the Department of Health.  There have been some improvements in some parts of the country, but I certainly recognise that we have a long way to go.  We are in the fourth year after the introduction of the free preschool year.  A lot of things are developing that are not being done as well as they should be.  There have been many improvements for children with additional needs and we will continue to work with the Department of Health.</p></speech>

We were absolutely clear on that point; we emphasised the need for quality throughout.  As attending a service that is not of high quality is of no benefit to children, we are absolutely clear that services must be of high quality before we extend the service in any way.</p><p>  I take Deputy Robert Troy's point that all measures need to be costed.  We emphasise this throughout and I hope that when the strategy is published, it will look at costings because it is very important for us to know what the investment in early years education is because it might allow us to see what savings have been made through making it.  I do not think bringing Ireland to the point where it is at the OECD level of investment in early years services necessarily represents Utopia.  Having an average level of spending is probably something we should be aiming towards and something I would like to see.  </p><p>  On access to early years services, one of our recommendations is that we need full information on the free preschool year.  We need to make absolutely sure that the free preschool year service is being accessed by all children from all sectors.  Once we have that information, we will be able to see whether particular groups are being missed, although as Ms McLoughlin said, there probably will not be many because we know the uptake is very high.  We must also move beyond this because we must look at what is happening within the service to ensure children from all backgrounds and of all levels of ability and disability are fully integrated into the activities of the service.  It is not only about getting into the service; it is also about being included in everyday activities within the service.</p></speech>

We can quantify the number of children who are splitting it over two years, but how are we going to quantify the number who have been refused access?  There is scope to refuse access.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-03-06a.1250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Toby Wolfe" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014030600025#AA00600"><p>I agree with Dr. Hennessey that there was a very clear call from the expert group to prioritise the issue of quality.  In that context, the expert group talked about the "Prime Time" programme entitled, A Breach of Trust, and the lessons to be learned from it.  A clear lesson is that we do not want to see a repeat.  That means that public funding should not be used to support lower quality services.</p><p>  In respect of affordability and access, the expert group had a few recommendations to make.  Recommendation No. 17 calls for income-related subsidies for early care and education services to reduce the cost barrier for families, particularly those on low incomes or experiencing poverty.  It went to state reform of the existing subsidy schemes - the community childcare subvention scheme and CETS - should ensure subsidised places were equally accessible in all areas of the country.  That was a specific recommendation made by the group.  Obviously, the recommendation that free preschool provision be extended would also lead to an increase in access and affordability.</p><p>  On the question about the percentage of GDP invested being utopian, I echo Dr. Hennessey's remarks.  The expert group stated public the investment in early years education was money well spent.  We cannot afford not to do it.  The expert group also stated we could increase it incrementally; therefore, 1% of GDP was not a recommended figure for budget 2015.  The recommendation was that we increase expenditure over a ten year timeframe.  </p><p>  There was a question on maternity leave and suggestions around making the existing provision of maternity leave transferable at no cost.  As the expert group did not comment on that proposal, it is hard to know what it would have stated.  However, its position was that the period of leave should be extended.  It approached this from the perspective of the child in saying every child should be able to remain at home with a parent until he or she was 12 months old.  While allowing the existing entitlements to maternity leave to be shared might facilitate gender equality in caring roles, it would not enable children to remain at home for longer; therefore, it would not quite match the expert group's recommendation.  </p><p>  On special education, Dr. Hennessey was right to agree that it was a cause for concern if any child was missing out on the free preschool year.  That is why the expert group asked for the access figures to be looked at very closely.  It also had a number of specific recommendations to make to make services more inclusive for children with disabilities.  Recommendation No. 18 called for a national policy on access to preschool special needs assistants to ensure consistency and the availability of assistants.  It called for improved access to a wide range of services, including speech and language therapy, with services being brought closer to children and a national roll-out of training programmes on inclusive practice and the diversity and equality guidelines.  These are the subject of recommendations Nos. 19 and 20.  There is a series of recommendations around ensuring services meet the needs of children with disabilities, which clearly was a priority for the expert group.</p></speech>

By the time children get to preschool, support for special needs should already be in place.  A more integrated infant health and well-being programme, with early identification of children with special needs, is one of the best ways of addressing later difficulties.</p></speech>
