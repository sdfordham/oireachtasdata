I am pleased to be here today with my colleague, Aidan Walsh.  We were the partners leading the PwC work on Project Atlas from late September 2008 until January 2009.  I was the main point of contact with IFSRA and the Department of Finance during our assignment.  We have been requested to provide evidence in two key lines of inquiry - the role of advisers in analysing the crisis and, two, the effectiveness of reviews of the bank loan books and capital adequacy.</p> <p>  By way of background, PwC were retained by the IFSRA on 18 September 2008.  Mr. Walsh and I met the Financial Regulator on that day.  Mr. Neary explained to us that he needed urgent assistance to look at the liquidity position and the credit quality of a number of Irish banks.  He explained that he would need us to carry out our work in a short period of time.  Following our meeting, we exchanged a proposed scope of work and an engagement letter.</p> <p>  We commenced our work on Anglo Irish Bank on the following day, 19 September.  Over the following number of days, our engagement was extended to include Irish Life and Permanent and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The original focus of our work was mainly on liquidity, as some of the banks were losing significant amounts of deposits and running out of money.  We attended part of a meeting at the NTMA on 28 September, where we discussed the findings of our work over the previous eight or nine days.  This work was focused mainly on liquidity and the level of provisions that existed in the banks' management accounts at the end of August 2008.  Following on that ... following on from that, we issued an e-mail summarising the information shared at that meeting.</p> <p>  Apart from two e-mails discussing the deposit outflows on 29 September and the deposit inflows on 30 September, we had no other meetings or contact with IFSRA, the Department of Finance or the NTMA from 28 September until 6 October.  On that date, we met the Financial Regulator in his office to discuss the work we had performed on the top 20 borrowers within each bank.  We had not been involved in any discussions around the guarantee or any alternative options being discussed at that time.  Our reports on Atlas 1 were discussed for the first time on the second week of October.</p><p>Following a meeting with the regulator on 8 October 2008, the Atlas 1 exercise was extended to cover all six banks and to increase the sample of the top 20 loans to the top 50 loans and the top 25 land and development loans.  This Atlas 2 was a significant exercise and involved placing a large team from PwC in each bank for approximately five weeks, with us reporting to the regulator on 17 November, approximately six weeks after the guarantee had been announced.</p><p> Our work involved us reviewing lots of loan files and interviewing senior management in each of the banks, with particular emphasis on lending and credit areas.  The scope of our work did not include reviews of smaller developers or any element of actual mortgage lending.  Our reports highlighted the very large exposures that the banks had to a small number of developers and the very high level of asset concentration in property.  The top ten borrowers had loans of &euro;17.7 billion with the six guaranteed banks and that was before any additional borrowings they had in Ulster Bank or Bank of Scotland Ireland.</p><p> The Atlas 2 reports also included, for illustrative purposes, a number of scenarios shown to impact on tier 1 capital of write-downs in various asset categories.  Following discussions on the findings of Atlas 2, the regulator requested that we undertake more work on the top 75 land and development loans.  We referred to this as Atlas 3.  We were to engage a property valuer to assist us with this work and JLL were engaged in mid-November 2008.  They were asked to focus on problem commercial real estate loans and to carry out a review of the bank's valuation of the underlying properties based on an actual medium-term view of potential future value.  JLL reported their findings on 17 December 2008.</p><p> We have submitted statements to the inquiry team dealing with the nature and scope of the work we were asked to carry out.  As the committee is aware, we are restricted by Central Bank legislation as to what we can say about certain confidential information that we received during our work.  Subject to these constraints, I look forward to being as forthcoming as possible in answering any questions you may have.  I will now hand you over to my colleague, Aidan Walsh.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be here today with my colleague, Mr. Denis O'Connor.  As he has stated, we have been requested to provide evidence to the committee on two lines of inquiry - the role of advisers in analysing the crisis and the effectiveness of reviews of bank loan books and capital adequacy.</p> <p>  I also attended the meeting with Mr. Neary, the Financial Regulator, on 18 September which Denis has referred to in his opening statement.  This meeting took place following the collapse of Lehman Brothers the previous weekend and the severe constraints that were being experienced on an international basis in the interbank and wholesale money markets.  As Denis has stated, following our meeting we agreed a specific scope of work and engagement letter.  We deployed separate teams to each bank.  In the first week of our work we focused, as agreed, on the movements in deposits into and out of the banks and in compiling information on the top 20 borrowers by jurisdiction in which the banks operated.  Management at the banks were co-operative and shared management and accounting information with us.  It was clear that the liquidity positions were deteriorating on a weekly and daily basis and interbank and corporate deposits were not being rolled over and where they were, the deposit periods were reducing significantly.</p> <p>  We both attended part of a meeting at the National Treasury Management Agency on Sunday 28 September.  There were participants from IFSRA, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance, the NTMA and from Merrill Lynch, who were the financial advisers to the Government.  We did not have a draft report prepared for that meeting.  We shared information we had collected on the rapidly declining liquidity and the substantial cash deficits that were forecast by the banks to arise in the very near term.  We also shared information on a summary of the loan books at the three banks, the value of loans that were reported as impaired and the value of loan provisions that were booked.  We had not done any substantive work on credit quality at this stage, just nine days into a complex assignment.  Our next meeting, to discuss draft reports with the Financial Regulator and his staff, was on Monday, 6 October, a week after the bank guarantee had been announced.</p><p>As Denis has stated, we were instructed on 8 October to commence work on what was known as Atlas 2.  The results of our Atlas 2 work was reported to the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance in mid-November 2008, roughly six weeks after the bank guarantee had been announced.  The primary focus of this report was, as agreed, on the top lending positions.  It also included the results of stress tests that had been run by each of the banks on their capital adequacy ratios, and based on their own assessments of the probable emergence of future loan losses.  In addition, PwC included two additional scenarios based on higher levels of future loan losses, called scenarios 1 and scenario 2.  The assumptions for these scenarios were developed in conjunction with officials from IFSRA, the Central Bank, Department of Finance and NTMA.  As is clearly stated in the report, these scenarios were for illustrative purposes only, to show the sensitivity of the banks to future losses in these two scenarios.  Our work was not intended to be a comprehensive assessment of the most likely outcome for future losses.  It is also important to note that within the timescale that we were working to, Atlas 2 did not include any third-party evaluation of property values, nor did it include a review of the security documentation supporting the loans.</p><p> Work on Atlas 3 then followed.  JLL's work was carried out independently of our loan reviews.  JLL were given details of the properties comprising the collateral for the loans, but the loan details were not shared with JLL.  The property values were tested based on a long-term outlook for property values, which was formulated by JLL.  The collateral values were not marked to estimated current market value at the time of the review, as there were no ... as there was no liquidity in the market and the market could not absorb a wholesale transfer of property.  The results of the JLL work were consistent with the indicative future losses calculated under scenario 1 and 2 as part of the Atlas 2 analysis.  Mr. O'Connor and I shared responsibility for the work which PwC carried out for IFSRA in the period from 18 September 2008 to early January on the assignments that we have code-named "Atlas".  I too am subject to statutory obligations which prevent me from discussing confidential information which we obtained as part of our engagement on the Atlas reports.  However, I also aim to be as forthcoming as possible and of as much assistance as I can be to the committee in relation to the two themes which we have been asked to address.  Thank you.</p></speech>

I echo the Chairman's earlier welcome to you.  In your statement, you state that PwC's role in many of these meetings was to obtain, analyse and summarise information from the banks.  What was the response to PwC on liquidity, loan exposure and provision of assessments to ... from the other participants on the 28 September meeting?</p></speech>

On liquidity, the bulk of our work at that stage was done on liquidity.  As you probably are aware, the ... as deposits were up for maturity on the banks, they were ... they were not being rolled over, so a number of Irish banks had significant liquidity issues, particularly coming up at the end of September, which was the quarter end or half-year end in some of the cases.  So the information that we had compiled over the previous number of days from the banks' records emphasised to the regulator - and they were participants in the meeting - that this was a big issue and a contingency plan would have to be put in place ASAP.  We were looking at a good few ... into &euro;8 billion or &euro;10 billion outflows in a number of days, and that was happening at the end ... in three days' time.</p></speech>

Now, in your statement you also say that you made comments and observation about possible asset write-downs and scenarios:</p><blockquote>these were for indicative purposes only.  And we did not seek to &quot;mark to market&quot; property assets in the present economic environment (where the market for property assets is largely illiquid); in that context it is difficult to forecast the outturn of any immediate short term assets, sales or asset developments.</blockquote> <p>Did that detract from the exercise?  You knew that they were heavily concentrated, as you reported, in a small number of borrowers and you knew they were heavily concentrated in property, so were we leaving out too much by not investigating what, what was going to happen in property and in, in preparing the scenarios?</p></speech>

So, the focus of our work was very much on commercial property loans and development property loans and getting as much detail behind those and helping to aggregate information in relation to connections and connections could ... loans could be out in a range of different names, different special purpose company names, individuals' names, partners' names.  And we sought to bring together all the loans that related to a controlling individual within either that company or partnership or individual name.</p></speech>

Looking at those, would it be fair to say that - on page 5 - that the institutions estimated a loss of ...  it's not totalled but it starts with AIB thought it would be &euro;2 billion and so on.  That comes to &euro;5.157 billion if I added up correctly.  Then scenario 1 thought it would be &euro;8.6 billion and scenario 2 thought it would be &euro;10.3 billion.  The concerns would be that while you had brought very important information to those meetings, this is way short of the eventual reality of the &euro;64 billion.  So, where did the scenarios come from given that they were so far short of what happened?  And could I add to that?  When the former Taoiseach, Mr. Cowen, was giving evidence - I don't know if you saw his presentation - he said on paragraph 25, the PwC analysis was "hopelessly optimistic" and certainly did not envisage the crisis to develop in the way that it subsequently did.  So, those were scenarios within the banks.  They still had no idea that we were headed towards the &euro;64 billion and the inquiry we're conducting today.</p></speech>

That's for a year.  The scenarios were for year 1, year 2 and year 3 so if you multiply scenario 2 by three years, it's over &euro;30 billion.  And the other material bit of evidence that you need - this was done before the capital ratios in the banks increased from 4% to 10%, which is a significant increase, and also this was one year in advance of actually NAMA happening where the loans were written down to market.  So, our work was done before NAMA, before tier 1 capital ratios increased from 4% to 10%.  And also, there were a number of other issues like the amount of equity in the loans, which we had assumed was equity, wasn't really equity.  It was actually borrowed from a different bank or a different part of the same bank.  And the banks themselves were relying on personal guarantees of the borrowers and those personal guarantees proved not to have any value.</p></speech>

And that budget was framed against assumptions that GDP would decline by 1% in 2009 and unemployment might rise to 7%.  That was consistent with the outlook from the third quarter report from the Central Bank of the same time.  The outturn for 2009 was that GDP declined by something ... 7% and unemployment rose to 15%.  So the, the economic outlook in official documentation at the time was far more benign than the recession that evolved in Ireland over the subsequent two years.</p></speech>

And you mentioned the optimistic view, but there were also people like Professor Niamh Brennan and Jim O'Leary, Morgan Kelly, notably, pointing out there had been 40 property bubbles which he studied in his ESRI article.

And for all of us, the element of surprise when we saw ten borrowers more or less owing &euro;18 billion was very significant, to everybody concerned at those meetings.</p></speech>

That was all looked at and that was factored into our assessment of the risk on those top 22 borrowers, whether it was high risk, lower risk or moderate risk.

Now does that contrast with auditing of banks in Ireland and elsewhere, which didn't see a bank crisis coming down the line?  Is there a traditional view of auditing that just adds up the numbers and says "That's what they are" or one that provides the wider economic advice like you were just talking about there - there are other shopping centres, you know, a lot of the stock isn't going to sell?  Which, where does the balance lie in that?</p></speech>

The two questions I suppose I want to ask: how do you reflect on that now with the fact that Anglo has cost the taxpayer over &euro;30 billion that they&rsquo;ll never see a red cent for?  And, secondly, that when you reported on 17 November on Project Atlas 2 to the regulator, the Taoiseach of the day, Mr. Brian Cowen, came out two days later and he said:</p><blockquote>The report confirms that all institutions reviewed are in excess of regulatory requirements as of 30 September 2008 [ the date the guarantee scheme was announced by Government]  The PwC report demonstrates, under a number of stress scenarios, that capital levels in the covered institutions will remain above regulatory levels in the period to 2011.

This was very much a loan-to-loan situation and there were marked differences between individual borrowers and individual loans in terms of loan-to-values and how the equity portion was funded.  I think one of the issues we found was that while money might have been borrowed from the commercial bank, you might find a situation where the related private bank had lent money to fund the equity portion of that loan.  Or a different bank had funded the equity portion of that loan.</p></speech>

By the end of 2013, &euro;64 billion in the six financial institutions, can you comment on the capital adequacy of the Irish financial institutions, risk over-concentration in property and land and development, arrears identification, interest roll-up?  And, in your PwC report, you stated that - this is core document Project Atlas 1, Vol. 1:</p><blockquote>The latest available capital information for the Banks shows current core Tier 1 ... ranging from 5.9% [in Anglo] to 8.6% [in Irish Nationwide] ... at 30 September before any stress testing or scenario analysis ... The table [below left] sets out the Banks' estimated capital ratios and risk weight[ings] as at the 30 September.</blockquote><p>The table on the right sets out State investment.  So, I suppose, the question is, how do we get from a point with Project Atlas 2 ... Project Atlas 1 ... that you were saying that the banks had ... would have sufficient core tier 1 to absorb any losses?  Take ... And I am factoring into that the lower core tier 2 that's required - I think, it was at 4%; it went to 10% in future time periods.  Even with that situation, how do we get to a point where &euro;64 billion went into the six covered financial institutions?</p></speech>

We had a lot of specific comments in relation to individual developers and collateral.</p> <p>  Just to your point in relation to the Financial Regulator's work in 2011, in my view, the world had changed fundamentally between 2008 and 2011.  NAMA had been instituted, the properties were being transferred over so they were now being marked down at mark-to-market basis, the capital adequacy ratios had increased from 4% to 10%, unemployment had gone to 15%, mortgage books were starting to experience significant stress and default rates, and, by 2011, we were very close to the very bottom of the property cycle.</p></speech>

All right, fair enough.</p><p>I just want to deal with some matters regarding to loan selection samples, the decision criteria and concentration risk for a moment before I bring in the next witness.  The two relevant documents to this, you would be familiar with.  There's your own statement, Mr. O'Connor, and there's the Project Atlas 2, Vol. 1 - the working draft of that.  And in that, it says:</p><blockquote>The top 22 exposures across the six institutions we have received total &euro;25.5 billion, of which &euro;13.7 billion [that's 53%] is in Anglo and &euro;8.1 billion [that's 32%] is in AIB.  The top ten exposures are each in excess of &euro;1 billion, accounting for &euro;7.5 billion [that's 17%] of the top 22 exposures.</blockquote> <p>It then goes on to say:</p><blockquote>78.2% of Anglo's book is lent to property companies, 5.5% for personal investments and 6.3% to hotels.  42.2% of Bank of Ireland's book is in home mortgages.  It appears that concentration limits may be exceeded in a number of cases [as the figures would have indicated as I've read out].</blockquote> <p>In your management discussions, what was the background and rationale for the major lending positions and the level of loan provisions from this examination?</p></speech>

Can I ask you, Mr. O'Connor, just to clarify a comment you made to Deputy O'Donnell on the issue of whether Anglo was solvent on the night of the guarantee?  And I think you used the measure of whether it was able to meet its obligations as they fell due, as opposed to the measure of whether its liabilities exceeded the true value of its assets.  Can you just clarify your statement that Anglo, in your view, was insolvent at the end of September 2008?</p></speech>

Can I just ask that page 5 of the core booklets would again be put up?  And, so this is Project Atlas No. 2.

So, for residential mortgages scenario 1, 15 there is actually 0.15%.</p></speech>

So, under the highest stress scenario, you were projecting that Anglo would not need any additional capital and would still be in excess of the minimum capital requirements two years forward, using the assumptions that you were working under.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

So your projections were based on that assumption, that Anglo would continue to be profitable going forward into 2009 and throughout 2010.  You accepted that management assumption.</p></speech>

Finally, one of the reasons that you cited earlier for the true picture ending much worse was around the issue of loan security, security not being properly tied down, cross collateralisation, personal guarantees not being worth a whole lot when the bank tried to pursue them.  But when did you first identify any concerns in that area, because even going back to the letter of engagement for Atlas 1, point No. 9 in appendix A, you were to select a sample of the customer loan balances at the end of August '08 on the large exposures, and review the loan files, discuss the contents of these files with members of management.  And then subsequently, in October, letter of engagement for Atlas 2, you were required to again review the loan balances at the end of September '08 for the top 20 this time-----</p></speech>

So your engagement did require you to look at the underlying documentation in respect of the loans extended to the major borrowers.  So did you identify any concerns about the underlying security, cross collateralisation and securities not being legally tied down?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.494" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#Q06400"><p>Correct.  We looked at the loan files but security is not kept on loan files.  Security is a separate issue completely and we did not look at security under any files.  That was part of the legal process that happened and that really wasn't identified until NAMA came into being and they transferred the loans from the banks to NAMA.  And as part of the legal due diligence it was found that the security assumption was totally flawed.</p></speech>

So, in terms of the, if you like, the gap between the 28th and the 6th of October, as the week unfolded and you saw the guarantee and all of that, are you saying that there was then no contact at all between you guys - your team - and the Financial Regulator and everybody else that you'd been dealing with?</p></speech>

At that stage, we had moved on to the underlying loans and the ... the liquidity issue had gone now.  The guarantee was in place so that the banks were liquid again, they had deposits, they could open their doors the following morning.  So, now we were going on to looking at the loan books - the top 20 loans in each bank - and because we are dealing with the banks themselves, we actually were not dealing with the Department or the regulator or anybody else.</p></speech>

When we went from bank to bank, like, you had borrower A in one bank who had X amount, then you went through the same borrower A was ... another couple of hundred million in the next bank.

Now, Mr. McDonagh talked about when he ... he had asked in relation to Goldman Sachs and in relation to INBS, he said, you know, there were 33 questions, he referred to at his evidence here, that I want to know the answers to and he had e-mailed them to the Department of Finance.  He said they were terribly basic questions.  He described them as commonsense questions in his evidence and I am just wondering whether or not that, sort of, lack of evidence ... that lack of detail was apparent to you also in the work that you were doing.  He was saying that he was surprised by the lack of information available.</p></speech>

The Anglo crisis point was Tuesday.  It was end of year for them - 30 September - and I said earlier on, lots of deposits were up for maturity on that day.  Depositors from other parts of the world really couldn't distinguish.  It's hard to believe but they couldn't between AIB and Anglo Irish Bank and the contagion effect if one bank was to go would knocked everything else over at the same time.

If you're somewhere over in... wherever you are and you're putting money on deposit, they don't go into that level of detail.  They're investing really in Ireland at that rate of going and our understanding and our discussions with management and with other people was that one bank going in Ireland would have a contagion effect and all the banks would be in the same boat and the amount of discussion that would go on to distinguish one from the other will not happen.  They will just put it into a more secure bank in a different country.</p></speech>

They were organised and structured to meet us, to share information, to make sure that they understand what our questions were, to make sure that they made loan officials available to us, to make sure that we got access to the loan files we asked to see.  Just to go back to your earlier question, one of the things that surprised us a little bit was they didn't have separate analysis of loans that were just interest-only or interest roll-up, that they struggled to identify the value of interest roll-up in their P&amp;amp;L accounts.</p></speech>

Loans got rolled over.  Loans got renewed.  The practice at the time was when a loan matured, unless there was something desperate going on, it tended to get rolled over and they weren't regarded as restructured loans.  They were just regarded as a loan in the normal course.  There was no separate segregation of restructured loans in the analysis that we saw from any of the banks.</p></speech>

A lot of very statistical information in respect  of mortgage books and smaller commercial loans in terms of the development from compliant to maybe missing a payment or missing several payments.

You said to Deputy McGrath earlier on that there was no examination ... that it wouldn't typically be expected of auditors or it wouldn't be kind of best practice to go into the kind of cross-collateralisation of individual loans and to assess that, for example, the equity that you thought that was there and now it wasn't there because, you know, that just isn't the done thing in terms of auditing.

Part of that problem existed because there wasn't visibility across different banks and we had a very privileged position at the time in terms of getting an oversight across those six banks, but we actually didn't have any visibility into two other significant banks in the system at the time.  So even the work we did didn't give us full visibility of what might have been going on with those top 20, 25 borrowers.  We didn't see into the Scottish banks.</p></speech>

She says at 7.13, &quot;Accounting is highly judgemental&quot;.  I'll just give you the quote if I may:</p><blockquote>Many observers of the banking crisis will wonder how bank financial reporting turned out to be so wrong.  The problem with almost all accounting information is that, while it has the appearance of precision and accuracy, it is the product of extensive subjective judgements.  Most non-accountants do not understand the extent to which accounting is a matter of judgement.  Bank financial statements were, with the benefit of hindsight, flawed.  The judgements behind the accounting numbers were too optimistic.  Specifically, receivables from customers were overstated because they did not reflect people&rsquo;s inability to repay their borrowings which subsequently came to light.</blockquote> <p>How would you react to Professor Brennan's submission to us?</p></speech>

He can only make a provision if a condition exists at the balance sheet date.  Sorry, the company can make a provision if the condition exists on the balance sheet date, the auditor will report on that.  If a company had provided for losses that were going to happen in two or three years' time the auditor would not allow that to go through.  So that is the issue more than anything else.</p></speech>

This is offset by reductions of &euro;446 million from commercial / corporate and &euro;7.5 million ... unsecured consumer lending.</blockquote> <p>So the reader could see from that analysis that's written into the report what the impact of those individual changes were, and in the context of the exposures, I take from that that the impact of development land with and without planning permission far outweighed any movement on provisioning on commercial and corporate lending.</p></speech>

As you mentioned, Mr. Chairman, I served as special adviser to the late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, from March 2009 to March 2011.  In this role, I advised the Minister on economic, budgetary and financial policy in responding to the economic and financial crisis.  Among other things, I played an advisory role in relation to three budgets during the period, the national recovery plan, the creation of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and other measures to address the financial crisis.  The three budgets during this period involved &euro;15 billion of fiscal adjustments at an annual rate.  These adjustments were aimed at reducing the Government's huge structural deficit, thereby restoring order to the public finances.  Reducing the structural deficit, by definition, required discretionary measures as the structural deficit would not decline due to a cyclical recovery.<br/><br/>In dealing with the consequences of the bursting of the bubble for the Irish banking system, the Minister's focus was on stable ... on restoring financial stability by restructuring, recapitalising and deleveraging the banking sector.  The Minister regarded the two main banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, as core retail banks that would play important roles in Ireland's economic future.  The banks required capital to remain in operation.  The banks' capital positions were being eroded by loan losses and, therefore, the banks required recapitalisation.  The Minister wanted to minimise the burden on the State of ensuring that AIB and Bank of Ireland were properly capitalised.  For that reason, he afforded the banks the opportunity to raise private capital through, for example, rights issues involving shareholders.  Ultimately, Bank of Ireland was successful in finding private sector solutions.<br/><br/>In the case of Anglo, the priority was to deleverage and de-risk the bank without damaging the rest of the banking system.  The Minister had an open mind as to whether a small good bank could be carved out of Anglo, as proposed by the bank's management.  Anglo had been included in the blanket bank guarantee and, therefore, the Government had to recapitalise Anglo to avoid a call by creditors on the guarantee.  Moreover, Anglo required injections of capital to retain its banking licence and thereby maintain access to Central Bank funding.<br/><br/>In relation to the cost to the State of recapitalising the banks, the upfront costs were large by international standards.  The Minister was confident that the State would recoup some of these outlays and wanted to spread the cost of the crisis over as long a period of time as possible.  It's worth noting that although the cost of recapitalising Anglo and INBS added markedly to measured Government debt - about &euro;35 billion - the way in which Anglo was recapitalised meant that the burden of servicing this debt is relatively low because the debt is largely held within the State sector, is long-term and can currently be financed in the market at a very low rate.<br/><br/>On the issue of right-sizing the banks, NAMA was established by the Government to help deleverage and de-risk the Irish banking ... the Irish banks.  Asset management companies like LAMA ... like NAMA have been used in many countries over recent decades during financial crisis to facilitate bank restructuring and to manage and dispose of troubled assets.  Regarding the overall effectiveness of NAMA, in my testimony before this committee on 4 March last, I noted the assessment of NAMA in an independent study of the agency.  On page 2, the study states, &quot;First, the establishment of the bad asset agency, NAMA, serves as an international example of [the] successful management of bad assets.&quot;  On page 24, the study states:</p><blockquote>The establishment of NAMA was instrumental in the successful management of the Irish banking crisis.  It allowed the banks to recognise fully the losses on these loans, and thus removed an important source of uncertainty for the banks.  Next, the government set only overall targets for NAMA in [the] resolution of the bad assets.  The relative freedom in running down the bad loan portfolio allowed NAMA to realise a relative good price for its assets disposals.</blockquote> <p>Also on the same page, the study draws a key policy lesson for other countries:</p><blockquote>Ireland followed international best practice by setting up NAMA, [an] asset management agency to run down the bad assets of the Irish banks.  Releasing bad assets from bank balance sheets is instrumental in the path [of the] recovery.</blockquote> <p>I share the study's view that the establishment of NAMA played a critical role in restoring financial stability in Ireland.  I would note, however, that an asset management agency is not and cannot be expected to be a magic bullet to solve a banking crisis.  No single policy measure on its own can do that.  NAMA has been part of a set of policies that, together, have helped to restore order to the Irish banking system and contributed to the recovery in the Irish economy.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the efforts to restore international investor confidence in Ireland and its banks, during the second half of 2010 the cost to the State of borrowing on international markets rose to unsustainable levels.  Around the same time, funding in debt markets for the Irish banks dried up and the banks experienced large outflows of deposits, especially corporate deposits.  These outflows replaced by borrowings from the euro system.  The ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland provided invaluable liquidity assistance to the Irish banking system during the crisis.  I believe, however, that the ECB in 2010-2011 underestimated the systemic nature of the crisis in the euro area.  The ECB was overly anxious in the latter part of 2010 to reduce the amount of emergency loans that the euro system had extended to the Irish banking system.  There are also question marks about the ECB&rsquo;s communications with markets about individual member states.  With no access to markets at affordable rates, the Irish Government was forced to borrow from the official sector.  The EU-IMF-ECB programme of assistance provided the State with funds that were needed to finance the budget deficit and provide a functioning banking system.<br/><br/>Finally, Mr. Chairman, the large gains in international competitiveness recorded by the Irish economies ... Irish economy over the 2009-2010 period went a long way to creating conditions in the economy for key sectors of our economy to grow, gain market share and expand employment.  Without these gains in competitiveness, the Irish economy would not be registering the fast growth rates that we see today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  That concludes my prepared remarks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.698" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#X00300"><p>Yeah.  Thank you, Chair.  Mr. Ahearne, you're very welcome this afternoon.  Can I start by referring to your reference on page 4 of your witness statement that the late Minister Brian Lenihan had decided in autumn 2010 to wind down Anglo?  So can I ask, what advice, if any, did you give to the Minister at that time to support the decision because, in parallel with that, the then management of the bank were actively lobbying to have a good bank-bad bank split and to try to carve out a new business from what remained of Anglo?  So what was your advice at the time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.699" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#X00400"><p>I guess for ... for all the time that I served in the role as adviser, I was sceptical that a good bank could be carved out of ... out of Anglo.  I felt that its ... its business model - which was large exposure or large lending to commercial property - that that would no longer be ... be viable.  The management had talked about a new sort of a small business bank but I was sceptical about that.  I think the Minister was open-minded on it.  I never recall him being enthusiastic about this proposal.  The proposal to carve out a small bank came from the management.  The Minister felt that ... the argument was put to him that this carved-out small new business bank ... it might be worth something and therefore it might save the State a few billion in terms of the net costs of the banking system.  So that obviously got his attention.  He was aware that ... that we were going to need more competition in the banking system, so the idea of another bank being there was somewhat helpful.  So any interactions I had with him, he was open-minded on it, but I never remember him being convinced one way or the other.  So he wanted to give it ... this proposal a shot.  It was being sent over to the European Commission for approval and back.  I was seeing all these ... this documentation and I think what happened, as we got into September ... August and September, is that the European Commission had gone very cold on this plan and the Minister felt that it just ... just wasn't going to work.</p></speech>

And what would've been the ... the operational factors in that decision?</p></speech>

I guess the issue was the reputational damage to this bank - whether it would ... it had a ... it would've had a franchise at all.  The management felt that it could, that they could get something new out of it.</p><p>They&rsquo;d even come up with a new name, "An Banc Nua", but I just didn&rsquo;t see ... it would be the old Anglo, and I couldn&rsquo;t see how it could play a role.  Also, banking is about expertise and lending experiences.  The expertise that they would have had would largely have been in lending to commercial ... in often the case, highly speculative properties so I just didn&rsquo;t see how this would ... how this would fly.</p></speech>

And when the decision was announced then in early September 2010 to separate it into a funding bank as such and a recovery bank, what was the anticipated timeline for the overall wind down of Anglo was it going to 2020 at that stage, was that the plan?</p></speech>

The problem with ... it had a large amount of assets, loans.  It&rsquo;s ... if you try to sell loans, deleverage very quickly, you have to take big haircuts on those loans, if you can find a buyer at all.  And if you&rsquo;re taking big haircuts you&rsquo;re adding to the losses so the Minister was conscious that in deleveraging, particularly in an environment with very little appetite for Irish assets, you would have to be very careful and do it over a long period of time.</p></speech>

The point of having the funding back was, while Anglo did have ... did have some funds, it had some deposits, it did have ... it was able to raise funds ... and the Irish banking system as a whole needed funding, private funding.  So the plan was to try ... how can you keep funding in the system, that funding that they had access to, without having a bank that can lend, and that was the argument for that particular split.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.707" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#Y00600"><p>Okay, if I can take you to November 2010 and the negotiations with the troika for the bailout.  Ann Nolan of the Department of Finance stated in her witness statement to this committee that IMF officials were strongly in favour of burning any unguaranteed and unsecured bonds in Anglo.  This was opposed by the EU and ECB officials.  In the event she said the matter was considered at a more senior level in the IMF, and you have said this as well, as a result of US Treasury veto the IMF came down against any such action.  Can you elaborate on what happened at that time and was it a live issue being considered in the build up to and during the negotiations ... the burning of the unsecured senior bondholders in Anglo?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#Y00700"><p>It was a live issue.  I mean I had many conversations with the Minister during the summer of 2010 on the issue of senior bonds, particularly in Anglo because ... now there was no intention of doing anything while the guarantee was in place but the guarantee was going to run out in end-September.  And then some bonds in Anglo and some of the other banks would there ... were therefore going to be exposed, they would no longer be guaranteed.  So we talked about what could be done with those banks and whether there was room, scope for bail-in or burning those bonds as people say.</p> <p> I mean initially I think the Minister wasn&rsquo;t particularly enthusiastic, he saw lots of problems with that and there were problems, market problems, legal problems, and he saw all those.  But as time went on during the summer he sort of came to the position, came around to the position that in principle this would be a good idea.  I mean at one stage I remember, maybe in August or September, he even came up with some numbers.  He was talking about senior unguaranteed bonds after the guarantee had gone, those bondholders taking a haircut as he put it of 50%.  I mean I remember a conversation when he begun with the line &ldquo;The bondholders are going to have to take a haircut.&rdquo;  He had numbers &ndash; 50% for the Anglo, he had smaller haircuts for AIB, 20% or something like that, and then with Bank of Ireland at one stage he mentioned maybe 5% then he said, &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s probably not worth doing it.&rdquo;  So we&rsquo;d exclude that bank.  So the focus was really on Anglo.  INBS didn&rsquo;t have many bonds but that was probably thrown in there as well.</p> <p> I went to the Washington DC with him, because you mention the IMF, in early October and I met with a couple of IMF officials, I think one of whom you&rsquo;re meeting tomorrow.  And they brought up ... we had some discussion with the Irish and they brought up, they said &ldquo;Is the Minister aware that there&rsquo;s about &euro;4 billion of Anglo bonds that are now unguaranteed, senior non-guaranteed?&rdquo;  I said he is aware of that and he was aware of that.  They said &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot of money&rdquo;, and I said &ldquo;He&rsquo;s aware of that.&rdquo;  So it was clear from the short discussion I had with them at that stage that they had spotted this and they had these concerns.</p></speech>

It was also in the Minister&rsquo;s line of sight.  I use the word, mistakenly, &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; because it wasn&rsquo;t that he gave an order at some stage, you know, on 30 September after the guarantee &ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s burn them.&rdquo;  It wasn&rsquo;t that but he, in principle, if the opportunity arose, if it could be done, he did want a haircut of these bonds.  He was very concerned about the market reaction, how that would spill over into the sovereign debt market.  He was getting strong advice from the NTMA that announcing that there was going to be a burning of senior bonds would have a very negative effect on the sovereign&rsquo;s access and it would push up interest rates for the Irish Government.  He wanted to avoid that, but of course that argument became moot when we got into a situation where Ireland was going to borrow from the official sector and that&rsquo;s why that opened up that opportunity.</p></speech>

The IMF on the ground here in Dublin during the negotiations was still supportive.  Why did it not happen?</p></speech>

A lot of it was legal work because there were big legal issues involved.  Later that week, or maybe the weekend, I was speaking with the Minister and he said there&rsquo;d been a conference call, I think ... I understood it was a G7 conference call, but it may not have been, but it obviously involved sort of people at that level, and that it had been decided that the burning of bondholders had been vetoed.  ECB was against it.  That was relayed to me.  The European Commission sided with the ECB and as the Minister put it, although the IMF staff themselves individually, and from earlier on had viewed this as a good idea, the organisation at the executive level took a decision not to do it and therefore ultimately the troika&rsquo;s position on this was that there&rsquo;d be no programme would be available if this route was taken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.713" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#Y01200"><p>And did it come down to that net point in the end that if Ireland had insisted on burning senior unguaranteed bondholders there would not have been a programme, there would not have been financial assistance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.714" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#Y01300"><p>Yes, I mean it was, particularly the ECB&rsquo;s approach was quite strident so there would not have been a programme.  And indeed I mean, the ECB could have done many other things if Ireland had decided to burn senior bondholders of a bank.  They could have said, &ldquo;This bank is now insolvent, you&rsquo;re burning the bonds therefore we&rsquo;re not going to lend to it anymore.&rdquo;  So they could have said the collateral ... this bank is no longer eligible for euro system financing, in which case all the financing would had to have fallen on the State.  So there was ... at ... if the troika were against it and the ECB were against it there was no option.</p> <p> It&rsquo;s also the case, at least we&rsquo;re focusing on the Anglo, the amount of money involved was about &euro;4 billion, from &euro;3.5 billion or &euro;4 billion.  Brian Lenihan had in his mind 50% discount so you might say &euro;1.5 billion to &euro;2 billion.  It&rsquo;s a lot of money but you&rsquo;ve got to balance that against the consequences.  The ECB and the European Commission had their arguments and they put them out and there was a recent European Commission paper looking at, assessing the programme &ndash; I have it here &ndash; and they list eight or nine reasons why they believe at the time Ireland should not have burned the bondholders, and they still think Ireland shouldn&rsquo;t.  They said it was in Ireland&rsquo;s best interest not to.  So they&rsquo;re making those arguments but the Irish side had a different perspective on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.715" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#Y01400"><p>And at that time was it only the remaining Anglo bonds that were on the table in, let&rsquo;s say, November 2010, and by coming out of the guarantee at the end of September there was total of about &euro;19.5 billion that were unsecured and were now unguaranteed and Anglo as you say was about &euro;4 billion to &euro;4.5 billion?  So throughout October and into November was it distilled down to the question of Anglo bonds or were the other ones not considered?</p></speech>

They had everything in.</p></speech>

And I think in <i>ex post</i>rightly so because actually when you look at it the bank was able to raise private capital and recapitalise itself through subordinated debt.  It&rsquo;s not at all clear that senior bondholders in that particular institution should have been discounted.  It&rsquo;s certainly not the ... it&rsquo;s certainly the case that they should not have been ... the losses from Anglo should not have been put onto senior creditors in Bank of Ireland.</p><p>So I think at one stage they may have had closure and given those sort of more general numbers, but I think in the heel of the hunt it came down to Anglo and INBS, which was much smaller, because those were banks that were going to be wound up and they were in a very ... a different position then.  They weren't going to be issuing bonds in the future.  It was easier to distinguish them from any other bank in Europe so ultimately it came down to them. </p></speech>

As you know Mr. Ahearne, about &euro;15.5 billion in total of losses were imposed on junior bondholders - subordinated bondholders.  Much of this was done through liability management exercises where debt holders were asked to voluntarily sell their debt back to the banks at reduced price.  Was that seen as being an entirely different issue to the senior bondholders at that time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.721" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#Z00300"><p>It was.  I mean, I remember being in conversations - during the summer I think it was or maybe early autumn - in the Attorney General's office with several senior counsel.  I am not a lawyer but just listening to the conversation, it was clear that it was much easier to put losses, legally, on subordinated bondholders than on senior bondholders.  Subordinated debt, as I understood the conversation, is explicitly subordinated.  So after all capital has been wiped out, you can then go to the subordinated debt and put losses on them.  But senior bonds are not subordinated to deposits, for example.  So, in a liquidation if you liquidated a hotel, you cannot treat the bill that is owed ... money owed to the launderette different from the money that is owed to the meat supplier.  They are senior creditors.  Unsecured senior creditors all treated equally and that was the position of the senior bonds.  They were <i>pari passu</i>or equal in the eyes of the law to depositors ... much more difficult game.  Now maybe it can be done but it was clearly a much more complicated operation.</p></speech>

Can you explain why that structure was put in place and what, in your view, were the advantages of doing it that way from the State's point of view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#Z00500"><p>I mean, assuming that money ... the bank had to be recapitalised, otherwise the guarantee would have been called in and the bank would have lost access to ECB funding.  The issue is how do you put a large amount of money in, let's say, &euro;30 billion.  One way to do it is to put cash in.  I mean that was done through ... AIB and Bank of Ireland were recapitalised with cash from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  There wasn't enough cash.  So, the Minister could in theory have asked the NTMA to go out and borrow cash, issued Government debt and whatever interest rate prevailed at the time - ten-year money might have been 5% or 6% - borrow that money and put the cash in.  A much, much cheaper way of doing it was to, rather than put cash in, to give the bank, Anglo, Government debt and that, whether it was regular Government debt or promissory note, it is all IOUs.  Because that way Anglo could then go to the Irish Central Bank, present that piece of paper and borrow money on the back of it.  That meant essentially that ...  so the debt was not being issued into the market.  The interest rate that was being paid on the promissory note was being paid to Anglo but Anglo was part of the Irish State as just an internal transaction.  Anglo was paying interest to the Irish Central Bank on its borrowings but the Irish Central Bank is part of the State.  All this stuff is simply internal.  The cost to the Irish State of that recapitalisation was, if you go through it and get down into the weeds, the cost was the cost of funds to the Irish Central Bank borrowing from the Eurosystem and that was extremely low - it is currently zero.  So the point was, this allowed Ireland to recapitalise this bank but the burden, the annual burden - the interest rate which is what really matters - was going to be extremely low.  And that was the advantage of the promissory note system.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.725" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#Z00700"><p>So the difficulty with it was ...  I mean people ...  when the promissory note was restructured a lot of people said, "The expensive, high-interest promissory note is being restructured."  Well, that's a misunderstanding.  The interest rate of the promissory note was irrelevant.  The interest rate was being paid to Anglo.  It's just one arm of the State to the other.  The promissory note was an extremely cheap way of financing it.  The problem with it, it was going away, it was going to be replaced every year by &euro;3 billion of money borrowed in the market.  So it wasn't that this was an expensive ... it was a really cheap arrangement but in seven or eight years' time it was gone.  So, the trick was how could you keep that cheap arrangement in place for as long as possible and that's what the promissory note deal did.  The Irish Central Bank currently owns these bonds.  The interest paid goes to the Irish Central Bank.  Look at the profits the Irish Central Bank is turning over to the Irish State.  That's all internal.  So this was a very cheap way of financing it.</p> <p>  &euro;30 billion is a huge number but if I told you that you were going to finance &euro;30 billion over 100 years at a zero interest rate, then it's irrelevant, it's for free.  So the point is, when you're talking about national debt like that, you have to look at ... it's not just the amount, it's the maturity and the interest cost.  And so the key to the way Anglo was being done was to get the cheapest possible finance and you can't get any cheaper than the ECB.  It created issues because the ECB then, particularly as the amount increased in the autumn of 2010, were worried that this was monetary financing, essentially that the Irish Government was borrowing at a very cheap interest rate but it was happening through the banking system. </p></speech>

How did Minister Lenihan react to the letter from Jean-Claude Trichet of 19 November 2010, which really left nothing to the imagination that emergency liquidity assistance would only be maintained if the Irish State applied for a bailout?</p></speech>

It wasn't that this was a complete shock.  Maybe it was a surprise but what was a surprise was why this was put in writing.  But that message that the ECB wanted Ireland in a programme, that the ECB was desperately unhappy with the amount of money it was lending, it wanted its money back, it wanted Anglo, which is the money we're talking about - the &euro;40 billion that had been lent in ELA - it wanted the Government to pay that back by borrowing from somebody, either from the markets or from the troika.  So it wanted Ireland to replace extremely cheap money through the promissory note arrangement with expensive money and Brian Lenihan said, "That's completely ridiculous.  This is ... How is this going to solve our problem?"  I don't remember talking ... explicitly asking him how he reacted to that but it put very starkly the ECB's view on Ireland at the time.</p></speech>

So again, this would have been in November 2010.  Can you elaborate on that?  What was he hearing?  What was he referring to there and what impact did this briefing have, which Governor Honohan has acknowledged, when he came before the committee here, did happen?</p></speech>

These were people involved in pension funds and insurance companies who would be buying ... you would like to be buying Irish Government bonds, who may have done so in the past, potential ... people who would potentially lend to the Irish Government.  Now, I met a lot of these people - they were very interested in the Irish economy and developments and stuff like that - and quite a lot of them brought up the point that the ECB appears to be hostile to this lending that it's doing - the ELA that's growing.  And I remember somebody, one of them, saying to me - and again this somebody I'm trying to convince that they should lend to the Irish Government at reasonable interest rates - they said, "What are you going to do when the ECB pulls the funding from your banks?"  They were talking about the Anglo stuff, in other words, forcing the Irish Government to go to the market to raise &euro;40 billion, which it couldn't possibly do.  And I said, "That's not going to happen."  And he said, "Well, excuse me, I was in Frankfurt [I think that's what he said] yesterday and I met ECB officials and they told me that's what they are considering, so how do you answer that?"  Now some of this was in the papers in the sense that ... I mean they had, in early October, began to tighten up on liquidity.  They had loosened things during the global financial crisis and they had begun to tighten things up - that was public.  But it was clear that potential investors, whoever they were talking to, were being told that they want ... they're not happy with this and they're considering doing something about it, which would force the Irish Government on to the market to raise &euro;40 billion.</p></speech>

Can I raise the issue of NAMA, Mr. Ahearne?  And you have addressed it in your witness statement and you are strongly supportive of the NAMA project.  But can I put a counter argument to you, that the NAMA project crystallised immediately losses of &euro;42 billion on the books of the banks, which triggered a massive round of recapitalisation?  Subsequently, NAMA sold on the assets at market prices, which were at the lower end of the market, predominantly to US private equity funds or so-called vulture funds, who are now flipping those assets and selling them on for gains.  Would it have not have been better to let the banks work their way through the assets at that time?</p></speech>

And what they ... what NAMA forced and the sales forced the banks, the bankers and everybody else to do was face up to the reality of what had happened.  I guess if ... let me make a couple of points.  One is that the banks would have needed capital to cover those losses in any event, because there was stress tests being done - stress tests done, various PCAR rounds - and, ultimately, there was the comprehensive assessment, which is the stress test done by the ECB.  And even if the loans had stayed on the banks - the books of the banks - they ... those stress tests would have seen potential losses in those and, therefore, the banks would have been required to have capital.  So, it's not that the removal of the loans caused the banks to need capital, the fact that there was huge losses on those loans, irrespective of whether they stayed on the books or not, meant that the banks needed huge capital in order to cover those losses, in order to -----</p></speech>

I mean, if NAMA was about to make or expected to make a profit of &euro;20 billion, or surplus - it's not a profit-making institution - a surplus of &euro;20 billion, then you might have an argument there.  You might say, "Well, they clearly underpaid these banks for these assets.  Look at the huge profits or surplus they are about to make."  And, by the way, most of the arguments at the time were not that the fears, concerns that NAMA was going to underpay, but they would overpay.  But my understanding - and you've had NAMA in front of you - is that they more or less expected to break even or that they would make a small surplus.  That would suggest to me that they more or less got the pricing right, that the value they paid was the value of the loans and, therefore, what happened is that the banks simply were forced to face up to what was reality.</p></speech>

You are welcome back to the committee.  I just want to stay with NAMA, if I may, because in your opening statement you suggested it was unfortunate that the details of the final tranche of loans, the transfer to NAMA was not available prior to the PCAR figures being announced, but you also said that the "subsequent upward adjustment made in September 2010 contributed to the weakening of investor confidence in Ireland around this time".  So, are you saying that the NAMA process contributed to our need for a national bailout?</p></speech>

I mean, the way you put it there is far too stark.  Ideally, the loans would have moved in one go and there would have been a price given and, therefore, the Central Bank, in doing its PCARs in the March of 2010 would have seen that price.  And, therefore, a line could have been drawn over how much capital the banks needed for those particular assets.  Now, the banks needed more capital for different assets, but at least for those.</p> <p>  The reality is, of course, that there was so many loans and, most importantly, the European Commission had set down rules by how these were ... how these would be priced and transferred, and they involved loan-by-loan transfers and due diligence and so that made for a slower process.  So ... now there were advantages to that in that doing that loan-by-loan allowed ... meant that the pricing was much more accurate and it allowed the State, through NAMA, to see the full picture.  You could imagine in theory where a random sample ... a large random sample of loans is taken, they're priced and then all of the loans transfer at that price.  That would be faster, but, of course, it would be more risky because you are only taking a random sample.</p></speech>

NAMA was announced in April.  From scratch, things were ... the legislation was written.  I think it was announced.  There was draft legislation put into the public domain in June or July and then legislation introduced.  There was a Bill in September and it was up and running by later that year.  So, given the size of the operation, given the size of the problem, that was fairly speedy.  I think it took a lot of the Minister's attention and energy, the debate about it but ... look, this was a big ... this was a big policy decision and so, I think he understood that there was going to be a serious debate about it.</p></speech>

I can't ... what it were, but some stories about NAMA's going to bankrupt the country and this sort of stuff.

I think the view was that particular bank, which had big problems at that stage - much of it was still under the carpet - that that particular bank would prefer not to face up to the reality that they had made huge loans - speculative property loans - and there was going to be huge losses on it.  So, I think he recognised that, yes, there was going to be opposition from certain bankers to the facing up of reality, but he was determined that people were going to face reality.  He knew full well - I mean, I had discussed this with him - that the international evidence was that if you try to hide it, the costs don't go away, particularly the cost to ... the public cost, the cost to public finances or ... and to the citizens.  They accumulate over time.  It doesn't get any better, it gets worse and you have to face up to the problem, and he was determined to do that.</p></speech>

You also write about, in your opening statement, about Professor Schoenmaker and the successes of NAMA.  And you wrote about the relative freedom that the agency had to manage the assets.  But, what about the lack of flexibility regarding the bond repayment schedules that were entered into on behalf of NAMA?  Did this result in a rush to sell prime assets to meet these early repayment targets?</p></speech>

You want the asset management company ... you don't want them dumping all these assets onto the market at one stage, at one time, because there won't be enough liquidity there.  If you are in a crisis and they have to sell them at very cheap rates, then they make huge losses.  At the same time, you don't want them ... you don't want the asset management to be around in 20 years' time hoarding these.  And that was the experience of the RTC, the Resolution Trust Corporation, in the United States.  If I remember rightly, after a few years, Congress passed a law, kind of, forcing them to sell a bit more because it was felt that they weren't selling enough, that they were beginning to hoard.  So, that's always a tension.  It looks - and there are different reports that look at NAMA - it looks to me from the outside that that they probably got that about right.  They were selling assets, but they tended to be foreign assets, often in the UK.</p><p>They were getting reasonable prices for those and therefore they were beginning, they were, they were paying off their senior debt.  They held the Irish assets through 2011-12 but then there was a remarkable increase in the appetite for Irish assets over the last few years and they've sold into that.  So by, by luck or by design, they seem to have, have got their timing about right.</p></speech>

No, there is still, the full amount was owed.  Now, everybody knew that NAMA was not going to get back the full amount or anything near it.  It was expected that what they would get back would be about the amount of money they had paid.  After all, that is why they valued it that way.  So, if they could get the full ... I mean I think &euro;72 billion transferred for &euro;30 billion, something like that.  That was something like the numbers.  If they could get the 100% back, the &euro;72 billion, then we wouldn't have this inquiry because therefore there wasn't a bubble, all assets were valued properly.  It was clear that there was a bubble, that assets were not valued, were not at the height of the bubble fairly valued, so there were going to be huge losses.</p> <p>  So that was, but, I mean, for example if there was a developer who had bought a field, and had a loan and the collateral on that was, I don't know, the field plus a bit of a pension fund, and that pension fund rose in value for some reason, and that pension fund would then be part of the collateral behind it, so that NAMA could go after that pension fund as well as the field if they ... so there was no sense of okay, "You've transferred this loan.  It was originally &euro;100 billion.  It's transferred as &euro;100 million and is now &euro;5 million, therefore you only owe us &euro;5 million."  That was never the intention, and I don't, from what I know I don't think that has been the practice.</p></speech>

Just to move on then if I may, when you entered the Department, and what the sense was in the Department of the need for a bailout.  When did that start to come into your view, as an adviser to the Minister, because we have from other evidence that it occurred to some people in the Department around the time of the guarantee, that something like that might be needed down the line, some sort of a cross-stream credit line at least?  And we also have a conversation between Governor Honohan and Minister Lenihan in April 2010 where Governor Honohan says it to the Minister that we're next in line for a bailout after Greece and the Minister said "No, it would be Portugal".  So at what point in the Department are you thinking "We might be in trouble here on the sovereign side"?</p></speech>

There was huge outflows from the banking system.  So, the risk that the country might not be able to fund itself, that was, that was a possibility.  Now I had no discussion with the Minister about that, but it was possible.  The Minister, I know, did meet somebody from ... a retired IMF official, who gave him a sort of briefing about what a programme might look like if Ireland ever needed it and I think that briefing was sent, was e-mailed to me as well.</p></speech>

They saw what was maturing.  The ... I guess the view in, after the banking announcement in, at the end of March 2010, and in the weeks that followed, the Irish banks were actually able to, their funding had stabilised and they were actually bringing in, I think there was inflows of about half a million, excuse me, half a billion a week into the Irish banking system, where there had been outflows for the previous, in 2009, of a billion a week.  So that at least had stabilised.  The Irish banks were able to issue bonds.  I think Bank of Ireland was able to issue some serious bonds, senior bonds.  So the hope was that if things continued to stabilise that the banks would be able to raise private funding.  It was clear they wouldn't raise enough private funding to get over the cliff, and therefore the Eurosystem, the ECB and the Irish Central Bank would have to help out temporarily, but if they had, in the months that then followed, they would continue to issue bonds and raise funds, and they would've been able to repay that.  So the hope was that things would remain stable, and things would continue to improve, well they were improving marginally, but if they continued to do so, the banks would be able to get over that cliff.</p></speech>

Is it not something that you don't announce, or you don't negotiate on, you do it, and then try and deal with it then?

I mean, I discussed this a senior civil servant maybe from May onwards about the Anglo bonds, could they be discounted.  At the time the plan with Anglo was to split it into a good bank-bad bank, and that raises the issue of what goes into the bad bank, what creditors, what funding goes in.  You put the subordinated debt in of course, and that would expose it then, but you, in theory, could put the senior bonds in.  Now you are splitting the depositors and senior bonds then so that had all those legal issues but at least that was, in principle, we discussed that.</p></speech>

I mean, I was ... l remember he did an interview in New York in early October, maybe about 10 or 11 October, with, I think, the <i>Financial Times, </i>and I was sitting beside him and he said to them ... they asked him about the Anglo bonds and he said &quot;Well, I'm not going to coercively discount them but the bank could do a liability management exercise and raise some capital that way, burn 'em that way.  That's a voluntary ...&quot;.  In fact, most of the subordinated debt that Deputy McGrath spoke of was done that way, done through voluntary ... a voluntary way.  Not long after, I remember somebody from the NTMA - a senior official from the NTMA - showing me their BlackBerry and saying &quot;Look at this, I'm getting e-mails from ... here's a headline, I think, from the <i>Financial Times</i>or from somebody, something like Ireland going to default&quot;.  It was that sort of tone to it - &quot;Look at this, I'm getting e-mails from the people we sell bonds to asking me is Ireland about to default&quot;.  And I said, well, he didn't ... the Minister didn't mention anything about sovereign bonds, he was talking about bank bonds and the reply I got was &quot;It doesn't matter, look at the headline, this is creating problems&quot;.  And the Minister said ... I remember the Minister saying afterwards &quot;Okay, I realise I'm talking about burning senior debt and you're [the NTMA are] trying to issue senior deb&quot;.  So, they're different debts but very difficult to do in an environment where the sovereign market is stressed.</p></speech>

Do you recall any conversation between Kevin Cardiff and the ECB when - we're later into November now, this is negotiations and discussions - and the ECB had its own legal advice on whether it was constitutional for Ireland to impose burden-sharing and Mr. Cardiff retorted that, you know, we could have a referendum if we needed to.  Were you there for that conversation, do you recall it?</p></speech>

Kevin either said to me or else I read it in a memo.  I thought that was somewhat later but Kevin's dates might be better than mine but I do remember that ...  I think reading it at the time in a memo that the ECB had said "We have got ... ", "Actually, this would be unconstitutional and we have got our own lawyers".  And maybe - I'm not sure if it was written or whether Kevin said it to me afterwards but "This is the answer I gave them: "I'm sure if we put this to a referendum the Irish people would vote to burn Anglo bonds."."</p></speech>

Just finally, going back to October and I think it was in your travelling over to New York you wrote in a chapter with ... for the book on Mr. Brian Lenihan about a discussion you had with him about the euro and about possibly exiting the euro.  We know from other evidence that there was a unit doing work on potential contingencies should we find ourselves outside of the euro or should a decision we take bring us outside.  But was that discussion a serious discussion or was it just a chat that people have, you know?</p></speech>

I mean, he wasn't willing just to ... if an official said, you can't do A, he'd want to know why can't you do it "Well, there's problems - X,Y and Z problems", "Well, is there a way around the X, Y and Z?".  So, he was very open-minded and he wanted to satisfy himself that whatever route he was doing that that was the right route and that everything else had been considered.  So, was it serious?  It was never ... he didn't, sort of, again, order a big ... a plan to go ahead.  It wasn't that but he wanted to kick the tyres of that particular out-of-the-box alternative route, as he did with many other things.  And so I thought it was just a good way of doing policy making.  He thought everything through, even things that were, sort of, real left field.</p></speech>

So, was this the national recovery plan, this bespoke plan, or was it a separate thing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.815" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#CC01300"><p>No.  So what he wanted ... I mean, Ireland was under pressure in sovereign ... in the markets.  The national recovery plan would have been part of it, so what he wanted to do was get the national recovery plan out, publish it.  He wanted the ECB to say that ... because the banks were separately under stress on their funding, he wanted the ECB to say publicly that they stood behind the Irish banks and provide liquidity.  By the way, the ECB were never asked to give capital to the Irish banks.  It's not that they were asked to pay for a single cent, they were being asked to give funding but they were repaid all the funding.  But he wanted them to say that they would stand behind him.  And then he was willing to enter some sort of precautionary programme and what he had in mind is they could ... I mean, he said they could do quarterly surveillance if they wanted but the Irish State had enough ... the sovereign had enough money to keep going to the middle of 2011.  So he said "Look, let's use that money.  If the markets haven't improved, we can run down that money.  We've just given ourselves time, given everybody time [the Irish State] given the Europeans time."  Because they were in turmoil over what was going on - this was, remember, the start of the EU area crisis - maybe get some money to keep the State going until the end of 2011 and at that stage if Ireland still did not have access to the markets, they had pulled out at this stage, then we'd go for a full-blown programme, but he wanted some time.</p></speech>

And the national recovery plan was a part of that bespoke plan and he wanted to talk to the French and German Finance Ministers about it but Olli Rehn intervened.

He met him first privately then he came into the room with several officials and I was there.  And Olli Rehn said "This is certainly worth pursuing".  That was the point I was making, this precautionary plan.  Later that week ... you know, so it looked at this stage there was going to be some time to develop this, to get the national recovery plan out and talk to the various ... to the two Finance Ministers.  Later that week - the phone call that I am talking about is from Seoul - there was a G20 meeting.  Now, I was in the United States ... I flew to the United States, to New York later, that week so I was in the US but I called back, I think, on the Friday.  There was a ... Reuters or one of the news agencies had a story that said Ireland applying for the ... is going to apply for a programme.  So I called back and said "What's this all about?" and I was told at that stage that a call had come in, I think, the night before, sorry, or at some stage around then, from Olli Rehn to Brian Lenihan and he had said - in the conversation as it was related to me -  "Hi Brian.  It's midnight in Seoul.  Things have changed."  And what he meant was... "Things have changed.", is that on the Monday or Tuesday, there was this potential to explore a precautionary programme but by the time we got to later that week there was no time to do that.</p></speech>

If I can just deal with a few matters myself with you, Mr. Ahearne.  In your statement, you say that the merger of Anglo and INBS and the transfer of deposits was a reasonable approach agreed with the troika.  Then you kind of go on to say, "Ironically, I had identified as an option the transfer of deposits from Anglo to AIB in a newspaper article I wrote in January 2009."  Maybe if I could just tease out some aspects of that with you please, Mr. Ahearne, in that do you think the troika was a material motivating factor in the merger of Anglo and INBS and the resultant deposit transfers?</p></speech>

I mentioned that it made sense in ... I mean, there weren't huge benefits to it.  In fact, the benefits were probably quite small, but they wanted to do it.  One benefit was that it did put the two banks that were being wound down together and, in a way, created a separation between them and the other banks.  I thought that was probably helpful.  And there was a transfer of deposits then from Anglo to AIB.  The country needed the deposits, it needed the funding, but the funding really needed to be in the banks, the core banks that were going to continue, not in banks that were going to be wound down.  So that made sense to me.</p></speech>

I didn't see a future for Anglo and, therefore, Anglo was ... my thinking on it was it was just going to eventually disappear.  You had to do something with the bank's assets and liabilities.  I think I wrote in that article about moving the assets to an asset management company.  Well, that was done through NAMA, and then you've got to move its liabilities somewhere.  So it made sense to move it to another bank.</p></speech>

Could I maybe invite you also to comment upon the suggestion by the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, that the merger of the EBS and AIB and INBS and Anglo was largely "cosmetic", would have been the words he would've used.  In your opinion, was there any real value to be obtained from these mergers?</p></speech>

Is this institution going to last at all?  And so that would've created worries for depositors which were unnecessary.  So folding it into AIB and, therefore, depositors had AIB behind it, at least did provide some assurances to depositors.  I don't think there were any big costs to it but ... and no huge benefits ... but I think there was a benefit for stability or deposit stability reasons, having a bigger bank like AIB behind those deposits.</p></speech>

You recall in your statement that the Minister decided in autumn 2010 to wind down Anglo.  Maybe if I could ask you what advice, if any, did you give the Minister to support the decision to wind down Anglo?</p></speech>

So he would've known my opinion about it.  But, as I said, he was ... he would take advice from lots of different people and he was open-minded on it.  So he was giving the management an opportunity to make their case that you could get a good bank out of it and that would be positive for the Irish economy.</p></speech>

It still had to put the capital in.  It was important that Anglo had a banking licence and was able to get funds from the ECB, because those were otherwise funds that the Irish State would have to do to wind ... to gradually wind this bank down.</p></speech>

I just want to wrap up with a couple of matters there and to say you were in a similar kind of area with Deputy Murphy a few moments ago.  I'll maybe just put the question to you.  I know you came in in 2009.  You came in after the banking guarantee had actually been put in place but you were dealing with the legacy issue of it in your capacity as an adviser.  So maybe if I could start by putting the question to you, did the structure and design of the banking guarantee along with its period of duration - which was two years, the way that it was actually set up - have any bearing on the Irish State entering a bailout programme two years and two months later, after it had been put in place?</p></speech>

I mentioned ... because all creditors were guaranteed.  Of course, it's not at all clear that if there had been a different guarantee or low guarantee that the Irish State would have put banks into liquidation anyway and put losses onto senior creditors, depositors and bondholders.  So the answer to that question, just to have it clear, I think, one has to have a clear idea of what the counterfactual is, and it's not clear to me that in the counterfactual-----</p></speech>

We know it subsequently did a quantitative easing.  By announcing the OMT, it reduced the yields on Italian and Spanish bonds, which had gone up to 7%, up to where Irish bonds had been in the autumn.  It reduced them ... it kept those two countries in the markets.  In other words, it prevented them going into a programme.  Now, the programme ... there wouldn't have been a programme because there wasn't enough money for them, but the point I'm trying to make is, if the ECB - and this is a thought experiment - if the ECB had announced in the summer of 2010 OMT, would the Irish State have required a programme.  And the answer is, in my view, clearly "No".</p></speech>

We would have gone into 2011, but the yields on Irish Government debt were continuing to rise.  They didn&rsquo;t stop rising until we got to the summer of 2011.  At that stage the Irish State would have been well out of cash.</p></speech>

You are familiar with much of the content of it.  When this proposition was being tested against Mr. Trichet - and one of the purposes of engagement with Mr. Trichet was that we would have ... that that engagement would be evidence that could we test with other witnesses, so this afternoon is an opportunity to test it with another witness - Mr. Trichet says: "As you know" - he&rsquo;s talking about the whole ELA funding - "As you know, we could also have continued on our side after having gone from 100% of GDP to 200% - this is Irish GDP - and why not 300% of GDP?  Then what would be the commission of inquiry [referring to this inquiry] be asking for?  You would say, 'Were you totally crazy, at the ECB, to continue, when we were going into the wall at 100 miles per hour, to continue providing liquidity and liquidity and liquidity?' "  So the question I put to you, Mr. Ahearne: is Mr. Trichet right?  If this action hadn&rsquo;t actually happened and his correspondence of November hadn&rsquo;t kind of named the situation, and, as we see from Mr. Cardiff&rsquo;s testimony, that we were going into a bailout programme anyway - if we had just delayed and stayed on the never-never with the ELA, would the bailout have been bigger for Ireland?</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Ahearne.  On your appointment to the position of special adviser to the late Brian Lenihan in March '09, were you satisfied that the Minister and his officials were in possession of the management information that was necessary to make informed decisions such as the initial injection of capital of &euro;4 billion into Anglo in May 2009?  Was there recognition at that time by the Minister and officials that the data available to them was not as accurate as it could have been?  And maybe you could put that in the context that we had PwC in before us this morning and Project Atlas ... one of the assumptions they took was that commercial property would only fall by 4% in value between '08 and 2011, when, in fact, property fell by over 60% during that time period.  And, they were ... PwC were subsequently involved in doing work for the Department in around May '09, at which time you would have been in situ, where they agreed with that &euro;4 billion that the new management in Anglo suggested was needed in terms of recapitalisation of Anglo.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it would depend on ... the amount of recapitalisation that was going to have to be done by the State depended on lots of different things.  It depended on, one, on how much private capital the banks could attract.  There was always, right from day one, I think, some confidence that the Bank of Ireland would be able to attract private capital, and therefore, save the State having to inject the money.  There was more scepticism about whether AIB would by then, so it was seen as a more troubled bank than Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

So that was one of the factors, how much private capital.  The other was how much capital ratios the Central Bank would set and, ultimately, the decision about how much capital the banks needed was a decision for the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  I remember being in a meeting at some stage where there was a bit of a discussion - the Central Bank and the Governor and the Financial Regulator were there - a bit of a discussion about what's a good capital ratio for banking and the regulator abruptly stopped it and he said, "Excuse me, there's only one person who can set capital ratios, and that's me", which he was correct.  It was not a political decision or a decision for a Minister or a Department.</p></speech>

How much?  That was a question for the Central Bank.  It was going to do its stress test and its PCARs, and it was going to report the number ... up to the Minister to decide whether he puts the money in or not, the overall strategy, but the quantum of money that was required of capital to meet capital requirements, all that was to be determined by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

The NAMA process, for example, was going to gather very accurate information - time-consuming, but they were going to drill down and, on a loan-by-loan basis get the, sort of, information that, ultimately, you needed.  So, the Government ... I think at that stage it was very difficult for them to have a complete picture.  How could they have?  You're dealing with aggregates.  This is what the, sort of, reports were dealing with.  If you really want to get into the, sort of, assessment that NAMA did, and that, let's say, eventually, the ECB did in its comprehensive assessment and stress test, then you have to go into incredible detail, one-by-one, and that just takes a lot of time.</p></speech>

It's not the losses as actually recognised today under what I think are imperfect accountancy rules but - you could step back from that, which is in a regulatory or an accounting approach to solvency, and say that, as an economist, this is what is going to happen in the property market and here's the real story with these loans, that there's really not much collateral and stuff like that.

This is ... if you have a backstop, a lender of last resort who is doing what they're doing now under ... it's now under quantitative easing where they're buying and they've driven Irish bond yields to 1.5%.  But even under the OMT, which ... actually, there was no bonds bought under OMT - it was just an announcement - but that did reduce the yields.  And if your yields are low enough, then when you have access you, obviously, have people who are willing to lend, then you can borrow from them and you can do the plans.  I mean, ... if ... and, again, we are talking counterfactuals, which are extremely difficult.  In that counterfactual, it wouldn't have made an iota of difference, I think, to the fiscal adjustments that were made.  Ireland would still have had to do its fiscal adjustments.  The fiscal adjustments that were done weren't done because we entered a programme; they were done because we had a very large budget deficit.  Under a scenario where we could borrow from the markets, the borrowing would have been financed by the financial markets as the Government did the fiscal consolidation it did.  It turns out that that money came from the official sector, but it's still the budget that had to be narrowed.  It didn't make any difference to that.  It may well not made a whole lot of difference on the ... what was done in the banking front.  So, there was work needed to be done.  The issue was who was going to finance it.  Ideally, it would be financed by the markets.  If the markets aren't going to finance it, then it had to be financed officially.</p></speech>

Do you think anything different could have been done in terms of dealing with the banking crisis and the guarantee that would have saved the Irish taxpayer the at least &euro;64 billion gross that has gone into the bank and, more particularly, the &euro;30 billion of funds that are gone into Anglo Irish Bank that they will never see a red cent of again?</p></speech>

There was a lot of work to be done in restructuring the banks and fixing the public finances, but if you're talking about, sort of, avoiding the pain of the bursting of the bubble, then not a whole that could be done on the Irish side.</p> <p>  If we had the, sort of, European mechanisms - the banking union, quantitative easing - and if they had been in place in 2008, that would have made, I think, the deleveraging and the deflating of the Irish economy, and the recovery, easier, but that's not an issue for the ... I mean, that would ... that's not something that the Irish authorities had control of.</p></speech>

They're publicly-owned.  Some of them are privately owned.  Sometimes there's an asset management company per bank; I think, the Swedes did it that way.

We also heard from developer Michael O'Flynn, where he gave evidence to this committee on 23 July and he said:</p><blockquote>By paying low prices for assets and by taking good loans as well as bad, it was always likely that [an] entity would generate a profit.  However, this profit has been achieved at the cost of an earlier recovery in the banking system and serious damage to some developers, who had loans acquired and who had lost an opportunity to work out those loans.  It also ignore[d] the huge hidden cost of fees which [were] not included on NAMA&rsquo;s balance sheets but, instead, added to the account of the borrower.</blockquote> <p>Firstly, what's your assessment of the assertion by Mr. Fingleton that NAMA was a factor in the losses experienced by those banks ... by his bank?</p></speech>

It looks like NAMA is going to recover in or about, say ballpark, as the money it paid.  That sounds to me ... doesn't sound to me, therefore, that they completely underpaid the banks.</p></speech>

So, therefore, even ... if it was allowed to, as a bank would, to work those loans over a longer period of time, it would have gained the benefit.  So to say that they're only going to make &euro;1 billion, for example, you also have to look at how many billions the private equity funds have made in flipping the properties.</p></speech>

You look at the way they have dealt with the mortgage arrears and if somebody wants to stand up and say, "It's clear that these bankers are actually really good at working out problem loans," then by all means go ahead and make that case.</p></speech>

The case is that NAMA's structure meant that they had to sell on these loans.  They had to sell on these assets within a certain period of time and that was being done at a time when the property prices were either at rock bottom or just starting to recover, whereas if the structure of NAMA were allowed to hold on to the loans for a longer period of time, then you would actually receive greater amounts of money and be able to pay back the taxpayer a lot more.</p></speech>

There's always controversies in the war with the RTC as well about people making money buying at the bottom, but that's an operational issue, strategic issue for the asset management company.  They sometimes feel that by getting a few assets out there that begins to get some transactions and that gets things going.  That's a strategic,  a strategic decision.</p></speech>

I don't think it would be fair to lay that on the door of the asset management agency because there was very strong criteria laid down as to the amount of deleveraging that NAMA would have to do as a result of the programme that Mr. Lenihan agreed with the troika.  But can I ask you in relation to the book that's been referenced,<i>In Calm and Crisis</i>, and we talked about burning bondholders, on page 111, Mr. Ray MacSharry, who writes in the book along with yourself said:</p><blockquote>One morning I got a call at about quarter-past eight and it was Brian.  He told me ... he was able to burn the bondholders and he was very happy because the European Central Bank ...

One last question is, in relation to the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme, which the banks that were guaranteed signed up to and gave effect to the guarantee, there is ... one of the paragraphs there allows for the Minister to amend the terms and condition and also to discontinue the guarantee for any financial institution if it weren't keeping with the objectives of the scheme, which is that it is in the public interest.  So, therefore, the scheme allowed for the cessation of the guarantee to any individual institution at any time.  It's in article 8 of the scheme.  Was this ever considered?  Because you've made numerous comments about you couldn't burn bondholders until the guarantee extinguished in 2010, but the scheme actually allowed for the Minister to do that at any point.  It had to be at six-month intervals that the review would have to take place.  Was that ever considered?  Did you look at this scheme in relation to that purpose?  Was there ever a view offered that we should maybe look at this area in terms of discontinuing it for the likes of Anglo Irish Bank?</p></speech>

So if you look at statements through the summer of 2010, the Minister didn't say, "Well, we're now considering what we'll do after the guarantee."  The legal advice was "Say nothing."

It was mostly deposits, and so that rescinding, which would have had all these various negative effects to do with essentially what would have been perceived as a default - as a default on the sovereign promise, but it's still a default - it would have had all those negative effects, and you would have - if you wanted to save money, ultimately you would have ended up discount ... discounting the positives.

They probably drowned out any voices that were giving warnings like that.  I think I said last time in front of this committee that ... that a huge amount of people were benefitting from the bubble, and therefore I know people didn't want to hear that.  It's also ... I mean, the ... presumably politicians, the political system, would ... in hearing something like that would have turned to, say, the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank or officials and got their opinion on it, and I think the consensus opinion was that whatever's happening is manageable.</p></speech>

I just want to finish this point.  PwC were paid millions of euros and they had access to all the banks.

Mr. Ahearne, I'd just like to quote an extract from Ajai Chopra's witness statement which will be put into evidence and to ask you a question and I know you haven't ... you haven't seen it before.  He said:</p><blockquote>It is understandable that there is a strong sense in Ireland that burden sharing between Irish taxpayers and bank creditors has been unfair.  In late 2010, remaining unguaranteed and unsecured senior bondholder exposure was about &euro;16 billion, somewhat above the magnitude of envisaged fiscal adjustment over the next four years.  [The] comparison made the issue very visible.  [He said] Even if spillover risks dominated, the question remains - why should Irish taxpayers have to bear a disproportionate burden to address wider euro area concerns?</blockquote> <p>So, do you believe that Irish taxpayers did bear a disproportionate burden to address wider euro area concerns arising from the banking crisis?</p></speech>

I think the Europeans have given their reasons why they didn't think that was in the Irish interest or in their interest and I think a big part of the reason was they felt there would be contagion to ... elsewhere in the euro area.  So, that does mean that Ireland ends up having a higher cost for systemic ... in order to save ... for systemic reasons.  That said, you know, Ireland ... there were various things done that saved Ireland a lot of money.  For example, the reductions in the interest rates in the summer of 2011.  So, although there was stuff taken away on one hand, there was a break given on the other hand and how all those things ... how they all net off is a difficult ... difficult calculation.</p></speech>

And, finally, to what extent, Mr. Ahearne, was the failure to get to the bottom of the black hole in the Irish banks over the course of 2010, when there were various statements about the likely overall bill ... is it the case that the markets eventually lost confidence in our ability to get to the bottom of that black hole and lost patience in that?  How significant a role did that play in Ireland ending up in the programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-09-09a.1093" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Ahearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015090900002#KK03200"><p>I wouldn't overstate it.  The main reason we ended up in the programme was because of the scale of the losses combined with the huge budget deficit and everything that was going on in Europe with the euro area crisis.  So, there was a big combination of factors.  It would have been better ... and it was ... if a number could have been produced and we didn't have to revise up the numbers during the course of 2010 as you explained it.  There's no doubt about that.  So, I think the revisions would have hurt investor confidence some and part of the programme was to bring in BlackRock to do this very detailed analysis.  That was ... turned out to be a very good thing to do.  It helped in confidence.  So, I think it would be better if we could have got to the bottom of it earlier but in terms of would it have ... would that would have meant that we could have retained market access, I very much doubt it.</p></speech>

I just want to return to where we left off with the national recovery plan just to finish up a couple of questions on it.  Could you just outline the relationship between that plan and the bailout that we entered into - in terms of it being a blueprint for it - when you were made aware that this was actually going to become a blueprint for what would be our bailout and then the parties that became involved or if parties became involved subsequently once you'd begun your work or the different people had begun their work once the bailout became ... came into view, please?</p></speech>

I mean, Brian Lenihan had said that he thought it would be ... the Irish public would find it difficult to accept the huge amount of budgetary adjustment that was still to come - and it was obvious that it was still to come - to correct the public finances if it appeared to be imposed from outside and, therefore, he thought it was important that if there were to be more adjustments - and there were going to be - that they would be seen to have been part of a plan made ... written in Dublin.  So, that was a big part of the reason that there was a big push to get the national recovery plan done and, therefore ... before the troika plan was announced.</p></speech>

I mean this was ... the national recovery plan was written in Dublin.  I ... there was some comments ... when Olli Rehn came in early October ... excuse me, in early November, he must have had some details because he ... there was a little bit of discussion there about the national recovery plan.  I mean, he just had some suggestions about if you're going to do a VAT increase, you shouldn't do it right away, you should do it in the future so people can ... will, anticipating the VAT increase, bring forward their expenditures.  Just some issues like that.  But the plan was written in Dublin and it was more than presentation.  It was ... the Irish Government felt - Brian Lenihan felt - that they were doing the right things, they had been doing fiscal consolidation, that they were on the right path and they wanted to go down that path and they knew they had more information about - economically and politically - about the Irish economy than ... than outsiders did.</p></speech>

I mean the quantum of money needed was sort of mechanically produced.  Certainly for the public finances, it was a case of crunching the numbers and seeing what sort of money would be borrowed and what maturity ... what money was maturing.  On the banking part, the number was extremely large.  I remember that - &euro;35 billion.  It seemed very unlikely that we required &euro;35 billion but the troika had insisted on that.  They ... I mean they wanted large amounts of capital put into the bank.  I think the ECB wanted large amounts of capital because the bank would then have cash and they could repay the ECB.  Ultimately, the ECB's ... my perspective on it's approach to this in the weeks leading up to the entering the programme was that they wanted their cash back and they wanted restructuring of the Irish banking system in a way that the Irish banks would repay quickly the amount of money that had been borrowed and the ECB would, therefore, reduce their exposure.</p></speech>

I mean at the ... when ... I remember in 2009, there was a lot of arguments about ... the Government surely should be putting money into the economy not taking it out.  I think that was a misunderstanding of the nature of the deficit.  As I mentioned in the statement, it was a structural deficit.  I mean ... and I said a few times in the statement if the work that was done over that period had not been done, the Irish economy would not be growing at 5% this year.

As we can now commence our public hearings with Mr. Alan Gray, former board member of Central Bank of Ireland, the Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session.  Can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off?</p> <p>  Our first hearing of this afternoon is with Mr. Alan Gray, former non-executive director, Central Bank of Ireland.  Alan Gray has worked as an economist for over 30 years in Ireland, Europe and in Canada.  He was a non-executive director of CBFSAI, that is, the Central Bank, from December 2006 to September 2008 and was ... and recently he has been appointed by the Government as director of the IDA.

If you're directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you're entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You're directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.</p><p>I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations are being taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can lawfully be given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it'll mean that some information can be dealt with in a summary or aggregate basis only, such that institutions or individuals will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on your screens to your left and right and members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  With that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the affirmation to Mr. Gray, please.</p></speech>

Chairman and members of the inquiry, as an independent economist, I believe that major mistakes were made resulting in the economic, fiscal and banking collapse.  To help understand what happened and why, I have submitted new evidence which I hope will help the inquiry.</p> <p>  I am head of economic research with an independent Irish economic practice.  I joined the board of the Central Bank in 2007 as a non-executive director.  I am on the Government's labour market council and I'm a director of the IDA and chairman of London Economics.</p><p>My work as a professional economist has given me the opportunity, since the 1980s, to offer impartial advice to consecutive Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments and to governments internationally.  When I provide any informal advice to Irish Governments or serve on State boards, I request that I do not receive fees or expenses, a practice which is not unusual for economists.<br/><br/>My statement and supporting material comprises extensive notes and documentation I prepared at the time.  I ask the inquiry to excuse any references to publications that I have written.  These are not to give these publications particular significance but to confirm views I've held at key periods.  As well as the banking crisis, I have provided evidence on a number of matters of public interest, including the meeting on unemployment with An Taoiseach on the morning of 28 July 2008 - I should say with the then Taoiseach - and the continuation of the discussion over dinner at Druid's Glen.  These show that I expressed concerns on the economy at the meeting and I suggested actions to prevent an even more rapid decline.  I have provided the 11 pages of detail notes I circulated at the discussion and I would be happy for the inquiry to release those notes and all of the approximate 80 pages of evidence I have submitted.<br/><br/>I turn to the causes of the crisis.  Before addressing the significant Irish mistakes, I would like to briefly note the design flaws in the single currency and the impact of the bankruptcy of Lehman's.  In considering why there was a crisis in Europe, the Nobel Prize winning economist, Professor Krugman, concluded:</p><blockquote>The truth is that the story is mostly monetary.  By introducing a single currency without the institutions needed to make that currency work, Europe effectively reinvented the defects [...] that played a major role in causing [...] the Great Depression.</blockquote><p>The design flaws in the single currency were particularly significant for Ireland due to our dependence on trade and the declining competitiveness.  In a publication I edited prior to Ireland joining the euro, one of my academic collaborators, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, then at Harvard University, concluded that, &quot;This is surely a big risk for a small country that is dependent on export-led growth - perhaps even too big a risk.&quot;<br/><br/>One concern I hold is that the required European institutions and policy instruments may not yet be in place, and complacency exists about this inadequacy.  The ideologically driven US decision on 15 September 2008 to let Lehman Brothers go bankrupt resulted in an international banking crisis of a scale not seen since the 1930s.  The combined impact of the Lehman collapse and design flaws in the single currency had horrendous implications for Europe.  The larger lending countries and international agencies tend to downplay these two factors and shift most of the blame onto peripheral countries.<br/><br/>Central Bank directors are understandably reluctant to criticise the international institutions, particularly given their extensive funding support for Ireland.  However, I believe the decision of these institutions to prevent Ireland from burning the bondholders and requiring Irish taxpayers to then bear the cost was morally indefensible.  This forced a small state to socialise losses and impose the burden on ordinary working people, while private sector gains were protected.<br/><br/>Reference to the design flaws in the euro and the Lehman's collapse is not to deny the scale of the Irish mistakes.  An unpredictable and once-in-a-century external crisis was made much worse by a gross over-dependence on the construction sector and by a failure of bankers, policy makers and regulators to adequately respond to the risks.  In my view, the key Irish mistakes were mistakes in lending decision by banks, the failure in the regulation of banks, the impact of Irish macroeconomic policy and intervention in the property sector.</p><p>The lending decisions made by individual banks provided loans to developers and others which turned into bad debts.  I believe this was the fundamental driver of what happened in Irish banks.  There was also a failure of bank regulation and deficiencies in stress testing and macro-prudential policy.  Detailed stress tests were undertaken but failed to anticipate the scale of the impending crisis or the level of increased capital needed.  In the aftermath of the guarantee, I felt the banks were still in denial of the necessary capital requirements.  Writing to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to provide a contrary, external perspective, I said the banks' own assessment has indicated that they may have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements after dealing with anticipated bad debts and that PwC reports suggest that, under certain scenarios, this may be the case.  My letter states that I do not accept this and concluded that action on capitalisation is needed and as soon as possible.</p><p> In addition to deficiencies in the interpretation of stress testing, there was insufficient regulation of banks and inadequate capital requirements, particularly in the period from 2000 to 2007.  Accurate information was not obtained on major borrowers dependent on property and I raised this at board meetings.  More intensive involvement in the approval of directors of banks would also have been appropriate.  At my very first board meeting in 2007, a new policy was outlined to dampen the growth in the property sector.  This new measure required the banks to increase to 150% the capital requirement for lending to speculative property.  It was suggested that speculative lending could then only happen after 50% of the property value had been pre-sold.  Not surprisingly, as an economist I was very supportive of this revised action as I felt it was beginning to respond to the risks.  However, I accept this proved far too little and far to late to address the scale of the crisis which emerged.</p><p> Regulatory weaknesses did not cause the crisis but they did not do their job and did not prevent the crisis.  This weakness was not due to the absence of supervisory powers and these cannot be used as an excuse for the misjudgments about endogenous risks and the failure to discover practices in the banks.  Once developments in individual banks became clearer and more information was available to the board, I concluded that radical changes were essential to the system of financial regulation.  I wrote to the Central Bank and Financial Regulator and to the Department of Finance, and I quote, "It has been my opinion for some time that radical changes are needed to the system of financial regulation in Ireland" and I went on to say that "I believe a fundamentally changed basis for regulation of financial institutions is required".  As you know from the letter I have submitted in evidence, I suggested major changes at the time, including: increases in the minimum requirements for capital; new controls on lending practices; changes in the incentive structures; greater levels of inspection of financial institutions; new requirements for approval processes for directors and senior management; greater levels of public disclosure and transparency; changes in the relationship between external auditors and the Central Bank; and measures to facilitate and protect internal whistleblowers.</p><p> Irish macroeconomic and fiscal policy also played a part in the period post-2000 and there was an over dependence on stamp duty and VAT from property and there was too rapid growth in public expenditure.  This was based on a belief that economic growth would continue, together with a consensus on the desirability for increased public expenditure.  Concerns on macroeconomic policy were a recurring theme for myself and for other economists in Ireland years prior to the crisis.  In a publication to honour Dr. T.K. Whitaker's 80 years, I indicated - and I'll quote - "while the lessons of previous policy errors are well known, there are potential dangers ... particularly if public expenditure programmes are planned on an assumption of continued rapid growth."</p><p>I emphasised the difficulty of adjusting public expenditure programmes which could result in the emergence of a large deficit and an expansion of public debt if there was an economic downturn.  <br/><br/>Interventions in the property sector also fuelled the fire of property prices.  In 1997, I argued that policy should, by appropriate planning and zoning decisions, ease the shortage of land for residential housing.  Restrictive zoning meant windfall gains to property speculators, increased housing costs and opened up opportunities for corruption.  The escalation in property prices was further fuelled by the build-up of tax incentives.  My views on this were informed by an investigation of property tax incentives which I and other economists completed for the Department of Finance in 2005.  My views at that time indicated that while the incentives were supported by a range of vested interests, including investors, property developers and banks dependent on property, my report concluded:</p><blockquote>There is absolutely no case for further government incentives.  Continuing to approve new projects would contribute to oversupply and represent a clear waste of scarce public resources.</blockquote><p>I strongly recommended the abolition of the vast range of property incentives.  <br/><br/>On crisis management, in the period since I joined the board of the Central Bank in 2007, there were detailed plans by the Central Bank to deal with the liquidity position and a domestic standing group was established jointly with the Department of Finance to examine risks and responses.  The focus was on liquidity risks and this intensified over time.  On 16 September 2008, a note to directors of the Financial Regulator pointed out that term funding was effectively closed.  It stated that post-Lehman's, public concern was increasing and the tone of media comment was systemic rather than institution-specific.  Investors were cutting lines to Irish banks and requesting breaks in the terms of deposits.  In addition to two institutions which were being very closely monitored, one of the other major institutions advised that, &quot;If markets do not improve, they risk breaking liquidity ratios in a matter of weeks.&quot;  This signalled to me the danger of a full scale run on the Irish banking sector.  <br/><br/>While liquidity risks were monitored, there was much less understanding of solvency and this was a major mistake.  This may have been due to the belief that solvency and liquidity were separate.  The week of the bank guarantee, leading to the guarantee decision, resulted in Irish citizens paying a very high and unjust cost for the banking crisis.  The guarantee was not thought up on the night of 29 September but arose from extensive analysis by the Department of Finance, Central Bank and regulator, with the teams of external advisers.  I first heard of the guarantee as the main option being considered in an emergency joint Central Bank-IFSRA board meeting which was called on 25 September but this option must have been developed earlier.  As is evident from the official board minutes which I have supplied you with, the Governor and the Central Bank and the Department of Finance indicated that a guarantee of the liabilities of the six financial institutions was being considered.  There was no suggestion at that time of any option to guarantee some banks but to nationalise others.  The Central Bank board was never asked for a view on that revised option.  The minutes of the Central Bank board meeting on 25 September show: &quot;The Governor and the Chairman of the Authority briefed the meeting on the ongoing discussions with the banks and the Department of Finance regarding the liquidity position of the Irish banks and policy options to be considered if the position continued to deteriorate&quot;.  It indicated that the Minister for Finance ... the then Minister for Finance had convened a meeting on Wednesday, 24 September, attended by the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the NTMA and the Department of Finance and, I assume, by their advisers.</p><p>The Government had also met with the Minister ... the Governor of the Central Bank had also met with the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  The outcome of this meetings ... of these meetings was that the Government wanted policy options for the future of the financial sector to be developed and refined, as a matter of urgency, over the weekend for consideration by the Cabinet at the start of the following week.  Following a detailed discussion on the liquidity pressure on all the banks in what was referred to as ... unprecedented international credit crunch, it was suggested that if the liquidity situation did not improve, the issue for the authorities would be how to address the whole financial system.<br/><br/>The minutes highlight what was seen as the key policy option.  The minutes explicitly noted that a key policy option for the weekend was whether or not the Government should issue a formal guarantee for the liabilities of the six domestically-owned credit institutions.  If a decision was to be made in this regard, the Government would require the formal advice of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator on the necessity of such a measure and its impact.  On hearing this proposal, I raised the following questions at the board.  Would it be illegal under state aid rules?  I suggested I expected it would be challenged.  How could one minimise any exposure to the State?  Would financial markets and the public view this as a credible guarantee?  Had all alternative options been fully exhausted?  And was there any hope of ECB-wide action before consideration was given to such a radical decision?  I knew the Government ... the Governor of the bank had been very actively exploring ECB action for some time.  And how would any guarantee interact with the necessary restructuring action on individual institutions in order to ensure viability?  I clearly remember the representative from the Department of Finance and the Governor and some other directors also expressed strong views on that latter issue.<br/><br/>I made suggestions to attempt to protect the taxpayer and reduce the risk to the State if such a policy was subsequently decided - firstly, by ensuring any guarantee was for as short a time period as necessary and I argued against any long-term guarantee.  I indicated if the State felt obliged to give a guarantee, we should get out of these obligations as quickly as possible.  I suggested that in the event of any guarantee, the banks should be forced to pay in full for this and the payment levels should reflect the value to the banks and the risk to the State.  Some of these points which I and the other directors made were reflected in the formal, signed-off, agreed minutes of the meeting, and I quote:</p><blockquote>In discussing the option of a Government Guarantee, the meeting noted that the market would have to be convinced of the credibility of the Guarantee.  There was also a likelihood of a legal challenge on competition grounds if it was confined to the domestic credit institutions.  The meeting agreed that the issue of an explicit Government Guarantee supported by a willingness to supply additional funding, if necessary, warranted detailed consideration.  In this context, however, it would be necessary to identify a viable long-term strategy for the industry and [to] pursue this objective vigorously.</blockquote><p>I had the distinct impression at the meeting that a guarantee of all banks was the favoured option and probably the only option in serious consideration which was explained to the board.  I felt strongly at that stage that all available options should be examined, rather than simply the guarantee option, and I decided that evening to write to the Department of Finance, the regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank.  As is evident from my correspondence of 25 September 2008, which I have provided to the committee, I outlined my view on the principles which should be followed: (i) State exposure to be minimised where possible; (ii) the knock-on [impact] of any decision should be taken into account and the minimisation of contagion; the cost of any assistance to be paid for fully by the sector, even if this means over time; and wider economic implications should be factored in.  The best option was, in my view, a European-wide, EC-wide ... ECB-wide action.  My opinion was there was a reluctance by the ECB to recognise the scale of the problem or to take necessary responsibility for their role, but I felt pursuing that action was desirable.<br/><br/>On the option of a guarantee of all six financial institutions, as proposed by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, I was ... felt there was a need to consider different formulations if this was the chosen option.  I also raised explicitly my concern over whether it would postpone necessary restructuring of Irish banks.  I had concerns over whether a guarantee would be effective in preventing a bank run and what would be the market reaction.  This was still a major concern to me in the days and weeks after the guarantee was announced.  I also suggested the payment terms could be structured in a way which would neutralise the competitive impacts, i.e. some banks should pay proportionally more.  My suggestion implied much higher costs for institutions such as Irish Nationwide and Anglo.  I highlighted the need to take action to reduce Exchequer exposure and to restructure the sector.  In my written advice on 25 September 2008 to the Governor of the Central Bank and to the Department of Finance, I outlined three other issues which I felt needed to be addressed as well as the immediate issue of liquidity, namely, a response to individual banks with liquidity issues, actions to reduce risk and potential exposure and plans to restructure the sector.  The options for action in relation to individual banks which I proposed on 25 September 2008 included management changes, restrictions on loan ... on loans and a restructuring plan, including managing-down of loans.<br/><br/>Over the next few days, it was very clear the crisis was getting much worse and I felt a bank run was now a real possibility.  There was a sense of incredible panic in world financial markets and policy makers were in uncharted waters.  I had come to the view that Ireland could face the total collapse of the banking system and the ECB was taking the attitude that we were on our own.  By the time we had reached 29 September, I knew from the previous board meeting of the Thursday - of the 25th - that the Government ... that the Governor had indicated he'd previously been against the guarantee but then ... by then felt things had changed.  The decision of the US Congress to reject the bailout plan ... their bailout plan - which was an extraordinary decision - meant there was now ... while there was up to then a chance that liquidity pressures would ease, things had now fundamentally changed.  My view is that given this development, the guarantee was the sensible option, but of the terrible options available.  However, I always understood that a response to the liquidity crisis would at best only buy time to address the underlying problems and to deal with the issues in individual banks.  As soon as the guarantee was introduced, my focus was on how to minimise the exposure to the taxpayer and I wrote, on 20 October 2008, to the Governor of the Central Bank and to the Department of Finance stressing that &quot;the day we give a time limited guarantee is the day we need to plan for exiting&quot;.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would like to very briefly suggest a number of issues for possible consideration by the committee that may help to avoid another crisis, namely: supply issues in the housing market, unless addressed, could result in the re-emergence of rapidly increasing property prices and rental prices and even greater levels of homelessness; Governments might usefully consider using any unexpected windfall gains in Exchequer return to repay national debt, rather than fund tax reductions or increased expenditures; the Central Bank should base its policy in regulation on an assumption that any regulated institution could fail and, if it is of systematic importance, will be bailed out, and regulation should reflect that; there is ... a renewal in bank governance and personnel should be a requirement; changes in the nature of auditing of banks are required; and banks need to incentivise long-term gains, rather than spurious short-termism.  Thank you, Chairman and members of the inquiry.</p></speech>

I have given independent economic advice to governments for about 30 years and it&rsquo;s known, I think by most governments, that because of the international nature of my work that I might have perspectives that other people don&rsquo;t have.  That is not to say, Deputy, those views are right but they are often somewhat different from other views and they are always independent and are never influenced by vested interests.  And governments, I ... in my experience find it very hard to find independent economists who can give independent advice and are willing to do so.</p></speech>

Nobody asked me to prepare an agenda for the meeting.  I was invited, on behalf of the Taoiseach, to attend the meeting to outline any views I had on unemployment and on the ... what was happening in the economy - which is something that many governments have done at different periods - and I put in a lot of effort in advance of the meeting, including talking to some international economists about their perspectives and ideas, and I turned up at the meeting with my detailed notes.

I did not have an agenda but it was the case, and this may be a version of semantics which might suggest that was an agenda, I turned up at the meeting and I was at ... there was a general discussion about whether people had ideas and I said "Taoiseach, I have detailed ideas in a number or areas and I have copies of my notes and would it be appropriate to share those?" And so it did actually become the agenda for the discussion but it wasn&rsquo;t a ... I didn&rsquo;t see it as an agenda, I saw it as an outline of my views on what was happening, the adequacy or inadequacy of the Government&rsquo;s response to that and what should be done.</p></speech>

He said, and I quote, "The rise in unemployment was something that, you know, we would all have been conscious of, nobody needed to raise it."  Now, that is a direct contradiction of your witness statement where you refer to the Druids Glen meeting, on page 2 of your statement, as the "dinner on unemployment", and you've referenced that in your comments.

I was also very aware, as an economist, of the scale of growth in commercial lending that had occurred over the period from 2000 to 2007 and I don&rsquo;t have ... I didn&rsquo;t have time, Deputy, before this attendance to look at every reference but I do have some references that I would like to bring to your attention.  At the regulator board meeting in, I think, mid-2007 - and you have, I understand, a copy of the board meetings - I did indicate that I felt it was necessary to examine in more detail the top property exposure in the banks.  I suggested that there would be merits in examining the holding company accounts of the banks and ... sorry, the holding company accounts of the property developers or major borrowers, and to review whether information provided by the borrowers to different banks varied.</p><p>Were they telling the same story to each of the banks?  And what was the credit assessment of those property developers by individual banks and was there any difference?  Because it was known to people on the Central Bank and the regulator board that they shared the same clients.</p><p> I'd also point out that in December 2007, the banking supervisory division, following on from that point I made, conducted a series of inspection of the banks to look at the commercial property lending.  And in January 2008, the IFSRA board were informed of a number of issues that were raised.  I'd also like to encourage you to look at the board minutes for the regulator meeting in May 2008 when I again raised this at the IFSRA board and requested more investigation of the risk exposure of the banks to major property developers. </p><p> Just finally, and I won't ... I know you've lots of questions and I'm happy to answer them all.  In June 2008, I asked of what progress had been made on this and I was informed at the board of the regulator that arrangements were being made to interview the heads of lending in the main banks in order to examine in more detail the principal exposure to property developers.  And they were notes I had kept at the time but if I had time to forensically go through all of the-----</p></speech>

I did not invite them to come, they came.

And I think they were very keen to try and find any option or any channel to, you know, have their views aired.  They came and they ... Mr. Drumm had a presentation with him.  I told him I had a very busy day and, you know, was there ... I'd prefer he would just tell me what was the purpose of the meeting.  And he went through a number of points in his presentation.  He didn't leave it with me.  I told him these were issues that they should talk directly to the Central Bank on, and to the Financial Regulator, and that was what happened.</p></speech>

My final question then is in relation to the actual phone call which I touched on at the start.  The options that were discussed ... I just want you to briefly outline them.  Mr. Cowen, in his testimony to the inquiry said - and I want to quote him directly - he said:</p><blockquote>I phoned him and asked him what he thought of a guarantee option being used.  Mr. Gray emphasised that providing a guarantee would, obviously, give an advantage to those institutions to whom the guarantee would apply <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>competitors, since they would have the backing of the Irish Government. </blockquote> <p>In your statement to <i>The Irish Times</i>on 14 January 2011, written on your behalf by a legal firm I understand, provided to the inquiry-----</p></speech>

Sorry, it's been presented to the inquiry ... I misunderstood it if that's ...  I wasn't trying to mislead myself.  You state that you were asked to "obtain your views as a director of the Central Bank on the likely market reaction".  The question - really, there's two parts - what were the options discussed?  And which is, in your recollection, the correct recollection of events of that phone call?  Did Mr. Cowen ask you what you thought of the guarantee option being used or did he ask you the much narrower question about what the likely market reaction to that option would be?</p></speech>

First of all, the option that the Taoiseach asked my view on was the very same option that was raised at the Central Bank board meeting the previous Thursday, which was an option to give a guarantee to the six financial institutions.  And he asked me what did I think of it and what would be the market reaction.  I don't see a difference in that-----</p></speech>

That is a very narrow thing.</p></speech>

I wrote that statement, not with any legal assistance or any legal advice.  And I had a significant dilemma in writing that statement because I have always operated as a very professional economist, operating with commercial confidentiality.  When that issue became a matter of national public debate, I was extremely ill at the time and I wasn't quite sure how to respond.  Other people didn't make any statements and I still don't know to this day did I made the right call in trying to balance professional confidentiality and in terms of having public disclosure, but I made that decision.</p><p> And it ... I have had discussions with the current Taoiseach and previous Taoiseachs and previous Ministers and I would never dream of making a public statement about them.  Even this morning before I came to this inquiry, I was asked advice from very senior people in the Prime Minister's office of another eurozone country.  But I don't go issuing public statements about contents of discussions I have, because it is the epitome to independent professional conduct.  But I made that decision and I don't know whether it was the right one or not. </p></speech>

You're saying that you don't take a fee from the Central Bank and you provide your economic advice free.

Now, on the Central Bank, you joined in January 2007 and the crisis happened in September 2008.  So, you had about 20 months.  Could you describe your experience?

But I was very aware of the risks in the banking sector and the risks in the Irish economy and I raised those risks on many occasions.  In terms of Deputy Phelan's questions, I outlined some of the risks I raised and looked for action to get more information on the commercial property lending side and I also raised issues in relation to the stress testing of banks and a whole range of other issues, some of which are in the detailed evidence I've supplied.</p></speech>

And they related to examining in terms of what was likely to happen in the commercial, buy-to-let market, in the property sector.  It was very much in terms of looking at and encouraging an investigation of what would happen during a property crash, because all booms end in either a slow down of property prices or, in a significant number, in terms of a property crash.  So, I think there was a very wide range of risks identified and research done, but they came to the wrong judgment on what actually happened.</p></speech>

I think undue comfort was taken from the fact that the previous decline in Irish property prices, which happened a number of previous ... a number of years previous, had not caused any difficulties for the banking sector.  I think the second reason was they felt from their detailed international research, which they presented in terms of the draft stability reports, that the probability was that if there was a property crash, it would be a property crash that would decline over time rather than the scale of immediate crash that happened following the Lehman Brothers.  And also Senator, I think because they believed that the magnitude of that property price decline would be less than actually transpired.</p></speech>

They weren't my figures, but in terms of the level of evidence given to the board, I felt that there was a good granularity on those numbers and estimates and, if we've time, I would like to talk a little bit about the stress testing that was undertaken, the research that was done for it and why it actually failed to anticipate the scale of crisis which emerged.</p></speech>

I think from the time I joined, really, a few things were happening.  First of all, that incredible mountain of build-up of lending to the property sector really was just hitting its peak.

I think that there were a number of issues in relation to property-based tax incentives.  One was that they meant that funding was being directed into, effectively, a unproductive part of the economy rather than supporting the internationally-traded sectors and this was of concern to me, not just as the crisis emerged but much earlier.  I think it was in the early to mid-1990s, in a book that I wrote that, Senator, you may be aware of because one of your colleagues, Professor McAleese, was one of the contributors.  But in my chapter on that book I pointed out, back then, back in I'm not sure if it was 1992 or 1995, that no new taxation measures should be introduced for any activity in the non-traded sectors of the economy.  And I pointed out that views ... viewed in isolation many of the tax incentives for certain property and other investment might appear defendable in order to achieve a specific local or other objective, but viewed against the background of the need to encourage tradeable activities, such activities cannot in general be justified.  And I purposely went on to say that there should be no further extension to the timescale for them, and I pointed out that whenever a date is set for the cessation of investment-related property tax incentives, strong vested interest groups will emerge to seek an extension of such deadlines.  The case will be argued that investments were in the planning stage and it would be inequitable to have the cut-off date.  I said, alternatively it could be argued the level invested had not taken place and the timescale should be extended, but I said-----</p></speech>

So was liquidation rather than the nationalisation mentioned in your memo to Kevin Cardiff dated 25 September 2008 not a more favourable option for the Exchequer?</p></speech>

I know of no expert economist in this area that thinks in the middle of coming into a bank run that a sensible option would be to liquidate a bank and we do have one example of that, Chairman, namely, in Lehman Brothers and we know the impact of it.</p></speech>

Just finally on that, was a political guarantee rather than a full blanket guarantee considered as an option by you or the board members and, if not, why not?</p></speech>

And on the second page of the detailed document that I put in, I put a potential option would be that there would be a Government or ministerial statement indicating a State guarantee would be provided if required or an intention to provide such a guarantee but with no immediate commitment or legislation.  And I gave my assessment of that would be that that would be in danger of being seen as too weak and it would probably be better not to have any such statement.  And that if in the scale of the crisis we were facing, any systematic wide initiatives must be seen as sufficient otherwise it would fail.  And I think the idea that in the scale of the crisis that people were facing that a general political statement from the Government would've prevented a bank run, I think would not be a credible option.</p></speech>

In your witness statement you advise, "I felt so strongly on this that I wrote to the Central Bank Governor-Financial Regulator and to the Department of Finance and suggested radical reform of financial regulation."  Now I just don't want to get the details for the moment but would you consider it normal practice for a board director to write to the Central Bank Governor and the Financial Regulator expressing concerns?  Would that be normal practice in the main?</p></speech>

It wouldn't be a normal action, Chairman, in a normal situation if there was not major problems and the reason that I sent it to the Department of Finance and to the Central Bank and not just raised it at Financial Regulator board meetings was it would require Government action and legislative changes as well as simply a matter within the remit of the board.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Gray.  Mr. Gray, can I go to Vol. 1, page 65 to 66, its core document, it's the letter of the 20 October that you wrote to Mr. Kevin Cardiff?  You might just summarise what were the main points you wanted to raise.  It is about an exit strategy from the bank guarantee, the reasons why you wrote the letter so early in the guarantee period.  How was the letter received?  What action was taken on foot of it?  You sent a similar letter to the financial stability committee in the Central Bank and what action was taken on foot of this?</p></speech>

So, in terms of when ... why did I write that letter and what was the nature of it and what was the content, I was aware at that stage that there was a very widespread perception both in Ireland and internationally that the guarantee had worked in terms of stemming the outflow of funds to the banks.</p><p>But I was very much aware - and these were the same points I was making in my letter of the 25th, before that decision was made - I was very much aware that there was significant risks for the exposure for the Exchequer.</p></speech>

They said, "This is a temporary guarantee to deal with an exceptional period of financial turbulence."</p></speech>

So I said ... the key points I was making is that I knew that there were ... everyone was very involved in implementing the guarantee but I felt that we ... policy makers needed to focus on the effective risk management for the guarantee and the exit strategy.

That was only highlighting a risk but in terms of what action was taken, I outlined what I felt was the action that was needed.  And I said that that risk management strategy must have, really, changes in the regulatory process, including effective monitoring, assessment, quantification and control of risk.

I was ... if I had been asked to attend a meeting on banking or Anglo Irish, I certainly would.  But I was asked to attend a meeting where the chairman of Anglo Irish Bank was there and the chief executive of Smurfit Kappa - I wasn't even aware that he was a director of Anglo Irish Bank - and Mr. Fintan Drury, who was a friend and adviser to the Taoiseach on communication issues.  I have been invited by many different Ministers and Taoiseachs to attend meetings, and I don't have a say... I don't control who the other attendees are but I did not see any difficulty with this.</p></speech>

Thank you, Mr. Gray, and you're very welcome.  Mr. Gray, I'd like to focus on your time as a member of the board of the Central Bank, if I may.  You resigned from the board when exactly?</p></speech>

I'm not quite sure the source of that information.  It certainly isn't information I've given the inquiry, and I don't believe it's factually correct.  Or actually it says I was there till 2008 ... September 2008.  I joined ... I got my first letter appointing me, having agreed to join, when I came back from my break at Christmas.  I got it in January and I attended my first board meeting at the end of January 2007.  I remained on the board until the new Central Bank Commission was appointed.  I was on the board that oversaw the appointment of Professor Honohan as the new Governor; I was on the board of the regulator that saw the appointment of Matthew Elderfield as the new regulator; and I was on the board that started to implement a very different form of financial regulation, very much in line, Deputy, with what I had earlier written to Finance and the Central Bank.</p></speech>

Without repeating yourself, is there anything you want to add to what you submitted in your written documentation?</p></speech>

I think that I did have some further thoughts on stress testing, yes.  Just in preparing for this session, Deputy, I went back through more detailed notes I had and I can&rsquo;t quite remember whether I put this in my statement but the very first presentation on financial stability and stress testing that was made to the central board ... bank board when I was a member was at the end of March 2007, and I and a number of other directors asked for further work to be undertaken on five areas: the exposure to the decline in the price of building land; the consequences of the continuation of recent trends in credit; the effect of changes in interest rate on affordability and debt levels; analysis of the levels of provisioning and what would be the impact of a collapse in property prices.  At a subsequent meeting of the Central Bank board, I and other directors asked for further work to be completed on three areas: commercial property; the buy-to-let market and the emergence of sub-priming.</p></speech>

Yes.  And they did do additional fact research, including an examination of the details of a range of property price collapses.  I have submitted that in part of my evidence to the commission and it has been deemed as not appropriate for me to put into my evidence because of section 33AK but I am happy to talk in a more general way about that if that would be helpful.</p></speech>

There were a couple of other things around that I wanted to ask.  The other question was in relation to you or your company ever being employed or contracted to do additional work for any of the individual banks on their own stress testing or any measures like that.</p></speech>

It&rsquo;s page 34, Vol. 1.   One of the initial points you put down is the danger of a system-wide response being seen to be too weak, &ldquo;Any system wide initiative ... must be seen as sufficient so ... there is not ongoing initiatives launched.&rdquo;  Is that in effect you saying that anything that is done needs to do the job and do it in one go, if you like, because we heard something similar from Mr. Hurley when he was before the committee?  So I&rsquo;m wondering if when he put that view into the room on the night of the guarantee it was because of the conversation that the Central Bank would have had, but because of that view that you held in particular.</p></speech>

So, can you ask how the NTMA might have had that view right up until the moment of the guarantee, whereas the view of the Central Bank from the 25th was it&rsquo;s going to be a guarantee?</p></speech>

And as soon as I was appointed to the board of the Central Bank, in January 2007, I wrote to the Standards in Public Office Commission, described the type of work we had done for Bank of Ireland and asked did they consider there could be any material conflict of interest.

It was one of the worst examples of a small state being forced to socialise losses (i.e. for the taxpayers to pay the costs) while the private sector gains were protected.</blockquote> <p>And you also said under the paragraph, &quot;Week of Bank Guarantee&quot;, page 16:</p><blockquote>The Bank Guarantee decision resulted in Irish citizens having to pay a very high and unjust cost for the banking crisis.  Providing a linkage between the sovereign and the liabilities of the financial institutions proved to be a very costly decision.</blockquote> <p>Mr. Gray, is this by way of recanting from your support and advocacy for a bank guarantee?  Because, obviously, the bank guarantee was the origin of why the sovereign and the taxpayer were eventually saddled with this massive debt.</p></speech>

I could understand that the ECB, for international financial stability reasons, might require and make a decision that bondholders shouldn't be burnt at any particular time because of the impact on world financial markets.  What I feel is that would be an extremely unjust decision if that was a decision that was made but when combined with the requirement that to meet that worldwide international stability objective one member state would have to pay the cost, was morally indefensible, and I don't make those comments lightly.  The guarantee ... that is about burning the bondholders.  The guarantee issue is ... the guarantee was an unjust decision but was, in my view, the sensible decision, even though it was unjust, given the terrible options that were available.</p></speech>

I did not give any advice in relation to the bailout but I did point out in the evidence that I submitted that I and some other external economists were invited to a meeting in the Department of Finance, some time in October, to give our external assessment of what was likely to happen in the economy and what would that mean for public finances, and that was prior to the bailout.  But I put that in for full disclosure in case people would be saying, "Well, that was actually related to the planning for the bailout," and it may well have been.</p></speech>

And the reason I took that view was the Central Bank board was very much an advisory board that looked at general economic developments.  As an independent economist, I would assume that if there had been any contrarian views - I am, despite what might appear in this session ... am an extremely informal individual and I would be known in the economics profession, and people would ... I assume, if anyone had any different views ... would have come to me.  And economists, by their DNA, are hard to stop giving their views.</p> <p>  But on the regulator board, when I was appointed I thought, maybe because the Central Bank and the regulator was a sort of a hierarchical and a deferential type organisation, I thought it would be important to ensure that there were no views about problems or particular issues which were ... people didn't feel at liberty to express to the board, and I asked could I meet all the department managers on a confidential basis, one to one.</p></speech>

He didn't, and he didn't tell me what the Government were likely to do.  He asked my view.

In fairness, you know a lot about the way government works and you know that most people take a holiday in August, and your timeline was, if I might suggest, very ambitious indeed.  So it looks like a very ambitious project that, if you like, really didn't fit with the kind of meeting.  It looks like something from another day or another time that would have required a huge big meeting with a lot of people, and not that kind of meeting.  And I am just asking did you have another purpose when you wrote that document originally and did you then think, "Oh I'll take that with me because it would be useful."</p></speech>

But one of my frustrations as an economist, not only in Ireland but in other European countries, is how slowly governments tend to move and I knew there was a looming crisis.  I felt that the response to date by policymakers was inadequate and I pointed that out - it's printed in the document that I circulated.</p></speech>

It's just coming up to 5.30 p.m.  I am just proposing a very short, five-minute break.  In doing so, just before we do break, I just need to ... just let Mr. Gray know and inform him that once he begins giving evidence, he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to his evidence on matters that are being discussed before the committee.  With that in mind, I now suspend the meeting until 5.35 p.m. and remind the witness that he is still under oath until we resume.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Mr. Gray, in your witness statement you advise:</p><blockquote>In attempting to respond to the crisis, extensive use of external advisers was made by the Department of Finance.  This included both international financial and legal advisors.  Their advisory reports were not shared with the Central Bank non-executive directors and I have only briefly seen some of these subsequently when they have been publicly released.</blockquote> <p>Were you surprised that the advisory reports were not shared with the Central Bank non-executive directors?</p></speech>

You go on to say in your statement, on page 17, that "there was no suggestion at any time of any option to guarantee some banks but nationalise others, yet we know from evidence from AIB and Bank of Ireland that this was their preferred option ... of those two banks.  And, obviously, we know from the board minute that you were informed that AIB and Bank of Ireland were not on board with the six-bank guarantee option.

The legal advice to the commission is that I can't include any of that in my public evidence, so that was the only reason for that.  My recollection of the minutes ... and not the minutes ... my recollection of the meeting was the Governor explained that there had been discussions with the banks prior to this issue coming before the board of the Central Bank.  And he explained that the major banks had up to this date been against a guarantee but that, given the evolving liquidity position, that their view may have changed, and that the Governor and the Department of Finance were going to continue their discussions with the banks.</p></speech>

Can I ask you in relation to the public statement that you include here to <i>The Irish Times</i>where you say you were invited to attend an informal dinner with the Taoiseach in Druids Glen; &quot;The purpose of the invitation was to provide independent ideas [and] stimulate economic growth and to reduce unemployment in Ireland&quot;?  Could people suggest that that was misleading in the way that you weren't invited to a dinner in Druids Glen to discuss unemployment and the economic growth in Ireland until you actually were invited to a private meeting in a private residence of a former director of Anglo Irish Bank and, when that meeting hadn't concluded, you were asked to attend a dinner?</p></speech>

And the reason I didn't; I was trying to balance my approach which would not be to normally issue statements to the media about policy discussions with any governments and when this broke I, as I have mentioned, I was extremely ill and I was trying to make a decision of what to release to balance my normal confidentiality arrangements and to respect people's privacy but yet to put out in detail what the content of that interaction was about.  I was aware that the house we were in was an ordinary family home.  I did not know whether Mr. Drury had children or not and I felt I would be breaching a personal issue of normal privacy and I didn't think it mattered, the location of it.</p></speech>

Did you consider that that would be the type of detail maybe that the public would have been looking for at that time, instead of corroborating what had already been released through questions to the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

The number of the ... a number of issues that you were discussing with the chairperson of Anglo present and two of the directors was, for example, additional equity for investment in start-ups; measures for credit fund for home ownership; we have guarantee that mortgage interest tax breaks wouldn't be reduced when the Government would have to implement different austerity measures; social housing ... local housing ... social housing being sold back to the owners to invest in construction.

You suggested that the document was altered.  It was not altered.  I highlighted in blue my interpretation of what I was discussing under each of the headings.  I can, of course, supply the commission with the original documentation but it is identical to the document that you have, which has all the points in black other than the ones in blue.  The issues, if I can go on to the particular areas that you're raising, were not about banking.  They were about trying to deal with what I felt was the escalating unemployment position and the issue of social housing I don't think had any relevance to the banking sector.  It was something that I felt very strongly about and normally in a context like this, one would not disclose information like this, but I came from a family that was homeless at one stage and I ended up in local authority tower blocks in Ballymun and I know the importance of people not having a house and this was a policy issue which I felt would have a social benefit and which would help create employment.

Is that ... I'm wondering how could the conversation not evolve in relation to banking.  It's just, you know, somebody put it to me that-----</p></speech>

So, it didn't and none of those issues would be relevant to Anglo Irish Bank.  They weren't in the general residential mortgage market.  When I was looking at consideration of a home-buy scheme, I was referring to a social initiative in the UK to have a similar scheme.  I outlined similar schemes in New Zealand.  These were not issues about banking.</p><p>I think any objective economist would look at these and say these are issues about an economist identifying the scale of the crisis which had not yet been interpreted.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Gray.  Just if I can take you to that letter of 25 September '08 addressed to Mr. Kevin Cardiff, and you have spoken about this at length so we should be able to get through these questions quite quickly.  There weren't any terms of reference for that paper, I think you've confirmed that.  It was your own initiative following the discussion that you had just attended at the Central Bank meeting.  Can you outline the supporting evidence and analysis you placed the greatest emphasis on when preparing this or what documents did you have regard to or was it just from your own mind that you prepared this paper?</p></speech>

It wasn't from any specific documents that I prepared it to but it was based on my very rigorous interpretation of what was the scale and nature of the issues that were facing the banking sector from my role in the Central Bank.  In my role as chairman of London Economics, we have experience in about 80 countries internationally.</p></speech>

I had indicated to the Department of Finance and to the Governor that I knew they had their own teams of advisers but I believed in sharing my inputs, for what they were worth, outlining the need to look at a wider range of options.  I put the ECB option as the very first one because I felt that that would be the normal response.  If this was in the US, the Federal Reserve would have been taking actions-----</p></speech>

So, my question is, when you were preparing the paper on 25 September and, indeed, when you had the discussion with the Taoiseach on 29 September, was it anywhere in your mind at all that providing a guarantee for the banks would inevitably have to be backed up by injecting additional capital into those banks?</p></speech>

The first one was the issue of liquidity ... that I felt that there was a restructuring and action in individual banks that would be required.  And if one looks at the actions to reduce risk and potential Exchequer exposure in specific individual banks, which I outlined, I identified three options: one, management changes; one, restrictions on loans; and, thirdly, a managing down of the loans.  And that is really an ... like, banks need capital depending on their scale and size and there's two ways of really addressing that - one is to put in more capital or one is to scale down the organisations.  I also felt that in relation to banks, the best option, if it was feasible, would be to sell the banks or sell part of them to a institution that would have a wider capital base.  And in my response to individual banks who had liquidity issues, the options that I had outlined was to seek a trade sale as a strong ... to a strong, credible institutional buyer and I pointed out that that was the best option and should be pursued but it was unlikely to be feasible in the current circumstances.  So there was ways, in dealing with the potential issues that would need to be dealt with subsequently, that might have, you know, have involved responses other than the State putting in capital.</p></speech>

The banks had been told to do very detailed stress testing and they came back and said that they didn't need additional capital to meet regulatory requirements and to deal with the levels of expected bad debts.  And some PwC scenarios were suggesting the same issues and I just did not believe that was correct.</p></speech>

Finally, do you now believe, looking back, that in your discussion with the Taoiseach on the night the guarantee was decided or a number of days previous when you did take the initiative to document some key points and key challenges that the State was facing, that you should have identified the likelihood, or the possibility at least, that the State would have to inject money into the banks by way of recapitalisation?</p></speech>

That came, I think, on 28 November ... was the first reference by the State.  So you seemed to realise very, very quickly after advocating the possibility of a guarantee-----</p></speech>

I was outlining the need to look at other options and to outline the risks in relation to a guarantee and I felt ECB action was a more appropriate action.  But I have seen almost in every case whereby worldwide liquidity markets become into significant difficulties, the interaction between solvency and liquidity changes and that requires additional capital.  The regulator was being asked to send in teams of accountants to come up with an assessment of whether capital was needed and I did not have certainty on that time of whether it would or not.</p></speech>

Improved Liquidity in the Banking Sector", which was the burning issue of the time, you set out the options.  One, the preference of an ECB intervention, which it became clear - if it hadn't been clear already - that that was not going to happen, and then under "Potential National Responses", there are five options.  Four of them involve a guarantee, either a commitment to provide one or an actual guarantee.  The only one not involving a guarantee is the banks setting up a liquidity war chest which, in your comment box, you say "probably not feasible this week".</p></speech>

I was responding to that proposition.  And just for the record, I believed that the bank guarantee, which was a horrific and unjust decision on the Irish people, was the best option because of the restricted options that were available by the time we got to the night of the 29th.</p></speech>

So, just for clarity, it wasn't advice to the Taoiseach.  But in terms of the information that I had access to, I had no access to any information other than what was available to all the members of the regulatory board and all the members of the Central Bank board, which was very detailed information on the solvency position.</p></speech>

I don't know whether he has given witness evidence here but I consider him to be the most insightful economist with expertise in this area.  And I agree with assessment really that there has been undue attention on to the guarantee decision, which was probably the best option of the terrible options available but the horrific mistakes were made by many people prior to the guarantee and sometimes very significantly prior to and also post the guarantee.</p></speech>

I said to them, and again I said it ... in the context of what I find a slightly frightening public context in this, I might be a bit more formal than I normally am, but I said, "Look, I'm a non-executive director of this.

Mr. Gray, just returning again to annex 9 of your statement where you said, &quot;No one from Anglo had ever asked me to take action on their behalf or to make representations on their behalf.&quot;  I want to put a quote to you from a book produced by Bruce Arnold and Jason O'Toole called <i>The End of the Party</i>, page 15, specifically, where it states:</p><blockquote>When he was Finance Minister, Cowen appointed Gray as Director of the Central Bank and the Financial Services Authority of Ireland and also as a member of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA)...<br /><br />In late 2010, Indecon contacted the website forum<i></i>politics.ie to ask them 'to point out that despite what's being posted here and alluded to, Indecon have never acted for Anglo Irish Bank in any capacity'.<br /><br />Only days prior to the banks' bailout, Drumm says he and FitzPatrick met with Gray as a 'go-between' between Anglo and the Department of Finance.  He says the intervention was needed because Finance 'wouldn't tell us what way they were thinking'.<br /><br />According to Drumm, calls were made to Alan Gray.  He was asked: 'What should be done? What are they thinking? Are we doing the right things?  Are we doing the <i>wrong</i>things?' There could be no direct communication with the Department of Finance.'  At meetings there attended by Drumm and FitzPatrick, the officials would sit and listen and look.  In the end no one was any the wiser.  According to Mr. Drumm, 'They wouldn't tell them what to do.  They wouldn't help us.'</blockquote> <p>I'm sure you're probably familiar with that particular quote; it's at variance with your own annex 9 statement that you didn't act on, you know, questions that were raised with you by Anglo.  Can you answer it?</p></speech>

My evidence is the factual evidence on the position.  I did consider taking legal libel action against the publishers and there was something in a newspaper that I subsequently .... more recently as a leaked version of Mr. Drumm's non-admissible statement was issued-----</p></speech>

They stated I'd had made those contacts and representations and had presented proposals to the Taoiseach on this.  And I have never sued any newspaper and I believe in open discourse and even though I probably would be a lot wealthier tonight if I did, I chose not to, but that doesn't mean there's any basis for those suggestions.</p></speech>

The Governor of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance briefed the Board and indicated that a guarantee of the liabilities of banks was being considered.</blockquote> <p>I have about...there's five parts to the question, brief answers if you can.  Did the Governor and-or the Department of Finance advise how a guarantee solution came about?</p></speech>

I think it...just...I don't have as much energy as members of the committee but it was either &euro;600 billion or &euro;400 billion was quoted in the statement and that was the only assessment that was shared with the Central Bank.</p></speech>

And the ECB was very much aware of this.  There was very regular contact by the Governor, which was reported back in a general sense to the board and I understood as it got near the date, maybe even daily telephone discussions.</p><p>But exactly what was discussed, or not, I'm not quite sure.</p></speech>

When there was a discussion on that, they indicated that that would have a particular risk for Ireland's credit rating, and I did not get the impression that it was being seriously considered.</p></speech>

Similar to the ESRI, we would tender for projects.  We've never been awarded projects except by public tender from those organisations.

In your witness statement, you advise that the guarantee was not thought on the night of the ... or, sorry, the guarantee was not thought up on the night of 29 September but arose from extensive analysis by the Department of Finance, Central Bank Governor, regulator and with the other involvement of teams of external advisers.  By, kind of, implication or by just, kind of, the outline of that, it could appear that your comments on the guarantee would seem to imply a predetermined guarantee scenario was already evolving or developing or had developed.  Would that have been the case, yes?</p></speech>

We'll see what the weight of that actually is but we know, or it has been presented here from testimony, that the issue of including or not including Anglo in the guarantee is a very significant discussion on the night.  The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach have different views on it and, in fact, the room seems to be split very much on this.  And the issue of nationalising or not nationalising Anglo is, by the testimony so far, whether it was the biggest issue or not on the night, was certainly ... certainly a live issue inside in the room.  Did the Taoiseach at any time discuss either the inclusion of Anglo in the guarantee or not or the nationalisation of Anglo or not?</p></speech>

You're directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of this inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  I have been a career banker, starting with AIB in 1979 where I worked in various branch banking and head office departments.  In 1990, I joined Anglo Irish Bank as lending manager in its Dublin branch.  I was promoted to divisional head in 1997.  In November 2000, I resigned from the bank to join the Devey Group as chief executive.  The Devey Group was a Dublin-based health care, hospitality and property group with business operations in Ireland and Portugal.  After approximately 11 months with the Devey Group, I was approached by the Anglo CEO, Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick to rejoin the bank.  I returned to the bank in February 2002 to establish a new division in the bank called the wealth management division.  The wealth management division was an amalgam of various private banking operations in Dublin, London, Vienna, Geneva and the Isle of Man.  In January 2004, I was appointed as an executive director to the board of the bank.  In January 2005, I was appointed head of lending Ireland as part of significant management changes introduced by the newly appointed CEO, David Drumm.  In April 2007, I advised Mr. Drumm and the chairman, Mr. FitzPatrick, of my intention to leave the bank with the announcement of my departure being made to the Stock Exchange on 4 September 2007 and set up a new business LeBruin, which is a corporate finance and debt advisory business now employing 20 people in Dublin, Galway and London.  I welcome the opportunity to be of assistance to the inquiry.</p> <p>  Given that I left the bank at this time, I can only be of limited assistance on what happened in the last quarter of 2007 and through 2008 when the bank experienced growing pressures and issues, which culminated in the Government guarantee and, ultimately, the nationalisation and State bailout of the bank.</p><p>The inquiry has provided me with core documents.  I have, however, not had any insight into the workings of the bank itself since I left in 2007.  I will, again, however, do my best to be of assistance to you.</p><p> When I left the bank in 2007, I firmly believed that the credit approval process, the loan review process, the ongoing reviews of credit policies and the developing risk function within the bank were sufficiently robust to provide early indications of problems in the loan book to the executive team, the board and to the Financial Regulator.  Over the ten years to 2005, Anglo Irish Bank had transformed from being a small player in the Irish marketplace to becoming a serious player in terms of market share in chosen segments in Ireland, with a growing business in the UK and an emerging business in the US.  This performance in Ireland was driven by a number of factors: a very active, long-standing client base, many of whom had become the leading players in the property development and investment sectors; very strong customer loyalty across the core client base, which ensured a high level of repeat business for the bank; and an economic environment with low interest rates and wholesale bank funding at unprecedented levels.  The success of Anglo over the ten-year period to 2005 was reflected not just in the growth of the loan book, but also in year-on-year increases in earnings and a strong market rating recognised by reputable international agencies such as Oliver Wyman who, in 2007, named the bank as the best performing bank in the world over the previous five years.</p><p> Due to this comparative success and to the prevailing economic conditions, competition in the mid-2000's began to significantly intensify.  This competition came from existing universal banks in Ireland and from emerging foreign lenders in the market.  For example, AIB bank established what they called win-back teams to target former clients who'd moved their business elsewhere, or existing clients who were multi-banked.  Emerging players, such as Bank of Scotland Ireland, ACC Bank and Ulster Bank, all competed very aggressively to wrest market share from existing banks, including Anglo.  All of this led to an avalanche of credit in the marketplace.  The timing of the Savills launch could not have been worse.  Asset values rocketed, signs were emerging of a property bubble and, while the general consensus was that the market would have a soft landing, the emerging evidence indicated a serious potential problem.</p><p> In early 2006, the Anglo board decided, on the basis of management advice, to change its lending policy reflecting the concerns we held about the acceleration in asset values and given the growing intensity of competition.  A decision was taken that no new clients with development funding proposals would be entertained.  The bank would exclusively deal with existing customers with a deal carrying an acceptable level of risk.  This policy change became widely known in the marketplace and, indeed, some competitors played on this in their tactics to attract new development business.  This policy change was Anglo's attempt to curtail activity in this sector of the market, which, clearly, had begun to overheat.  On reflection, the motivation for this policy change was entirely correct; however, the policy itself was seriously flawed because it did not go far enough.  We continued to support our bigger existing clients who continued to be active in the market, which led to very large exposures to a concentrated number of clients.  The lending proposals at that time all met the acceptable levels of risk.  These proposals were from long-term, proven operators, each with a depth of expertise and capability to deliver successful projects time and again.</p><p> Yet, with the benefit of hindsight, the failure to more forcibly implement the policy decision taken in early 2006 together with the shortcomings in the policy itself was a serious mistake.  The consequences of this mistake became very clear when the property market in Ireland collapsed, resulting in very significant losses for the bank.  The bank should not have defended its position with its biggest borrowers against the intensive competition in the market to the extent that it did.  This defence led to unacceptable exposures concentrated on a relatively small number of customers, and no matter how professional and capable these customers were, the concentrated risk profile which resulted from this defence was to put the bank's loan book at an unacceptable risk.</p><p> Regarding the funding of the bank during this period, I did not experience that funding was under pressure prior to my departure from the bank.  Through the early part of 2007, wholesale corporate and retail funding had held up well and the performance of the bank in attracting new funding was very good.  There was no indication of stress.  However, the pressure which emerged ultimately, post the Northern Rock issue, demonstrated that the funding base was not sufficiently wide, deep or stable to underpin the scale of the loan book.  It also since emerged that at the time of my departure from the bank, Se&aacute;n Quinn had a sizeable position in the bank through CFDs, contracts for difference.  I was not made aware of this, although other board directors of the bank were.  Although Se&aacute;n Quinn's CFD position would go on to cause difficulties for the bank, it would not, however, be appropriate for me to make any further comment on this matter because of ongoing legal proceedings.</p><p> When I left Anglo, I genuinely believed that the bank was solvent and liquid.  Indeed, a thought that a liquidity or solvency issue would emerge was alien to me.  I did not see a threat to the long-term viability of the bank as I left the bank in 2007.  I was a senior executive and an executive director of Anglo until 2007.  Given what ultimately happened and the consequent impact on so many people, staff, customers, shareholders and the State, I deeply regret my own role in the building of the loan book to what became an unsustainable, overly concentrated scale.  Thank you.</p></speech>

There was a board review undertaken by external consultants in 2003 and this review noted that some directors felt that the board pack "fails to ignite debate on important issues".  The report also notes that many directors expressed a "frustrating need for more debate on strategic issues".  When we come to the Nyberg report in 2011, when speaking about Anglo, it says, "There is little evidence that board directors at the time were active in challenging the bank's approach or its pace of lending growth".  And, again, many of these observations were also reflected in a board evaluation that was carried out in November-December 2007.  Do you agree, or not, with these observations?</p></speech>

Moving on from that to your role as managing director for lending, Ireland, can you tell me a bit about the lending culture under your stewardship because Mike Aynsley also told the committee about a story that was related to him about an auction as a way of illustrating the culture and the lending practices in the bank prior to the crisis?  This is what Mike Aynsley said to us, and he is talking about someone speaking to him about an auction:</p><blockquote>And [the person] said, &quot;I don't know how they found out about it but I was at an auction one morning and a fellow came up and he handed me an envelope, and it was an Anglo Irish Bank envelope, and I opened it up, and there was a cheque inside, which represented slightly more than what the deposit would be and it says ... a note attached saying, 'Just in case you need the deposit'.&quot;. So, you know, this is the mindset at the time. It was to go out there at all costs ...</blockquote> <p>Do you recognise that?</p></speech>

That would never have happened, in my view.  I'll give you another example of an auction that I attended.  In early 2006, when the bank had brought its new policy in place, I attended an auction on a property, which was guiding somewhere in the region of &euro;10 million, in terms of its guide price, and it sold for something in excess of &euro;30-odd million at the time, and I remember coming back to the office and requesting my secretary to get all the lenders into the room because this was, kind a, further justification of the change of policy that we had just introduced, that the market had gone out of control.  You know, people were way ... were paying way over the odds based on indicative pricing for assets, and that's the other side of the story where the bank was at in early 2006.</p></speech>

The goal was, again, based on the new lending policy that was introduced in 2006, which was very much to curtail the activity in this regard.  As I said in my opening statement, we could see from early 2006 that the market was getting seriously overheated.</p></speech>

This is in the report of April '07.  If the policy changed in '06, how could lending in Ireland increase by 50% in the following 12 months?</p></speech>

I mean, if you recognised something in 2006 and the policy is to try and pull back - I understand the caveat that you put in there - but then to see it still increase by 50% in a 12-month period.</p></speech>

You know, again, going back to my point about, you know, we had a very active, you know, client base, they were the biggest players in the market and, unfortunately, we continued to actually support those players when we should have actually probably curtailed the level of lending to the bigger players in the market.</p></speech>

And just then to note that from September 2004 to September 2007 Irish lending grew by 284% - so that's &euro;13 billion to almost &euro;38 billion - and this was on loans advanced ...  It was on loans advanced during this period that Anglo took its heaviest losses and you were MD of lending for most of this period, so what do you say to that?</p></speech>

We'd attempted to, kind of, broaden the base in terms of cashflow lending, M and A-type lending, corporate ... more corporate lending.  So we'd broadened the base over those number of years.  Again, going back to the point I made earlier on, we had a very active client base.  We had a very high level of repeat business.</p></speech>

There were propositions that people who gave personal guarantees gave personal guarantees to many financial institutions and when NAMA was auditing its loan book, when it took it on board, that was certainly something that was visible in the NAMA.  So, while you were taking personal guarantees, were you also examining to see if the person who was giving you a personal guarantee hadn't already given a personal guarantee to another institution?</p></speech>

Mr. Browne, looking then ... continuing on this theme, and enforcement of security, NAMA reported that a downward adjustment of &euro;477 million in aggregate was required to the value of the loans acquired from the participating institutions due to the difficulties with enforcement of security, and Anglo accounted for 57% of this total, &euro;273 million.  So can you explain why the discount applying to Anglo's loans in respect of difficulties with security was so high?</p></speech>

That was always farmed out.  We had a panel of ... two panels of solicitors, depending on the size of the deal.  And a solicitor would be responsible for putting the security in place.  So, you know, when you ... you know ... so on a case-by-case basis, there was individual legal firms appointed to make sure that the security was perfected.  And it was the responsibility of the lending team and the banking administration team to ensure that the security was put in place.  But, ultimately, the responsibility was actually ... was the role of the legal agent appointed by the bank in terms of perfection of security.  And, again, you know, I don't ... it seems ... that when you say that figure, it seemed extraordinary high.  You know, again it depends on, kind of, the individual aspects of each case.  But it seems remarkably high to me, because again the process was very much, you farmed out your legal perfection work to an appointed panel of solicitors.</p></speech>

I mean, we have a view from Brendan McDonagh from the NTMA that they were always sceptical about the business model of Anglo and that the bank couldn't get deposits from the NTMA.  And then, eventually, it did and the NTMA didn't want to keep those deposits with the bank but it had to because of a direction from the Department of Finance.  So did the board discuss this and what was the view of the board?</p></speech>

My answer to that would be, you know, over the years that I was there the bank had a tremendous track record in terms of its ... its actual liquidity and fundraising.  It always used to amaze me when you looked at the list of corporate depositors, you know, you had international firms across Europe, you know, with &euro;700 million, &euro;800 million, &euro;900 million on deposit.  So the bank was very successful in terms of growing its deposit base under a number of strands over many many years but that issue, you know, in terms of the NTMA, I don't remember it ever being coming up at the board meeting.</p></speech>

And Deputy Murphy rightly outlined the &euro;477 million, I think it was, from NAMA, but NAMA confirmed that that for the institution - the individual banks - was in the region of &euro;2 billion.  That's how much loans that could not be perfected because of ... or could not ... had to be written off as a result of unperfected security, and the majority of them rested with your bank.  We see on the core documents, Vol. 2, page 63 ... we see an example of 12 files that was carried out.  And of ten of those files, no letter from the bank's solicitors confirming the security was complete is evident, that's, 83%.  These are loans above &euro;6 million.  It talks about the credit policy where draw-down shouldn't happen unless it's authorised in writing by a manager before the perfection of security, but we see that the draw-downs were taking place.  And I think in the situation the number of draw-downs up to the time of the review for the 12 selected loans was 67.  So, again, we are seeing, like, loans of &euro;149 million which were drawn down with no solicitor's letter on file.  So, as a result of your credit policy, that would have had to be authorised by a manager.  So, it's not solely the responsibility of the solicitors.</p></speech>

A manager from Anglo landed with a bank draft for the purchaser ... to the ... for the purpose of the purchase of that property.  Is that an accurate reflection of what was going on in Anglo - that Anglo was on call at 12 o'clock at night, landed down to the office where this auction - so-called auction - was taking place and produced a bank draft at 2 o'clock in the morning to allow this developer to buy the biggest valued asset in the history of the Irish property bubble?</p></speech>

You know, there was a very clear culture in the bank, right, of a loan process that went from ... you know, the team that actually originated the loan or the team who managed the exposure, they would actually look at the actual ... the individual loan.  They would decide whether they felt that loan was worth bringing to actually what we used to call our mini-credit committee meetings.  The mini-credit committee meeting was a meeting amongst the lenders like in a room like this.  There could be 20, 30 people who would actually ... the loan would be presented, it would be debated amongst the actual ... the lenders.  If the consensus view was that the loan was a good loan, it would go on to a main credit forum in terms of, actually, for final sign off where non-lenders and risk would have been the final arbitrators of the individual loans.  In some situations, you know, there would have been forums - gathered quickly - of senior people to decide whether a loan was actually one that was worth doing in terms of acceptable levels of risk, but the vast majority of, actually, loans would have gone through a very formal process of approval.  As I say, from the team up to the mini-credit situation to the main credit situation and being signed off at that level.</p></speech>

And then, going back to my point, you know, there was a very formulaic approach from the ground up in terms of, actually, approval of loans.  Every loan, you know, went up to credit committee every year for review and every loan was reviewed by risk - in the early days, four times a year, and in latter years, two times a year.  And out of those review processes came what probably was the most important management tool, which was the actual watch list.  The watch list was, you know, the individual loans on each portfolio that needed attention.  The attention was decided by the risk people in terms of what action was ... was to be taken in regard to, you know, correcting the situation that they weren't happy with.</p></speech>

You know, as I said earlier on, the mistake that was clearly made, right, in terms of, actually, the property development loans in particular, was that we did support, you know, probably our top 20 clients too robustly against intense competition and we got too big with those exposures.

Every exception has to be look ... looks ... looked at in terms of its materiality.  An exception could be the following: if credit policy says that interest cover has to be 1.3 times, the lending manager brings a loan to credit committee and, say, the loan is &euro;5 million and the interest cost is, say, at a rate of 5%, so that means the cost of funding that loan is &euro;250,000.

Obviously, this is, you know, into 2008, you know, a year after I left the bank and obviously what the bank was doing at that stage, because asset values were under pressure, when the loans were going up for, actually, their annual review, the actual value of security was being written down to reflect the fact that the market was actually ... asset values were actually on a downward spiral.  And that's where you've got the increase in that period of time.  So, you have to look behind ... there was an individual story behind every exception.  And exceptions, you know, on the basis of ... you have your lending policy, right, okay, but if it's an exception to credit policy, it's put up very clearly upfront, right, for a decision to be made whether you would actually want to approve the actual ... the credit, if it's outside policy.  And that could be for a whole host of reasons.  Like, it could be there's other security that ... cross-secured.  There's ... the client could be a depositor of the bank.  The client, you know, could be, you know, have another, kind of, relationship with the bank in terms of, actually, on the private banking side.  So, there is a whole range of issues that could determine why you would actually, kind of, approve a loan-----</p></speech>

We've heard testimony from ... from others in the committee, including Professor Honohan, which talks about the damage was done, you know, in the period running up to 2006 ... that period ... that when you were going into 2008, it was too late.  Can you explain to me - and that was ... obviously ... coincides with the period when you were head of lending of Anglo Irish Bank for the Irish division - can you explain to me how NAMA had to apply a 61% discount to loans that your bank and you, as head of lending, approved?  How did you get it so wrong and ... when we compare it to other banks which had haircuts but not as high as 61% applied to them?</p></speech>

We defended our position too strongly with these people and our exposures went to levels that were unacceptable and as a result of that then, you know, the haircuts that the bank, you know, obviously were forced to take because they were very big exposures with clients reflected in the fact of what happened when NAMA came into being.  And, you know, I've openly admitted it here tonight that we did actually defend ourselves too strongly with a small, select group of clients-----</p></speech>

I just want to kind of come into an area myself which is probably a summary where Deputy Doherty is at so I won't drill back down to the detail.  I'll just take it at top level with you, Mr. Browne, which is with regards to the bank's lending approach.  What was your view of the lending policy procedures and prevailing culture?  Was it the kind of... was it the norm as reflected in the wider banking sector or was it a very aggressive one or was it passive?  How would you reflect upon that now?</p></speech>

There was huge loyalty from that client base and we continued to support those clients probably too strongly into a period when the market was actually getting overheated.</p></speech>

I'm going to... I'm referring to three different documents but I'm just going to bring up two pages as examples of them.  One is regard... they're all in Vol. 1.  One deals with risk appetite, the other one's minutes of risk and compliance meetings and the other one is an extract from the loan review summary.  So in core book Vol. 1 there, I'm just bringing up on the screen ... I think it's page 97 if I can just have a look at it there... page 97.  If we just to go to the bottom of that page there, Mr. Browne, it says:</p><blockquote>Residential development accounts for 67% of development overall.  Exposure [of] zoned land without planning primarily related to the Bank's Top 10 customer relationships with whom the Bank has a long and satisfactory track record [and] It was noted that the exposure to the unzoned land was not significant.</blockquote> <p>And then I'll just go on to page 101 in the same book and we might just leave this one on the screen then afterwards.  If you go to 101, and it's the second table down there where it gives a breakdown of the areas of the exposures, I'm assuming that sum on the left is &euro;10 billion, is it ... &euro;10 billion and &euro;600 million... on the left, yes... is that &euro;10 billion?</p></speech>

All right, so the other ones then are &euro;627 million unzoned land; &euro;3,580 million on zoned land; just about one-and-a-half billion on zoned land with planning permission and over &euro;600 million, &euro;641 million in fact, with speculative development and then the development, what's the "w/c" there?

The real issue here, when you look at kind of where the risk was, is around unzoned land and zoned land and again, the mistake that was made is that we continued to support people who were actually kind of acquiring, you know, that type of asset.</p></speech>

Mr. Browne, that the real risk, as a counter-proposal just to challenge that statement if you don't mind, is that basically what we have here is a sectionised area of one single sector, which is property, albeit in different manifestations, and that Anglo were overly concentrated into the property market?</p></speech>

So it's not that the wall fell down yesterday is what the problem was; it's that there was a problem not addressed over a long period of time and, hence, a major intervention.  Was the problem in Anglo growing like a subsidence issue because there was a difficulty underpinning the structure, or was it that something happened later in 2007 that was unforeseen, and where did that come from?</p></speech>

Could I ask you took at - sorry, I didn't give notice of this - page 3, in Vol. 2 of the IBRC book?  You have it yourself there, Mr. Browne, Vol. 2, page 3, it is easily got.  This relates to documents from IBRC liquidators in NAMA, exceptions to credit policy for Anglo loans, and the findings at the very bottom and the very bottom paragraph:</p><blockquote>Of the 1,731 cases reviewed at client level, the number found to have represented an exception to credit policy was 1,073 or 62% of clients.

If you go to book number, Vol. 1, page 57, I think it is ... if you again go back to that table where you see the level of exceptions in 2008 over a period of February '08 to July '08 has dramatically jumped from 26% to 42%, so ... and the reason for that is ... it states there in the document that, "The percentage increase in exceptions for July is primarily due to lenders applying a 20% discount to security values."  Now I presume what happened thereafter is that as asset values continued to actually collapse over the period of time, '08 onwards, every time the actual credit was going up to renewal on an annual basis, it was being highlighted as an exception because the lenders were actually applying bigger and bigger discounts to the underlying security.  So, when that report was done it reflects the fact that within the bank, from probably '08 onwards, they were actually discounting the underlying value of the security, hence it shows up as an exception.  When I looked at that as well, the only rationale I could come up, in terms of why that figure is such ... it's based on that the bank was, obviously, applying more and more discounts to the underlying security.</p></speech>

So every time a credit went up, it would, obviously, be shown as an exception to actually credit ...</p></speech>

I must have spoken too quickly.  The Anglo annual report for 2007 shows that over the period 2002-7, profit before tax increased by 376%, earnings per share by 363% and total assets by 398%.

So they were a function of, you know, as I say the client base that had ... the bank had developed, probably over the previous ten, 15 years who were very active in the marketplace.</p></speech>

And then going on to main credits where group risk was the final arbitrator whether the risk was acceptable.  So that process was the standard approach in terms of actually, kind of, the individual loans that were actually underwritten at the time.</p></speech>

They say, "A key balancing act for us is to impress upon the market that Anglo's growth is delivered in a measured and conservative manner, without loosening our credit standards."  Isn't your evidence to Deputy Doherty and Deputy Higgins that there were 92% exceptions and Nyberg found that the audit committee ... neither the internal audit nor the audit committee was in a position to challenge credit decisions where the main problems ultimately arose?  I mean, wasn't the model unsustainable?</p></speech>

The exceptions, as I explained ... you have to look behind the reason behind the exception in every loan.  You know, at the time in the marketplace when you were actually going out to investors, you were being quizzed on a continuous basis in regard to the sustainability of the model.  And in every situation we were actually able to kind of explain why we felt the model was sustainable.  And the growth in the bank really in the years was going to come from markets such as the UK and the USA.</p></speech>

Good evening Mr. Browne.  Firstly, I want to refer to the book that has been referred to by many others, Mr. Carswell's <i>Anglo Republic</i>.  In it, it states that you were paid &euro;3.75 million from Anglo when you resigned in November 2007 as a golden handshake or retirement package.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I suppose I used my best judgment in any decisions I made or any decisions I influenced while I was there.  When I left the bank in 2007 I felt I'd done a good job and I felt I left behind a bank that there was no undue stress when I was walking out the door.  So all decisions I took when I was there and implemented, I took them all in good faith.  You know, when I handed in ... when I told the chief executive and the chairman that I was leaving, it was the board's decision to actually decide whether I was entitled to, you know, a payment.  I decided I was leaving.  Whether I got one or not was irrespective.  I was leaving, my race was run.  And, you know, the board decided that they were going to actually recognise my efforts over the previous 15 or 16 years.</p></speech>

I was reading your ... part of your biography there, during your second term in Anglo, and it is remarkable reading because you seem to have held a lot of different, kind of, roles within the bank at the ... at the same or similar times.  You were the head of ... managing director of lending for Ireland between 2004 and 2007, when lending went from &euro;3 billion to &euro;38 billion.</p></speech>

Mr. Browne has it anyway.  Page 67, Vol. 1.  So, that particular inspection by the Financial Regulator identified 30 separate issues which it required to be addressed and which it listed in a report dated 27 June 2007.  Varying degrees of seriousness, I think would be fair to say, Mr. Browne, but a number of quite important issues.  So, can I ask, were you made aware of this report as a board member and was it discussed by the board?</p></speech>

And again, going back to, kind of, what I said earlier on, Deputy, my view of the board, in terms the openness and transparency, it was very much ... if there was an issue that had to be discussed, it would be brought up forthright and put before the board in terms of any issues that needed to be discussed.

Just on the issue of exceptions to credit policy, just looking at page 3 of Vol. 2, this issue was touched on earlier on, but the reference at the very bottom of it, which basically is a summary of the aggregate of exceptions to credit policy for the period 2001 to 2008 prepared by ... by the special liquidator, as such, found that of the 1,731 cases reviewed at client level, the number found to have represented an exception to credit policy was 1,073 or 62% of clients, in volume terms, and then in value terms, the aggregate value of the exceptions identified was &euro;31.97 billion or 92% of the value of the book which transferred to NAMA.  So, I know you explained some element of that would have arisen after you left, but this was a representation of the 2001 to 2008 period.  Does that match your experience in your role?</p></speech>

As we saw in one of the other exhibits, you know, probably in the latter years as asset values, security values, actually kind of diminished, the bank obviously was taking a very conservative approach in terms of writing down security values-----</p></speech>

So, you know, somebody saying, "Well, the credit policy says 75% loan-to-value but the loan has come up at say 80% loan-to-value", so it's highlighted from the word "go" and a decision is made to approve that based on other, you know, circumstances.  So it's clearly identified from the word "go" in terms of that approval.  What the discussion around why you would approve it, you know, will depend on a whole range of reasons.</p></speech>

But, I mean, a lot of your answers on this issue and on the issue of security seems to be the case-by-case analysis, but, I mean, I have to put it to you that the basis of making a decision on a case-by-case scenario doesn't seem to have regard to what the policy was.  The policy seemed to be breached on a wholesale basis, looking at the figures that we have before us.</p></speech>

No, based on that figure, right, okay.  But, you know, again, you know, if you look at that figure there which is, you know ... is you highlighted there ... you know, again it goes back to what's behind, you know, each of those loans, right.  Why are they exceptions?  If the bank has decided in 2008 to write down, you know, the underlying security by 20%, that, in itself, and you can see the figure there, it went from, what, 28% to 46% over the period of four or five months as a result of the bank deciding that, you know, let's kind of take a 20% haircut in the underlying value of the security, and that's why an awful lot of accounts will end up being exceptions in that situation.</p></speech>

Yes, there would have been exceptions to credit policy.  They would have been reported on a monthly basis, just like that report we saw there, okay, and there would have been, you know, a specific reason behind each of those exceptions, why it was an acceptable thing to do.</p></speech>

In the book, <i>The FitzPatrick Tapes</i>, and don't worry this is not contentious, it's an observation made by Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick himself, and he was talking about how, after David Drumm had been appointed, he said well:</p><blockquote>The bank was about lending. ... The lending guys were all about Lionel Messi.  They were all strikers.  They were the pop stars.  They were the guys who were making the f-ing money.  They didn't worry about how the money was got to give to them.  As far as they were concerned they were the guys lending money and that was where it all was.  That was where the culture was as well.</blockquote> <p>Now Mr. FitzPatrick, obviously - pretty much important guy in your bank.  What do you think about his observation?</p></speech>

And the treasury operations, you know, its primary responsibility was to actually fund the growth of the loan book.  So it was, fundamentally, a lending bank.</p></speech>

I think there was a very clear process in terms of, actually, kind of, how the whole ... you know, the whole loan approval process went and how it evolved over the years.

I think what he's referring to there is that, you know, they didn't worry about, you know ... the treasury guys, you know, as on ... on the funding side, their responsibility was to be able to go out and develop new strands of funding to be able to fund the actual growth of the ... of the loan book.  And the bank, you know, in the latter ... you know, in the latter years, you know, was kind of developing, you know, its operations in the UK and in America, so suddenly you had the three, kind of, areas of geographical growth in terms of the ... yes, the loan growth in the bank.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, when he gave evidence, on page 76, he was talking about how it had started.  He said, "the start of the liquidity crisis or the first signal that became available in the market", that was August 2007, and then he goes on to talk about Northern Rock, which, clearly, you would be aware of.  So is Mr. Moran wrong?  I mean, lots of people have given evidence that, really, things started to get very tight August-September, really beginning to feel the tension by October-November, never mind then what happened when you had left.

Just to come back to this 2006 policy change.  You decide you're going to stay with your proven clients, the big developers who've got large scale projects in Ireland and that's going to be the MO from 2006 on.  And then total lending in Ireland doubles over this period of time.  Were you placing too much trust in these special clients that you were sticking with from 2006?  And I'm not asking you about trust in their business abilities, I'm asking about trust in their wealth, how much you perceived that they owned, their exposures in terms of their assets or what they were developing and too much trust in terms of how much they were telling you they were borrowing from others?</p></speech>

I think, you know, I think it's an interesting word, "trust", you know, we backed them because we believed their ... of ... we believed their ability to deliver on the projects.  You know, there were people that we had, kind of ... we had developed a close relationship with over ten, 15, 20-year period, and we'd seen them perform and, I suppose, the view was that if there was going to be a soft landing, you know, the people that you wanted to be in the trenches with were people that had a track record of delivering performance.  And the view would have been that these were the people to actually, kind of ... to support.</p></speech>

You're referenced or you're mentioned in the book along with Tiernan O'Mahony, both of you leaving a number of years after not being appointed to the top position.  He talks about Tiernan O'Mahony writing in <i>The Irish Times</i>as far back as 2002, saying the big days of 40% per share profits are over and it'll be more likely to be 15% to 20%.  But he mentions ... he says about you, and I will quote just for your benefit:</p><blockquote>Browne stayed on for another three years before leaving with the same generous package as O'Mahony enjoyed.  In that time, he tried to reduce the bank's exposure to the Irish property market.  As far back as early 2005, he told me that it had become dangerously overheated and too dependent on tax breaks.  There was limited value left for investors.  However, while he had some success in reducing the bank's exposure, it continued to do new business in Irish property, both as a banker and as an investment organiser.</blockquote> <p>He goes on to talk about how Drumm wanted to prove himself FitzPatrick's equal, wanted to double the profits of the bank within five years, which he did within two.  So, can I ask you is that a true reflection of your own position at that point in time in 2005?  Were you trying to reduce the over-exposure to the Irish property market at that time in the bank and was there other pressures within the bank? </p></speech>

I remember the conversation.  I suppose the first attempt to try to do that was the change of policy in 2006.  I remember the board meeting well where it was debated long and hard in regard to the policy change and the policy change was adopted by the board.  You know, there was several examples where I saw this market getting seriously overheated.  The policy change was an attempt to actually curtail our activity.  As I said earlier on, you know, we didn't do it ... we didn't impose that policy strong enough.  You know, we continued to support, you know, the bigger clients when we shouldn't have - we should have kept out - and we failed in terms of the implementation of that policy.  So, from that ... so, you know, the policy that was brought to the board was the attempt to try to curtail activity and that was reflective of that comment.</p></speech>
