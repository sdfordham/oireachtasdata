This is a European initiative for the implementation of information services dealing with environmental security.  It replaces the European earth observation programme.  It also covers activities for ensuring an uninterrupted provision of accurate and reliable data and information on environmental issues and of security matters to users in charge of policy making, implementation involved in the EU and its member states.  As of 2014 the Copernicus programme will enter its full operation phase and this is the subject of the regulation.  It is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The second proposal is Schedule A, COM (2013) 404 - proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain rules governing actions for damages under national law for infringements of the competition law provisions of the member states and of the European Union.  The main objectives of the present proposal are to optimise the interaction between public and private enforcement of the EU competition rules and ensure victims of infringements of EU competition rules can effectively obtain compensation for the harm they have suffered.</p><p>  As some of the legal and constitutional impact of some of the elements of the proposal have yet to be fully explored it is proposed that this proposal warrants further scrutiny.  It is suggested that a letter be sent to the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation stating that the committee is keeping a close watching brief on all developments regarding the Commission proposal, in particular regarding the outstanding subsidiarity issues.  The letter would also ask that the committee be kept informed on the legal implications of this proposal in Irish law and receive an update on the legal advice pertaining to limitation periods, joint and several liability and the proposal for a mandatory recognition of decisions of non-Irish courts and competition authorities when considering private actions and damages by 27 August at the very latest.  Does everybody agree that we send that letter?</p></speech>

I am joined by colleagues from Enterprise Ireland who are present to assist the work of the committee.  They are Mr. Paddy Hopkins, secretary to the board and manager of corporate services, Mr. Tom Hayes, divisional manager of micro enterprises and small business, and Mr. Eamonn May, department manager of banking relationships and growth capital.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland's objective is to grow jobs in Irish companies.  For companies to grow their employment, they need to grow their sales.  Export growth provides a sustainable route for companies to grow.  If they win sales overseas, they will drive the growth of jobs here in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland works in partnership with our clients providing a cohesive set of supports, both financial and non-financial, to help them start, grow, innovate and compete on global markets, thus driving economic growth and employment creation.  Before I go into the detail of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s activities in 2012 and this year to date, as members will be aware, Enterprise Ireland has a key role in the delivery of the Action Plan for Jobs, first launched in 2012.  Enterprise Ireland had responsibility for approximately a third of the action plan deliverables last year and delivered in full and on time the bulk of the actions assigned to it in 2012.  Enterprise Ireland continues to be centrally involved in the Action Plan for Jobs this year with a significant element of the plan again falling to us for implementation.  Of the 333 actions to be delivered in 2013, Enterprise Ireland is responsible for leading on 52 and will also actively contribute to a further 27.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies created 12,861 new jobs in 2012 resulting in a net increase in full-time employment of 3,338.  The positive performance of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client companies in 2012 was achieved notwithstanding the continuing economic challenges facing Irish companies both at home and abroad.  Our client companies employ 145,460 people.  The outlook for new job creation in 2013 is positive, although there remain significant challenges, particularly related to the ongoing uncertainty in international markets.</p><p>  In Enterprise Ireland we understand that exports sustain and create jobs.  Last year saw Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client exports increasing by &euro;966 million to reach a record total of &euro;16.2 billion.  It is especially encouraging to see companies recording significant gains in established markets such as North America, 20%, and the high growth economies of Asia Pacific, 17%, and Latin America, 24%, in 2012.</p><p>  While companies must remain strong in their core markets, we recognise the need to continue the diversification of exports from the UK and to respond to the ongoing weakness in the euro zone economy.  It is vital for the recovery of the Irish economy that Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s clients continue to win new business in high-growth economies.  To this end 2013 will see a record number of ministerial-led trade missions with an increased focus on high-growth economies in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.  This will be backed up by a wide range of inward buyer visits, market study visits, trade fairs, embassy events and knowledge seminars, all aimed at linking Irish companies to international buyers, increasing the opportunities for export and job growth for Ireland.</p> <p> Entrepreneurship is an increasingly important source of growth for the Irish economy and the entrepreneurs of today will generate the employment, sales and exports of the future.  Enterprise Ireland works in collaboration with other State agencies and bodies to support entrepreneurs from the initial seed idea through to financial investment in high potential start-ups.  Despite the challenging economic environment, ambitious entrepreneurs, with highly innovative products and business development strategies, are continuing to successfully build their businesses and their presence in export markets.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ten regional offices work closely with entrepreneurs, local development agencies and local representative bodies, such as the network of county and city enterprise boards, offering a wide range of supports for entrepreneurship.  We also actively engage in creating and maintaining relevant networks that provide a pipeline of early stage entrepreneur inquiries.  Our goal in these efforts is to ensure that Enterprise Ireland is well positioned to identify entrepreneurs with the capability to grow exports and employment in the economy.</p><p> In 2012, the level of start-up activity was very encouraging with a record 97 high potential start-ups, HPSUs, supported during the year.  Of these, 12 were led by overseas entrepreneurs, 14 were spinouts from research and eight were led by female entrepreneurs.  They are ambitious companies with highly innovative products and business development strategies that will enable them to carve out a place in global markets.  They are expected to create in excess of 1,600 over the next three years.</p><p> In 2012, Enterprise Ireland continued to support very early stage companies through the competitive start fund by  providing an equity investment along with an experienced business mentor to work with the companies during this crucial stage of their development.  Last year there were four funding calls under the competitive start fund and focused on the ICT and industrial sectors and on female entrepreneurs.  In total, 60 early stage projects were approved under the competitive start fund in 2012.</p><p> Last year also saw the launch of a &euro;2 million community enterprise centre development programme to assist them recruit or retain a strong business development function-Manager.  The community enterprise centres provide space in a supportive environment for budding entrepreneurs and serve to help the development of entrepreneurship locally in urban and rural locations.  Since the launch of the new programme, 46 managers have been approved for community enterprise centres around the country.</p><p> Innovation is at the heart of all entrepreneurship, be it in a high growth potential start-up company turning knowledge into solutions or in established companies that are constantly improving their products and processes and thus their ability to compete and win sales overseas.  Innovation is, and will be, central to our success and we work continuously with our clients to support them to progress along the innovation ladder.</p><p> We support companies, not just in the area of research and development, although it is a central focus of the agency, but also on process innovation such as new business model development.  In 2012 Enterprise Ireland provided support of &euro;100,000 or more for 80 companies to develop new technologies and processes that will lead to job creation and increased exports.  In 2012, 798 client companies were engaged in significant research and development of &euro;100,000 or more with over 134 companies spending in excess of &euro;1 million on research and development. </p><p> In order to promote business innovation with the ultimate aim of creating jobs, Enterprise Ireland also works with the broader enterprise base in Ireland including foreign-owned multinational corporations and the research community where we work in close collaboration with IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland.  The close working relationship is demonstrated by Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s technology centres that work to an agenda defined and agreed by consortia of indigenous firms and multinational companies.  The centres tackle problems that are prevalent in specific sectors or technology areas, for example, the costly issue of energy efficiency in manufacturing operations.  In so doing the centres represent the best of Irish indigenous and multinational companies&rsquo; researchers working together with academia to solve issues that are too big or costly to be solved by any one company working in isolation.</p><p> In 2012, three new technology centres were established in the areas of financial services, e-learning innovation and cloud computing.  Last year Enterprise Ireland also supported the largest ever investment in research and development from an Irish company in a project that clearly demonstrates the link between innovation and growth.  The Kerry Group has begun work on its global food innovation centre of excellence in Naas, County Kildare with 900 jobs.  The initial investment is worth over &euro;100 million and will be game-changing for the agrifood sector in Ireland.</p><p> The strength of a company&rsquo;s senior management team is a key differentiator of success.  As the needs of our companies have evolved and become more diverse, we have responded, finding new ways of building management capability in our companies.  Over 100 companies have participated in Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s management development programmes so far this year, including Leadership 4 Growth, the International Selling Programme and others.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland offers a range of financial supports to assist clients through all stages of their business development cycle.  The nature and level of support offered to clients will depend on the individual company&rsquo;s development needs and is assessed in consultation with their development adviser.</p><p> In addition to providing direct financial support to companies, the State through Enterprise Ireland has invested heavily in stimulating and facilitating Business Angel and seed and venture capital initiatives to provide access to finance for SMEs.  In May 2013 the Government launched the fourth seed and venture capital scheme 2013-18 that is valued at  &euro;175 million.  The scheme is aimed at providing additional funding for high growth Irish companies with the potential to</p><p>generate large amounts of additional export sales and grow jobs.  It targets an additional &euro;525 million in funding from the private sector that will mean a total of &euro;700 million will be available for investment over the lifetime of the scheme.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland client companies are located in every county and continue to make a substantial economic impact at a critical time in the State.  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s clients account for over 300,000 direct and indirect jobs and spent &euro;18.9 billion in the economy in 2012.</p><p> We are keenly focused on our ongoing mission to support companies and support employment creation.   Notwithstanding progress made during 2011 and 2012, in the future Enterprise Ireland supported companies will have to scale significantly if they are to continue to win out against global competition.  In this regard, access to finance to fund export growth will be a key determinant of success as will the composition of the senior management teams and the leadership and ambition of the boards of emerging Irish companies.</p></speech>

I now call for questions from the members, commencing with Deputy Calleary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013072300004#E00300"><p>I welcome the Enterprise Ireland delegation and apologise that I will not be here to listen to the second part of the session.  I also wish Mr. Terence O'Rourke well in his new post of chairman designate.  He has an excellent set of qualifications.  I did not know whether he would attend as his county is not used to success in Gaelic football but I wish him well.  He has the task of filling the shoes of Mr. Hugh Cooney but I have doubt that he will succeed.</p><p>  I also wish Mr. Frank Ryan well.  At a time where it has become fashionable to kick the public service he is an example of someone who has contributed an enormous amount to Irish public life.  He reeled off a pile of figures but his imprint is all over them because he did a good job steering Enterprise Ireland during his tenure as chief executive officer.</p><p>  The Secretary General is present and I hope I hope we can retain his skills somewhere in the public service.  I hope he will listen to me when I say it would be a good investment for the country to keep Mr. Ryan involved, at some level, in order to drive the enterprise economy forward.  I wish him every health and happiness as he moves on to the next stage of his life.</p><p>  I have a few questions for Mr. Ryan.  He guided Enterprise Ireland, particularly over the past few years, and is now  prepared to move on.  Has he seen companies change their approach to the applicant process and growing a company?   Are people more comfortable when dealing with or approaching an international market?</p><p>  We have engaged previously with Mr. Tom Hayes on the following matter.  There is no doubt that  Enterprise Ireland is skilled in assisting companies who want to export and the old county enterprise boards will be under its wing and transformed into a local enterprise office, LEO.  Will a company that is happy to stay in Ireland and grow its home base be comfortable within the Enterprise Ireland family?  Is there a place for it in the family?  County enterprise boards have done a lot for indigenous companies but are now being subsumed into a broader family.  Can an assurance be given that an Irish company which is not interested in exporting at present will find a good home in Enterprise Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Ryan" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013072300005#F00100"><p>I will take the first question and then I will ask Mr. Tom Hayes, who has been centrally involved in the work on the CEBs becoming LEOs, to take the second part of the question because it would be more informative that way.</p><p>  I have seen huge changes over the ten years in ambition and in innovation.  There has been considerable progress on leadership among the senior management teams of the companies and considerable progress on export spread, or on our international trading footprint.  If one goes back ten years to 2003, essentially, 50% of everything we exported from the indigenous companies went to the UK.  That percentage is now down to 38%, notwithstanding that exports to the UK have increased by &euro;1.5 billion in the meantime.  Exports to the UK have grown, as have those outside the UK.  Now 62% of our exports do not go to the UK.</p><p>  The end of 2012 saw us, for the first time, break through the &euro;1 billion barrier in terms of exports to Asia and the &euro;0.5 billion barrier in terms of the Middle East.  As I leave Enterprise Ireland, I am full of pride for the Irish companies which have gone to the coalface and made this happen.  The increased exports about which we speak, of &euro;16.2 billion, maintain employment and create jobs in Ireland and those companies are to be commended.  I thank the Deputy for the kind words but I would say that I am surrounded by a great team of people at Enterprise Ireland who have gone out of their way to really deliver and they are a credit to the public sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Hayes" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013072300005#F00200"><p>We addressed this issue at a previous meeting of the committee.  There have been, and will be, significant changes in the context of the county and city enterprise boards, where they are going and the evolution of the new LEO structure in which Enterprise Ireland has been centrally involved.  The Deputy mentioned companies focused on the domestic market only.  Our ambition and one of the key strategic moves we have made over the past 12 to 18 months has been to encourage companies which have a product or a service that is exportable to export.  Just short of 18 months ago, we set up a potential exporters division to encourage and to help companies which were focusing almost exclusively on the domestic market to export.  Over that period of time, we have gone around the country with export awareness events.  We had 16 of those throughout the country and 15 exploring export workshops.  We have brought over our team from the UK to help them to understand the dynamic of the UK market to make exporting that little bit easier.  We have assigned advocates and mentors to well over 100 of those companies.</p><p>  I suppose the most radically change has been to move from a one-to-one to a one-to-many scenario.  We have get export ready, which is online and at which companies can look.  It is a kind of export health check for companies to see where they are.  One aspect of it is to encourage that cohort of client companies which have focused almost exclusively on the domestic market to get export ready.</p><p>  I could spend a long time talking about the changes which are underway.  Significant work has been going on in the background in regard to the legislation.  The framework service level agreement, which will operate between ourselves and the LEO network, has been published.  The new logo has been published.  We are working on the website which will unify and bring together all of the CEBs.  Rather than have them operating individually, they will be able to share from one website platform.</p><p>  To directly answer the Deputy's question on companies which focus exclusively on the domestic market, we want to help them to become better companies through our centre of excellence.  We are working on establishing a centre of excellence to ensure that each company, irrespective of whether it is the Kerry Group or somebody who wants to start a business to sell locally, has the proper business functions and structure and that it can find the proper information so that it has ready access to the knowledge and information it requires.  </p><p>  Appreciating the tremendous work the CEBs have done over the years, we want to build on it, enhance it and strengthen it to ensure that all companies in the State which want to start a business are looked after, irrespective of whether it is the domestic market only or whether it has an export ambition as well.</p></speech>

I thank him for his great work and for his presentation.  I will be a bit parochial today.  If people went to Galway today where the Arts Festival is taking place, they might think the place was booming.  However, looking at the distribution of jobs and the figures presented for the west, in particular, the net change is quite low compared to other regions.  It is a net change of 43 jobs.  We had 798 employment gains and 755 losses.  Is there a reason for that?  Perhaps Mr. Ryan might give us an indication, in terms of job creation, of the spend per region and how it is worked out.  What is the cause for the minimal improvement in the west?  Is there a reason for that?  Does Mr. Ryan have any specific plans for the west to try to redress that figure?</p><p>  In terms of the broader picture, it is very heartening to see that we still have exports of more than &euro;16 billion.  That is very good given the trading circumstances we are in.  I refer to the slow down in the global economy, in particular in Britain, the EU and the USA.  Where does Mr. Ryan see the scope for EI-supported businesses to build their market share in those markets, in particular given the difficult trading circumstances and the decline in the economies in those areas?  What is the value for continual export growth in the emerging markets, in particular in the BRIC countries?  </p></speech>

There is a lot of talk about the BRIC locations.  If one looks at our overall portfolio of client companies, approximately 15% of our portfolio is high growth companies, approximately 10% is very large companies, such as CRH and Glen Dimplex, and in the middle is a giant number of established SMEs, the majority of which are family owned.  We have to be realistic about our starting position in regard to what we can achieve.</p><p>  We want to see more exports to the BRIC locations but it is not for everybody in the audience.  It takes approximately 18 to 24 months to get one's first contract and it is unlikely that one will make money from it.  One is talking about funding one's expansion into the BRIC locations.</p><p>  We see great potential for near Europe, which is something that should not be forgotten.  There is still considerable potential, in particular in France and Germany, for further export growth.  Some BRIC locations are more appealing than others right now.  We have made very good progress in China but that is because there has been a sustained focus on China.  We had an incredible coup last year of having the now President of China, Xi Jinping, visit Ireland for three days.  That got Ireland known in China in a way that we could not have possibly imagined before.  </p><p>  We are now making good progress with Brazil.  We have agreement with the Brazilian education authorities and an increased number of Brazilian students will come here for third level education.  We are making solid progress in the Middle East.  We would hope that one of our first major trade missions next year will be to the Middle East and will include the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p> Russia has always been an attractive market for us.  India has proved challenging, but we have had a breakthrough in respect of Indian students wishing to come here to be educated.  There is a range of companies and we look after 22 industries.  They have different interests in different places.  It is essential that we continue to grow our trade with the UK and that we continue to grow our trade outside the UK.  It is that kind of balanced portfolio of trade development that we want to see happening.  It is not too long ago that our exports to Asia would have been worth less than &euro;300 million, not to mind &euro;1 billion, so things have changed rapidly.  Around 40% of our overseas offices are now located in the BRIC countries or the Asia-Pacific region.  Our deployment of human resources in that region is ahead of our trade levels, because we see the potential there.  Irish companies now have to travel further from home to get into economies that are growing strongly, because the euro economy is not growing at the moment.</p></speech>

The UK could go into a small decline relative to the size of its economy, yet we would still have many opportunities there.  We are growing our exports to the UK at the moment and there is no reason we cannot continue to take market share.  Enterprise Ireland supported companies grew their exports last year by 6.3%, whereas world growth was 3%.  It is safe to conclude that Irish companies are increasing their market share.  We can do that again but it will be the innovative companies that have invested in research and development across their value chain that will be leading those exports.</p></speech>

However, we try to ensure that there is a regional spread of entrepreneurship emanating from the west.  We have an office with a director based in Galway.  We have supported a number of community enterprise centres in Galway and in some of the other counties like Roscommon, Mayo and Leitrim.  We work with the university to support the incubation centre.   We work with institute of technology in Galway in the New Frontiers Programme, which is our flagship programme in supporting early stage start-up companies.  These consist of individuals with good business ideas.  We provide training in all areas of business and mentoring, networking with other entrepreneurs and introduction to investors.</p><p>  We have had a specific call for competitive feasibility within the regions.  We piloted this in the south east and we extended that to cover practically all regions in Ireland.  We got a very good response in the west and a number of those companies are being supported.  Those companies that do not exhibit the ability to grow in scale are working with the local county enterprise board.  We have worked with third level institutes North and South of the Border in the Think Outside the Box awards.  We had over 400 applications.  Last year's winner was from NUIG and we had already supported that company.  Although the company was run by students, they have been so innovative, they have since formed a business and are developing that in NUIG.  This year's awards took place in Galway as well.</p><p>  We want to support the regional networks and hubs.  We want to ensure that entrepreneurship and the existing client base is well supported.</p></speech>

I compliment them on the very readable annual report and on their work over the last few years in job creation.  The &euro;6.2 billion worth of exports to the UK is obviously very important.  What implications can future growth in the UK have on that?  What implications might an in-out referendum on Europe in the UK have on these exports?</p><p>  I hope I do not see negative press commentary about 43 jobs.  Jobs growth is important and we have had ongoing investment, so the fact that Galway has the third highest investment is very important.  I know that the IDA had an excellent year for jobs growth in Galway.  The agrifood sector consists of 53% of exports.  How is the agrifood sector doing in respect of the breakthrough in China?  Ireland is a lead exporter in baby formula and so on, and has that market been accessed?</p><p>  The report stated that Enterprise Ireland will be part of the group to review availability of appropriate finance for international trade, and will be looking at a number of options.  During the Irish Presidency, the competitive council announced a new loan facility.  Has Enterprise Ireland had any soundings on how that might work?  How important is the interaction between Enterprise Ireland, Forf&aacute;s and the IDA?  How do they complement each other?</p><p>  Page 74 of the report refers to a contribution to the Exchequer of &euro;15 million coming from the sale of investments, financial support refunds and the disposal of equipment.   That is a considerable amount.  Are there particular items which account for it?</p></speech>

In the same way Denmark has value because of its close proximity to Germany, the German market and the opportunities there.  Primarily, the UK is the first market that any company exports to out of Ireland.  There are exceptions in North America in the information and communications technology sector but the general rule is that the UK is the first market.  As a result we have divided our resources in the London office and established a dedicated team to assist companies with their first exports to the United Kingdom.  We also have a dedicated team with companies that are established in the UK which wish to grow their market share further.  This links to our focus on reaching out to every company in Ireland with the offer that if they have a product or service which they believe they can internationalise and sell overseas, then we want to hear from them.  That work is done by our potential exporters division and it has a particular focus on the United Kingdom.</p><p>  Agri-food exports grew by 2.3% last year while non-food exports grew at a rate of 11%.  The 2.3% increase is down on the normal export growth for food, primarily because of the weather.  Since May 2012 the weather has not been supportive of the farming community and the volumes are down because of that.</p><p>  It is clear to us from our contact with the Chinese authorities and representatives that China has a major regard for the quality of the food products from Ireland and for the level of output that Ireland has achieved in the food sector <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> our size and scale.  One of the most highly value-added products that comes out of the agri-food sector in Ireland is infant formula.  Currently, we supply one in seven children in the world who are fortunate enough to have access to infant formula.  When the Danone facility in Macroom comes on stream fully one in five children in the world fortunate enough to have access to infant formula will be supplied from Ireland.</p><p>  Our work with the Kerry Group and the major investment in Kildare and Glanbia and the major investment in Belview in south Kilkenny means that we mine this increase in output for the maximum value-added products that we can get out of it.  There are certain commodities that come out of the value-added process and these are by-products of higher value items.  This is something we are totally focused on in respect of what we are trying to achieve.</p><p>  I will hand over to Mr. May presently to ask him to talk about access to finance and that part of the question.  Then I will hand over to Mr. Hopkins to discuss the notes to the accounts.  There is a close working relationship with Enterprise Ireland and its parent Department.  Ultimately, we are an agency of our parent Department, as is IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and Forf&aacute;s.  Forf&aacute;s has now been incorporated within our parent Department and work on that is advancing apace.  We are a close family.  We are now working in a major programme with IDA Ireland on increasing the amount of goods and services supplied from indigenous companies to multinational companies.  We work with IDA Ireland on joint strategies because no longer can we have the days when overseas companies went to one room and indigenous companies went to another room.  We need them together.  The technology centres project we are doing with IDA Ireland is a perfect example of how that is working.  Science Foundation Ireland is increasingly producing spin-off opportunities and companies from its research investment.  We are the commercialisation arm that receives those opportunities and works with them.  Therefore, there is a close working relationship with those agencies and with our parent Department.</p></speech>

As Mr. Ryan cited in his initial introduction, we are part of the State family and we work closely with our parent Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  The Action Plan for Jobs cites an action in respect of the establishment of a group to examine the area of export finance.  Specifically for us, the issue is working capital for exporters, particularly in respect of pre-shipment finance.</p><p>  Another aspect of the family is the wider group.  Enterprise Ireland is a participant with the Department in the small and medium enterprise State bodies group chaired by the Department of Finance.  We feed our view in terms of the challenges that our clients have around access to finance into that group on a regular basis.  It involves a wider group not only ourselves but the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the Central Bank the Department of Education and Science and Forf&aacute;s.  There are nine agencies involved and the group is chaired by the Department of Finance.</p><p>  There are two strands to the issue of access to finance.  One is bank finance and the other is non-bank finance.  Some good initiatives have been taken in respect of micro-finance for smaller companies at the micro level.  That initiative is well and truly active now.  Another initiative is the loan guarantee scheme which is managed by our parent Department and that is up-and-running too.  Yet another is the recent National Pensions Reserve Fund announcement relating to restructuring and turn-around funds, etc.  There is an active engagement going on in this area but from the point of view of exporters, access to working capital to support growth in future is central.  For a specific cohort of companies we have an ask in respect of provision of bond facilities.</p><p>  Reference was made to loan facilities.  I assume the Deputy was referring to the European Investment Bank commitment of &euro;10 billion to small and medium enterprises throughout Europe in the coming years.  As one of the actions being taken by the SME Stage bodies group and the Department of Finance that facility is being examined closely to see whether it can be exploited in the context of Ireland to deliver some level of additionality to the marketplace in terms of finance in the economy.</p></speech>

I believe they are making efforts to be more effective.  Certainly, they are providing funding to low-risk and medium-risk projects.  We see a challenge with the cases involving more challenged companies.  They need to be a little more proactive in terms of resolving some of the legacy challenges that exist in those cases.  In many cases they are viable businesses and they have capacity for future growth but there is a place for both bank and non-bank interaction.  There is a requirement for creativity in terms of solutions but there needs to be a solutions-focused approach.</p></speech>

The way Enterprise Ireland funds its operations is that we get an amount of grant-in-aid each year.  In addition we have some own-resource income and we are allowed to retain that up to a specified limit.  Once we go over the specified limit we refund any excess to the Department.  Note 10 on page 74 has several headings.  Basically, it relates to the sale of shares and investments.  No equipment was disposed of as such and we do not have any equipment as such.</p></speech>

Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the enterprise boards have worked hard to identify areas in which job expansion can be created and I welcome that.  I could get parochial and refer to Naas but I will not because there may be a Kerryman in the area who might attack me.</p><p>  The Enterprise Ireland representative referred to one aspect which he found to be very successful, that is, when the organisation opened up for female entrepreneurs last year.  He said it was a highly successful venture.</p> <p>Will it continue this year?   It was oversubscribed.</p><p> I refer to young entrepreneurs.  We have found younger people who do not have a credit rating or a track record find it difficult to source funding.  UCG was mentioned, where a group of young people, which the delegation then financed, came together.  </p><p> I see that happening in all universities.  Many universities have micro companies which are spin-offs from research which is taking place.  Those aged under 25 years have a lot of good ideas but do not have a track record.  They may be associated with internal markets.  Will something be available for that cohort in the future?  </p><p> I referred to the Kerry Group.  Spin-off industries may be associated with it.  Throughout the country where large multinationals are located there are spin-off businesses, which are small-scale companies which may be associated with and feed into a major company.  How does the delegation see itself fitting into a role where it may support such companies, given that it works in conjunction with enterprise boards? </p><p> A number of large multinationals are located in my constituency.  The overall budget for enterprise boards was cut last year.  Can the delegation guarantee that the funding for LEOs will be maintained at the same level, if not increased?  The one in ten companies working in Ireland rather than exporting from Ireland need to be supported.  We need to stimulate the domestic rather than the export economy.</p><p> I refer to some specifics in the financial statement.  A number of consultants are on a variety of sub-committees.  When I was in Kildare County Council I was on my hobbyhorse about payments to outside consultants who were invited in.  </p><p> I cannot see how much was paid to consultants in the financial report.  I mean no disrespect to the chairman, who is part of KPMG, but how many were associated with KPMG?  Since I was elected to the D&aacute;il I have been on my hobbyhorse about the four major auditors, of which KPMG is one.</p><p> I do not mean to be critical of board members but there has been a 100% increase in the allocation of grants to board members, whether directly to their companies or companies with which they may be associated.   Does the delegation have any comment to make on that?</p></speech>

We encouraged women to start businesses.  Through going for growth we set up a network where women helped themselves through mentoring, encouragement and bringing in role models who built businesses. </p><p>  About 18 months ago we put a real focus on female entrepreneurship, in particular with respect to innovative technology-led products.  We found many businesses started by women tended to be smaller and local.  There is nothing wrong with that, but the number of women participating in things such as HP issue product was very small.  We launched a competitive feasibility fund, followed by a competitive start fund exclusively dedicated to women.  In 2011 8% of the total overall competitive start fund was allocated to woman.  This year the figure rose to 23%, which is a very significant increase.  In December 2010 there were seven female applicants for the competitive start fund and in March 2013 figure had risen to 33.  We are also involved in a number of networks and sponsor a number of events which are exclusively dedicated to women.  To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question, we will continue that and ensure a higher proportion of those starting a business, in particular in the technology area, are women.</p><p>  All of us can relate to the scourge of youth unemployment and want to encourage young people to not just think about a job or emigration, but starting a business in Ireland.  A number of our programmes, while not exclusively dedicated to young people, comprise a significant proportion of them.  We find younger people are applying for the competitive feasibility and competitive start fund because the barriers to entry are much lower.  They can secure an investment of &euro;50,000 for 10% of the business.  It does not involve the normal requirements for a matching support; they put in &euro;5,000.  It is a much lower barrier.  </p><p>  I referred to two of the other programmes which would have a significant youth dimension, one of which is the Think Outside the Box awards, which operates at third level and encourages those in third level to think about starting a business.  Over the past three, four or five years there has been a very significant increase in participation, which I have seen at first hand.  Over 400 participated, which is a great response.  The quality of those becoming involved has improved and they are much more likely to remain involved.  It is fair to say that traditionally students entered such programmes as a rite of passage as they went on to get a job, but now are much more focused on starting a business.  Many of the 150 involved in the new frontiers programme in nine incubation centres around the country which are attached to institutes of technology.  Many of those involved are aged under 30.</p><p>  On funding for CEBs and LEOs, there has been no decrease whatsoever in terms of funding.  Even though we are in a transition phase, no one individual or company has been in any way disadvantaged as a consequence.  Anybody who wants to conduct a feasibility study, expand job numbers, undertake research or participate in the various programmes run through CEBs can do so.  We will fight and ensure that the budget for 2014 is on a par with that for 2013.</p></speech>

It is a major breakthrough.  We do expect a spin-off for companies in that regard, or certainly a spin-off in terms of employment.  In the same sector we would expect between 0.5 and 0.7 of an additional job to be created for every job that is within the Kerry Group.  It may not be a case that an entirely new job or new company is created, as there are existing suppliers.  One could expect that a reasonable amount of the raw material for the facility would be supplied within the region if not the county.  Through the CEBs and shortly through the LEOs we want to help smaller companies to grow.  If one is supplying a product or service to a company such as the Kerry Group, there is a good chance that one might be able to sell it internationally.  In Enterprise Ireland we want to see that coming through from the very good work of the CEBs.</p><p>  Reference was made to the sub-committees.  We have three consultants who are paid a fee for their attendance on the investment committee.  No other consultant on a committee is paid anything.  We want outside people to be on the majority on our committees, in other words that internal committees are not making decisions.  The workload of the investment committee, whose responsibility is devolved from the board, is to deal with the vast bulk of the cases on hand.  In any 12 month period we deal with between 3,000 and 3,500 companies.  The investment committee meets every two weeks and it has a large workload.  It would not be unusual for between 30 and 35 cases at one time to be up for discussion by the investment committee.  Due diligence has to be done on all of those cases, as a business recommendation and we must have outside people who are willing to do that on a two-weekly basis, for which they are not paid an exorbitant fee.  The three roles are put out to public tender approximately every two years.  Anybody else who is listed as a consultant is such in their private capacity but they are not paid for any service they provide to other committees.</p><p>  I do not have the detail of board members&rsquo; interests.  It is almost impossible to get a board member in the State who is not connected to something else.  We would be happy to supply the information.  As part of our corporate governance procedures they are required to make that information available on an ongoing basis.  We would be pleased to write to the committee with the information.</p></speech>

I thank him for the annual report.  I compliment him and wish him well in his new role.  I also thank Mr. Ryan and his team for always being so courteous to me when I visited Enterprise Ireland.  I also say well done on Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s penetration into China, Asia and the Middle East because that is where much of the new export business will come from.</p><p>  My questions relate to funding.  The witnesses will be pleased to hear I will not mention mentoring today.  We believe that issue is finally heading towards Forf&aacute;s and we hope to have results on it.  We know that a lot of the jobs will come from entrepreneurship.  I appreciate that Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs do provide grant aid.  I accept we have the microfinance fund and all the other funds that are available.  However, we still seem to have a big problem filling the gaps where Enterprise Ireland or what will be the LEOs provide funding.  It is difficult to match funding or bridge funding.  Has Enterprise Ireland seen any results on the banking front?  The statistics still show that 96% of funding for all new businesses is coming from the banks.  In order to be a truly entrepreneurial country we need many different forms of finance to penetrate and to turn all the research and innovation into a commercially viable state.  I do not look for specific replies; I am just looking for the views of witnesses on the issue and what additional work we can do.</p><p>  Venture capital has been a long-running issue.  There is a huge gap in 1:10,000 venture capital.  When we get investment in that space it usually ends up being an American or other foreign national company whose first step is to repatriate the headquarters out of Ireland to their country.  We seem to be losing many potential jobs.</p><p>  I examined the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, investment, which focuses on equity.  It was only set up in the second quarter of last year and perhaps it is too early to see whether there is any knock-on effect from that.  Is it targeting this area and what is the outlook?</p><p>  I am very much aware of innovation vouchers.  They have done much great work.  I was in a university recently where I heard that innovation vouchers have become very bureaucratic for the amount of money involved.  Is there a way of simplifying the bureaucracy in the system for both the company involved in securing a &euro;5,000 innovation voucher and the university that is doing the work?  The belief is that if the system could be streamlined then more could be done with it.</p></speech>

In overall terms, in terms of where we are now in funding, we are not going back to the old model that was heavily debt-based.  I cannot see the banks going back to that.  The progress that has been made in the past 18 months has been significant in terms of the funding that has been made available for SMEs.  I refer to microfinance loans, the credit guarantee, and the very active involvement of our parent Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, with the Department of Finance and the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The size of the new funds to help SMEs is of note.  The SME equity fund recently announced by the NPRF was &euro;300 million.  The better capital fund is &euro;100 million.  The small credit fund is &euro;540 million.  One should note in particular the SMEs that need to restructure on the work of AIB and the European Investment Fund, EIF.  The funds are all to be welcomed.  The Government announcement that Enterprise Ireland is to receive &euro;175 million for investment will leverage the funds further.  Perhaps the places that people in the past have looked for financing is changing.  Business angels will be far more important as regards matched funding.  There will be a different way of funding one&rsquo;s company in the future.</p><p>  Worldwide, the exit mechanism for most high potential growth companies is through trade sale.  There are very few IPOs worldwide.  We lost a fair number of companies out of our portfolio that went into the portfolio of IDA Ireland through the acquisition of the companies here.  C&uacute;ram, our largest software company, was bought some time ago by IBM.  ChangingWorlds was bought by Amdocs.  Havok Inc. was bought by Intel.  It is a very active market.  We are now producing the quality of companies in this country that someone wants to buy.  There is a certain acid test associated with that which is welcome, although we would like to see more Irish companies IPOing, as set out in the Action Plan for Jobs and we hope to see the ecosystem for that in place by the end of this year.</p><p>  Innovation vouchers are a bit bureaucratic, but at the end of the day it is taxpayers&rsquo; money and we must be able to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and say something has been done properly and the money has been expended properly.</p> <p>I would like to think that as the universities get more accustomed to doing innovation vouchers - it is the institutes of education, IOTs, that have led this - the system will become simpler when it is more regular and familiar.  We would like more universities to engage in innovation vouchers because it has been a successful intervention to date.  Mr. May might wish to add to that.</p></speech>

Last year 30 deals were done in which Business Angels was involved.  It invested &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million in those projects, which was a good development, and we see it adding value not just in terms of capital but its industry expertise also.</p><p>  The other area which is embryonic, and it will be interesting to see how it plays out internationally, is crowd-funding.  It is interesting to note that there is an entrant here, which is small but which will chip away at the establishment, as it were, in terms of bank finance but the regulatory regime will be the issue for crowd-funding internationally.</p><p>  The Innovation Fund for Ireland, alongside the National Pensions Reserve Fund, attracted some international venture capital, VC, firms into Ireland such as DFJ Asprit, Sofinnova etc.  They will write larger cheques, and the Deputy spoke about the &euro;1 million to &euro;10 million space.  Investable companies are what is required and if the projects and strong and investable, they will attract the capital.  We are currently in the process of evaluating some propositions around this seed and venture capital space, specifically with regard to the venture rather than the seed space, which is much lower.  It is in the space the Deputy spoke about, namely, the &euro;1 million to &euro;5 million ticket size.</p></speech>

I am conscious that Senator Mary White wanted to ask a question.  Mr. Ryan is staying for the second session and he might take a question from the Senator at that stage as she has strong views on the entire area.  I thank the witnesses for attending.</p><p>  I will make some observations.  There is a great opportunity with the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  We have had discussions with Mr. Ryan and others about people's concerns about those but overall they represent an opportunity, and I believe they will work.  However, it is important that we instill confidence in the early days to ensure business people, and potential business people, that the LEOs are there for them and that they will work.  I have no doubt they can work, and there is an onus on all of us to make sure we work had to send out that message.</p><p>  Regarding the figures for last year, almost 4,000 net jobs is a great achievement, and we are looking at a better year in 2013.  I understand that represents a great deal of hard work on the part of Enterprise Ireland and its teams in what is a very difficult trading environment.  It would have been welcome if the figures had remained the same but an additional 4,000 jobs at the end of the year is an achievement, and well done in that regard.  I am aware Enterprise Ireland is involved in mentoring business about lean manufacturing, re-engineering and so on but as an organisation it has taken a lean approach and has made do with fewer staff.  I compliment the work of the teams and much of the reorganisation in Enterprise Ireland occurred under Mr. Ryan's watch.  That achievement will stand to him.  Along with other members I wish him well in the future.  He is not gone yet and therefore we can raise other issues with him but on behalf of the committee I thank him for all his work and look forward to dealing with him in other fora.  We will continue to work with his colleagues.  That concludes this session.</p><p>  We will begin our second session, which is a discussion with Mr. Terence O'Rourke, chairman designate of Enterprise Ireland.  I welcome Mr. O'Rourke who is joined by Mr. Frank Ryan, chief executive officer, Enterprise Ireland, and Mr. John Murphy, Secretary General, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, who is here for the second week in a row.  Mr. Murphy is welcome.  I read the note on the Defamation Act at the start of the meeting and therefore I call Mr. O'Rourke to make his presentation to the committee following which we will have questions from members.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for the invitation to come before it today.  It is a privilege for me to be here.</p><p>  If it is not too self-indulgent I take this opportunity to introduce myself to the committee, provide it with an overview of my professional background, and give it my initial impressions of Enterprise Ireland.  I appreciate the members have just heard a comprehensive briefing from the Enterprise Ireland chief executive officer, Mr. Frank Ryan, and his colleagues.  I will also outline the key areas of focus I see for the organisation for the next few years as well as the role of the chairman in addressing them.  Following that I would welcome any questions the members may wish to ask.</p><p>  I grew up in Inniskeen, County Monaghan - I am very proud of my native county this week - the second son of seven surviving siblings; I have four brothers and two sisters.  After completing primary level in the local national school I went to boarding school in Castleknock College in Dublin, after which I studied economics and history in UCD.  It was the mid-1970s, post the first oil shock, and career opportunities were scarce in the country.  For me it was a choice between the Civil Service and something related to business.  Although my academic qualifications were not in the commercial area I had grown up in a family business and when it was suggested to me that a route from my arts degree to a possible business career might be through an accountancy qualification, I decided to do that.  After qualification I could then decide the track to further follow.</p><p>  I should explain that my father owned and managed two small mills in Inniskeen and Dundalk making animal feed as well as oatmeal and wheaten meal for human consumption.  I grew up helping out in the mill, working with the lorries delivering pig and poultry meals throughout counties Monaghan, Louth and Cavan, and in the office.  The business had been founded by my grandfather but it has not survived to the third generation as larger, more ambitious companies squeeze out the last water mill on the River Finn and a slightly larger Dundalk-based companion.</p><p>  As well as growing and developing the family milling business, my grandfather had been one of the consortium which rescued Belleek Pottery in County Fermanagh in the early 1920s, and subsequently my father had been chairman of that world-renowned family-owned Irish craft business.  Thus, I grew up in a household that debated the challenges and opportunities of developing a privately-owned business in the face of fierce competitive pressures, an environment that characterises most indigenous Irish companies.  The importance of export markets was also brought home by the exploratory shipping and branding of Irish porridge oats for the United States in the 1960s and the strong if modest continuing demand for Belleek's unique charms from its devotees overseas, mostly in North America.</p><p>  When I successfully qualified as a chartered accountant in 1979 with a leading Irish firm, Stokes Kennedy Crowley, or SKC, later to become KPMG, I decided it would be good for me to get broader experience by spending some time abroad.  I was lucky to get a post with KPMG's office in Boston, Massachusetts, where I spent almost two years getting to see from the inside the remarkably robust and vibrant US economy.  When that posting finished I was expected to bring back my additional experience and expertise to the Irish firm.  Given the very tough economic conditions of the early 1980s, I resisted the temptation to return to the by now struggling family businesses and decided to invest further in my professional career, still unsure as to what should be my medium or long-term career horizons.</p><p>  I found that I got to love the challenges of auditing and devising a portfolio of Irish and foreign-owned businesses and progressed within KPMG to partnership in 1988.  My clients ranged from large foreign direct investment, FDI, companies, public limited companies, PLCs, State-owned commercial enterprises, and banks, insurance and investment management firms, starting with the nascent IFSC, to entrepreneurial, privately-owned successful and growing indigenous companies.  I was elected managing partner of KPMG, a role equivalent to chief executive in a company, in 2006.  I was re-elected in 2009 for a second term, and I have just completed a second and final term in that role, and retiring from the partnership of KPMG at the end of April.  </p><p>  KPMG is among the largest professional services firms in Ireland, with approximately 80 partners and 1,800 staff.  As managing partner of KPMG I have also chaired the KPMG Ireland executive team and the firm's elected board.  As a senior partner in the Irish firm I was a member of KPMG International's 25-person global board and, separately, the EMA board, as well as being one of the ten country senior partners who are members of KPMG's global executive team, the top governance body of the global network of our firms.  That experience gave me contacts and insights into business and economic developments in developed and developing countries around the world.</p><p>  With reference to other boardroom experience, I am currently a non-executive director of The Irish Times Limited and of the Dublin Theatre Festival.</p> <p>In addition, I am a member of the council of the Irish Management Institute and the advisory board of the Women's Executive Network Ireland.  I am also chairman of Enactus Ireland, an organisation which involves businesses supporting and sponsoring student teams - currently featuring seven leading universities in Ireland - to develop and put into action social innovation projects and programmes which address real social needs, using business and entrepreneurial principles and strategies.  </p><p> I was recently asked to join the board of the Institute of International and European Affairs.  I have been active in professional associations, thus gaining insights into the issues facing accountants advising Irish companies North and South. </p><p> I was chairman of the then Society of Chartered Accountants in 1990, and was elected to the council of the all-Ireland Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland in 1994.  I was president of the institute in 2004-05.  I have represented the institute and the T&aacute;naiste's review group on Auditing 2000 which recommended the establishment of the current regulatory framework for auditors and accountants in Ireland.  </p><p> Finally, I have been a board member of the Chartered Accountants' Regulatory Board since 2007.  It is an innovation of the institute that acts as a separate group, with a majority of non-accountants, to develop and approve the detailed regulations and administer the inspection and disciplinary regimes for chartered accountants in Ireland.</p><p> One of the great advantages of having been an auditor and adviser is that I have had extensive experience and exposure to the corporate governance and business issues that a wide range of boards face both in the public and private sectors.  I will be happy to expand on any aspect of my background.  I have separately provided a detailed resum&eacute; to assist the committee in this regard.  </p><p> I would now like to speak about Enterprise Ireland itself.  Although KPMG has many interactions with EI, I was not deeply familiar with the details of the organisation, nor its detailed operating issues, prior to the beginning of the process.  The several weeks since the Minister, Deputy Bruton, approached me about this role, have therefore been particularly interesting.  I have met a number of the organisation's executives and have read as much about the business of the organisation as time has allowed.</p><p> Although my impressions at this stage are not as developed as I hope they will be in time, I would nonetheless like to share them with the committee.  My strong impression is that Enterprise Ireland is a competent, well-run and effective organisation.  The executive is sophisticated and dedicated and what it has achieved, particularly over the last four or five years, is impressive.  I do not make this statement lightly and do so only by reference to my experience of other Irish and international companies of which we, as a country, should be proud.</p><p> The committee will have heard from Frank Ryan of the impressive achievements of EI over the last year when it supported client companies in achieving record exports of over &euro;16.2 billion in 2012, while EI client companies also increased full-time employment to over 145,000 last year.  Additionally, EI continued to be extremely active in such areas as funding early-stage and high potential start-up companies, building leadership and management capability within companies, supporting research and development, transferring innovation from third-level research to real commercial exploitation, and investing in an increasing range and amount of equity and venture funds. </p><p> This is not to deny that EI needs to continue to sharpen its focus on a number of issues in the immediate period ahead.  I see these issues arising under a number of different headings.  The first of the issues is the appointment of a new chief executive.  I know Mr. Frank Ryan and have seen his work and the team he has built around him.  It is clear to me that he has been an excellent chief executive who will be particularly hard to replace.  The identification and appointment of a new chief executive is a particularly important job for the new chairman and I intend to devote significant energy to it over the next while.</p><p> The second area of focus for me is maintaining a strong and effective board.  The board is currently in some transition, with the terms of a number of members expiring this year, in addition to the completion of a successful term for chairman, Mr. Hugh Cooney, and Frank Ryan's own departure later in the year.  It is, of course, a matter for the Minister as to who is appointed to the board but I intend to work with him to identify the optimal blend of skills and people to move the work of EI forward. </p><p> It will also be a central part of the chairman&rsquo;s role to continue to ensure strong communication and transparency between the organisation and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as well as to engender a purposeful and cohesive dynamic in the EI board itself.  Another area of focus will be to make sure that EI is collaborating sensibly and constructively with other Departments and agencies - especially the IDA and Bord Bia - and with the local authorities as they work on integrating the established strong network of county and city enterprise boards into the about to be established Local Enterprise Offices, or LEOs.</p><p> A fourth area of focus for me will be to help EI deal with the challenges that face management as it adapts and reshapes the organisation to reflect the pressure on resources, especially staff resources, that arises as a result of currently constrained Exchequer funding.  Lastly, EI will soon be commencing the development of a new strategic plan for the period 2014-16, which will set out the priority areas for the agency to focus on over the coming three years and beyond, in order to drive entrepreneurship, job creation and export growth in an effort to deliver a significant and necessary contribution to the economic recovery of the State. </p><p> It will be a privilege for me to become chairman of Enterprise Ireland and to work with the board, the executive and the staff in the organisation.  My goal as EI chairman will be to manage and lead the agency&rsquo;s board in an effective and efficient manner.  Working closely with the board of the organisation and with a focus on the policy objectives communicated by the Minister, I intend to challenge and encourage the chief executive and the management team to continue to develop Enterprise Ireland in accordance with the country's needs, to provide a quality and supportive environment for ambitious indigenous Irish companies as they strive to make their way in the world, adding jobs and winning export sales for Ireland. </p><p> I thank the Chairman and other members of the joint committee for the invitation to appear before them today.  I will be pleased to take any questions.</p></speech>

As an observation, having gone through his background and all the organisations he has been involved in, it is probably just as well that Monaghan do not get to too many Ulster finals and do not win too often, as there would not be time fit it all in.  I thank Mr. O'Rourke for his presentation.  He has left no stone unturned in giving us details of his background.  It is clear to me that he will be the right person to chair Enterprise Ireland.  There is no doubt about that.  I now call on Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins.</p></speech>

How does Mr. O'Rourke see that in terms of jobs growth, which is what we all want to see?  Third, how does Mr. O'Rourke see the collaboration he mentioned between EI and the LEOs?

Therefore one of the challenges for EI is to adapt to the changing world around us and develop further.</p><p>  Enterprise Ireland is a complex organisation which has a breadth or responsibilities and programmes.  They all interact with each other - including research, entrepreneurship and funding - yet they all need focus and dedication.  One of the issues therefore is to ensure that EI is as coherent as possible in developing all its different programmes.  They all need to be renewed, refreshed and reinvigorated as well as being connected.  That will be a particular challenge for EI.</p><p>  Deputy Kyne referred to world economic conditions.  I spent last week in Singapore where one sees cranes on the horizon, which is amazing.  It is a vibrant business centre.  I met the EI representatives in Singapore who are plugged into the issues happening in the region.  There are great opportunities there.  Parts of the world are growing and we know about the emerging middle classes that will spend a lot more money on products and services over the next ten to 20 years.</p> <p>They will be situated in developing countries.  The ASEAN region, which includes Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia, has a population in the hundreds of millions and offers significant opportunities for Irish companies.  Economic conditions are challenging around the world.  Europe's economy is particularly difficult or stagnant but America appears to be doing well and the east and south are moving ahead, although the road is not clear of challenges.  The eurozone is seen as a political issue in Singapore because its growth depends on European stability and resilience.  We are not yet out of the woods globally but there are numerous opportunities.</p><p> I have been involved in the implementation working group for local enterprise offices.  Our challenge is to combine the best of county enterprise boards with the best of what was provided by local authorities.  There will be great opportunities but they will require management and dedication.  The centre of excellence to which Mr. Hayes referred will be very important, with Enterprise Ireland setting the framework and policies on a uniform and high standard of support for enterprise in Ireland.  It could work very well but it will not be easy and will require people to put their shoulders to the wheel to get it underway.</p><p> The job action plan is comprehensive and detailed.  Enterprise Ireland is involved in the majority of the actions and we have a number of tasks to monitor and progress.  All of them are important but I question whether we should prioritise them by, for example, tiering them according the most important actions.  A number of areas are not in a satisfactory position and will have to be progressed.  The action programme is a good way of setting clear targets and reporting quarterly.  The discipline is welcome but the proliferation and breadth of the plan is an issue.</p><p> In regard to the abilities and vision of the new CEO, the most important ingredient is leadership.  We have great talent and skills among the executives in Enterprise Ireland but the CEO will need to be a real leader who can align the organisation's activities and goals to make sure everyone is marching together according to its objectives.  Managing relationships is also critical, including with the Department and the Minister and across the bodies such as Bord Bia.  It is also important to maintain a relationship with the public.  Mr. Ryan has done an excellent job in projecting Enterprise Ireland among the public and making sure people understand the important role it play.  The new CEO should be able to convey that message and articulate the activities and ambitions of Enterprise Ireland in order to build community support for making the best of Irish business.</p><p> The plan for 2014 to 2016 is important in terms of recalibrating Enterprise Ireland.  The strategic plan for the previous three years has been successful and the new plan will be developed by the end of this year.  Executive management is responsible for developing the plan, with input from the Department and the political arena, but the board has a role in challenging and critiquing it.  It is not a matter for the board to come up with the plan.  We are there to ensure the process is sensible and that the appropriate inputs and ingredients have been included in formulating the plan so that it is robust.  I will encourage my fellow board members to poke at the plan to ensure it stands up to scrutiny given that the organisation will be measured against it in the coming three years.  It needs to get the best out of the organisation and do the best for Ireland, but it also needs to be achievable.</p></speech>

That represents money for people in our communities who are buying goods locally and enhancing quality of life and the economy.  It is an added advantage that many of our indigenous companies source locally.  The increase in export sales equates to a net increase of 3,000 jobs.  While I was researching my policy paper, which Fianna F&aacute;il will launch tomorrow, I was struck by the major changes that have occurred since Connie Doody and I started out in the late 1980s.  There is now a network of 28 offices and nearly 60 virtual offices that Enterprise Ireland operates overseas to provide access to markets and introductions to buyers.</p><p>  I have come to the conclusion that we have to get indigenous companies to internationalise as quickly as possible.  In our time it was done on a step-by-step basis.  KPMG was good to us in terms of looking after our accounts for a very modest charge.  Modern technology and cheap air fares have made a significant difference.  When we started out in the 1980s it was very expensive to fly anywhere.  Skype and other technologies offer significant potential for conference calls and meetings.  There is no excuse for companies but they have to be pushed.  I was pleased to learn about the launch of the new potential exporters division.  This is a critical initiative.  Irish companies account for just 10% of the country's exports.  We must increase that proportion.  The access that Enterprise Ireland is opening to overseas connections will create tremendous opportunities for companies to internationalise quicker.</p><p>  I wish Mr. O'Rourke the best of luck.  I know he will be excellent in his new role.  I also convey my best wishes to Mr. Hugh Cooney and hope everything progresses well for him.</p><p>  The county and city enterprise boards are doing excellent work on the ground but they need defined budgets.  The Minister has indicated that he will introduce legislation in autumn but we cannot assign bureaucrats to do these jobs because they need entrepreneurial people like Mr. Ryan and the Enterprise Ireland team.  Enterprise Ireland has to take personal responsibility in ensuring the right people work in the local enterprise offices.  They will die otherwise.  In my experience they are doing very well in terms of helping small companies.</p><p>  I commend Enterprise Ireland on establishing a women's entrepreneur unit led by Ms Jean O'Sullivan.</p> <p>They have done amazing work.  When the spotlight went on the women with the feasibility grants and start-up funds, they responded.  In Ireland two and a half times more men start businesses than women.  We are down at the lower end of the EU scale for this, just ahead of Poland, France - which would not surprise one - and the Czech Republic.  We are failing to tap into half the potential of the country, and we are not being competitive internationally, if we are not using women's talents and energies.  That is what the Fianna F&aacute;il policy paper, which is being launched tomorrow, is about.</p><p> I wish Mr. Ryan the best of luck.  I have known him for a long time, probably 40 years.  Ireland has been privileged to have had him leading the organisation.  He is the highest-minded person one could meet.  I formally thank him.  He is a true patriot and brought the Enterprise Ireland team with him.  Please God the person who gets the job in the future will be his equal.</p></speech>

She mentioned the very welcome export increase, the increase in employment, which, I agree with the Senator, we are all about, and our overseas offices.  We have had very good news in the last couple of days from the Secretary General on staffing allocations for those offices in due course, and we will have more about that later.</p><p>  It is vitally important for Irish companies to internationalise as soon as possible.  We are very pleased with the progress of the potential exporters' division.  It is dealing with approximately 1,100 companies at various stages of initial inquiry to starting to export.  That special team in the UK is dedicated to helping them break into their first market.  It is planned that the existing CEB staff will transfer in their current positions.  Enterprise Ireland will be responsible for training those staff and they will be eligible to attend our internal training programmes so we get the one level of competence.  I agree with the Senator on the contribution and calibre of staff within the CEBs.</p><p>  We have been very fortunate to have two of my colleagues, Ms Jean O'Sullivan and Mr. John O'Dea, take up a dedicated focus on female entrepreneurs.  We are very pleased with the level and quality of applications we have received for the feasibility study and competitive start fund, whereby we have invested &euro;50,000 into 15 start-up funds.  As part of the awareness campaign we are sponsoring the <i>Image </i>magazine awards, the <i>Women Mean Business</i> magazine awards and the Going for Growth initiative.  We are developing an online secure female networking platform, which we hope to launch early next year under the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  We continue to do research on that.  Female entrepreneurship will remain a key focus for Enterprise Ireland in the next three year plan.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be with the joint sub-committee, even if from a long distance away.  I am Pascal Saint-Amans and I am director of the OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration.  As the joint sub-committee is aware, the OECD is an organisation of 34 member countries, including Ireland.  We work in many areas, including that which relates to tax.  The OECD has a Committee on Fiscal Affairs - the membership of which comprises the tax policy directors of the member countries - that meets twice a year.  We have many working parties which conduct our technical work.  In their work, these committees and parties are serviced by the secretariat of which I am in charge.  Some of our work relates to tax policy analysis and the economic aspects of such analysis.  Mainly, however, our main work relates to international tax law, that is, international tax treaties to eliminate double taxation, transfer pricing rules and international corporations, which includes exchange of information.  This work is based on the model tax convention, which was first elaborated by the League of Nations in the 1920s and which was taken on by the OECD in the 1950s.  Our work is aimed at eliminating double taxation, favouring cross-border investment and encouraging better co-operation between governments in order to ensure that the tax sovereignty of states is protected.</p><p>  I have been asked to testify before the joint sub-committee in order to outline some of the hot topics with which we are currently dealing.  At the weekend, among the key topics discussed by G20 Finance Ministers were base erosion, profit shifting and the automatic exchange of information.  In the context of combating base erosion and profit shifting, we launched a project last year which is being conducted within the OECD.  We operate on a consensus basis in this regard and this means that progress cannot be made without all the countries involved either reaching agreement on a particular subject or at least not objecting to a particular course of action.  Our work in this area is focused on addressing one of the key challenges which has arisen in the current international environment, namely, the fact that as a result of the gap between the way international tax rules have evolved and the way business has changed, there are now wide avenues which multinational companies that are exposed to international transactions can in order to avoid paying tax anywhere.  This is what a number of observers have referred to as double non-taxation.  The action plan we have brought forward in the context of addressing this issue is based on the report we produced in February.</p><p>  Our goal in this area is to ensure that companies pay taxes in at least one place and that we bring an end to the disconnect between the location of the profits and the location where the activity takes place while ensuring that we will continue with the elimination of double taxation.  By reaching a balance in this regard, we are of the view that we will be in a position to ensure adherence to the international standards which are absolutely necessary in the context of creating certainty and providing a nice environment in which businesses can operate, invest and create growth and jobs.</p></speech>

On that basis, I will divide the remaining time to ensure that every other member of the committee will be able to engage with him on some level.</p><p>  Mr. Saint-Amans will be aware that the Irish Government has recently been obliged to respond to media attention in respect of Ireland's perceived role with regard to the structures employed by multinational companies which operate in this country and elsewhere.</p> <p>There has been a perception that the problem is a global one and that this was created by mismatches or gaps between different countries' domestic systems.  Is it best suited for Ireland to deal with these issues in a unilateral fashion in regard to the base erosion profit-shifting mechanism that the OECD is proposing or is that best done on a multilateral basis and dealt with as a multilateral solution?  What is Mr. Saint-Amans's view on this issue?  Can nations take unilateral positions on this or is a multilateral approach the only one to be taken?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.96" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300003#B00200"><p>The reason the OECD has been asked by many countries to carry on this work is precisely because it requires a multilateral approach.  This should not prevent countries from taking their own decisions and implementing their own policy.  If one wants to address this issue, as shown in the report we published in February, one needs to address issues in the area of international taxation and tax treaties.  We are in charge of the model tax convention and bilateral tax treaties, which, by definition, involve more than one country.  Especially in today's environment, where a chain of trade or business involves not only two countries but a series of countries and therefore a series of bilateral tax treaties, usually there is a need for a novel approach which would not be limited to one country.  Moreover, the issue of transfer pricing, which is at the core of base erosion and profit shifting, is also related to the implementation of the article 9 of the model tax convention, which deals with transfer pricing which enshrines what we call the arm's length principle, which is a method to determine how a group of companies should price internal transactions, transactions internal to the group.  The interpretation of the arm's length principle must be adopted by all the countries participating and not only by one.  We have fought for years at the OECD to have international consensus on the way to interpret the arm's length principle or to play with it.  If we have countries taking their own approaches, which would not be consensual, this would result in the increasing risk of double taxation, which is something we must avoid.</p><p>  In a nutshell, this is a multilateral issue, which requires a multilateral response.  A single country cannot address it and that is why we think a multilateral approach is the right one.  That is why the Irish Government has been clear and active in supporting this project.  The delegates of the Irish Government have attended all the meetings, have contributed and have been very active.  Ireland also had the Presidency of the Council of the European Union and over the past six months it ensured that we would work well with the European Union while developing this action plan, but again that does not prevent countries from also taking unilateral measures if they want.  We are not a harmonising organisation and we do not want to impede on the tax sovereignty on other countries.</p></speech>

For instance, in the case of our closest neighbour, Britain, I heard the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, talk recently about the introduction of a new tax rate, with perhaps a patent box regime of 10%, or, in some cases, perhaps a zero rate in the area of innovation and development.  These are the areas in which intellectual copyright is very prominent.  What would be the view of the OECD on the introduction of such regimes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300003#B00400"><p>There are two aspects to the Chairman's question.  One is the rates that can be implemented in one country and the other aspect is the rate that can be targeted at what we tax people call patent boxes, to which the Chairman referred in the context of the UK.  On the first aspect, since the late 1990s work has been carried out in this area.  This area was then called the harmful tax practices work or unfair tax competition work and the consensus among OECD countries has been that countries are sovereign to decide their own tax rates, that fair tax competition is not the problem and, as a result, it means that countries should decide on their corporate income tax rates.  Moreover, other work we have carried out on the tax policy analysis area has shown that the OECD favours rather low direct taxes, rather than high direct taxes, because they are pro-growth.  What was highlighted at the end of the 1990s, and the rules have not changed since, are that harmful tax practices are to be condemned and harmful tax practices are those designed to attract mobile investment by being ring-fenced and also by offering a lack of transparency.  This means that the 12.5% rate, which we understand is at the cornerstone of the Irish economy, is not questioned.</p><p>  The other part of the Chairman's question dealing with patent boxes needs to be looked at through the same angle, namely, are these practices harmful and what will be the criteria, namely, those included in the 1998 report, which was adopted by all OECD countries and which they consider to be the rules.  Clearly, action 4 or 5 - the best action plan we have come up with publicly on 19 July - deals with harmful tax practices, the need to reinvigorate that work and to look at the regimes.  Obviously patent boxes are regimes which will be looked at but they will be considered based on the existing criteria.  If they are deemed to be harmful because they have some features which would make them harmful, they will considered in terms of being dismantled, but if they are not harmful, they will be maintained by the governments which installed them.</p></speech>

To move on to another area, much publicity in recently times has involved US multinationals and there have been a number of hearings in Washington and also some hearings in London concerning taxation and US multinationals.

The tax action plan we submitted as well as the report we issued in February are the result of technical work by the delegates from all our member countries and by the delegates form a number of non-member countries, the G20 countries in particular, India, China, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and a few others.  This work is consensual.  We work by consensus at the OECD.  Consensus means that a document, a recommendation or a report is adopted when nobody objects to it any more or, to put it more positively, when everybody agrees.  It is my understanding that the US Government agrees with the action plan, as it is.  Without unveiling secrets of negotiations, I can tell the Chairman that the US has been very active in promoting this work.  This work was initiated last year and the US was very active in promoting this new approach to tackle base erosion profit shifting and it was also very active in developing the action plan.  I think the US supports this report, as was shown at the Committee on Fiscal Affairs, the CFA, a few weeks ago where the action plan was adopted, and also more recently at the G20 meeting where all the G20 countries indicated that they fully endorsed, to use that term, this action plan.</p></speech>

Just before the brief interruption I invited Deputy Michael McGrath to ask him a few questions.  He has ten minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300004#C00600"><p>I thank Mr. Saint-Amans for giving us his time today.  I will follow on with the questioning where the Chairman finished.  As he is aware, the proceedings will be closely monitored not just in this country but internationally.  Like most jurisdictions our priority in reading the report he has compiled is to inquire and interrogate its impact on our tax environment.  In that regard I wish to put a question to him about the harsh criticism this country received in the US Senate sub-committee meeting concerning certain multinationals.  An allegation was made that this country is essentially a tax haven.  Could Mr. Saint-Amans give us the OECD response to the allegation, which was made in an important international forum, based on the agreed principles defining a tax haven, and with regard to this country's very transparent statute-based system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300004#C00700"><p>The answer is very simple.  Ireland is not a tax haven.  There is only one definition which was internationally agreed on what a tax haven is, which is the definition that was included in the report I already mentioned that was issued in 1998.  The report gives a four-tier definition of what a tax haven is.  It is a jurisdiction where there is no tax or nominal tax, where there is no transparency, no exchange of information and no real activity.  Those are the four criteria for the definition.  Clearly, Ireland does not fall at all into this category.  To respond to the question very bluntly, the answer is &ldquo;No, sir&rdquo;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300004#C00800"><p>I thank Mr. Saint-Amans for clarifying the point.  He has confirmed to the Chairman that the corporation tax rate in each country is a sovereign matter for that country, but when he was in Ireland recently he made a comment that if a country has a 12.5% rate then he would like to see companies actually paying 12.5%.  That comment was seen very much in the context of the debate that has been ongoing from the US Senate hearings and the hearings in the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee as well.  Is it not the case that Ireland operates a very transparent transfer pricing regime?  Is it not also the case that when there is commentary that certain companies in Ireland are only paying a 2% rate it does not take account of the fact that we can only tax companies that are tax resident in this country and only on taxable profits?  Is it not also the case that in arriving at a figure such as 2%, which I know Mr. Saint-Amans did not &ndash; I do not direct the accusation at him &ndash; people are confusing the profits of tax-resident Irish companies with companies which are connected but which are tax-resident elsewhere, and which, while they may be incorporated in Ireland, have no activities, assets, employees or income in Ireland?  Could Mr. Saint-Amans clarify his position on that?  He was very clear to the Chairman that the 12.5% rate is an Irish decision, and that is not on the table in any respect, but could he clarify what he means in terms of the actual rate that is paid and his comment that companies should pay 12.5% if the rate is 12.5%?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300004#C00900"><p>I thank Deputy McGrath for this question and for giving me the opportunity to clarify something which may have been misperceived.  What I tried to say when I was in Ireland a few weeks ago was that what the world is currently concerned with &ndash; I understand there is consensus on that concern &ndash; which is that we have moved from the elimination of double taxation to the facilitation of double non-taxation.  We have been very clear in the OECD that it is not any country&rsquo;s fault, nor is it the fault of the business; it is just a matter of fact or of law where one has some discrepancies or loopholes in the law.  When I refer to law I am referring to the articulation between domestic tax rules and international tax rules as they have developed based on the model tax convention and the interpretation of transfer pricing.  In other words, instead of having companies paying their corporate income tax at the rate which is paid in the country, the play on the different domestic rules, international rules and the gaps between tax sovereignties have resulted in lowering quite dramatically the effective tax rate of a number of companies.  In general those companies are the internationally exposed companies - in other words, multinationals.</p><p>  What I was trying to say is that 12.5% is not a problem.  In the international environment, as is, there is consensus on the fact that it belongs to fair tax competition but there is concern when the articulation of the different rules will result in an effective tax rate which is dramatically different from the secondary tax rate in Ireland as in any other country.  What is being attempted is to precisely make sure that we reconcile the location of the profits and the location of the real business so that we can reconcile the statutory tax rate with what companies are paying or there will always be a legislative gap between the effective tax rate and the secondary tax rate, which is not legitimate.  What is no longer considered acceptable is that the gap would be justified by the inadequacy of international tax rules on how business currently operates.  I hope that clarifies my previous statements.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Saint-Amans for that.  Would the full implementation of the report prepared by Mr. Saint-Amans make Ireland more or less attractive from a taxation point of view or would the difference only be around the margins?  Does Mr. Saint-Amans have a view on that based on his knowledge and understanding of the Irish system and what impact the proposed changes would be likely to have on our corporation tax offering?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.111" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300004#C01100"><p>That is a difficult question because it would require some anticipation of being part of the action plan and the fact that it is properly and fully implemented.  Let us assume that is the case because we have worked very hard to make this happen.  That would mean we would reconcile the location of the real activity and the location of the profits.  Companies would no longer be allowed to play on the rules to erode the basis in countries where they operate and locate the profits in jurisdictions where they do not operate.  Of course it is hard to do such abstract reasoning.  Deputy McGrath knows better than I that there is some special interaction between Ireland and the United States and the way the US tax system is designed.  The action plan is not fit to change US domestic law.  That is a question of tax sovereignty in the US.  I am pretty sure Deputy McGrath knows as much as I do about the current political debate in the US which is happening on Capitol Hill, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, to change US tax law.</p> <p>The next action plan will have an impact but from an Irish perspective I guess it also depends on reform of tax policy in the United States.</p><p> To take some risk in responding to Deputy McGrath's very interesting question, I would say - and I am not saying this because I am addressing Irish parliamentarians - that the implementation of the action plan should not reduce Ireland's competitiveness but may result in more real business being located in Ireland and not real business moving away from Ireland.  I do not see any negative impact but rather a positive impact because closing these avenues which facilitate double non-taxation will make it more interesting or important to locate the real profit in jurisdictions that are competitive with our tax system, which is the case-----</p></speech>

My final question is to ask him to clarify his core objective with the report.  Is it to get multinational companies to pay more tax globally on an overall aggregate basis or to redistribute where corporation tax is paid, depending on where the profits are finally residing?  How confident is Mr. Saint-Amans that he will achieve progress in the timeline he has set out given that he is dealing with approximately 40 separate jurisdictions, all of which will be motivated, understandably, by their national self-interest?</p></speech>

It is to make sure that countries get the right to tax and do not face base erosion through artificial settings such as massive interest deductibility, the use of hybrid mismatches from entities or products and other harmful tax practices, but also through artificial shifting of permanent establishments by not meeting the current definition, abuse transfer pricing rules or just use of the transfer pricing rules, which we would then need to change.</p><p>  As to whether we are confident to implement the action plan, I am paid to make sure we implement this action plan and I am paid to be optimistic and to turn optimism into action.  I am confident we will be able to do it because we have political consensus on the action plan.  The way we have played it has been to make sure that we would have an agreement on the sense of direction.  What has been agreed and what was released a few days ago is an action plan which states: "These are the problems.  These are the solutions.  This is where we want to be in 18 to 24 months time".  There is political consensus at the highest level, including among the G20 countries.  It is not all about the G20 countries.  We are servicing our member countries - the 34 member countries of which Ireland is one - but we also have the endorsement by the G20 countries, which means that we have reached out of the OECD membership.  This has been endorsed and because of the political profile of that project, it has been endorsed by the governments, not only by tax people, and because we have political agreement, I believe it will be easier to turn to the tax people, the technical people, and tell them that they need to develop the instruments but that they know where they must be in two years' time because there is political agreement on the solution.  That is why I believe we will implement this plan within the timeframe, which is ambitious, but on the other hand, if we said there was a major problem and we would take ten years to solve it, that is not solving it.  That is why we thought we needed to have this ambitious political deadline of 18 to 24 months.</p></speech>

Will he give us some more information on how that figure was reached?</p><p>  Regarding some of the meetings in the US House of Representatives, the chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, Mr. Camp, has made it clear that reforming the way taxes are gathered is the major issue and that the focus should not be on grilling corporations on their legal tax avoidance strategies.  Does Mr. Saint-Amans have any comments to make on what the chairman, Mr. Camp, is doing?  I know he does not want to comment specifically on the policies of other countries, but the Cut Unjustified Tax Loopholes Act was brought forward in the US Senate by Senator Levin.

My first reaction to the figures he has mentioned is that I do not know about them.  I am surprised he found that in OECD documentation because I am always very careful not to quote any figure on a country.  I am always clear to say that we do not know the amounts that are at stake.  I do not know from where the &euro;3,000 billion the Deputy mentioned comes.  Sometimes I refer to one figure, which is the accumulated profit by US multinationals set offshore.  That figure, which is available here and there, and is about $2 trillion, $2,000 billion.  That is the US figure we are just quoting.  The OECD has never given a figure as regards the potential tax gap resulting from either tax avoidance or tax evasion.</p><p>  The Deputy's first question related to what we can do about the tax havens.  Two issues arise.  It is good that we do not only focus on the tax issue because the other issue is about transparency and exchange of information.  The Deputy probably knows that the OECD has been to the forefront in the fight to improve transparency for the past years, if not decades.  Recently, we facilitated the endorsement of exchange of information on request as the standard, which is now endorsed by all countries around the world, with the exception of Lebanon.  We created a global forum on transparency and exchange of information and all the jurisdictions that formally qualified as tax havens have joined this global forum.  They have committed to implementing the standard on exchange of information and they have started implementing this standard through the negotiation of bilateral agreements.  We now have more than 1,000 agreements which have been negotiated versus 40 between 2000 and 2008.  That is major progress.  As we reported to the G20 a few days ago, we are now moving towards automatic exchange of information being a way to exchange financial information such as bank account balance, interest, dividends, sales proceeds and life insurance products on an automatic basis along the lines of what the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, has provided.</p> <p>I understand that Ireland has already signed a FATCA intergovernmental agreement with the US.  That is what we are doing with what are now called tax jurisdictions.  The next layer of pressure will be to get them signed up to an automatic exchange of information.  </p><p> As regards their role, we are not trying to tackle countries or impede their sovereign jurisdictions.  As the Chairman indicated, a number of them are UK overseas territories or Crown dependencies.  Those two categories are included in UK law.  Therefore it is not to impede sovereignty but rather to neutralise the schemes which would use them.  In other words, instead of telling jurisdictions with no direct tax - and there are a number of them, in the Caribbean in particular - that they should have taxes, the action plan will try to neutralise the use of these jurisdictions to locate profits there artificially so that those profits are not taxed where they accrue - either in the source countries where the activities are deployed or in the residence countries where the companies' headquarters are located and financing is taking place.</p><p> We invoke these jurisdictions and push them to implement transparency standards and exchange information.  This is being reviewed by the global forum.  As regards tax avoidance or the BEST project, it is neutralising the schemes rather than getting jurisdictions to change their legislation, unless they are engaged in harmful tax practices.</p><p> I do not have much to say about what Chairman Kemp is proposing in the US, except that clearly one aspect of his proposal in the draft bill is entitled "Base Erosion".  This clearly goes in the direction of what the international community has agreed with the action plan.</p></speech>

Why does Mr. Saint-Amans think this issue has become such a major one now, given that many of the taxation issues and multinationals' corporation policies would not have changed dramatically in the last few years?  What does he think has currently brought this matter to such prominence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300006#E00300"><p>I will give my personal assessment or view based on my experience at the OECD for the past four and a half years.  This is due to the crisis and it is a political issue.  The crisis has brought up the need for more transparency in governance all around the world.  I remember the Irish Government was very active at that time, and still is, in fighting bank secrecy for tax purposes.  That was the first layer of pressure.</p><p>  We cannot buy out our financial industry - and I understand this is something that is very sensitive in Ireland - while this industry is facilitating tax fraud.  In other words, we cannot put taxpayers' money on the table to buy out banks which facilitate tax evasion through their counterparts located in secretive jurisdictions.  This triggered all the work, including that of the G20, on putting an end to bank secrecy for tax purposes. </p><p>  Tax avoidance is the second layer.  It is hard for elected governments across the world - and I am talking to politicians who understand these things better than I do - to explain to their people that they have to increase direct and indirect taxes.  Over the past three years, VAT has increased in 25 out of 33 OECD member countries.  The US does not have VAT.  Personal income tax has increased almost everywhere.  I understand that personal income tax has increased quite significantly in Ireland.</p><p>  Therefore, governments have to explain to the public that they are cutting expenditure and increasing taxes.  Meanwhile, media campaigns explain that some large, profitable multinationals have an effective tax rate which is dramatically different from the statutory tax rate of the countries where they operate.  That includes Ireland where the corporation tax rate is 12.5% while the effective tax rate of some such companies is between 3% and 5%.  Therefore there is a political problem because it is hard to explain that this is the unintended outcome of an outdated international tax architecture, which has facilitated double non-taxation.</p></speech>

I welcome his contribution to the committee and particularly the last discussion about the justification, in the face of austerity, that multinational companies operating here and in other jurisdictions are paying a very low effective tax rate compared to the corporation tax rate we have set.  As Mr. Saint-Amans has heard from other members of the committee, there has been much discussion on how Ireland's taxation policy facilitates multinational corporations accruing a low effective tax rate.</p><p>  Mr. Saint-Amans mentioned earlier that Ireland is not a tax haven, which I agree with, under the OECD's criterion.  However, is there any country in the world - currently using the same criteria - that is a tax haven? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.131" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300006#E01000"><p>As I indicated, the definition of a tax haven was elaborated in 1998 in a context where a large number of jurisdictions were attached to strict bank secrecy.  The definition therefore focused on these aspects with no exchange of information and no transparency.  Since 2008, major progress has been made in this domain with almost all jurisdictions now not only having committed to, but also having implemented, the standards on transparency and exchange of information.  That would explain why the response to the Deputy's question is that we probably do not have many jurisdictions left, if any, which meet the definition of a tax haven.</p> <p>That said, I think the definition is still relevant.  The two other aspects are no tax and no real business activity.  If one puts aside the lack of transparency, there are a large number of jurisdictions meeting these criteria.  This is not the comprehensive definition of what a tax haven is.  However, there is no doubt Ireland is transparent and it is at the forefront of the fight for transparency.  I understand that Ireland has taxation and attracts real business activity.  It is very far from the definition of a tax haven.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300007#F00200"><p>A country must meet all five criteria of the definition to be a tax haven.  For clarity, the OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, does not see any jurisdiction in the world as a tax haven.  The reason I make this point is that the accusation made by the US Senate committee was that we share the space with Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  One of those jurisdictions has over 150,000 registered companies at one address.  We also know the US has over 200,000 companies at the one address.  Sometimes one has the pot calling the kettle black.</p><p>  The definition of a tax haven is outdated.  We have seen multinational companies change but the OECD has not.  In the US Senate Committee there has been a focus on one multinational company operating in this jurisdiction.  The report correctly identified the discrepancy between domestic law here and in the United States.  What effect would the implementation of the recommendations have on that Irish incorporated multinational company which is a non-tax resident both here and in the United States?  It has not paid any tax on income of &euro;70 billion over the past three years.</p><p>  This report has happened as a result of political pressure within certain member states which were going to go alone which could have created double taxation issues.  In the event of no consensus on these issues being reached, is it possible for Ireland to take on some of these issues on its own?  For example, in 1998, the Department of Finance looked at a report on incorporated multinational companies which were not controlled here and were, accordingly non-tax resident, but deemed them automatically to be due to their incorporation to be tax resident here if they had no other interest in the State.  This change was made to the Finance Act 15 years ago which exempted multinational companies referred to at the United States Senate hearings.  Could we go it alone and make a company not paying tax in any jurisdiction but which is incorporated here a tax resident?</p></speech>

Again, it is Ireland&rsquo;s sovereignty to decide so.</p><p>  Assuming the best action plan translates into domestic legislation in all countries, including the US, the companies in question would be taxable in the US and would not benefit from what they currently enjoy, which is double non-taxation.</p></speech>

Can we expect this to be translated into domestic legislation?  Considering this State&rsquo;s heavy dependence on multinational companies from the United States locating here, would such a move have negative consequences for us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300007#F00500"><p>Matters can be more complicated than what the Deputy has just described.  If a country does not do anything and keeps going on with the current taxation regime, then it faces the risk that its partners will take defensive measures.  To put it another way, what is at stake is our ability to protect the set of rules designed to eliminate double taxation.  What do businesses need?  They need to be taxed only once in cross-border investments.  They cannot be taxed twice because this would have a major impact on the allocation of capital.  This would not be good for economic growth or employment.  What is at stake is reaching the balance where on the one hand all countries are keen on facilitating businesses headquartered on their territory but at the same time not offering them such a benefit that it will be rebuked by unilateral domestic legislation by other countries.  That is why we have been able to reach an agreement on a plan in this regard even with countries that are hesitant about this.  It is in the interests of all collectively that we have rules which work.</p><p>  The real prize would be that corporation and income tax, as decided by individual countries, would be paid by companies which have used loopholes to avoid paying it before.  At a time of fiscal constraint and financial and budgetary crises, one cannot afford to have implicit subsidies to companies.</p><p>  Most of the plan will be OECD recommendations.  Some of them will be to change domestic legislation to neutralise, for example, hybrid mismatches.  Part of it will also be on changing tax treaties which will be international tax legislation, not domestic.</p></speech>

Some people have said that the only problem with the double Irish Dutch sandwich is that it has the word "Irish" in it.  Based on Mr. Saint-Amans's experience and expertise, can the State break that arrangement which we know has been used by many companies in the past?</p></speech>

It is not as simple as saying that in our tax code we have a provision that offers a product we would call the double Irish Dutch sandwich to all companies.  This is the result of the articulation of different pieces of both domestic legislation and international tax law.  Can Ireland fix all this on its own?  The answer is "No".  Can Ireland contribute to changing all of this, including by unilateral moves?  The answer is probably "Yes", but that is for Ireland to consider, given the overall environment.  Can the international community provide a comprehensive response in the limited timeframe for the action plan?  The answer is "Yes", and that is what we are pushing for.</p></speech>

This is an economic piece.  It is not about low tax but about the economic analysis of tax policies.  The findings of this report were that indirect taxes were more favourable or less distortive and, therefore, more favourable to growth than direct taxes.  One of the recommendations of this report was that more emphasis should be placed on property taxes rather than increasing direct tax rates.  Overall, we recommended in terms of policy a shift towards indirect taxes rather than direct taxes.  In the field of indirect taxes, we thought property taxes had good potential for raising revenue while not being too distortive of growth.</p></speech>

How difficult will that process be?</p></speech>

Five years ago, bank secrecy was the rule in a large number of major financial centres which completely refused to engage on this.  We are now in a situation in which all the jurisdictions have committed to exchange information and have taken all the steps necessary to carry out exchange of information on request with a very strong peer review mechanism organised by the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes, which now includes 120 member countries on an equal footing.  As I indicated, because of the dynamic of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, and critical concerns expressed about offshore leaks recently, there is a new layer of pressure and interest.  We saw the case of the French budget minister who had to resign for having lied to the French National Assembly about bank accounts in Switzerland and Singapore.  We are moving to the automatic exchange of information.  As we reported to the G20 meeting of finance and labour Ministers in Moscow last weekend, we recommend that the content of the information that the US will get through FATCA should be the contents of a multilateral standard for automatic exchange of information, which is now becoming the standard.  We are developing a multilateral platform to operate this exchange of information on a multilateral basis.  There is a pilot initiative within the EU, which I think Ireland has joined, to multilateralise FATCA-type agreements.  Finally, we are providing for a legal platform with a multilateral convention on mutual assistance, which has now been signed by more than 60 countries, which the UK dependencies are joining and which can provide for automatic exchange of information.  What we expect in terms of the calendar is that in 2014, this new standard will be up and running and will, probably before the end of the year, create within the global forum a group for the automatic exchange of information so that all the global forum members would move to this new standard while keeping their commitment to exchange information on request.  So we are getting there, which is tremendous progress given where we were five years ago.</p></speech>

It sounds like a pretty difficult balance to strike.  A previous question was asked about why this was at the forefront of the international agenda.

The area where such a risk could exist is that of tax co-operation, because tax co-operation means giving up something to another country which also gives it up in a reciprocal manner so that both countries can co-operate.  In respect of neutralising schemes, a simple example may help members to understand what we have in mind.  The example is a hybrid product between two continental European countries with high taxes.  From my accent, members will know I am French, so I will take the example of a company with headquarters in France and a subsidiary in Germany.  This French company has some cash, but the German subsidiary is making a profit and does not really need cash.  The French company decides to lend money to its subsidiary through a hybrid product which is a bond convertible into a share which is designed to be a bond from a German domestic perspective and is, therefore, an interest-deductible, which is paid out of the German subsidiary, which counts as a deduction to the profit.</p> <p>However, in France it has been designed to be a share, and therefore a dividend is perceived which is tax-exempt because of the apparent subsidiary exemption.  As a result of that, between two high-tax countries we have, through the use of the hybrid instruments, a deduction in one country and no taxation in the other country, which is double non-taxation.  The deductibility in one country can erase the profit in this country without augmenting the profit in the other country.  This is a hybrid.  We will include in the recommendation to be developed on hybrid mismatches, which is No. 2 or 3 of the action plan, that countries put in place legislation which would neutralise the hybrid mismatch.  In other words, Germany examines what France is doing, and if France is exempting a product Germany would tax it and not allow deductibility of interest, or <i>vice versa</i>.  We will develop that.  Such a recommendation would not impinge on the sovereignty of France or Germany.  We are restoring the sovereignties which were put at risk because of these gaps between sovereignties and the fact that the business operates globally and no longer only in one market.</p></speech>

The definition of "tax haven" Mr. Saint-Amans is using, which is current, is meaningless.  It is just another thing the multinationals have spread around.  The phrase "double Irish" makes it clear that the tax and legal situation in this country is such that multinationals can exploit it to facilitate enormous tax avoidance.  From a moral point of view and from the point of view of the ordinary lay citizen, particularly in this country where people are being crucified with taxes, austerity and cuts, that makes us in any meaningful sense a tax haven because we are facilitating aggressive, large-scale tax avoidance by some of the wealthiest corporations in the world.</p></speech>

I fully understand his statement.  I am not a big fan of the phrase "tax haven" because many people have their own interpretation.  There are as many definitions as there are people thinking of it.  In the late 1990s the OECD tried to provide an objective definition which was focused primarily on transparency, because we were at a time when refusing to exchange information or accepting international businesses in a country without knowing who was behind them was the rule.  The definition of "tax haven" was designed to address this issue.  I do not disagree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that this definition is outdated.  I am not sad that it is outdated and I would not rush to try to define something I am not that interested in defining.  From the international perspective, Ireland is not a tax haven-----</p></speech>

These differences are the result of domestic legislation in Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Germany and many other countries, including the US.  Because Ireland has been competitive in its corporate income tax, it has obviously been used by a number of US multinationals, as has the Netherlands.</p></speech>

The only explanation Mr. Saint-Amans seems to be giving is that our low corporate tax rate seems to attract companies involved in this aggressive tax avoidance.  For the benefit of people trying to understand this situation, is the following brief description, given to me by former Google workers, an accurate description of how Ireland functions as a facilitator of tax avoidance?<blockquote><br />Google's advertising is a digital product. They sell that product to customers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa from their Dublin HQ - and as such don't have to pay taxes on that anywhere except Ireland because the sale of that good is deemed under international law to have taken place in Ireland.<br /><br />  The profit they make from all those advertising sales is eaten up by a charge levied by Google Ireland Limited's holding company - which (conveniently) tends to be almost the exact amount of profit they make. The little bit that is left is charged at the standard 12.5%.<br /><br />  The holding company's profits aren't taxed because of Irish law waiving corporation tax on certain profits made from intellectual property royalties and/or because the company isn't managed or controlled in Ireland. That money then tends to be routed through further subsidiaries in Holland before moving to the Caribbean.</blockquote>Is that a fairly accurate description of the double Irish?</p></speech>

I have no comment on the operations of private companies because I do not necessarily know them.  Does this result in having large profits located in no-tax jurisdictions?  The answer is yes, and this is why we are pushing for the best project.  When I said the double Irish exists because Ireland is attractive with the 12.5% tax rate, we need to understand how it works.  This is related to the way the US articulates Subpart F with check-the-box rules.  Companies will locate real activity in Ireland for the 12.5% rate and then create all these chains of entities under the check-the-box rules, which will allow them to shift the profits, using international tax rules such as transfer pricing, to no-tax jurisdictions.  Thus they avoid taxation in both the US and Ireland at 12.5%.  That is the overall picture, which explains why the double Irish is now known in the world.</p></speech>

Ireland should also consider it is not the only country in the world and there is an interaction with other countries.  For example, part of the tax is due in the US rather than in Ireland for the simple reason that the intangible has been developed in the US, is owned by the US and should be taxable in the US, so there is a reason to tax profit which is not accruing in Ireland.  Therefore, this issue cannot be solved unilaterally and there is need for interaction with another country in order to deal with this.</p><p>  As I indicated earlier, we believe we first need collectively to address the deficiencies of some of the international tax rules, in particular the transfer pricing rules in the area of intangibles.  The Deputy is 100% right to note there is a serious issue in this area but it is not something to be addressed unilaterally by one country as we need an international consensus to change the rules.  The current rules in Ireland are compatible with the international consensus.  What is wrong is not the current rules in Ireland, it is the international consensus.  We agree that needs to change.  Afterwards, as I indicated, countries can take the unilateral decisions they have to take, and it is within their own sovereignty to do so.</p></speech>

However, there is nothing to stop us changing those rules so that those things, for example, are not tax deductible and, similarly, there is nothing to stop us changing the rules around tax residency such that any company that is incorporated here would be taxed here.  Consequently, companies that are currently based here, but are paying tax nowhere, would be taxed here.  That would close off those loopholes.  There is nothing to stop us doing that, is there?</p></speech>

While I am not an expert on Irish legislation like the Deputy, I would draw his attention to the fact that some of what he describes is actually consistent with the international tax rules.  Therefore, what needs to be changed is the international tax rules.  That said, on the question of whether there is room for Ireland to take its own measures to change things which go beyond the international tax rules, the answer is yes, of course, as is the case in all countries.</p></speech>

Before moving to the second round of questions, I will summarise the position.  What I am hearing from Mr. Saint-Amans in response to the committee's questions is that the kernel of global taxation of multinational enterprise profits is the balance between taxation at source and that of residency, and those two different areas are ultimately where the dilemma lies.  The difficulty is the sharing of the tax take between the sovereign states in a fair and equitable fashion that bestows no singular advantage on one state over another.  Ultimately, what we are dealing with here is an issue of architecture, and the different nation member states of the OECD would have to agree to that overall architecture.  This is what Mr. Saint-Amans is proposing in his report.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Will Mr. Saint-Amans expand on those three points?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300010#J00800"><p>The government part is quite easy to understand.  Not just Ireland but all countries of the world do not collect some taxes that they should collect.  I say "they should collect" because they never intended to let that tax go, or if they did let it go, it was implicitly, and they now think this time is over.  Therefore, the position of governments is straightforward.</p><p>  For companies, there are two dimensions.  The first, which is quite obvious, is that because companies are exposed to international transactions and, therefore, can use the deficiencies which may exist in the international framework, one cannot give them a competitive advantage compared to purely domestic businesses which cannot do that.  When one looks at benchmarks in many countries, one can see there is a significant gap between the effective tax rate of multinationals and purely domestic companies.  This is a distortion which is not good for investment.</p><p>  Second, for companies, double non-taxation actually undermines the international consensus on the need to eliminate double taxation.  Where there is such a situation, at some point one may face the risk of some countries walking away from the consensus and introducing unilateral measures to protect their tax bases without trying to co-operate with the others.  This would be very bad because it would restore double taxation and might even, in a worst case scenario, end with triple, quadruple or multiple taxation.</p><p>  Finally, for the taxpayers, given the fact that some do not pay what they should pay if the laws were designed in a way that ensured there were no loopholes - in talking about the law, I am talking about the international tax architecture - when one does not collect what one has to collect, it is the others who will have to pay it, that is, individuals or other businesses.  This is why it is not good for ordinary taxpayers.  In addition, it undermines confidence in the tax system and, therefore, the perception that the tax system is unfair results in general in lower compliance and makes the life of tax commissioners much more difficult.</p></speech>

That may also be the case with this Irish committee, although given some of the remarks he might have heard here, Mr. Saint-Amans might not guess it is being carried out in Irish interests.  To take one point, the American system of deferral, which has been the practice in place since the 1950s, or at least since Kennedy's time, means an American company can operate abroad and can defer unquantifiable sums of money indefinitely, and if it repatriates the money, it pays tax on it there and then.  There is no compound or simple interest; the tax comes in at that moment in time and the tax is paid.  When a deferred sum comes into play, it is just paid in a once-off fashion.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It has also been suggested that the cost of funds to finance overseas investments is actually a corporate structure designed by the US that allows companies to invest money overseas by having their tax deferred.  If such a company loses money, it means that the money can be written off, so there is actually a great advantage to American companies in having this system in place, and the American authorities are well aware of this.  Ultimately, as this money can be deferred indefinitely under US taxation law, what is basically happening is that the US Department of the Treasury, or its Internal Revenue Service, gives interest-free loans to American companies forever.  Is this correct?</p></speech>

I will, however, make an overall comment.  Earlier I stated governments had accepted the opening of some loopholes in their tax legislation which facilitated or favoured their champions or multinationals.  An example in Europe is the watering down of controlled foreign corporation legislation as a way to protect one's tax base in a territorial system.  The United States introduced the check-the-box system which some then tried to repeal when they realised its major impact.  Companies indicated that they would be put at a competitive disadvantage if the US system was repealed because of European countries with weakly controlled foreign corporation legislation.  This is the type of implicit behaviour which has taken place.  All countries, including the United States, European countries, Japan and other G20 countries, now have the will to put an end to this type of practice.  That is why the base erosion and profit shifting project has such support.  Countries are also concerned with levelling the playing field and ensuring they move in the same direction at the same time.</p></speech>

Mr. Saint-Amans and I are of the same opinion that the US deferral system can be interpreted as an interest-free loan for an indefinite period of time.  My understanding of European law is that it is not possible for a nation state in Europe to do this because of competition law, but for some reason or another the US system can allow a loan forever without interest being applied because tax can be deferred forever.</p><p>  Mr. Saint-Amans has probably examined the US Senate report which had much to say about Ireland.

Various jurisdictions have conducted parliamentary inquiries and many of the companies listed in the two big inquiries held across the water on both sides of us are located in Ireland.  Our focus is different in this regard, as these companies employ tens of thousands of Irish people and we can understand why there is a degree of jealousy in other jurisdictions.  In the US Senate Ireland was described as a tax haven.  Mr. Saint-Amans has stated that not only is Ireland not a tax haven but it is far from being one.

The beauty of international organisations is that we try to level the playing field by putting all countries on an equal footing.  This gives more power to small countries than they would otherwise have in the international community jungle if we did not have some policing through international organisations.</p> <p>This process is driven by large countries.  Small open economies - I do not like using the terms "large" and "small" - such as Ireland have been active, as they understand that their interest in this game is to have an international consensus that is accepted by all governments, preventing them from walking away and taking unilateral measures.  Ireland must participate.  It can always change some pieces of domestic legislation.</p></speech>

I understand that the IMF is also willing to work in this area.  We would welcome this complementary analysis.</p><p>  We gathered evidence in February.  We found some in the analysis of the effective tax rate of a number of companies.  We also found some evidence in the indicators of foreign direct investment, FDI.  For example, when the British Virgin Islands is one of the top five investors in China, the Netherlands, Russia and elsewhere, it gives the sense that something is happening.  Even though we did not have a figure to indicate the loss, the elements we possessed led us to believe that something was happening to jeopardise the revenues of member countries.</p></speech>

I wish to discuss loopholes in Ireland.  One of the sub-committee's objectives, and certainly the reason for setting it up, is to identify the loopholes in Irish law being exploited by multinationals.  Mr. Saint-Amans's point was well made, in that these are multinational problems and should be solved internationally.  The international taxation regime is complex.  Are a small number of Irish taxation laws being exploited to a large degree?  A full analysis might show hundreds of laws and sub-clauses, but could we close one or two large loopholes that are being used by multinational corporations?</p></speech>

I would need to understand the Irish system further to provide the right answer.  I am not a specialist in the Irish tax system, nor am I on any system except for international tax rules.  I would be happy to revert to the Deputy on his question.</p><p>  Some of the Deputy's colleagues mentioned the issue of residency and whether it should be applied to companies based on their levels of activity.  Such an approach has been taken in the current environment, but it takes two to tango, as it is said in English, and one must always mind the interactions with legislation in other countries.  The residency approach has been well used.</p></speech>

Is the problem the fact that Ireland does not tax what he believes it should be taxing, or is it that US multinationals are not paying that tax in the US?  If a company was otherwise taxed in the US, would the same result not be achieved by using a Dutch company, one that would be deemed as being resident in the Netherlands?  This is a complex issue, for which reason my response is short.  I would be happy to examine the various schemes further, but defining the problem in this instance is difficult, as the international environment and interactions between various legislative measures make solving the situation unilaterally difficult.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013072300012#L01100"><p>I would be willing to be led by Mr. Saint-Amans's definition of the problem.  For what it is worth, my definition comprises two elements.  First, the macro-problem is that of multinational corporations not paying any tax to sovereign states, which means that non-multinationals and citizens are required to take up the burden.  Second, the micro-problem is ensuring that taxes are collected in the jurisdiction in which the value is created.  If Mr. Saint-Amans or his team could revert with thoughts on what could be done in Ireland to address both issues, it would be useful.</p><p>  I also seek Mr. Saint-Amans's opinion on the OECD's taxation principle and the principle behind the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, an EU proposal that is technically flawed and politically motivated and should be resisted by this country and Europe in general.  As Mr. Saint-Amans knows, the principle is that taxation would be applied according to three elements - assets, labour and sales.  I have an issue with this because, if a microchip is manufactured in Ireland using intellectual property, IP, developed in Ireland and is sold in Germany, the German Government should not derive any taxation benefit bar what VAT it desires.</p><p>  My understanding of the report is that the OECD's principle is for corporate tax to be applied at the location of value creation.  Is it therefore the case that the OECD's proposal for the international principles of corporation tax are contrary, at least in part, to the CCCTB proposal?</p></speech>

Deputy Donnelly's description is right, but I am not sure I would have reached the same conclusion.  It all depends on the selection of the criteria.  Perhaps the criteria will be defined to ensure that taxation takes place where profits accrue and where value is created.  There are interesting and fascinating debates among OECD members, and also among non-OECD members such as India and Chine, on what value creation means.  Not long ago, a Chinese delegate publicly indicated that when a German-manufactured car is sold in China, the value creation is in China where the sale takes place.  Therefore, it is a Chinese citizen that gives the value, because he or she has bought the car.  As the committee will know, there are many different interpretations.  Clearly, the Chinese case that I described is not the consensus.</p><p> Deputy Donnelly reached the conclusion that there is a contradiction.  I would not reach the same conclusion, because there may be another way to approach the matter.  What is for sure - this is my comment on the CCCTB - is that it would require a consensus on the criteria to share the profits, and I do not see that happening outside the European Union for a while.  A number of people on the NGO side are asking for unified taxation.  I am sorry, but I do not see that happening.  I am not even sure I am sorry because I am not sure it would be better.  However, I am more than happy to examine and consider the matter.  I do not see it happening because there is no consensus on criteria and consensus is not possible in the short, medium and, probably, long-term.  I have sympathy for my colleagues in the European Commission who are pushing the initiative, because it does not seem to have consensus either.</p></speech>

It is a comprehensive action plan, because the 15 actions address all of the issues.  If a country were to address one part without addressing the others, it would just shift the problem away.  All of the 15 actions are relevant to Ireland.</p><p>  I do not have a figure for the average effective tax rate for multinational companies operating in Ireland.  Our report, which was published in February, identified some effective tax rates for multinationals throughout the EU, but it was not done country by country because we do not have such data.  I wish to draw the committee's attention to the fact that we are trying to develop models to survey the effective tax rates of companies, particularly in the area of intangibles.</p><p>  I will respond to the question of whether the actions are more suited to larger countries than smaller ones.  No; they should suit all of them.  It is one-size-fits-all, and that is always a challenge.  One-size-fits-all never looks that good, but that is what we intended.  It should give countries the instruments to neutralise the use of no-tax jurisdictions where companies artificially locate profit.</p><p>  When will we see the effects on the ground?  We have an action plan that provides actions to be completed at our level, which is defining recommendations or providing instruments for government to implement in the next 18 to 24 months.  We expect that this sense of direction will inspire countries and, more importantly, the business community to change some of their legislation or tax practices.</p><p>  Is there something unique in Ireland?  I am not sure of that.  Ireland has been very good at attracting companies with its very low corporate income tax of 12.5%.  That is very low when compared with other countries.  It has also been used through what is called the double Irish arrangement, and some others, because of the articulation with US legislation.</p></speech>

I ask members to switch mobile phones off or set them to aeroplane mode to facilitate broadcast transmission which is being covered by UPC.  People also need to be cognisant of the effect of mobile phone interference on staff who have to record the proceedings.  It is important to note that it is their workplace as well.</p><p>  The sole purpose of today's meeting is a discussion with Ms Norah Gibbons, chairperson designate of the child and family agency.  She is very welcome this afternoon and I thank her for attending.  I also welcome Ms Elizabeth Canavan, Mr. Gerard McKiernan and Mr. Bill O'Dea.  As members are aware, the programme for Government committed to inviting proposed chairpersons of boards to appear before Oireachtas committees to engage in discussion.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, established a task force on the child and family support agency in September 2011 in response to a commitment in the programme for Government.  It has published a report that culminated in the introduction of the Bill to establish the child and family agency and the appointment of Ms Norah Gibbons as chairperson designate of the board.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing ruling of the Chair and parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  The format of today's meeting is that Ms Gibbons will make her opening remarks, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.  Members have already been given a copy of Ms Gibbons's statement.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Ms Elizabeth Canavan of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Mr. Bill O'Dea of the family support agency and by Mr. Gerard McKiernan from the Health Services Executive, child and family division.  All of them have been heavily involved in developing the new agency with Mr. Gordon Jeyes and others.  They are happy to assist me and the committee with any detailed queries germane to their work.</p><p>  The history of Ireland&rsquo;s services for children has largely been written in the reports of inquiries concerned with historical abuse in institutions established to care for and educate children - institutions where children should have been safe - and with abuse in families, where children should be loved, cherished and protected.  Children have a right to safety and need to have their rights protected and their needs met in all settings.  The publication of each report has brought painful truths to the fore - knowledge and evidence that we have often failed our children, particularly those who, due to their circumstances, should have had first call on the resources of the State.  Inquiries in other jurisdictions, most notably in the United Kingdom, have often been the catalyst for changes in child welfare and protection services and have laid the basis of much that is familiar to us in child welfare and protection in this jurisdiction.  In Ireland today we are on the cusp of developing a national service, the child and family agency, dedicated to children and families.  The establishment of this agency, which will align key services into a single cohesive, integrated and accountable delivery system, is a very welcome development towards modernising our child welfare and protection services.</p><p>  I am greatly honoured to be proposed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, both as chairperson of the existing Family Support Agency and as the first chairperson of the board of the child and family agency.  I am committed to working with the Minister, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, with fellow board members, with Mr. Gordon Jeyes and his staff, and with all those involved across all sectors working with children, families and communities.  I want to ensure we achieve what we all want, which is an agency that is fit for purpose and delivers high-quality services for children and families in Ireland.  I see this as a challenging and ambitious undertaking but one that must succeed.</p><p>  All of my professional life has been spent working in the area of child and family services.  When I qualified I worked in statutory social work in England for 13 years.  I joined the social services as they underwent significant change and realignment on foot of the Maria Colwell inquiry in 1973.  Maria died following her return to an abusive home despite evidence of her fearful reaction to contact with her mother.  Work in statutory social services was busy but entirely satisfying, providing me with daily challenges but also with huge learning experiences.  My responsibilities covered child welfare and protection, foster-care services, adoption, juvenile justice and guardian-<i>ad-litem</i> services in the courts.  Services were organised generically, so I gained experience in mental health as well as with services for older people.</p> <p>I have probably been through the entire life cycle in my professional work.</p><p> On my return to Ireland in 1989, I initially worked in a centre for the unemployed.  I became engaged in community work in a disadvantaged area.  I saw at first hand the power of solid local communities to build resilience despite a challenging economic backdrop.  Children live in families and families live in communities.</p><p> I worked with Barnardos from 1990 until August 2012, during which time I had a wide range of responsibilities at different management levels.  I was seconded to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse as a full member from 2000 to 2005 and as an ongoing board member until the Ryan report was published in 2009.  I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the bravery, understanding and consideration for others of those witnesses who told the commission of their painful and personal life experiences.  It was a humbling experience for me and the lessons from that time will always be with me.</p><p> A key area of work for me in Barnardos that is germane to my current position was the development of targeted family support services in conjunction with the then health boards in the late 1990s.  The rationale for those services was to work with children whose needs were not being met and where a concentrated programme of work with the child in the context of his or her family could hopefully avoid admission to the care system.  I am convinced of the need for support for families at all levels and I applaud the firm bedrock represented by the 106 family resource centres developed by the Family Support Agency.  This coincides with the new agency.  Through strategic partnerships with other key providers across the voluntary and community sectors, the new agency will be better placed than at any other time to offer real support to children and families in their own localities in a way that is open and inviting and links with other services as the needs of children and families dictate.</p><p> In addition to my work in establishing and chairing the confidential committee of the child abuse commission between 2000 and 2005, I chaired the inquiry into the Roscommon child care case that reported in 2010.  That report brought attention to the key issue of neglect, the impact that abuse of alcohol has on parenting and the consequences for children if steps are not taken to recognise and react proportionately in situations of chronic neglect.  Most of the report's recommendations are closely aligned with the needs audit on neglect that was published recently.</p><p> Like the 2012 independent child death review that I co-chaired with Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, the Roscommon report highlighted that children were missing out on effective prevention and early intervention services and that, too often, problems in families were not being tackled effectively until crises hit, at which point services were often ineffective.  A noticeable issue in many of the cases that I reviewed was non-attendance at school.  This is often a signal that something is going wrong at home or at school.  It must be identified and remedied if we are to help children.  I welcome the integration of the National Education Welfare Board, NEWB, with the new child and family agency, bringing with it the expertise that it has built up.</p><p> The new agency will also have responsibility for preschool inspection services, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services and services related to the psychological welfare of children.  Some or all of these service issues arise where child neglect or abuse is also an issue.</p><p> No amount of situating services together would make any difference if that was all we did.  I was pleased to have been appointed as a member of the task force that reported to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, in July 2012 on the establishment of the new agency.  The task force was working at a time when there were findings from many recent reports.  It was noted that the fragmentation and silos that can exist in services were the systemic cause of the failure to meet children's needs.  The task force's vision for a quality Irish childhood emphasised that children should feel nurtured, protected, safe, listened to and cared for.  It also stressed that, for these good things to happen, society needed to invest in preparing and supporting parents in their parenting and caring roles.</p><p> The task force correctly identified that we had a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform children's services fundamentally.  The need to bring together primary intervention, early intervention, family support and therapeutic care interventions was clearly outlined.  This broad scope of services is in line with international evidence and is what children in Ireland require and should have.</p><p> I am pleased that the legislation to establish the child and family agency is before the Oireachtas.  The agency's establishment is an ambitious undertaking.  The Bill sets out a strong framework of public accountability, with the Minister establishing the policy objectives for the agency and the agency, through its board, being responsible to the Minister for its performance.  It involves the bringing together of more than 4,000 staff and a budget of more than &euro;570 million from three existing bodies to be led by a single management team.  I look forward to seeing the Bill's progress through the Houses.</p><p> The leadership for the agency is almost fully in place under the stewardship of Mr. Gordon Jeyes.  Senior managers were recruited by open competition and should provide the capacity and leadership that the agency requires.  Each of the senior managers will have child and family services as his or her exclusive priority.  This represents a major departure from previous practice whereby senior managers often had responsibility for a list of services, none of which was directly related to children or families.</p><p> Below senior management level, there is an emphasis on strong local management operating within a clear national framework.  I understand that significant work has already been undertaken at an operational and logistical level to prepare for the agency's establishment.  This forms part of a two-year process of change that is under way.  I understand that the committee has received recent updates on these developments.  A project management team is in place and is working towards the smooth transfer of responsibilities to the agency on establishment day.</p><p> The HSE will continue to provide many services to children and families.  Both agencies' staffs are likely to share space, premises and clients.  There is a need to ensure that no existing synergies are lost and that more opportunities for collaborative working are established as the agency moves forward.</p><p> I have a particular personal interest in ensuring that the best interests of children are central to everything the new agency does.  Their voices must be heard at every stage and the focus of the agencies' work must be on outcomes for children.  I want to see a model of work ensuring that, at practical level, the voice of the child is present when a file is being reviewed.  With some files, we could not find information on the children's wishes, what they had said or, unfortunately, whether they had been seen alone.  There must be clear evidence that every decision for a child has his or her best interests at its core.  This is what they should articulate when they are asked how they experienced the staff of the agency.</p><p> As a society, we need to establish a culture of listening to children and paying attention to their voices and lived experiences.  As a social worker and a member of the child abuse commission and in carrying out case reviews, I am committed to the well-being of the 6,421 children and young people in the care of the State.  The vast majority are in general or relative foster care, with smaller numbers in residential care.</p><p> The decision to remove a child from his or her home can never be the first resort.  Prevention, early intervention and support to families come first.  However, where children's well-being and safety are at risk and interventions are not working, taking them into State care is the right decision.  It is crucial that those who take over responsibility for their safety, care and development are suited to the task, safely recruited, trained and supported in carrying out that critical role.</p><p> Another specific concern relates to ensuring with the board and CEO that the agency has the necessary resources to carry out its work effectively.  The number of children and young people in the State continues to grow, with more than 1.148 million individuals aged under 18 years.</p> <p>Since 2002 the number of children and young people has increased by over 13%.  The demand for the services of the child and family agency is increasing year on year, with 40,000 referrals last year.  We need to ensure that we have the correct staff numbers and skills mix available to carry out its functions.  I understand that work is now under way to map social work provision and to review the case loads of social workers.  I hope to have some of those results in the autumn.  </p><p> There is much work yet to be done in establishing the new agency and it must happen while the everyday work of child welfare, family support and child protection goes on.  I do not underestimate the demands of the task at management and front-line levels and pay tribute to all those involved.</p><p> Children, young people and families deserve a working agency and system that supports and protects them.  There is no room for complacency.  Change is very difficult for all of us, but the prize - a system fit for purpose for children and families - is one worth changing for.  Child care is never finished, and new issues and challenges will emerge as society develops and changes.  It is important to recognise those emerging needs, to know their extent and to develop plans, services and skills to meet them.  I believe that we can never give up on children because we owe them their future.  I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has asked me to convey his apologies.  He is very sorry but he cannot attend due to unforeseen circumstances in Monaghan which mean that he must remain in his constituency.  He asked me to wish Ms Gibbons well in her role and to assure her that she has his full support.  I too wish her well in her new and important role of chairperson of the child and family agency.  There is a clear need for a cultural change in how we approach these matters.  A series of reports lambasted the Government on its failure to protect children in care and the details of instances have horrified us all.  Ms Gibbons knows more than most about the reports.  The agency has great potential provided it is given the chance and the space to carry out its functions.</p><p>  Recently, my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and I spoke on the legislation to establish the new agency.  We are all familiar with the issue of the number of social workers and employees in the youth care sector.  The Minister has allowed for a number of additional appointments to be made but available resources mean that the number falls far short of what is required.  Ireland has relatively few child protection workers per head of population and relative to the total number of children in care.</p><p>  According to the recently published report prepared last year by Lynn Peyton, 96 cases were brought to the attention of the HSE's child protection services but less than half were adequately addressed.  Does Ms Gibbons believe this situation will continue?  Can we expect realisable targets?  Will greater pressure be placed on resources?  An increasing population and increasing poverty due to austerity will increase demand.  Will the new agency have adequate staffing levels to cope with demand?  Is there a need to employ additional staff in order to ensure that the new workload created by the Children First guidelines can be matched?  </p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised issues with regard to the Minister's disbandment of the Family Support Agency board.  When will a meeting of the interim or transitional board be convened?  What numbers will the board accommodate? </p><p>  I wish to comment on the welfare of children detained in direct provision institutions.  Recently the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, warned that Ireland's treatment of asylum seekers may be in breach of the Constitution and international human rights.  Can Ms Gibbons comment?  Can she intervene on behalf of such children? </p><p>  Ms Gibbons has our full support as she goes about her important work.  Her presentation and curriculum vitae clearly illustrate that she is eminently qualified and very knowledgeable in this area.  She has seen at first hand the damage caused by the State's dereliction of duty in so many areas.  I hope the Minister and the Government give her their full support and all that she and the job deserve.</p></speech>

Her experience and expertise are evident.  I did question the principle of appointing a chairperson and would have preferred if the post had been advertised, but I have no difficulty with her nomination.</p><p>  Will the terms of reference for the chairperson and board members be published?  Its publication would help us all to understand the roles and powers of the agency and the scope of those powers.  Perhaps that is part of the transition phase.</p><p>  One of the difficulties I am trying to work through is the vision of the new agency.  I seek clarity on its relationship with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, its interaction with the HSE and other services such as the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments.  What will Ms Gibbons's powers be as chairperson?  Where can she seek support?  Will she be able to attend meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and other bodies in order to effect and leverage necessary change?  All too often we have waited for the publication of a shocking report rather than have a pre-emptive system under which a board, perhaps, could express its concern if it felt the agency was not going in the right direction.</p><p>  Ms Gibbons mentioned the task force report that she actively participated in drafting.  Is the new agency's vision aligned with the findings of the task force report?  Does it differ?  I still struggle with the vision of the new agency.  I understand the generalities but I do not know which disciplines will be transferred to the agency.  Last week the committee raised the issue of referrals with the Minister at its meeting.  What are the referral pathways?  We are all quite clear on what constitutes a child protection issue or an escalated issue, but where are we with regard to welfare concerns?  In my voluntary capacity as a girl guide leader we occasionally have to advise statutory authorities of low-level concerns such as the neglect of a child.  At present we are told that nothing can be done unless we escalate an issue.  That is not appropriate, because it is just a concern, but someone should be able to join the dots.  I know that Ms Gibbons is all too aware of such issues due to her past work with Barnardos and dealing with much more vulnerable children.  Sometimes we nearly have to manipulate the system in order to get the response we want.</p><p>  The budget for the new agency is quite sizeable.  What is the role of the board when it comes to budgetary decisions?  One-fifth of the budget will go to civil society NGO service providers.  How will the budget be determined?  Can Ms Gibbons explain the governance surrounding the budget? </p><p>  I wish Ms Gibbons every success.  We are all aware that the public must have confidence in the new agency.  Yesterday a new prince was born in the UK and the first steps of the new agency will be scrutinised as much as his.  We all want the agency to take firm first steps and not to become an agency for troubled children.  We are experiencing a tight recession so there is a potential for the agency to become one for troubled children.  I do not believe anybody here wants that to happen, but it could happen, which is why it is great to know that so many people are interested in the agency.  I wish Ms Gibbons every success in her new role and the committee is more than happy to give her any support it can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013072300004#C00700"><p>I welcome Ms Gibbons and thank her for her good presentation.  I liked the fact that she did not use soundbites and demonstrated that she has a great understanding of children.  She said she was not going to pay lip service, that her curriculum vitae clearly showed her experience and that she wants to hear children's voices.  As she said, for too long children's voices were not evident in case studies or social workers' reports.  Too often the Departments responsible for education and health and the health boards passed the buck and no one took responsibility.  That is why I welcome the child and family agency, and I am glad it is nearly set up.</p><p>  Last week I listened to some of my colleagues here asking about the agency's vision.</p> <p>Will Ms Gibbons tell us a little more about the agency?  What exactly is her vision?  I heard the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, say that when she became Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, she did not have evidence, proper figures or proper information.  Does Ms Gibbons believe she has that information and that she can target resources to help children?</p><p> I talked about paying lip service, which was very evident in the referendum on children.  There was a turnout of only approximately 30%.  We talk about children and we respond if we see a programme about neglect of children, bullying or whatever, yet when a referendum was put to the people we did not come out to vote.  How will Ms Gibbons get the message out to the public that the voices of children need to be heard and that we need to respond not only when there is a crisis but to all of the 1.1 million or so children in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Norah Gibbons" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013072300005#D00200"><p>I thank members for their comments.  We are at the beginning of this new agency.  Although much background work has been done, we really are at the beginning.  We are beginning because of the HIQA investigations, which members will continue to see published.  We are beginning to gather the kind of information that was not available to the Minister, as she rightly said, when she took up responsibility for this new role and for the creation of the new Department.  We are very much at the beginning but we are starting to get concrete information on where children are at, particularly children with needs that are not met within their families.</p><p>  The task force did not want this new agency to be an agency only for troubled children.  I am very much in favour of the local in terms of meeting the needs of most or nearly all of our children and of only moving towards a regional or a national system where children have very particular needs that perhaps cannot be met locally.  The best way to ensure this agency does not end up as an agency for troubled children only is to do what we are doing - that is, to build in and blend in services provided by, for example, the family resource centres, Barnardos, the Daughters of Charity and other organisations providing family support, which provide a very basic information service for children in their locality, general help and general tips which all parents, including myself, need as they start out - things that concern all families.  Also, in the same place, we must offer help and support to children who need more than that.  </p><p>  My vision for this agency is that it is an agency not only for troubled children.  However, I am very conscious that at the core, we will have children who are in the care of the State - the children who, as I said, have a huge right to demand our resources because they are in the care of the State.  We have become their parents.  </p><p>  One of the things that is clear from the publication of the HIQA reports and which Senator van Turnhout talked about - cases in which there are concerns but we are not talking about child protection - is that there is a pathway for a decision to be made after an initial assessment.  This is something the family resource centre can help with.  Maybe a family has not been to the family resource centre and maybe somebody has a nugget of information which is germane to what is happening in that family but which has never been given to anybody else.  For example, teachers in schools often have that nugget of information.  A child is doing okay but suddenly the teacher will notice that the child is coming in without a lunch and is dishevelled in a way he or she was not previously.  If the teacher does not communicate that concern to somebody who can engage with the parents and find out what is going wrong, that is likely to turn into a crisis.</p><p>  Like the vision of the task force, my vision is very much for a broad-based agency, so that if a child and family come through the door or if I knock on a door and explain why I am there, I have at my disposal not only my own skills but other skills in the locality, particularly psychology skills, if that is what is needed for a child, so that he or she does not have to go on a waiting list and wait for other problems to develop.  I want it to be a safe agency, a caring agency and a non-stigmatising agency, which is very important for our children and our families.  In other words, we want people not to feel they are doing something really bad as parents but that they are going to the agency because they are good parents and want to be better.  However, that is not to disguise the fact there will be some children who will be in need of more of a service than is basically available.  The important thing is that other help and support is given to that child and that people work together.</p><p>  The other aspect that comes up in all of the reports is the lack of sharing of information.  As happened in the Roscommon case, 15 or 16 agencies went in but sometimes they were working quite separately from each other and not helping each other with information.  People said they were there to do this bit or that bit.  If we continue like that, the agency will not be a success.  I am quite determined that this will be a successful agency, as are others who work in it.  It has to be successful because we have been given this opportunity to do something.  Although it is happening at a time when we do not have all the resources in the world, one of the things I think will greatly help is the pulling together of different agencies so that we are not using scarce resources over and over in a haphazard way and that we have a detailed plan for the child and we make good use of the resources we have.</p><p>  I am a social worker, so I recognise my own bias.  The agency is undertaking a review of social work caseloads in this jurisdiction.  It has been done in different countries at different times and I am sure we have tried to do it before.  I am looking forward to the results of that review.  If we identify that we need more resources, we will talk to the Government about that situation.  That is our responsibility.  However, we might also identify that we need many more family support workers, for example, a mix of resources and a mix of skills.  I am looking forward to seeing that work, which has been going on over the past two years.  That kind of information will be readily available to us.  It will then be my responsibility and that of the board, together with the CEO, to talk to the relevant Department about the resources we need, and I put the Minister on notice in this regard.</p><p>  What happens if we do not have the resources?  What gets left behind?  I referred to the partnership with key providers in family support.  We all need to work towards the one goal.  What are we doing?  What is the outcome for the child for which we hope?  Are we on the right path?  Sometimes one goes down a path with a child and family but it does not work.  If we have tried very hard but it is not working, what else do we need to do for this family rather than add in another service?</p><p>  We have a lot of work to do but we are on a good path and we are beginning to have the kind of information from the HIQA reports and the internal audits - such as the neglect audit, which needs to happen in other places - to see what learning we need to pick up.  I am really pleased that in the autumn, Ms Lynn Peyton from Northern Ireland and Dr. Helen Buckley from Trinity College Dublin will take the results of that neglect audit and of the reviews into significant incidents and child deaths and hold concentrated workshops with staff to pull the learning out from all these inquiries so that they do not get put on a shelf.  I am very committed to the continuation of that kind of learning because, as we would have known in the Roscommon case, despite the fact that there was a very similar tragic death of a child in the neighbouring county, the staff to whom I spoke had never had it discussed with them.  It was discussed at the time and then it was left there.  New staff were not acquainted with the lessons from those reviews.  It is really important that we pick up on that.</p><p>  In response to Deputy McLellan, I do not believe we will get that level of neglect coming back over time.  I do not believe poverty is in any way equal to abuse.  Many families living in and experiencing poverty do not in any way abuse their children but, of course, financial worries on top of other problems in a family can exacerbate parenting issues.</p> <p>We all need to recognise that.  During these times we know that more children are living in consistent poverty and more children are at risk of poverty, and we need to be alert to that.  The money going into a family is very important in respect of poverty, but so are the services available to those families.  We need to build the family support and NEWB work to make sure that it remains with us.</p><p> There are 12 members of the board of the current Family Support Agency.  My first appointment - as long as members are happy - is as chairperson of that agency and that will be my main task.  I do not take over as chairperson of the board of the child and family agency until it is established.  I will arrange a meeting of the board when the Minister tells me who is appointed to the board.  I have already been going into the offices of the Family Support Agency on Fridays - they have been very kind to me - and I have acquainted myself further with the work of the agency.  I was delighted to attend two weeks ago when family resource centres from around the country were showing us the work they were doing, and I hope to get out and see more of them.  I value that work very much.</p><p> I have had concerns about children in direct provision for some time, because some of the direct provision available in this country is not perhaps in children's best interests.  It is certainly not in their best interests to stay there for a long period of time.  Clearly the HSE child and family services would always respond if there were specific child protection concerns expressed to them.  Children and families should obviously not be there.  It is not a place to bring up children, because the fundamental things, such as what to cook and when to cook for them, are not available.  I hope that we in Ireland can do better and we should heed the warning of the Ombudsman that this is an area that we do not want to be investigating in a few years.</p></speech>

I am inclined to be impatient and I must curb it a bit sometimes, but we should be in a position to move away because we are not under the same pressure of numbers, even if we are under some financial pressure.  Many of these children will remain as citizens growing up in this country and we want the best for them, as we do for everybody else.</p></speech>

We can send those to the committee.  The terms of reference are essentially the terms of reference of the FSA board as set out in statute.  The role in respect of the new agency is limited until such time as that agency is established.  The Minister hopes that on an administrative level, Ms Gibbons and whoever else comes on to the board will begin talking about the plans for the transition to the new agency.  The whole idea is to have that kind of continuity.  From a statutory point of view, the FSA terms of reference will be the terms of reference in the new agency.</p></speech>

It is unusual that the purpose of today's meeting is to scrutinise this appointment because we absolutely lucked out when we got somebody of the quality of Ms Gibbons.  She has such a concern and passion for children's welfare, along with Mr. Shannon and the entire team that is being compiled.  I wish them every success and we would like to offer any support we can on this committee.  I love the fact that Ms Gibbons is impatient.  I hope she can see that the questions coming from us demonstrate that we are impatient.  I appreciate that until only recently we have had a relatively dysfunctional delivery of services, but at least we have had a good start.  We all want to see it perfect by next Tuesday, but of course that will not happen.</p><p>  When public health nurses came before us a few weeks ago, they expressed public and private concerns that they are not in the first phase.  The new director designate, Mr. John Hennessy, also shared their concern that if the agency is only established with the NEWB and the child care people, then unfortunately it may garner the name of an agency that only looks after children who are in crisis.  Ms Gibbons obviously knows that the task is not to do that, but to be all-encompassing.  What plans does she have to ensure this does not happen in the interim period?  How quickly does she envisage all of the other services being added? What is the timeframe for the agency roadmap from the initial stages to becoming something that is robust and can provide all services to children with their best outcomes in mind?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013072300006#E00800"><p>I thank Ms Gibbons for her presentation.  Nobody in this room doubts her sincerity, capability and experience.  I have only a few questions.  How does she see the integration of the NEWB role within the new agency?  Her presentation referred to the need for society to invest in preparing and supporting parents in a parenting and caring role.  Coming from a voluntary community background, I believe that parenting begins at home and within the family circle.  We tend to pigeonhole people in communities.  If a person lived in a certain flats complex he or she was put in a particular pigeonhole, but if the person lived in a housing estate he or she was not put in that pigeonhole.  We have to be responsible for all children, whether they live in a housing estate, a flats complex or a private housing scheme.  They all need services at certain stages.  Can Ms Gibbons expand on investing in support for parenting?  The key issue is how we view family surroundings and family links.</p><p>  The presentation also referred to the task force on alcohol, the abuse of alcohol among parents and the concerns about neglect and the impact on families and communities.  In a report I read recently I was astonished to see that there was a 375% jump in the number of young people between the ages of 18 and 35 who will need new livers.  We have many lone parents in the community I represent and in fact I would say we have children rearing children, because many of these lone parents are 18 or 19 years of age.  In my eyes, they are still only very young adults.  The abuse of alcohol has grown remarkably among that age group, and not just among lone parents but right across family circles, where most people drink alcohol at home.  Going out for a drink is no longer the norm.</p> <p> Ms Gibbons referred to poverty among children.  I believe that being poor is nothing to be ashamed of.  We have labelled people in the bracket of being disadvantaged and so on.  Being poor does not mean being neglected.  I grew up with children who did not have a pair of shoes but, by God, they had great parents.  This relates to what I said in the beginning about parenting and how we help to provide services for young people with young families who are only learning to be parents at this stage.  Does the agency have a role in that regard?  Perhaps it is not the job of the agency, but I call on Ms Gibbons to address the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013072300007#F00200"><p>On my behalf and on behalf of Deputy Ciara Conway, who is the Vice Chairman of the committee and who specifically asked me to say so, I welcome Ms Gibbons to the meeting following her appointment.  Like many people on the committee I have had a good deal of experience dealing with children.  I was a teacher before I was elected to this establishment.  One thing that frustrated me in my years teaching was that when the school staff became aware of inadequacies in various family homes we did not necessarily believe that adequate services were available to deal with the problems.  As Deputy Catherine Byrne remarked, these difficulties may have included problems with alcohol and the resultant impact on children, or neglect.</p><p>  I appreciate the fact that Ms Gibbons is impatient and I get the message.  Perhaps Ms Gibbons will confirm whether I understood her correctly, but I took it that she intends to fight tooth and nail to try to ensure that all services will be as effective as possible.  One problem relates to after-hours interventions.  Often, the worst problems arise after hours.  I am unsure whether Ms Gibbons can say anything about how such issues could be addressed.  I was directly involved in one or two cases and I cannot say that I was happy with how some of the social services handled them.</p><p>  Deputy Catherine Byrne raised the issue of the number of inexperienced single parents.  I am well aware of the fact that many of those single mothers do a great job, but clearly there are some who find it very difficult to cope.  Is there a need for the State or some agency to try to encourage people not to have children until they have a settled situation?  To what extent does Ms Gibbons believe that problems in childhood are tied up with dysfunctional family situations?  How can we best get away from those dysfunctional family situations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-07-23a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013072300007#F00300"><p>I welcome Ms Gibbons and I wish her every success in her new role.  It is a major challenge.  One thing I find is that there are people who are self-employed and who employ several people who complain about some things to do with the Government.  Then, when I ask them how their management situation is, it emerges that they are having difficulty.  They might have a staff of fewer than ten people.  There is major challenge in managing 4,000 people and I wish Ms Gibbons every success in putting the structures together.</p><p>  I wish to touch on the time Ms Gibbons spent working in the United Kingdom and the changes that occurred there.  Let us look at it from an Irish point of view.  At what stage does Ms Gibbons believe we are here?  How much catching up have we to do?  I am not suggesting we should use the UK as the example, but, from international point of view, how much catching up do we have to do?  What timescale will be required?</p><p>  The other area I wish to mention is that of the family law courts, an area in which I have had some experience.  While there is no major issue with children in the sense of their not being properly looked after, they get caught up in the process of the family law courts.  What is the nature of the involvement of social services in giving backup support to parents there?  How does Ms Gibbons envisage that area improving?  We have talked about setting up a new structure for the long-term in the family law courts and that is an important element that we need to see emerging.</p><p>  We are undertaking a major and welcome change, but will the process of change be fast enough?  I raise this question in particular because Ms Gibbons referred to coming back from the UK.  A person I know who was working in medical services in the UK came back to Ireland.  One thing that struck her while working in Dublin was the number of girls coming to maternity wards under 18 years of age.  She was surprised that there was no specific service aimed at young people.  She suggested at the time that there should be a specific clinic to deal with the group of people under 18 years of age.  It was amazing that it took ten years for that clinic to be set up in the hospital in question.  There was resistance to change.  Ms Gibbons has referred to major changes in the setting up of the new structures.  Does Ms Gibbons believe the support levels are in place to implement that change?  Does she believe it will come fast enough?  This relates to my earlier question about catching up.  How long will that take?</p></speech>

In one respect it is regrettable that our society needs such an agency.  It is a reflection of some bad things in our society, of which I am a part.  As in many other areas, perhaps we have deluded ourselves as a society about some difficult things that have taken place in our short history.</p><p>  I concur with everything that the people to my right and left have said about the role of the State in terms of caring for children.  I accept all of it.  However, I wish to make one point and ask Ms Gibbons one question.  The role of the State is one thing, but I had a telephone conversation with one of the unfortunate woman who was in the Magdalen laundries.  She now lives in County Cork.  She wrote to me on the basis of a comment I had made in the D&aacute;il.  We had a good conversation and she made one particularly interesting point.  We were discussing the role of the church and State in respect of the bad treatment these women received.  She was very polite but she stopped me at one stage, and rightly so, to say to me that it was not only the church and State but it was society too.  We were all to blame.</p> <p>I almost dropped the phone, but she was quite right.</p><p> The figures do not make for very pleasant reading.  For example, the figures for 2012 from the ISPCC show there were 750,000 calls to its very good helpline, Childline.  We have a real problem if such large numbers of children are telephoning a charity for help.  Whatever about the role of the State - I am in favour of providing the best of services - we will eventually have to face the fact that there is something wrong with adults who, in such large numbers, treat children so badly.</p></speech>

I will respond to Deputy Maloney first.  I firmly believe that children are the responsibility of every one of us and very much welcome that the Children First guidelines will be put on a statutory basis.  That will tell every citizen that he or she has a responsibility if things are going wrong for children.</p><p>  Unfortunately, we are not unique in not recognising children as full individuals in their own right.  It is only relatively recently in the first world that we have treated children as people who should be heard, listened to and given their own voice.  All of us who grew up in Ireland, even with the very best of parents, know that one was told what was good for one rather than being asked.</p></speech>

People are beginning to understand, albeit not in the numbers we would have liked, that children are unique by reason of their youthfulness and we need to pay special attention to them.</p><p>  Parenting courses of different types and quality have been taking place for many years in the country.  The triple P parenting programme, which has been tested and works, is now available.  It is supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Health and is being rolled out in the midlands.  We hope it will be rolled out over time. </p><p>  I constantly refer to family resource centres because I am very fond of the services they provide.  Last year, 1,242 adults and 566 children benefitted from programme activities, including parenting programmes and the Strengthening Families programmes.  The community mothers programme, under which mothers in the community visit first-time mothers, particularly those at risk, has been widely deployed throughout the country.  </p><p>  For many years I was the chair of Treoir, the organisation providing support for young parents.  The number of parents aged under 18 is falling and has been for some time, which is good.  Once young people are looking forward to a different life involving work, the rate decreases.  Young parents are not bad parents; rather, they can be very good parents if they have support within their families.  In the past, as the committee knows, the tradition in Ireland, unfortunately, was that young parents were removed from the family orbit because people did not want to acknowledge what had happened.  Nowadays they are kept within the family and for most of them things work very well.</p><p>  There are a number of programmes for young parents.  I was previously employed by Barnardos, which runs one of them.  Others, run by the HSE and other organisations around the country, are specifically about supporting teenage parents and taking over from the specialised clinics to which Senator Burke referred.  We do not need to set up a specific programme but, rather, to help parents into programmes that already exist.  With the integration of resources into one agency that will be easier.  If we discover an area of the country has nothing for teenage parents we can talk to the family resource centres easily, because they will be a part of the whole, as well as other agencies.  We will able to identify that a need has arisen and ask whether the agency can address it.  I recognise that we cannot always build in new resources.  We must examine how we are using the current resources.</p><p>  The NEWB is joining the child and family agency and will have a representative on the senior management team, as I understand it.  It will continue to carry out its current role; the Act will not change that.  It will come under the board of the child and family agency but its tasks will remain the same.  I am very happy that as the agencies begin to work as one the information and expertise they have will be much easier to access for children who may be at serious risk of falling out of school, which is a key factor.  If we want to succeed with children and young people we need to keep them in the education system or adapt it to hold onto such children, particularly troubled children who are often in services such as Youthreach.</p><p>  Alcohol is a major problem for children and families in this country.  It is a major problem for the country.  I know the Government is examining the issue.  It is, perhaps, difficult to admit to the level of misuse of alcohol in this country.  It is a major public health matter and is commented on as such.  It is to be hoped there will be some recognition of that.</p></speech>

In my view, children are more abused by alcohol than they are abusers of alcohol.  As a country we have had various discussions about whether we will continue alcohol sponsorship for sports, advertising of alcohol near schools and things like that.  In my view that is not helpful, and it is not helpful for us to portray alcohol to young people as something they have to consume.  I hope that our emphasis on being healthier and taking part in exercise will be more helpful to young people.  Advertising conveys strong messages to young people.  If one sees all of one's idols taking part in something, it is likely one would think that is the thing to do. </p><p>  Public health nurses have a very strong role to play in families.  The new agency is building strong foundations and is already working with HSE on how all parts of the HSE, not just public health nurses, will still be in place for children and families and how they will interact.  </p><p>  I understand negotiations are at an advanced stage with regard to the project planning to which I referred.  Not all of that has been worked out, and I understand Deputy Doherty's comments.  We have to take particular care that we do not lose the expertise of public health nurses for children, particularly those involved at an early stage with families, and the role they play in keeping children safe, together with the rest of us. </p><p>  Part of the information to which I referred in my opening statement was that Children First would be put on a statutory basis.  Locally, it is really important that when care pathways are being worked out for referrals, more and more of which are coming in, we are able to get welfare services in to support children where there is not a level of concern that would lead to child protection issues. </p><p>  I understand from the CEO designate that a plan is underway for after-hours services and there will be a report in the autumn.  It is hoped to roll out an after-hours service on a national basis, starting in urban areas.  Particular issues arise in rural provision.</p> <p>That is not to say there are no problems in our rural society, as we all know well.  I agree that problems do not only arise between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., but we have a plan to do this, which we did not have previously.  The encouraging aspect for me is that many suggestions that were not taken on board are now being taken on board and the plans are in place to advance them.  It will not happen all at once, despite my impatience, and I must remember that.</p><p> I think those were all the notes I made.  If I have missed anything, please advise me.</p></speech>

Many of the young parents I know are not the first generation of lone parents but may be the second or third generation.  I was trying to emphasise that to Ms Gibbons and may not have been clear in what I said.  There is a history of lone parents over two and three generations in some communities.  I had a young family, although my baby is now 20 and has just finished college.  Many young people who were in school with my daughter have lost out on advancing their education because they had children younger and therefore found it difficult to get back into the system.  I have no doubt that the youth projects are doing a wonderful job in trying to work locally with young people who left school at a particular age.  Ms Gibbons said the numbers involved were falling but I remain concerned about the people who come to my clinics with a housing query because they are very young.  Not only do some of them have one child but they may be expecting another.  I am concerned about that cycle, particularly in certain communities.  That is the reason I asked the question about the agency.  Does Ms Gibbons see the agency having a role in trying to encourage people to hold off having a family until they complete their education and get a job or work experience?  In my role as a public representative and, long before I went into politics, as a voluntary community representative I found there was a generation of people coming through who were lone parents and within whose families there was a cycle of not attending school and not sitting the junior or leaving certificate.  I remain concerned that I continue to see the same picture, which has not changed dramatically, in my work today that I saw in my work when I was a teenager in a youth club.  I am trying to get my head around that.  I know the agency and the board have the specific task of bringing together people from the various groups but I ask that the board examine that situation because it is a real problem in some, although not all, communities.  I did not use the word "problem" to describe a lone parent.</p></speech>

I know from my own work with lone parents that they can be very good parents.  As a country we are doing much better at retaining children in second level education.  That is one of the positive findings in our recent state of the nation report.  There was much work to be done in the areas of education and youth work, which is now under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  That has been pulled together in terms of helping people to make good decisions in many areas.  I note the Deputy's concern about it.  All things being equal, if one can put off starting a family until a later point in life, one is much better suited to be a parent.  One has much more energy and one knows what one wants if one is not trying to grow up while one is parenting, although many of us do our growing up once we have children of our own for whom we are responsible.  However, I note what Deputy Byrne said.</p></speech>

She came before us with a strong professional background and from her opening remarks and her engagement it is clear that her appointment is the correct decision.  She has reaffirmed that by her engagement with the committee this afternoon.  I thank her sincerely for that.</p><p>  I join Ms Gibbons in saluting the bravery of those witnesses who met with the Commission of Inquiry into Child Abuse.  Ms Gibbons was right to highlight that they were brave in helping to shed light on an awful period in our history.  That was one of the most important parts of her engagement with the committee.  Her views were refreshing and I was struck by the fact that she has the best interests of the child and the family at heart and that this is central to everything she does.  I acknowledge also the role of the staff who work with children across our State.  We are all conscious of their workload and the changing background of the work they do but with Ms Gibbons as chairperson of the child and family agency, it is off to a very good start.</p><p>  That concludes our engagement with the chairperson designate.  Is it agreed that we will inform the Minister that we have concluded our discussion with Ms Gibbons, that we found it to be very positive, and that we will forward a copy of the transcript of these proceedings to the Minister for her information?  Agreed.</p><p>  I thank all the witnesses.  I again acknowledge the presence of Mr. Bill O'Dea, Mr. Gerard McKiernan, Ms Liz Canavan and also Ms Gibbons' daughter, Mairead.  I thank the members for attending.  I remind them that the committee will adjourn until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday for our quarterly meeting with the Minister for Health, the Ministers of State and the Health Service Executive.</p></speech>

We have already circulated committee members with our document Strengthening Connections in Rural Ireland, which explains the restructuring, as well as a questions and answers document.  I will focus on some of the key points in that document to allow more time for committee to ask questions.</p><p>  It is best to look back at the early stages of the programme.  The rural transport programme was launched in 2007 but was built on an initiative that started in 2002.  That had been established to meet the patently unmet transport demands in rural Ireland from a social inclusion and community-based perspective.  The rural transport programme to date has had a focus on rural isolation and enhancing the mobility, accessibility and community participation of local people, especially those at risk of social exclusion.  While the services are open to the public, older people and people with disabilities have formed the main customer base of the programme to date.</p><p>  The programme operates through 35 rural transport programme groups covering the country, which are managed in the main by voluntary committees, with subsidy funding to the groups provided now by the National Transport Authority.  The individual groups are responsible for identifying the specific services to be provided locally.</p><p>  There has been a great success and growth of the programme.  The level of services has increased rapidly over the years, going from 40,000 services in 2003 to more than 217,000 services in 2012.  The number of passenger journeys recorded has increased from 171,000 in 2003 to 1.73 million in 2012.  Funding for the pilot transport initiative and its successor, the rural transport programme, has increased from &euro;3 million in 2003 to &euro;11 million in 2010.  However, in common with many other Government-supported services, funding levels have fallen back in recent years as a result of the pressure on public finances.  We have seen this in all public transport subsidy areas.</p><p>  A value-for-money review was commissioned by the Government in 2007.  It examined the period from 2002 to 2009 and specifically focused on the period after 2007 when the programme was mainstreamed.  When it was published in early 2012 the review raised concerns about the overall value for money of the programme and the cost of the organisational structures.  In 2009 some 22% of total group expenditure went on administration.  In addition, there was inconsistency in fare levels throughout the country, inconsistency in the cost per service throughout the country and an absence of data to measure the benefits or positive impacts of the schemes, as well as a range of other issues.</p><p>  In January 2012 the Government decided to give the National Transport Authority responsibility for integrating local and rural transport and for the rural transport programme as well.  We took over that function on 1 April 2012 and we have been working on the details of the plan since that time to improve integration.  Ms Graham chairs the national committee which involves all the stakeholders, including the HSE and other bodies, and is working to examine the findings of the value-for-money review to see whether we could restructure the programme.  Our plans for restructuring were launched on 9 July by the Minister of State with responsibility for public and community transport, Deputy Alan Kelly.  As a result of this restructuring we believe that rural transport services will be better protected through lower administration costs and will be more closely woven into local authority transport planning and our mainstream national transport provision.  There will be no reduction in transport services offered locally as a consequence of the restructuring.  In fact, users will benefit from better integration with other State-funded and licensed transport services, all of which are under our remit.</p><p>  What is in the new plan?  The key element relates to the new administrative structures.  We will establish 18 transport co-ordination units.  They will be grant-aided by the authority and will work with the NTA and the local authorities to provide a co-ordinated response to local transport needs.  These units will retain much of the experience and local links and knowledge of the current service providers and only the existing rural transport programme groups can apply to form the new units.  The voluntary boards will remain part of the new structures.  The administrative savings achieved by this will protect the services provided to the end user.</p> <p>Amalgamations and mergers will have to take place to deliver 18 units from the current 35 groups.  We are engaging with a consultation process with the entire sector.  We spent yesterday in Portlaoise with the network and representative groups and had a very productive meeting.  We are encouraging groups to talk to each other and to come to us with formal plans for how they are going to amalgamate and create the new structures.  We will start a formal submission process in September and will ask for submissions for the units.  By Christmas we hope to have those details confirmed. </p><p> Another new element of the plan is relationships with local authorities.  We already work in partnership with regional and local authorities across Ireland to ensure that the national transport policy is reflected in regional and local plans and also to hear from local authorities in order that we can reflect their needs in our plans.  To date, local authorities have been excluded from transport provision in their administrative areas.  In the future we hope they will prepare local transport plans for their areas which identify the areas that need to be better served by public transport.  These plans will help us to identify the gaps and needs throughout the counties.  The units at local level, because of their detailed knowledge, will be able to detail the routes and stopping points for services.  We are also asking local authorities to help to house the transport co-ordination units in any available office space they may have.  We hope to reduce the costs of the programme through the use of overtime with this kind of arrangement.</p><p> I refer to the change in bus services.  Bus services will be provided by bus operators contracted to the authority.  At the moment Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail are contracted to us.  All scheduled and demand-responsive services currently provided will be incorporated into public transport service contracts.  The rules regarding those will be set out in national legislation and will rest with the authority.  There are two types of contract.  One is by direct award.  A number of rural transport groups provide the majority of their services by using their own fleets, of which many vehicles are wheelchair-accessible.  We propose to directly award contracts to those groups in accordance with EU regulations - that is, they will not have to competitively tender.  The second type of contract covers the remainder of the services.  In a similar manner to what happens now, we will have a tender procedure for those services.  One aspect of our procurement will be to focus on improving accessibility levels across the country.  The units will take bookings and handle dispatch for the service.  They currently do that, and people will be familiar with such services.  They will check the performance of operators, report on moneys and identify potential route changes to us.  We will vary the contracts to develop new routes or better serve the demand that is emerging.</p><p> There are two other initiatives occurring with which these units will be involved.  Community car schemes involve volunteers offering to use their cars or a car given by an organisation to drive individuals who have no transport.  The units will have a strong role in this initiative.  They can confirm the need for those services, identify the pool of drivers and generally advise us.  We will have to exercise exemptions from taxi and hackney regulations, which is one of the new features of the new taxi Bill.  Carriage for reward, even if it is for basic petrol money, would move community car schemes into the taxi licensing area.  The new taxi Bill addresses that matter and allows for exemptions for community car schemes.</p><p> Our proposal includes a local area hackney licence for certain rural locations.  The objective of this licence, which we would hope to introduce later this year, is to facilitate low-cost entry to the hackney market for transport provision in isolated rural areas which would not have any other services.  A typical example would be an isolated village or town where people have no options for returning home at night from their community or social activities.  These licences will only be applicable in areas where there is no other provision in terms of hackneys or taxis.  The units will play an important role in giving advice to the authority on the suitability of those areas for such a licence. </p><p> That is a brief summary of the programme and its history.  There is much to be done in serving rural areas.  We know the gaps and needs very well.  A key step is to get the framework right.  If there is the opportunity to do so in the future and an increased subsidy is available, we will have the correct framework on which we can build. </p><p> I commend all those involved in rural transport groups over the years who have developed this initiative from nothing in 2002 to 1.73 million journeys in 2012.  Their hard work, expertise, and enthusiasm, and the voluntary nature of the boards, has taken the scheme from a standing start ten years ago to a national network of services which we want to protect today.  I will be pleased to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

It will be helpful in trying to establish the impact of the plans for restructuring.</p><p>  I have had an opportunity to review the plans for restructuring the rural transport programme.  The main document is Strengthening Connections in Rural Ireland.  In my reading of the document, however, the proposals will weaken the connections which exist.  It is clear that this has been brought about by a ministerial decision to reduce the cost of delivery of the service.  We all accept that all State services over the past number of years have had to re-examine how they do their business and consider restructuring.  It is a falsehood to suggest that the service will be enhanced or strengthened by reducing the number of companies in the manner in which it is intended and reducing the money available.  I fail to see how one can do that in a manner that will strengthen the service that exists.  </p><p>  I am reasonably familiar with the rural transport system.  I come from Clare, and East Clare Accessible Transport, ECAT, as it started out, was one of the pioneers in developing a rural transport programme.  For that reason I am deeply concerned, because I know the negative impact decisions can have. </p><p>  The delegation has rightly identified the target groups - namely, those who live in isolation,  particularly those who are infirm, old or have a disability, and the young cohort of teenagers and young adults who do not have access to private transport.  They have benefited hugely from the scheme. </p><p>  The Minister seems to have based much of the plan on the value for money review and the notion that 22% of the total group expenditure in 2009 was spent on administration.  That would be of concern to all of us.  However, if one examines what the administration comprises, many groups, as identified in the document, carry out procurement for a fleet of buses.  That involves an administrative function.  That will still need to be done in a new setting. </p><p>  In many cases the administration costs can be attributed to the work involved in raising other finances and resources, which is often done through some of the volunteers, to purchase vehicles.  Much of that work is done through charitable sources.  Without that level of administration and the added benefit received from being able to fund-raise to purchase buses, the cost to the State would be a lot more in the long run. </p><p>  I have some specific questions.  In regard to the door-to-door service provided for many people, particularly those who are infirm, have mobility issues and are elderly, does the delegation intend to ensure they will be retained at the current level?  I do not refer to how internal administration might be managed.  On value for money and reviews of cost, how has the cost structure of the NTA changed over the past three years?  What are its annual running costs now compared to three years ago?</p></speech>

There was not only the value for money review but also the McCarthy report, which looked at services and recommended that the programme would be abolished.  At one time that was being considered.  What we have tried to do is restructure the programme to retain all of its best elements but to drive down the administrative cost basis to protect the service.</p><p> I was asked specifically about the door-to-door service.  Yes, that will be retained.  The objective is that it will be retained to current levels.  The current level of service allows people to ring up to organise a service and for a dispatcher to be contacted.  That will be retained.  Even though there will be subsidy cuts in the programme, because there are subsidy cuts generally in public transport, we feel that through the restructuring we will be able to maintain the current level of service.  In 2011, the grant aid for the programme was &euro;10.6 million.  In 2012, the amount reduced to &euro;9.77 million and in 2013 it fell to &euro;9.133 million.  The grant aid in 2014 will be approximately &euro;8.5 million.  With a declining subsidy available we had to address the underlying cost base and see whether we could come up with something that enabled the service to be retained.</p><p> On our own costs, all of the salary cuts that apply to the public sector apply to our organisation.  We are currently underfunded.  We rely on the taxi service introduced by the Commission on Taxi Regulation to enable us to discharge all our operations.  We manage that carefully.  Off the top of my head I cannot give the figure.</p></speech>

Almost exclusively, when one increases Government involvement or regulation one dispenses with the voluntary activity because once the State takes greater control volunteers fall away from the project.  It is my view that the impact on the voluntary sector will ultimately increase the cost level.  If the money is not available, the service will diminish.  It is not a criticism of Mr. Murphy, because he is constrained by the moneys available to him, but I will not leave the meeting with any confidence that the same level of service ultimately will be maintained.  Given that there is less money and increased regulation I can only see that as having an overall negative impact.  That is deeply disturbing, in particular to the vulnerable sectors that utilise and depend on the service to such an extent.</p></speech>

Currently, the groups are reporting to Pobal, which is acting on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  They have a reporting line.  We are stepping into the reporting line.  Our objective is to reduce the administrative demand on the groups, to reduce the level of reporting required to align it more with the type of reporting we are already seeing from Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We will not increase the regulation on the groups nor on the network that represents the groups.  One of the objectives when we met them yesterday was to find a way to proceed and to see what we could target as the key information they need to generate for us rather than just generating rafts of information which is a demand on them.  I assure Deputy Dooley that our objective is to simplify the process for the new groups that are set up to deliver services.</p></speech>

I hope the knowledge that local administrators have will be retained.  In my area the administrators do more than just make sure a bus turns up.  In some cases they are socially connected to the people in the sense that if a person is missing from a particular service they are often the first to alert the emergency services.  If an elderly person living alone in an isolated area does not appear for his or her usual pick-up by a rural bus service the administrator, who is invariably from the local community, will either check by phone with a neighbour or call the emergency services.  Whatever about the administration and reporting mechanisms, local knowledge is critical.  We have seen all too often with the so-called positive changes made to the roll-out of public services that the further one removes the service from the end-user the more one makes it impersonal and one loses the connection with the individual.  I am most concerned about that.</p><p>  Mr. Murphy corresponded with me recently on the hackney issue, with which I have a major problem.  I am delighted the issue has been raised.  If one is in Belmullet in west Mayo and one undergoes a small public service vehicle test, one must have a knowledge of the intricate geography of places between 80 miles and 120 miles away.  That is bonkers.  If one is located in one of the smaller counties, such as Counties Louth or Carlow, one will be required to have an intricate knowledge of areas less than 50 miles away, depending on where one lives.  In recent weeks I got results from the National Transport Authority which bear out that the knowledge test is prohibiting people from gaining entry to the service.  In many cases, that is why there is not a public transport system.  I could name four or five people who have got jobs driving hackney cabs in west Limerick but they cannot pass the test because it is primarily about Limerick city.  Deputy Dooley is closer to the areas that are the focus of the tests than the people concerned, who have more in common with Deputy Griffin than with Limerick city.</p><p>  It seems that lines on maps are the be-all and end-all.  I have heard some of the questions that are asked in the knowledge tests.  Having traversed all of County Limerick in the previous general election, I have a fairly good knowledge of the county, but I would not be able to say which street, running between Clare Street and Henry Street in Limerick, is a one-way street or on what street in a particular village is the post office.  One could be talking about a place 80 miles away.  God help the person in west Cork who has to sit the test because he or she will have to know about Kildorrery, Mitchelstown, Youghal and Cloyne.  They are probably more likely to visit Dublin than such places.  The area knowledge test is designed to protect someone or something but it is not protecting the consumer who is deprived of having a rural transport infrastructure because people are failing the test.</p><p>  In 2010 in Wexford, 13% of people who sat the test passed.  What makes it worse is that if one looks at the number who failed and those who got results of between 60% and 80%, the bulk of the questions in the good results are probably based on their local geographical area where they are likely to serve.  With the greatest respect, a person driving a hackney cab in Shanagolden, Loughill or Foynes does not need to know about Herbertstown, Bruff, Hospital or Garryspillane because they are never going to pick up a fare there and they are highly unlikely to be ever asked to drive a person there.  The knowledge test system is a barrier to gaining entry to those wishing to provide a service.  It does not reflect what is needed.  It is based on geographical boundaries and if one is unfortunate enough to come from a sparsely populated county in the west, all of which counties are probably bigger than those on the east coast, one is goosed before one starts.</p></speech>

We would hope that in the submissions that come forward from the groups to form the TCUs they would take into account as far as possible, particularly where they will be across a number of counties, the retention of the staff that would have that local knowledge to ensure the important role they carry out can be continued in the new TCUs.</p></speech>

By all accounts, the rural transport scheme has worked very well over the years at a cost that is very good by today's standards.  A major issue for many people with whom I have spoken is local knowledge on the part of the local community driver.  That knowledge is extremely important and I fear that we are cutting back on that by reducing the number of companies and the number of local people who will have an input.  The people who know what is happening on the ground are those in the rural areas where there are people who are isolated, vulnerable, sick, old and wheelchair-bound.  That local knowledge is vitally important and reducing 35 groups to 18 units will have an impact on that.  </p><p>  We have spoken about the subsidies, which have been reduced year on year, but we should not try to fix something that is not broken.  We might patch it up here and there but we should not overhaul the entire system.  That is one of the problems we face.  When Pobal carried out a review, its representatives travelled 150 km through the entire area of Galway and found that the number of checks that had to be carried out were extremely difficult to do.  If we cut back on those we will face more problems.  Centralising the service is a bad idea.  We must prioritise local knowledge because otherwise the managers and others will end up doing more work.</p><p>  I have a number of questions, the first of which is on the rural hackney plan being done under the review of taxis.  What percentage of this measure will contribute towards that plan?  Many taxi drivers are concerned that introducing this new tier of hackneys will impact on their businesses.  I do not know if the witnesses have taken into account all of that.</p><p>  Will the witnesses explain the direct award contracts with no tendering?  Is that a good idea?  How will it work? Is there a cost to local authorities who will house some of these companies?  If that is the case has that been factored in?  Will there be job losses in some of these companies and on the part of individuals, particularly local people who have small companies?  Has the impact of those in the communities been factored in?  Everything must be weighed up in that regard.  </p><p>  Mr. Murphy mentioned that Colm McCarthy wanted to abolish this programme.  Mr. McCarthy had very right-wing driven ideas in terms of abolishing many facilities and much that was good in this society, including social welfare and other cutbacks in those areas.</p><p>  There are areas that can be examined but whatever way we mask this we are talking about cutbacks, which will have a huge impact on local communities.  Despite what has been said, certain areas will not get a service, as happened with Dublin Bus when services in many local communities were lost.  We were told that was a great idea but we ended up with many communities not being served, with very few savings achieved.</p></speech>

Current taxi or hackney drivers should not be worried that we will license somebody who will be operating in the same areas as them.  One of the features, which we have already discussed with our taxi advisory committee and the industry, is that we will have to be advised by local authorities and, say, rural transport groups that a service is not provided by anybody operating in the area before we will consider that rural hackney licence.  I do not see it as a threat.  It is an enabling mechanism, yet at this stage I am not sure how many will be issued or where they will be issued.</p><p>  Regarding direct award contracts, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are in a direct award contract with us.  They are internal operators in the country and they are allowed to be given a contract for services without tendering under EU regulations and national legislation.  In the same way the rural transport groups that own their own fleets, and operate greater than 50% of their services through their own fleets, can be given a direct award contract.  That will secure many of the groups and the wheelchair-accessible vehicles being used throughout the country.</p><p>  On the cost to the local authorities, our hope is that the local authorities will offer this accommodation free of charge on the basis that it should be surplus accommodation.</p> <p>We are really only seeking a unit for four people.  We feel they have space available and they have diminishing numbers, so there should be an opportunity whereby the programme will not have to bear the cost of rental accommodation so that more money can go into the services.</p><p> I will hand over to Ms Graham to speak about job losses.  Before doing so, however, I think there is a recurring theme whereby the 35-group model is the only one appropriate and satisfactory to rural transport provision.  It grew up that way in Ireland but that is not the way it is offered in many other European countries that have much better rural transport provision.  They have regional models which allow them to reduce administrative costs.  In Ireland's case, it was a response from the ground to fill a need, but it is not the most efficient structure for doing so.  It is not efficient to have 35 managers reporting on finance and other issues to boards.  That is a repetitive task which involves unnecessary duplication across the country.  We want to retain the skills, as Ms Graham mentioned, of local administrators and managers who know what the needs are, as well as the dispatchers who are in touch with people in taking calls.  Those are the jobs we need to keep.  However, certain functions are being duplicated right across the country which are unnecessary for the programme.  It would not reflect international practice where services are provided on a much better basis than in Ireland.  We acknowledge that and would like a lot more subsidy to go into the rural transport programme.</p><p> Perhaps Ms Graham could now deal with the job losses.</p></speech>

We estimate a loss of approximately 22 or 24 posts across a programme that currently employs about 140 people.  In restructuring, we found that provision and staffing of the rural transport groups is varied across the country, with some having higher staff levels than others.  In some areas, posts are required and about seven posts will be provided.  We estimate that the net loss will be about 15 to 17 posts.</p></speech>

I welcome the work that is being done by the rural transport programme, which is very important for people in rural communities throughout the county.  I welcome the efforts to obtain better value for money from the service.  I would differ from some previous contributors in that I am optimistic the NTA can deliver that.  Reform and restructuring should always be considered, particularly where there are relatively new structures in place.  Realistically, we are talking about a service that has only been in place for about a decade in some places, and less than that in others.  We should be open-minded on the reform and restructuring proposals.  Having said that, it is an area that I will be watching closely in future to ensure the level of service provided is maintained and hopefully enhanced.  In that way, as previous contributors have said, local knowledge will not be lost.</p><p>  The Chairman of this committee has a serious societal role to play because rural isolation is a major problem.  This has been discussed responsibly in various quarters recently.  It is a matter that will not be going away and it needs to be tackled.  Transport is a big part of tackling the problem of rural isolation.  I welcome some of the initiatives that have been announced in the restructuring programme but I have concerns about the rural hackney licence, although I welcome it.  I come from a very rural community myself, living at the foot of the Slieve Mish mountains on the Dingle peninsula.  In mid-week, for example, it is difficult to get any hackney operator in that area and other parts of rural Kerry.  There is a vacuum to be filled, therefore, particularly from Monday to Thursday.  Transport operators who do not feel it is viable to operate from Monday to Thursday do operate at weekends.  Is there a threat of displacement if rural hackney licensees operate on the same nights?  How will the NTA get around that?  Certain hackney operators have told me they are concerned that on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights somebody could be doing the run for a much lower price than them.  There is that fear, but there is an opening on quieter weeknights for a lower-cost service run by drivers with fewer overheads.  How will the NTA strike that balance?  I do not mean to be critical of the proposal because it certainly needs to be fulfilled.</p><p>  I concur with Deputy O'Donovan about the testing system.  I am aware of a person who operates in Killarney and a maximum of 20 miles outside the town.  He has been asked to identify street names, as Gaeilge, in Dingle, which is over 50 miles or an hour's drive away.  The man might have been there once on his holidays but would certainly not be taking fares there.  That area needs to be examined because good people are being barred from entering the system due to such difficulties.  I urge the NTA to examine that matter.  </p><p>  None the less, I wish the NTA well in the future.  Kerry Community Transport has provided an important service to the people of Kerry since its inception.  I hope KCT will continue to do that with the NTA's support in future.  There should be an open dialogue and feedback with Members of the Oireachtas to ensure that a better service is delivered for its recipients.</p></speech>

I represent the constituency of Sligo-North Leitrim which, at the next general election, will include Sligo, all of Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan.  I see the value of rural transport every day and the difference it has made to people living in isolated parts of the constituency.  At committee meetings, one finds that very little time is spent on praise; we talk more about problem areas that concern us.</p><p>  Rural transport is a discretionary service; it is not a legal right or citizens' entitlement.  The Government can grant the service or withhold it at any time.  That concerns me, for starters, because rural transport should be a statutory right.  I would like the Government to address it rather than the NTA, which is not in a position to do so.</p><p>  I share the concerns expressed by a number of people here that service improvements are often described as such when the real objective is cost containment.  While I am all in favour of streamlining services and getting the maximum bang for one's buck from the services provided, if the intention is to control costs then it will be difficult for the NTA to deliver on its promise of collecting more than 70% of people in rural areas from their homes and bringing them to their destination.  It will also be difficult even to maintain the current level of service.</p><p>  In 2009, administration costs accounted for 22%, which is extremely high compared to comparable services.</p> <p>Have the administration costs in 2015 and 2016 been calculated and included?  To what extent have communications and joint working arrangements been developed between rural and school transport contractors and private bus hire companies?  Have links been developed with Bus &Eacute;ireann to ensure, for example, that people can connect with the nearest stop for inter-city services if they want to move outside their own areas?  I ask the witnesses to explain in more detail the role of community car drivers in terms of insurance implications and fitness to practise.  Another member asked a valid question about engagement with local hackney and taxi drivers.  </p><p> My final question concerns cross-Border rural transport.  A town in County Fermanagh could be much closer to a person living in a rural area in County Leitrim than a town in the latter county, and<i>vice versa</i>.</p></speech>

As someone who represents an urban constituency, I became jealous and emotional listening to rural Deputies speak about the great townlands of counties Clare, Limerick and Kerry.  They made me think of returning to the country.</p><p>  The rural transport programme is a very good scheme both in principle and in practice.  As the report indicates, it has benefited many people, although not everyone.  Those of us who maintain contact with rural county councillors will be aware that it is not a perfect system.  All systems that are not perfect should be subject to review where they involve taxpayers' money.  That is a good and positive thing.  The scheme is useful but it could be further developed to make it more efficient in dealing with the difficulties of isolation that affect people in certain counties.  It makes a good effort at dealing with these difficulties but it does not address them in their totality.  This is why I argue there is nothing wrong in carrying out a review.  That includes the monetary aspects.  We are living in a country that has been made bankrupt and that relies on the financial generosity of our neighbours, and all schemes are subject to review.</p><p>  Reference was made to an bord snip nua and the McCarthy report.  I am glad the programme was not abolished, and the Minister should be credited for retaining it.  Anyone who is interested in rural transport should examine what happened recently in Greece and six months ago in Spain.  We have nothing to complain about.  Those countries did not waste much time agonising over their systems or citizens in rural areas.</p><p>  I support the rural hackney scheme.  I have family members in Scotland, where the rural hackney scheme is one of the greatest innovations that ever occurred for those who live in isolated areas.  The scheme also operates in parts of Wales.  It has proven to be a solution to the provision of a transport system to isolated areas on an efficient basis.  One of the reasons for its success is that we are living in the age of technology.  Clearly there will be teething problems, but we should hold counsel until we see whether it works as successfully here as it did in other jurisdictions.  I hope it will be a success.</p></speech>

I know full well the value of the rural transport programme to communities in Laois-Offaly.  If it was diluted or diminished in any way, it would send shock waves through people who are already marginalised and isolated in many ways.  Fewer people can afford cars and some lack the capacity to run basic errands such as travelling to town or making medical appointments.  It is an integral part of life in rural Ireland, and not only in places we would regard as extremely remote or isolated.  I welcome what is being proposed in principle, as long as it is not merely a penny-pinching exercise.  We can develop a better and more efficient service that takes account of natural hinterlands rather than local fiefdoms.  It is important that the service be opened up in that way and if there are mergers they should lead to more effective services.  Common sense must apply.  There have been occasions in this country when rationalisation and centralisation did not work.  The health service is one such example.  People bayed for years for the closure of the regional health boards but that reform looked better on paper than in practice.  We must be careful to avoid these mistakes.  If we learn from the mistakes made elsewhere we can end up with a better rural transport service.</p><p>  I would make a similar argument for the rural hackney service.  If common sense prevails, there need not be displacement.  I know many people, including those who run small businesses in rural areas, who would be willing to provide a service for customers, clients and elderly people who cannot otherwise access such a service because it would not be economical for them to do so.</p><p>  We are coming to the time of year when my colleagues and I are inundated with requests from parents whose children cannot access school transport in rural areas.  For some of these families, the bizarre scenario will arise whereby a bus passes the child by on the road or picks up his or her siblings.  The rural transport programme could step into the breach if common sense were applied rather than the current absurd demarcation lines.  Children from small villages such as The Swan have to travel to the nearest secondary school 10 km away in Ballinakill, but the official school bus passes them by.  The rural transport bus may not be going at the appropriate time.</p> <p>It is a shame to see two buses in one place, both half full, or half empty, depending on how one looks at it, and neither fulfilling the service required for children, students and parents.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that. Is there scope for improving rural transport for school children?</p></speech>

They mentioned 22% on administration fees, which is high.  If this works out, by how much do they foresee that being reduced?</p></speech>

I spoke about geographical areas and he is talking about time constraints.  We have not made the regulation yet, so let us consider that.  If there is a need for a hackney licence in an area where nobody is operating, or if we identify particular times at which nobody operates or is willing to provide a service, we should examine that in devising the terms of such a licence.</p></speech>

We will enforce, and we advertised for a support company to help us to enforce because we have staff constraints.  I anticipate that by October we will have appointed a company that can provide support officers who can work under the direction of our teams to enlarge the enforcement operations we do throughout the country.  The Deputy mentioned knowledge tests.  We have a separate issue and I must come back and explain the link.  We will examine whether we are doing something in our knowledge testing that is causing a service problem, particularly in isolated rural areas.  We will take it in the round along with the rural hackney licences.</p></speech>

I am certain people are being deprived of having a licence by the knowledge test.  If the knowledge test reflects the area in which the person serves, we will not require the second system.</p></speech>

It is a good point raised to examine whether we are doing something that prevents provision.</p><p>  Deputy Colreavy asked a number of detailed questions that Ms Graham will answer.  He mentioned discretionary services and Deputy Griffin said that Deputies will examine that closely.  We understand that we have a serious role to play here.  We are very pleased the Government has placed rural transport in our remit because it brings it together with the scheduled services for which we are in contract with Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, and the licensing we do for private operators.  Bringing rural transport into that mix allows us to consider the continuum of transport for people in isolated rural areas, how they can get to employment or education, or carry out other business, and how they can connect to national services.  We have carried out reviews throughout the country on a better link between Bus &Eacute;ireann services, private operators' services and this connecting service from rural transport.  We hope over the coming years we will start seeing reconfigurations that better pick up all the services.</p></speech>

The value for money report targeted an administrative cost of 13% of the costs to be achieved next year.  When examining a service provision overhead, we hope the TCUs will be able to grow services, take on other transport services possibly currently provided by the HSE, so that overhead is being shared across a much greater service delivery.  Then one does not have the same concern about the level of administrative costs.  We would approach it both ways: reducing costs and growing the service provision so those administration costs are shared over a greater number of services.</p><p>  School transport is one of the key areas the national integrated rural transport committee is examining.  It has difficulties in that the programme for school transport provision managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann is very structured.  We can look to see whether rural transport can provide a service at a different time to broaden the number of passengers it can serve.  Where there is school transport provision in a certain area we are also looking to pilot a scheme to examine the return legs of those services, particularly where the bus goes to a school in a rural area and returns to a town, to see whether we can gain efficiencies associated with that.  We would have to do it separately from the school transport procurement.  If that is successful we would examine rolling it out in other locations.</p><p>  There are already some cross-Border rural transport initiatives, for example in Donegal.  We would try to retain as many of the cross-Border initiatives that are there as possible and grow them with our colleagues across the Border.</p></speech>

There is no real change.  Where they are operating, they are operating.  The Taxi Regulation Bill is trying to ensure there is no legal problem with them.  They are in a grey area because of the issue of carriage for reward.  It is a question of putting the legal framework right, and then they can continue to operate as they are.  Deputy Maloney raised some points about rural hackneys, which I have addressed.  We need to take on board the concerns to ensure we do not displace people from the industry and examine how well it operates and review it.  We can tweak and manage it by secondary legislation through our regulations if we see any difficulties arising.</p></speech>

I return to my deep concerns about how we will see a dismantling of the service and the voluntary endeavour.  Efforts have been made before to co-ordinate all transport requirements in rural Ireland working with the health boards and schools.  So much voluntary work goes on with which the witnesses may or may not be familiar.  For example, the west Clare mini-marathon, run by a small group of volunteers who take no payment from it, raises &euro;100,000 every year.  They provide a localised service transporting people from west Clare to Limerick and Galway for cancer treatment, which works exceptionally well.</p> <p>There is a huge voluntary effort in terms of fundraising, etc.  It does not fall within any programme.  I am somewhat concerned that as we start to put in place more regulation and greater structures - as we are doing with the current rural transport programme - it will disassociate the local voluntary community, which feel that, thank God, at last the State is now taking control and will hand it over with a very significant increased cost to the State.  In proceeding along these lines the National Transport Authority needs to be mindful of the huge level of voluntary activity that continues and does so much good work.  I am concerned that the National Transport Authority is trying to reduce what believes is an administrative cost, but which I believe is an administrative cost associated with the voluntary effort and fundraising providing a huge foundation to the service often through the purchase of the basic equipment required - the vehicles.  While the National Transport Authority has done a value-for-money audit, I am not sure it has taken account of all the strands that need to be included and that it will ultimately cost more money to deliver the same service.  That is just a comment and I do not expect a response.</p></speech>

I regard this development as very progressive as it mainstreams rural transport in the State for the first time.  It is a significant step forward and I hope we will look back in the future and regard this as a watershed moment.  That would be my view, which may differ from Deputy Dooley's outlook.  We need to be vigilant to ensure no mistakes or backward steps are made.  I am very optimistic.</p></speech>

It is evident that there is considerable support on the Government side for it.  I have no doubt it will see an enhanced and increased budget coming forward at the end of the year to ensure it will be in a position to deliver on this watershed.  That is probably the most welcome outcome from today.</p></speech>

Is there a danger that these will be used to take out some of these companies and be used for transporting people?  I am not clear what the Minister has said in regard to this.  Is he saying that these new hackneys will be used at certain hours of the night, or is there a danger that they could replace some of the existing companies that transport people, including disabled people?  Many of these hackney vehicles would not be wheelchair-accessible and those operating them would have considerably less cost than some of the rural transport companies concerned.  Is that a possibility?</p></speech>

They operate certain scheduled service and door-to-door services.  However, they do not operate in an isolated rural area at 11 p.m. for somebody in a local hotel or pub wanting to get home.  That is one of the big gaps that has been articulated to us.  That is not a gap that existing rural transport groups could fill or would wish to fill.  Rural hackney licences will be granted to people allowing them to operate for 10 km or 15 km.  They would be permitted to stand in the car park of the local pub - at the moment a hackney licence does not permit standing.  They would be able to pick up and people would know they were there that evening.  That licence would only be issued if we were informed that the local authority, the rural transport groups and the other social groups in the area had identified such a need.  That is the only situation in which we will issue such a licence.</p></speech>

I am sure the witnesses have covered the questions I had.  I welcome the new programme.  Coming from Meath, I know Flexibus works extremely well there and the people there welcome the programme.  Does the National Transport Authority intend using any one area in which to pilot the scheme?  When I spoke to the Minister he agreed that Flexibus worked extremely well.

There was mention of Clare.  We visited Clare, which has a fabulous operation with very committed services.  Many groups are operating good services.  The groups themselves share good practice, which is very good.  Their representative organisation is becoming stronger and more active in the area of pulling together good practice.  This will not be done on a pilot basis.  It will be done on an immediate basis for them all.  The objective is that by January or February we will have reconstituted those groups into 18 units.  We will make the best use of supporting information technology.  A group in the Sligo area has developed very good technology and we will investigate using that across the groups.
