    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-31a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018053100002#B00200"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy.  He is accompanied by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p> <p>  The next item is the minutes of previous meetings.  Are the minutes of meetings from 15 May, 16 May, 23 May and 24 May agreed?  Agreed.  There is one matter arising out of the minutes from the meeting of 24 May.  It regards category B correspondence, No. 1277, which we discussed last week.  The correspondence in question is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and he provided much helpful and useful information regarding unfinished housing estates, the local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme, the local authority mortgage resolutions arrears process and the taking in charge of estates.  The resolutions process dealt with the number of repossessions obtained by local authorities.  People will have seen the figures, which were quite high in some areas but not in others.</p> <p>  I wish to follow up that letter asking Mr. McCarthy to supply information relating to evictions achieved by local authorities.  We have the figure for repossessions involving people with shared ownership loans and mortgages - they are staggering in some counties - but we would like to see the figures for evictions achieved by local authorities.  We would also like to see which were done on foot of a court order or otherwise, as the case may be.  We know people have been evicted for non-payment of rents and possibly other reasons.  It would be useful to get that information for each of the past three years, taking in 2015 to 2017, inclusive.  I would like to get the figure from the voluntary housing associations funded by the taxpayer as well.  It is a matter we have not touched but when we saw the figure for repossessions by local authorities, the next question would be in respect of tenants in voluntary housing associations and evictions achieved.  This takes in local authorities and the approved housing bodies.  We should get the information and take it from there when we get it.  Is it agreed to seek that additional information?  Agreed.  Members should understand that it is about following up the excellent information provided on the previous occasion.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A refers to briefing documents and opening statements.  No. 1333A is from the office of the chief administrative officer, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, enclosing the internal audit report of the ICT payments process.  We will note and publish this.  There was a previous report provided to the committee.  No. 1344A is from the acting Garda Commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, providing his opening statement.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers to follow up previous meetings of the committee.  There are a number of items in this category, starting with a letter from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen of the State Claims Agency, as well as correspondence from the Health Service Executive, HSE.  I want to group these together in one discussion as different letters have popped up.  We will come to it in a moment but I would like to get the other items of correspondence out of the way.  Is that okay?</p> <p>  No. 1329 is correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Deputy O'Brien had a query about this matter, which regards the contract with the new national lottery operator and assurances given with respect to unclaimed prizes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-31a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018053100002#B00300"><p>This is seeking further information.  Basically, we want to know how, when the legislation was being drafted, the confidentiality clauses were included.  Who knows about the unclaimed prizes?  I presume the regulator knows but is unable to divulge the information as a result of the clauses put in place.  I am trying to figure who else knows aside from the regulator.  Does somebody in the Department know and who audits those accounts?  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not do it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-31a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018053100002#B00700"><p>I will ask the secretariat to go through, in particular, the Committee Stage and Report Stage debates of the relevant legislation in the Houses when the national lottery was, essentially, privatised.  I would be surprised if the matter was not discussed and assurances were not given by the Ministers during the passage of the legislation.  Perhaps there was a commitment.  If a commitment was given, we want to know if it was followed through into the subsequent contract.  The commitment is to go through the transcripts of the debate on the legislation.  Deputy Howlin brought it through when he was Minister.  I was a spokesperson for the Opposition dealing with it.  I have not checked the record but I suspect the item would have come up for discussion.  I would be surprised if it did not.  Deputy McDonald was probably part of the committee when we discussed the matter.  We will go through the debates relating to the passage of the legislation allowing the national lottery to be essentially privatised.  We can perform a search for the term "unclaimed prizes" and see what discussion took place and if the then Minister gave any commitments on the matter.  When we get that, we can follow through.  It is as much as I can suggest at this stage and it is really what I was suggesting at our previous meeting.</p></speech>

I just want to know, apart from the regulator, who knows the figure.  How is it checked?  Are we just taking the word of the operator that this is the figure or will somebody go through it?  There was another &euro;1 million that went unclaimed last week.</p></speech>

The workload is increasing and that is absolutely definite.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 1330B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 18 May 2018 providing a detailed note in relation to the following: the approach to national procurement by the education and training board, ETB, sector, the systems, number of staff and support given to the ETBs on procurement and a response to the final paragraph of the letter from the Chief Executive of Galway and Roscommon ETB to the committee.  We will note and publish that and people are free to use that information.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 1334B from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, providing an information note requested by the committee regarding the statement of claim in the proceedings against the Minister for Finance pertaining to the terms and conditions of remuneration and expenses of the special liquidators, and their oversight by the Department.  We will note that and we will be discussing that issue in private session today.  Deputy Mac Sharry is not here so we will hold it over.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence Nos. 1336B and 1337B on the CervicalCheck claims controversy and the letter from the State Claims Agency so we will hold all of that together.</p> <p>  The item is correspondence No. 1338B from Mr. Ray Mitchell.  This is on a separate issue providing information requested by the committee as follows: Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice Harold&rsquo;s Cross review of general account and fundraising report; Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice Harold&rsquo;s Cross procurement and HR training report; submissions on behalf of the former CEO of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice Harold&rsquo;s Cross for the report entitled "General Account and Fundraising"; submission on behalf of the former CEO of Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice Harold&rsquo;s Cross for report entitled "Procurement and HR training"; and, letter re Our Lady's Hospice audit to Kane Tuohy. solicitors for the HSE.  Mr. Mitchell requests that as Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospice Harold&rsquo;s Cross report is subject to a Garda investigation and that we do not publish it in unredacted form or deal with it publicly.  Can we note this, we might discuss it tonight but I have looked at some of this?  This matter has been aired very publicly on the national airwaves.  I am discussing this now briefly and I am asking people not to say anything that might implicate any particular individual because if there are Garda investigations under way we will certainly not cut across those.  However, I think there are matters on the internal audit that are smack bang within the remit of this committee to discuss and we will do that so I hope people will understand what I am saying there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-31a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018053100002#C00500"><p>I had raised this first.  I had asked that we write to the HSE to request a copy of the audit.  I fully appreciate the request that we do not discuss someone in detail for the reason the Chair gave that it is subject to a Garda investigation and some of the individuals involved have a right to protection as well so I have no difficulty with that.  The one thing I took from the audit itself and what was in the media reports, because a lot of this is in the media, was the attitude of the organisation as a corporate body to the audit.  I found it to be quite shocking to be honest.  Leaving aside all the issues which we will not go into, it was the response from the organisation to the audit that shocked me.  We see lots of audits and reports where there is a finding or an opinion, whether it is a Comptroller and Auditor General report or an internal audit report and an organisation may not agree fully with the finding or the recommendations.  There would be some commentary but it seemed to me that the attitude of the corporate body was "nothing to see here, hands off and how dare you even come in and ask questions".  That seemed to me be the attitude so there are certainly issues for the PAC.  We always look at process and whether the governance issues that should have been in place were robust and it seems they were not.  We have been here before so this is not the first of the section 38 organisations that have been before us unfortunately.</p> <p>  If I remember correctly, when I raised this we had the HSE in some time ago where we discussed generally what improvements were being made and the relationship between the HSE and these organisations.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was saying that improvements had been made on the back of our meetings and the work the HSE was doing and that the issues in this audit go back to a period a number of years ago where improvements have happened since.  It might be unfair to us to say that there is still a huge problem but these issues still need to be ventilated some way.  Maybe I will leave it at that and if we want to deal with it in private session or under our work programme we can but I certainly think we need to examine some of the issues.  I am open to how we do that and I am deeply conscious of what the Chair said at the start as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-31a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018053100002#C00600"><p>I am conscious of that.  I want to put one or two things on the public record by way of information in case the public are wondering what we are actually talking about.  There are two separate reports and I am not getting into the detail but the key finding of one of them relates to a Spanish residence in Marbella that was bequeathed to the organisation in about 2008 and then there was substantial legal costs to get it transferred into their title and it was sold .  These are facts.  The property was later sold for &euro;37,500 without being put up for sale on the open market which resulted in a loss based on the original estimated value and the cost incurred.  The report goes on to state that it would appear to the audit that the property was sold at a very low valuation considering the sale price was just &euro;37,500 and it refers to appendix B as a way of comparison to properties in the Marbella area at that time.</p></speech>

They lost money on that issue, not to mind the value of the property and they have included two possibly similar properties in the appendix that were on sale at around that time in Marbella, one was for &euro;260,000 and the other was for &euro;245,000.  It is extraordinary to be left such a valuable asset and actually lose money on the sale of it.  That is the estimate of that report and we will ask the HSE for a detailed response on that issue so that people will understand what we are talking about.</p></speech>

The individual believes inconsistent information was given by the Secretary General who attended a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Before we make any assessment on this matter, we should write to the Department asking it to explain the apparent inconsistency highlighted by the individual.

That is important because an issue has been raised here, and it is an issue that has been raised by many Deputies in the D&aacute;il.  This person has taken great trouble to point out inconsistencies and I am sure that took a huge amount of work.  First, we should recognise that fact.  Second, we must follow up on the matter.

I was not satisfied with the response and it was obvious that the matter was never really followed up.  Two service providers are involved and we asked how much each of them received.  We were told that we could not get such information even though one knew what the other was getting because the overall amount was given, which was nonsense.  We were given the runaround.  We were told that we could not have the information due to commercial sensitivity and all of the rest.  The matter is shrouded in secrecy.  Let us not forget that public moneys are involved and many concerns have been expressed about this programme.  Leaving aside the concerns that people have about the programme, it is problematic if we cannot get basic information on how taxpayers' money is spent.  I ask that the committee revisits the matter as part of our work programme.  I was dissatisfied with the responses that we received.</p></speech>

When we receive that, we will revisit the matter and we will keep the individual informed.</p><p><b></b>Correspondence No. 1285C<b></b>is from an individual and is dated 9 May.  It is on the non-payment of farm grants.  We received a response from the Department, which we forwarded to the individual, in which it stated that the individual is now fully up to date with his payments.  I propose that we note the item.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1312C, from<b></b>Deputy Catherine Murphy, is on the Road Safety Authority.  We will hold this matter over.  The Deputy has sent her apologies for being unable to attend today&rsquo;s meeting.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1316C is from an individual and relates to a meeting of the committee to discuss the Cork Institute of Technology.  We will hold such correspondence over until private session when we will discuss the best way to proceed.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1331C is<b></b>from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  It relates to the committee&rsquo;s discussions on the review of the protected disclosures policy that is taking place in the Irish Prison Service, the process to appoint a protected disclosures manager, and the reporting procedure to be adhered to.  Is it agreed that we note and publish this response?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1332C is Ms Ann Marie O'Grady, chief executive, Leopardstown Park Hospital, on the draft financial statement and the delay.  We will note and publish.  We have received a number of similar letters.  We will have a report on the up-to-date position concerning the matter at a meeting on 14 June.  I wish to advise that as a letter went out in my name, I got letters back yesterday from ten organisations or covering ten organisations, primarily in the Department of Finance, saying that all of the accounts had been lodged last week.  The letter has woken up some people.  We will get an update report on those 37 organisations.  At this stage, many of them are in since we last discussed the matter.  We will get an update in a fortnight.  There are probably a handful of organisations that have particular difficulties that the Comptroller and Auditor General will have to work through.</p></speech>

We will be in a strong position to close that topic when we get the final report next week or at the next meeting.</p><p><b></b>The next item is No. 1335C and<b></b>is correspondence, dated 24 May, that alleges the falsification of data by University College Cork about disabled access.  I propose that we write to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to draw attention to the alleged issue and request a note on what constitutes a part-time and full-time student.  We will also ask the HEA whether it is satisfied that UCC adhered to the requirements in terms of declarations about the number of part-time and full-time students.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next item is No. 1342C and is correspondence<b></b>from an individual, dated 24 April, about the wards of court fund.  This person has written to us on several occasions.  The individual appears to be asking whether there is some way that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts could examine the wards of court fund, even though it is a private individual fund.  We have discussed the matter at length several times.  I am inclined to hold over this matter because Deputy Catherine Murphy, who is not present today, seems to deal with this particular group regularly.  I think we should hold over the matter because I would not like to conclude a discussion without the Deputy being present to make an input.  Is it agreed that we hold the matter over until the next day?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1343C, dated 15 May, is from an individual who refers to concerns following on from a protected disclosure.  He is recording his warnings and concerns with the committee.  Can we note same?  Noted.  The matter is connected with a protected disclosure in the Irish Prison Service, as has been mentioned.  I do not propose that we publish the matter at this time.</p></speech>

That prison officer wants to make a protected disclosure.  The matter concerned seems very similar to the issues that have been raised.  As soon as I get the disclosure I will forward it to the committee.  I will talk to the secretariat on how that can be done.  It seems that there are issues and we have more than one matter.  There seems to be a crossover of issues so we may have to examine or find some way to examine them with the Irish Prison Service.</p></speech>

He has provided an update to the committee on the Apple escrow account.  He has said that &euro;1.5 billion has been received recently and the Department expects &euro;13 billion.  It is a very short report.  We asked for an update on the Apple escrow account.  The Department of Finance has confirmed that the total amount of the contested state aid involved is &euro;13.1 billion, plus interest.  The Department has said that &euro;1.5 billion, including EU interest, has been paid into the account and it has confirmed that the timescale for when it expects to receive the balance of the amount is the end of September 2018.  The correspondence is very short, concise and to the point.  Will we note and publish?  Agreed.  The money has been lodged into an escrow account so we cannot get our hands on it yet.

The only item on the work programme, and I will return to the main topics of correspondence later, is our meeting with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and Nursing Homes Ireland on 14 June.  No further changes have been made.</p><p>I will return to discussing the various items of correspondence that have been received in terms of the cervical cancer issue.  I will work in reverse.  I note that Deputy Darragh O'Brien has indicated.  Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. John Connaghan, director general of the HSE.  Interestingly, he was the interim director general last week but he has written his signature above the title of director general on correspondence that was issued this week.  I believe he has a big job ahead of him.  We were concerned because we were given evidence that people had informed the State Claims Agency that all of the women involved had been informed about their audit, whereas the State Claims Agency wrote back last week and said very straight that this was inaccurate, so we asked the HSE to respond accordingly.  We need to discuss the matter, which is a culmination of some of these issues in CervicalCheck.  I ask the secretariat to display the letter, No. 1348, on the screen so everyone has it in front of them.  People can view the correspondence on the screen now.  It reads:</p><blockquote>At the request of the HSE, SCA officials met with officials of the HSE, including Mr J Gleeson Programme Manager CervicalCheck.<br /><br />The purpose of the meeting was to clarify the apparent difference as to the content of a telephone call between the SCA legal team and Mr J Gleeson which occurred during the trial of V Phelan v HSE and another.  The context of the telephone call was to discuss matters pertaining specifically to the case.  The issue of all the other women (the subject matter of the audit) being informed arose as a brief discussion issue.<br /><br />While Mr Gleeson cannot recollect the specifics of the conference call with the SCA in April 2018, we clarified Mr Gleeson's understanding was consistent with the record of the call.  Mr Gleeson's understanding of the communication with the women was that at the time he assumed the women had been informed by their treating physicians.  We now know that this was not the case.<br /><br />Hence the HSE and SCA are satisfied that the apparent difference around the understanding of the communication with the women has now been resolved.</blockquote> <p>Obviously that is to the satisfaction of the HSE and the State Claims Agency.</p><p> My issue, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, is we are given very definitive, categoric evidence in public session and immediately afterwards we find it is not the case.  That is a problem for the committee in terms of witnesses appearing before us.  It is not about the cervical cancer issue; it is about evidence.  The committee has to have an absolute assurance that evidence given here is correct because if it is not correct we are all on the wrong track.  That is the issue I am concerned with.  Deputy O'Brien indicated he wished to speak.</p></speech>

The issue is not whether Mr. Gleeson was of the understanding the women had been informed or not.  The issue was he sat in that chair and said he did not have a conversation with the SCA and he did not tell them that all of the women had been informed.  It is not an issue of whether he was of that belief or not.  He categorically said he did not speak with the SCA and neither did anyone from CervicalCheck.  That is the issue.  He cannot now come back and say that he had the conversation, that he told them this, that he was under that belief and that is now resolved.  The issue around the HSE and the agency may be resolved in the context of the apparent difference in understanding of whether women were told or not.  I do not want to use the word "lie", but we have somebody who came before a committee and who did not give us accurate information and even denied having a conversation, and now we know that not only did he have the conversation, he said what we all knew at that meeting.  The other issue I have is that we had the director of communications from the HSE at the same meeting state that he was-----</p></speech>

The issue for me is not whether he knew; it is whether he sat in the chair here and denied even having that conversation.  He needs to be brought back before the committee to give an explanation for that rather than this back and forth with correspondence.</p></speech>

In this situation we all know the issues relating to management in CervicalCheck and confidence and so on.  The programme manager came in here and gave us information which we now know to be inaccurate.  In that scenario, we have to question having confidence in a management team that appears before the committee and gives information that, for whatever reason, is inaccurate.  Not alone is it inaccurate but it is based on a case that was in the High Court.  This is pretty serious stuff and we will have to have a discussion about what we do about this.  If the SCA had not written to us last week, we would be none the wiser.  It begs the other question: what else is inaccurate?  What else do we not know about?  It raises a serious question for Mr. Connaghan.  What will he do about it?  He has a management team, previous and current, that has given inaccurate information to the Committee of Public Accounts based on a High Court case.  If Vicky Phelan had signed the confidentiality clause, we would not even be talking about it in the first place.  This raises deeper questions.  We should write to the SCA, verify that it agrees 100% with the context and the way in which the letter was written and ask if it has any other further clarifications or information it wants to give to us.  Second, we have to seriously consider the impact of being given information like this which is completely inaccurate for us and which is based on other evidence given to us.  Dr. Scally is doing his report but we have to consider what our next steps will be as regards actioning something on this.</p></speech>

One being the State Claims Agency and the second being CervicalCheck.  They were polar opposite views.  Mr. Gleeson was strident in his view that the SCA was never told that all women had been informed.  This was not just a miscommunication around a misinterpretation of the meaning of what was said.  His view is that, as Teachta O'Brien said, there was no conversation and there was no information of that nature given to the SCA.  What has happened since - and I want to be careful how I frame this point - is we had two polar opposite viewpoints, then we had a meeting between individuals of the two organisations and we now have a common position.</p></speech>

I could put it a different way but I want to be careful in what I say.</p><p>It troubles me that we heard from two organisations that had polar opposite views on what is a very sensitive issue.  Conveniently &mdash; if I can use that word &mdash; we now have a mutually agreed position.  As I simply do not accept that at face value, I believe Mr. Gleeson has to appear before us again.</p><p> We should not, however, miss the bigger point, which is what An Teachta Kelly was getting at.  I am giving my opinion from what I have heard.  We look at process failures and systems failures but there is a sense that a deliberate strategy was put in place to limit the number of women made aware of the results.  That is the bigger issue.  In my view, Mr. Gleeson was at the core of the decision-making in that regard.  I do not believe that issue should be lost in the confusion over emails and what was said or not said.  The Committee of Public Accounts should produce a report from that perspective and should not encroach on the work of Mr. Scally or anyone else.  We have had a number of meetings, however, and cannot just bookend them saying we have had discussions with witnesses because we have our job to do.</p><p> There were three elements to the strategy.  One was to limit the number of women who knew.  The second was to get those who knew and who had legal recourse to sign confidentiality clauses.  Where that did not work, the third element was to drag it out through the courts.  Ms Vicky Phelan rumbled all that.  That is my sense of it.  It is only my sense of it so I am not speaking for the committee.  I do not believe we can forget the strategy.</p><p> As the Chairman knows, some of the women involved were in Leinster House again yesterday.  Some of them are still taking cases in the High Court.  Women who are dying are still in the High Court fighting the system.  We have to have their backs.  Deputy Fleming, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, promised them that we would fight their corner for them so we cannot just drop the matter and say that is it.  At the very least, we have to produce a report and give our view on whether we feel there were systems values.  I know the word "cover-up" was used by the solicitor for Ms Phelan.  That is still an allegation.  I do not believe Mr. Scally will be looking at that.  I would imagine that if there were failures he will come back and state that.  Then we will need a commission of investigation.  If that happens, it will be locked into a two-year process whereby nobody will be able to talk about the matter again.  That is what happens with these commissions.  We have been here before with all these issues.  I am just making the point that we started a process and made a commitment and promise to the victims at the centre of this.  Not only because we made a commitment, but because of our responsibility, we need to see it through.</p></speech>

I have serious questions over the fact that the director general has put his name to this.  I am not given to extreme statements but am inclined to make one when I see a new director general coming forward in a situation like this, where there was clear evidence from the State Claims Agency, to say he decided to bring the two together to have a meeting.  We have no minutes of that meeting.  He refers to an "apparent difference".  There was nothing apparent about it; there was a difference.  Now we are talking about apparent differences, assumptions and consistencies.  There is something seriously amiss.  I find this letter totally unacceptable.  The last line states: "Hence the HSE and SCA are satisfied that the apparent difference around the understanding of the communication with the women has now been resolved."  As a member of this committee, I believe nothing has been resolved for me.  There was no "apparent difference".  It has already been said this is a very serious issue.  We have only a very limited, specific role in it.  When we are given differing accounts as evidence, it is then up to us, not the HSE, to make decisions on how to resolve it.  The representatives of the organisations in question, including the director general, need to appear before us again.  We will hear what has been said and we will make conclusions in our report.  We have no choice but to do that.  I say that most reluctantly because there is a much bigger issue here for the women.  We need an investigation as quickly as possible.  This is now undermining confidence even more.</p></speech>

He told this committee that there was no conference call.  Those concerned are being very cute with how they are playing with words here.  There was an apparent difference regarding a misunderstanding over whether women had been informed.  Mr. Gleeson told the committee it was his understanding that all the women had been informed.  If the HSE is saying that is the misunderstanding and that the State Claims Agency and HSE are now happy it has been clarified, that is the end of the matter.  The issue for me, however, is that the programme manager of CervicalCheck is not even recollecting that there was a telephone call in the first place.  He appeared before the committee and said he had no communication whatsoever with the State Claims Agency, and that no one in his organisation had any either.  He appeared before the committee towards the start of May, two or three weeks ago, and he could not even remember a telephone conversation he had two weeks previously.</p></speech>

We are not investigating everything.  Members will have noticed I have included a new paragraph in my opening statement to witnesses in the past month or six weeks.  I state specifically that we expect witnesses to answer questions put to them clearly and with candour.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts - I believe I am speaking for all members - I did not believe we had questions answered clearly and with candour on the last day.  It am referring not just to one person.  I just left the meeting with that feeling.  I was disappointed with the quality of some of the evidence.  I suggest that Mr. Connaghan, Ms O'Keeffe, Mr. Gleeson and whoever they feel the need to bring with them be invited.   I refer to one session, not two separate sessions.  Also to be invited are Mr. Breen, from the State Claims Agency, and the people he feels are appropriate.  We will ask him to bring his legal advisers.  We may choose, during the course of the meeting, to go into private session if he wants to say something that cannot be put on the public record.  He should be prepared to have part of the meeting in private session, if necessary, if he wants to say something that cannot be said on the public record.  It might not be necessary.</p></speech>

He denies even having the conversation, and that is the issue for me.  It is not the information that was relayed within the conversation but the fact that there was no conversation.</p></speech>

The committee had good reason to test the evidence of the witnesses from the HSE.  We had verification from a number of people including Vicky Phelan and the State Claims Agency.  We now find that the evidence given in public session by the HSE to this committee does not stand up.  That is an issue which the committee has to address.  We must make it clear to all witnesses coming before the PAC that their information has to be accurate.  We cannot just get a letter stating the issues have been resolved.</p></speech>

This matter was discussed at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality&rsquo;s meeting with the Policing Authority on 21 March.  In our role, as public spending watchdog, we are following up on the matter as it relates to 2016 financial accounts.</p> <p>  We are joined today from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by: acting Commissioner, D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer; Mr. Michael Culhane, executive director of finance and services; Mr. Liam Kidd, executive director of ICT; Mr. Niall Kelly, head of internal audit section; Mr. John Cunnane, head of procurement; Mr. Kieran Downey; Superintendent John Ferris; Ms Gail Malone, strategic transformation office; and Ms Therese Carolan, internal audit.</p> <p>  We are joined from the Department of Justice and Equality by Ms Nuala N&iacute; Mhuircheartaigh, principal officer, policing division, and Ms Tracey Germaine, assistant principal office, policing division.  We are also joined from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform by Mr. Jim Deane, head of policy, Office of Government Procurement.</p> <p>  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  That includes putting them on flight mode, as putting them on silent mode is not adequate as it will still interfere with the recording equipment.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.

While the 2016 appropriation account for the Vote for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not formally for examination in this morning&rsquo;s meeting, it does provide a context for consideration of the issues dealt with in the internal audit report.</p> <p>  The Accounting Officer&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control at the front of the appropriation account discloses significant financial and other risks faced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the steps taken to address those risks.  The statement also deals with procurement matters and notes that there were 94 procurement arrangements availed of in 2016 where a competitive process had not been followed.  The combined expenditure under those arrangements in 2016 amounted to &euro;27.8 million.  Within that total, expired contracts had been extended beyond the specified contract end date for 27 procurements with combined expenditure of just over &euro;20 million.  This included procurement of information and communications technology, ICT, goods and services, some of which were the focus of the internal audit examination being considered by the committee today.</p> <p>  More generally, I would point out that, as part of the annual audit of accounts of financial statements, we review the work and outputs of internal audit units.  That work aims to identify any systemic control issues that need to be addressed by the audited body, and to ensure that they have responded appropriately to any findings and recommendations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s internal audit unit completed the examination on the ICT directorate payment process in August 2017, and this committee was provided with a copy of Garda management&rsquo;s response to the report in March 2018.  The report and responses are being examined as part of the audit of the 2017 appropriation account of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is ongoing.</p></speech>

ICT services must be robust, secure and, in many cases, available 24-7 to ensure we are in a position to provide an effective service.</p> <p>  A large number of policing and security services processes are dependent on ICT.  These include the management of the emergency 999 communications control centre; incident recording; criminal investigations; fingerprints; registration of EU nationals; and international policing and security co-operation and information exchange.</p> <p>  In addition, ICT is being increasingly used in new ways to support the organisation&rsquo;s daily activities in areas such as strategic planning, data analysis and modelling of the organisation and its functions.</p> <p>  In delivering such services, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has always been very conscious of the need to ensure the ICT budget available to it is maximised and is invested in a cost effective manner.  Despite its capital budget being reduced by 50% as a result of the recession and the level of staffing being below those of other Departments, the Garda ICT department has successfully delivered a number of major projects, such as the TETRA radio communications network, e-vetting and an automated number plate recognition system that have enhanced the delivery of policing and security services.</p> <p>  Delivering these kinds of new services, as well as maintaining ICT services to an organisation of more than 15,000 people who work in a very complex environment, would not have been possible without a comprehensive approach to governance and project management.</p> <p>  In line with other public sector bodies, the annual Garda ICT budget is approved by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.  Annual ICT expenditure is reviewed regularly in that given year by the executive director of Garda ICT.  In addition, it is subject to review by the ICT governance board, which is chaired by the chief administrative officer, and includes representatives from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The ICT governance board meets on a quarterly basis.</p> <p>  A key element of the organisation&rsquo;s modernisation and renewal programme is the need to upgrade, replace and develop new ICT systems.  In taking on these initiatives, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na faced the challenge of progressing ICT projects where the number of people employed in ICT is significantly lower than in similarly sized public sector organisations.  As a result, and, additionally, in order to maintain critical policing and national security ICT systems on a 24-7, 365 days a year basis, it was necessary for the ICT department to avail of a very significant level of external skilled resources.</p> <p>  By their nature, given the range of ICT services to be provided and supported, contracts with suppliers can be very complex.  The skilled resource contract with the largest provider of external resources to the organisation commenced in 2009.  The contract has been rolled over to ensure the continued operation of ICT services and, given the complex nature of the procurement required, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na engaged the assistance of a specialist ICT service to assist developing a procurement approach which would maximise competition opportunities.  A series of tenders have issued, with more currently progressing, and contracts with a number of different suppliers have been awarded.  Over this period, the cost of the existing contract was carefully managed, with the average cost per resource decreased by 8%.</p> <p>  The report by the Garda internal audit service raised a number of issues, which are being addressed.  For instance, since last year, all external staff working under the skilled resource contract in ICT are subject to the Garda electronic time recording system.</p> <p>  Since receiving the approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to use the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, framework to tender for new skilled resources, a series of procurement competitions have commenced.  To maximise competition options, the existing contract has been broken into five tenders for different services, namely, ICT service desk provision; IT operations; ICT security; ICT application development; and support for the strategic transformation office.  These tenders are at different stages of the procurement process.  Subject to the outcome of the five tender processes, which are independent and operate via open competition, we would anticipate that reliance on a single provider in this area will significantly reduce.</p> <p>  Over the past year, the number of inhouse skilled resources in ICT has begun to increase and will increase further in the coming years.  Increased numbers and skills, combined with new structures in the ICT department, will reduce the level of dependency overall on external contractors.</p> <p>  On the matter of agreed rates, all rates are contained in the master services agreement and annual project documents.  There are no verbally agreed rates.</p> <p>  In addition, the internal audit service raised the issue of pre-payments.  The decision to apply prepayments is in line with the overall Garda budgeting process and has resulted in a 5.5% discount.</p> <p>  To conclude, ICT plays a fundamental role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na providing a service that protects and supports communities.  We fully recognise the need to ensure that investment in ICT is in line with public procurement rules and provides value for money.  Our approach to breaking-up the skilled resources contract will assist us in this and our focus on increasing the number of our personnel working in ICT will reduce our overall reliance on external contractors.</p></speech>

He will be followed by Deputies David Cullinane and Catherine Connolly.</p> <p>  I have one question arising out of that because it is a matter that came across our desk in regard to another public body.  It concerns the question of prepayments.  The committee found that Dublin Institute of Technology lost in the order of &euro;700,000 on prepayments in respect of a library contract.  It thought it was dealing with a reputable international company and it so happened that was not quite the case.  What level of credit check do the witnesses do in respect of organisations to which he makes prepayments because if they are gone, they are gone and they will not get them back?  What kind of ongoing monitoring is done in that regard?  When a contract is signed today that will run for a couple of years, it might be fine on the day the credit check is done and the contract is signed but where there is a prepayment system in place, there has to be some annual update of a credit check.  Sometimes the published financial statements might provide hints.  What system do the witnesses have in place in terms of security of prepayments if the supplier is not there to deliver the contract?  Have the witnesses dealt with that yet?</p></speech>

We do not have access to its financial statements at the moment.  I am certainly conscious of the prepayment mentioned about the library service because I read about it already.  We are conscious we are exposing ourselves to the same type of risk.  As part of the process of developing a more robust system to ensure our prepayments are secure we are limiting the type of prepayments to the companies that we believe have sufficient financial stability or substance to guarantee the security of the prepayment.  The prepayment tends to be for a relatively short period so we are minimising any type of exposure we have.</p></speech>

It is hundreds of thousands of prepayments so we limit the companies we make prepayments to and we look at the financial stability of those companies.  I take on board the Chairman's suggestion.  It is an excellent suggestion that we look at the credit status of the company on an ongoing basis to ensure there is no exposure.</p></speech>

I do not know where Accenture came from but there is a big company called Arthur Andersen which was one of the big five and it was dissolved so nobody is secure in this world.  There has to be a checking system in place for prepayments each year.  I will let Mr. Culhane develop that but he gets the point I am making.</p></speech>

We are quite familiar with one another at this stage.  The game of cat and mouse will continue today.  I said that as a joke; it is not serious.  Perhaps it is half serious.</p> <p>  Five weeks ago, we went through all this in the justice committee.  I asked a range of questions which Mr. Nugent came back to me on late last night.  I have the answers on my phone.  The answers to my questions, which were meant to be delivered within two weeks, were sent yesterday, five weeks later, and they were not satisfactory.  I will go through some of them but they were not satisfactory.  I had to chase for the answers.  I will get back to them.  I used the phrase "cat and mouse" but that is what is going on because trying to get straight answers to a number of questions is borderline impossible at this stage.  </p> <p>  Well done on the audit, which was necessary.  There needs to be an investigation into the way in which some of these contracts were handled.  I say this with officials of the Department of Justice and Equality present and with the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality watching proceedings.  There should be an investigation into how contracts in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na relating to some companies were handled because of the volume of money and the lack of procurement processes.  Mr. Kelly has outlined it.  It is not acceptable in modern times that this would happen with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that it would not enforce procurement rules in respect of rolling contracts.  It is not acceptable that it would have people on site dealing with very sensitive information not clocking in so it would have no knowledge of what they are doing, how they are doing it or what hours they are doing.  The audit states, "No assurances can be given that procurement rules were being followed on major IT contracts in the force".  It stated that there was a lack of a paper trail over key financial agreements.  I ask Mr. Kelly whether that is correct.</p> <p>  I presume acting Commissioner &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in has read this audit in detail and I presume he has taken action as a consequence.  Who is at fault?  The vast sums are incredible.  What sanctions has he put in place for those who were over this?  How can he explain the statement in the audit that there is no paper trail for the decision-making on these projects?  They are my first three questions.</p></speech>

What we have learned - Mr. Liam Kidd can confirm this - is that it was the perceived wisdom at that juncture that it would be better to go for one major supplier as distinct from breaking it up.  That sets the scene for how the contract was developed and given out.  That contract was extendable and it was extended.  Mr. Kelly has agreed that the contract was within the proper timeframes up until 2014.  Between 2009 and 2014 that contract was valid.  There was a period in 2015 when it was out of date.  Mr. Kidd can explain that at that time the skill resources were not available internally to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a new contract.  With the governance arrangements in place it was deemed appropriate that that would continue.  In January 2016, I took over the responsibilities of the chief administrative officer for a number of months in the absence and retirement of the previous chief administrative officer before Mr. Nugent arrived in August.  One of the first things I did was to set that process in train to ensure that a new set of contracts would issue.  That started in January 2016.</p></speech>

I will ask him again who was at fault because I have not heard of anyone being at fault.  Perhaps it is the Government but will Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in just say who?  There has to be a reason it happened.  What sanctions, if any, have been taken?  They are the same questions.  There has been no answer.</p></speech>

He is our executive director of ICT so it is in his area for these things to be developed.  I have given the Deputy the context in which this thing was developed back in 2009 and what was deemed to be appropriate at the time, which was this would go to one provider as distinct from breaking it up.</p></speech>

There is a single point of failure, which is Accenture.  It has knowledge of a system that has been built for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which means the Garda cannot get rid of Accenture.  Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in's organisation has managed to develop that situation where there is a dependency.  I know it is trying to work its way out of it and it is breaking up the contract.  That does not take away from the fact that that is what happened.  There has to be an explanation.  From the audit, we know from Mr. Kelly that there is no paper trail and no explanation.  Presumably, as acting Commissioner, given the vast sums of taxpayer's money, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in has found a reason and has imposed sanctions on those who allowed this to happen.  If I was in my previous job and did this, I would not be in a job.</p></speech>

On that basis, we had that reassurance from those particular bodies that this matter was being dealt with in an appropriate manner throughout those years.</p></speech>

I do not have the figures in front of me but the amount of expenditure was low in the period between 2012 and 2014 because we were not doing a lot of new projects.

In fairness to Mr. Nugent, his email to me last night was helpful in this instance.  We have an acknowledgement that private email was used by people in the force - civilian and those of rank.  We also have confirmation that emails sent and received on the Garda IT system are kept.  However, we now have confirmation that in our State that where members use private email and an email is not sent to or received using a Garda email account, our country and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no record of those.  There is, therefore, no record of any Garda-related business conducted in private emails.  That is a fact.  That is not acceptable.  There is a range of issues for the Department relating to this, including security, financial and audit issues. What does the Acting Commissioner think of that?</p></speech>

It is none of my business if Mr. Nugent uses his private email to communicate with Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in or Mr. Kelly to discuss the results of a GAA match or a golf game that is happening.  This is about official Garda business and documentation being shared.  My question, the answer to which I can infer because none of the witnesses denied it, was whether anybody had ever sent or received anything involving Garda-related business using private email.  The issue is that this creates risk.  It creates risk when somebody uses private emails for business purposes because there will be no record of what transpired.  It has nothing to do with individuals sharing information that is not related to their work.  I am asking about work and I have been asking this question for a year.</p></speech>

As Accounting Officer, I depend on Mr. Kelly and the internal audit unit.  Part of the remit of internal audit is to look at emerging risks and ensure that the organisation is adequately dealing with those risks.  It is part of the remit of the committee and part of my remit to ensure that areas that I, as Accounting Officer, believe need the scrutiny of Mr. Kelly and his team are addressed.  I then ask for that and it is made part of his annual programme of work.  He has independence in the context of where he may wish to put his resources at any given time, but if risks are emerging they need to be addressed.  Since the area of procurement involves such vast amounts of money, I would expect it to form part of the annual work of any auditor.  That allows internal audit to give me the reassurance that I need in the context of the timeliness, etc., with regard to these contracts.</p></speech>

From 2010-11, I introduced timesheets for all contractors throughout the organisation.  There was some question as to whether they would operate on a timesheet clock or physical timesheets.  I wanted a requirement in 2010 for all contract resources to submit a weekly or monthly timesheet, which would be certified by a supervisor.  Those paper records came in from 2009 to 2010.</p></speech>

It is straightforward.  Mr. Kidd is saying there is a contract as well as an obligation to record hours, whether electronically or through a paper trail.

I am asking whether there were any examples of subcontractors or people engaged through Accenture who did not use paper recordings and did not log on the electronic time recording system.</p></speech>

I would like to come back to the point made about the governance of ICT money because it was raised earlier.  We have governance structures in place for all ICT projects and expenditures.  Previously, in 2009 and onwards, we had the ICT steering group, which met quarterly.  Underneath that, there were governance boards which dealt with projects.  Then, in 2016, the new ICT governance board was launched.  I have the terms of reference here, but all of those are attended by people internally and externally from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Justice and Equality.  Therefore, there is governance in place.  Those boards meet quarterly.  Subordinate to those, there are individual project boards which deal with the internal projects on which we are working within the projects.  On a routine basis, within ICT, I manage money monthly.  I have a monthly financial meeting from the start of the year through to September.  That is attended by my own line managers, and we manage the budget through to the end of the year-----</p></speech>

All of that is fine.  I understand all of that.  I do not really need that level of context.  My point is a more specific one.

He has a responsibility in this regard.  What he is telling me today is not what is in the internal audit report.  The internal audit report says that he cannot give any assurance and that there is a high risk.  Now we are getting the rationale from Mr. Kidd as to why that is the case, because there may have been a greater risk.  None of this is reflected in Mr. Kelly's report.</p></speech>

The procurement rules are legislation.  They are not just guidelines; they are actually legislation.  If we are non-compliant with legislation, that is a very high risk, and that was the position we were in.  There is also the risk of not having the systems available but that was a more strategic, higher risk that I was not looking at in the context of this report.  I was just looking at the ICT directorate payments process.</p></speech>

The focus for my branch at the time was to put our full-time Garda resources into more strategic areas, for example security and other areas that are specific to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I concentrated available resources there, and at the management and leadership level.  Things such as the helpdesk, which is used to fix PCs, for example, were resourced at entry level.  There are skilled resources on the ICT side, similar to plumbers and electricians.  We are bringing in, as far as possible, skilled resources at entry level to assist us, but they are directed by Garda full-time resources.</p></speech>

The learning for the organisation is clear in this area, and I have tasked Mr. Kelly with ensuring that this does not repeat itself and that we have controls in place now.  For that contract to be renewed, given the time it has taken since its initiation in 2016 we should have started in 2012.  We are just now delivering on it.  That is the reality.  We have to flag up all our procurement in all other procurement areas and to provide a good lead-in time to ensure that the compliance requirements are respected.</p></speech>

In many contracts, the idea of allowing an extension for a year and then a further year built into the contract at the beginning provides a buffer of two years, which should be reasonable if the original contract is a three-year contract.  It almost means that, when a sizeable contract like this is put in place, the day it is in place planning to replace it must begin, and the procurement process to replace it must be planned.</p></speech>

When I arrived there were four at the leadership level and eight at the management level.  We have invested considerably through our ICT strategy in certain areas.  I put together a HR strategy, which Mr. Kelly referred to earlier in the document.  That is what is currently being implemented.

There are issues associated with the terms and conditions of competitions in this area, most particularly relating to mixed competitions where individuals who were recruited into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are competing with civilians.  There have been challenges around addressing what the outcome, from a terms and conditions point of view, would require.  As recently as last week I summoned all of the various sanctioning stakeholders involved to a meeting to resolve this once and for all.  We want to have the competitions in place and we want Mr. Kidd to have all the resources necessary in place.  Some of this is outside our direct control.

After 2008 there was a moratorium on staff and, in looking at excess expenditure in the public service, we cut down extensively on money being spent on direct staff.  We gave more money to the private sector, which became the subject of examination at various committees.  There were serious questions on procurement and how payments were made and monitored and we ended up costing the taxpayer more.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

There was a surplus of &euro;11.5 million in 2016 and &euro;8.49 million in 2015, with a deferred surrender of &euro;9.3 million.  Does that mean the force gives the money back to central funding?</p></speech>

It is a standard Government contract.  We have several contracts with Accenture.  We have a skilled resources contract which is time and material.  It delivers people in to fill roles in the organisation.  There are some other projects which are fixed-price based on deliverables.  For example, the rosters and duty management system was tendered recently.  Several companies bid for it and Accenture won the contract.  That is on a fixed-price deliverable basis.  As certain milestones are reached in the project and are certified and signed off by the project board, then payments are made on the basis of those milestones.</p></speech>

In 2016, there were seven pieces of work done on the basis of the skilled resources contract and nine other contracts relating to Accenture which all went to procurement.

Prior to the current modernisation and reform programme, we had an ICT strategy which identified 22 projects and systems which needed to be upgraded or replaced.  PULSE is one of those.  Part of the replacement for PULSE is not necessarily to throw it all away but to make it more accessible out on the field.  The mobile project on which we are working is bringing some of PULSE, such as person and vehicle checks, out on to smartphones and mobile devices which will sit in cars.  That project is at an early stage.  It recently won a Tech Excellence award in that it will take the police station out to the front line to officers and patrol cars.</p></speech>

The underlying system is fit for purpose, however.  There are problems - this will sound perverse - with getting information easily out to garda&iacute; on the ground.  We have done a lot of work in this regard.  Without considerable investment in technology, we have been able to provide 100 mobile phones to officers in Limerick who are accessing PULSE on the street.  The process is good.  The underlying system is there but it looks dated.  It does not have easy graphical access and is not easy to get the information out of it.  The information is there, however, and we know we can make improvements in that space.</p></speech>

I went back and it seems very clear from the Policing Authority that the reliance on outside staff is a danger and a conflict for the governance issue.  It needs to be dealt with.  I welcome the clarity of what was said.   Concern on the spend on ICT was referred to and that we thought some of it could have been done by skilled professionals hired directly by the Garda.  It would probably have cost less money.  That is the context.  The bottom line is that private companies are in it for repeat business.  That has been clearly stated by the Policing Authority, as well as the difficulties.  We also see contracts running on without monitoring and without procurement.  We can see where the difficulties arise in respect to trust in the system.</p></speech>

I am never reassured by assurances.  I am reassured by seeing the actual machinery working on the ground.  Here it did not.  It was the contrary.  Reasons have been given as to why but what I am more interested in the timing around the gaps.  The witness has said that by the end of the year the staff will be in place and there will be less reliance on outside staff and internal expertise will be built up again.  That is what I am hearing.  I welcome that and that gives me much more reassurance.</p></speech>

Aside from that however, it is a big budget item.  There had to be a discussion among some people in respect of this budget item for the coming year.  There must have been some level of approval for that expenditure, notwithstanding non-compliance with procurement.  There must be some discussion in the system.  A budget of &euro;26 million could not have been agreed without some discussion somewhere.</p></speech>

It is incredible that the Policing Authority has a role in respect of anyone being appointed to any role in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It does and that is right.  However, it has no role in respect of contracts of &euro;26.5 million.  That is a weakness and as legislators we need to deal with that.  It is not the fault of the witnesses.  I am just saying that as fact.  I have a quick question for Mr. Niall Kelly.  We heard about issues with Garda tax numbers before.  Are all the tax issues in regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na dealt with?  Are there any outstanding issues?  How many tax numbers are there?</p></speech>

The advice we obtained from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General was it was preferable that the existing individuals would remain as directors at this moment in time while the transfer of land issue was working its way through.  Notwithstanding the other issues, the actual replacement of those individuals could in itself introduce delays to the process.  It is something we are keeping under review and we may revisit it later this year.  As it stands, to be factually correct, we still have two officers who are directors of a company.</p></speech>

The most recent figure I have seen in terms of response was that 80% had confirmed they had complied.  The reason for the others could just be about people being away and on leave.  I am comfortable we have an awareness, which is most important, about SIPO compliance and ensuring people make returns.</p></speech>

I am a strong supporter of the use of closed circuit television, CCTV, on motorways.  When I was Minister I gave a grant to a community in Laois and I have to say the garda&iacute; there were excellent and the CCTV system is in place.  We also gave grants for CCTV in a number of other places.  They did not proceed but in fairness to the Government, it followed my initiative and allocated &euro;1 million to get the projects moving again.  I am trying to help the Garda.  What can we do to roll out CCTV projects quicker?  I represent a county that has two major motorways running through it.  We all know about the issues highlighted in places such as Littleton and Two-Mile Borris.  CCTV projects are also needed in Nenagh and Thurles in my local area.  What can we do to highlight the issues?  Everyone involved, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has the will to proceed but there are obviously issues relating to data protection that need to be dealt with.</p></speech>

All of the schemes in the towns and cities in the State have proved that for us.</p> <p>  We have a working group looking at CCTV and body-worn camera equipment etc.  How it might be rolled out must be discussed in the context of the current environment of general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the protection of citizens' rights, while providing us with the obvious benefits that would arise from it.</p></speech>

I am trying to help out here because I am a huge supporter of this.  I initiated such projects when I was a Minister and I used some community funding from the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I wanted to see how the experiment would work and it has been successful.  People are frustrated that they cannot go live with this.  A lot of work has gone into it, such as in my county in Burgess, in Nenagh and in Two-Mile Borris, but they cannot go live with it.  What can we do?  Is it a data protection issue?  Is it about where the information is to be stored?</p></speech>

To be of use to the committee, perhaps the people who have been asked to do that work could give an update report.  This may point to the areas that are causing us difficulty at present.</p></speech>

The State is going through a process of GDPR, which is transformative.  It is causing a huge range of issues.  We might as well deal with it once and for all.  Ultimately, I would support all funding that goes into CCTV across the State and especially for motorways.  The motorways are brilliant but they are a cause of crime, as we all know, because they offer the link to accessibility.  As with mobile phones, motorways make everywhere accessible.  I would like to see this initiative rolled out as quickly as possible and I ask the Department representatives present to please take note of this.  The public is getting frustrated.  People are not into the nitty-gritty of the data protection issue.  I have spoken with my own council, and they do not understand.  If it is about where the data are stored, given cloud technology surely there can be a way in which this is managed.</p></speech>

With regard to Templemore Garda College, progress has been made on the issues surrounding the sports facilities.  There are some outstanding issues that are not major and I can speak directly with Mr. Nugent about these later rather than taking up the meeting.  We must, however, sort out the issues around the golf club in a progressive way.  The land is owned by the Office of Public Works, OPW, and I accept that the college has to expand.  There is a farm there that is of no use anymore and part of the land for the golf club, about which people are not fully aware, is not all owned by the OPW.  As far as I know there is an extra piece.  We need some solution.  After this length of time - since the early 1970s - getting rid of the golf club is not going to happen.  It will not be tolerated or acceptable.  As they are flexible on how to reorganise that, where are we with this situation?</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that we have to resolve the issue, sooner rather than later, of the State's involvement around the land associated with the golf club.  I am not saying how this should be resolved but it has to be done.  The discussion with the OPW was about understanding the needs of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not mean this in a threatening way, please do not take it in that way.</p></speech>

This unitary position has not happened yet, but I suspect it will happen within the next two months.  We are trying to regularise some of the land ownership issues.  Excuse the pun but we need to take the sports field off the pitch.  The transfer of the playing field lands is close to conclusion.  Contracts have been exchanged and that issue will be resolved.  There are other issues to do with the land around the golf club area, which need to be resolved.  We need to do that in the spirit of engagement with the golf club but only at a time when we understand.  Within two months we will have a view of where we stand.</p></speech>

Trust me, the college needs it.  The volume of cars, for example, is a nightmare.  I accept that the college needs to expand.  As a constituency Deputy this is positive and I would be very supportive of it.  Having said that I do not believe the community will tolerate the golf club going.  The golf club will remain.  I know the members there and they are flexible enough with regard to the college requirements to see how things can be assuaged to facilitate everything.  I would encourage An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to work in that spirit.</p> <p>  There is a lot of talk about procurement and issues that were regularised - for want of a better phrase - in respect of Templemore coming under public procurement rules and so on.  I understand this.  Nobody is above public procurement rules, despite what some of my colleagues in Tipperary may have said.  I will not go into that.  Within the procurement rules for small amounts of goods and services, I have a question about some components coming under certain thresholds with regard to using three local suppliers.  Would the witnesses consider looking at the process by which services and goods are bundled together to make larger contracts and if this is always the right thing to do?  I know the public procurement guidelines quite well and in that scenario, there is flexibility for smaller amounts of goods and services, especially for perishable goods, to be sourced locally having had three tenders.  I ask An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to look at this in the spirit of co-operation, but obviously within the rules.</p></speech>

We clearly want to maintain this.  It is an important message to send.  On procurement issues we are guided by the Office of Government Procurement.</p></speech>

We need to see how they work and assess whether the bundles that were put together were the right bundles.  It is a reality that the scale of expenditure in the college, even in the smaller areas, is quite significant.  I hear the Deputy and it is a fair request.  We will certainly feed this into our review process.</p></speech>

I have prepared a few questions.  However, given that I was not present earlier, I ask the Chairman to indicate to me if any of my questions are repetitive or the ground has been covered.  I can always check the transcript later to avoid delaying the witnesses.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in mentioned that a large number of policing and security services processes are dependent on ICT, including incident recording and criminal investigations.  How many times has a case such as that of the late Mr. Shane O'Farrell occurred where a person was convicted of several offences and these were not joined up?  I am referring to cases involving one court not being aware of a judgment of another court or one set of officers not being aware of the position when they stop and question someone.  Have there been many such cases?</p></speech>

That has been given primacy in the context of what we are designing and developing and will be delivered on over the coming months and years because we are at the stage where things are starting to come on stream.</p> <p>  I would have to say that there will be other examples because of the way the system is currently built.  We need to get rid of those issues out of our system and make sure that any add-ons that we put in are clearly set up in a way that we record information once on an individual and then it is clearly visible across our whole platform.</p></speech>

We estimate that to be in the order of &euro;12 billion, which will significantly increase in the next number of years with the capital investment programme.  In terms of what we have put in place, we have a national public procurement policy framework, which sets out the overarching policy for public procurement in Ireland.  As well as that we put in procurement solutions such as framework agreements which the Garda is using in this case as well.  What we are doing is promoting best practice and we believe that, over time, all the issues the Deputy is mentioning such as proper planning, having contract registers and a corporate procurement plan in place, will see improved practices in place.  We are working with our public bodies on highlighting where they can bring in improvements.  It is a process.  We are working with the Garda in this regard.  We worked with it on 16 projects last year and I believe another 16 projects are planned for this year.  It is buying a lot of its IT equipment through us also such as PCs, laptops, firewalls and so on.  While there is no sanction, as the Deputy is aware, under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, the Accounting Officer is responsible for their expenditure but in putting the spotlight on the procurement function and giving supports to public bodies as well, we hope over time that all these-----</p></speech>

Cross-departmentally there should be sanctions against politicians for abuse of privilege.  Equally, in terms of all of us who are paid by the public purse, if there are breaches there needs to be a demonstrative sanction from the public's perspective to give them a sense of ownership.  I know it is not Mr. Deane's fault but I thought it was important to point out on the record that there are no official sanctions for breaches that, theoretically and in practice, have been shown to cost the people a great deal of money.</p> <p>  Does Accenture provide reports periodically?

It has taken that length of time with the best will in the world to get it across the line.  It shows that we have to be flagging these things much earlier.  We all have a role to play in that, not least Mr. Kelly in his role as auditor as he goes around and the procurement office, which holds the database of all our procurement files.  I am assured the flagging system has been introduced so we should not be in this position again of being out of contract or out of time in the context of services delivered.</p></speech>

The difficulty I have is that if we have a scandal such as this, which is examined a number of times and is subject to hearings of Oireachtas committees, and it is found that failings and human error or worse were part of it but the Accounting Officer or person in charge decides not to take action against any individual because it might be divisive, what is to stop something similar happening again?  Notwithstanding the process changes which the witness says can be made, the problem here is that there was also human error.  I welcome the fact that the process can be tightened up.  I hope it will not happen again.  The problem is - and we have this over and over again - that if no sanctions are ever taken against an individual then nobody is held to account.</p></speech>

My job is to ensure that people do not forget what happened in that context.  As the head of discipline for the organisation, and I delegate that to my chief superintendents, I have made clear that I and they will consider that any breach of that type, where information is put on erroneously or deliberately when people know it is wrong, would be subject to the most severe sanction.</p></speech>

The officer will already have his or her TETRA radio and so forth.  This is an additional piece of assistance to the officer on the street.</p></speech>

If one is offering a discount where prepayment is concerned and the other is willing to offer at a higher price but accepting later payment, one needs to assess the optimum approach and to protect oneself against the very risks the Chairman spoke about.</p></speech>

Basically, it is set out in the tender documentation that the evaluation will be based on certain criteria.  Generally, there is a quality element and a price element.  In the pricing element, one could include factors such as that in question, and the bidders could compete against each other on that basis.  It might be better value for the State in certain circumstances to get a discount up front, or not, as long as it is-----</p></speech>

In the past year, we have had an example of a State body costing the taxpayer &euro;700,000 because of a prepayment and the relevant company going bust.  Today, the Comptroller and Auditor General tells us that, at the end of the financial year, &euro;11 million in prepayments to the private sector were in the system for the provision of services beyond the year end.

As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I believe the situation is not adequately in hand.  I am looking to Mr. Deane and to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to address this.  There has been a loss to the taxpayer.  Not only was there a loss but Mr. Deane is actually telling us there is no great system even to learn from that loss.  The lessons have not been learned across the public sector as a result of the loss of &euro;700,000 in DIT.  Mr. Deane says this is related to Government accounting procedures and not a matter of procurement but I am at a loss to know who needs to learn lessons from this.  Mr. McCarthy is telling us there is &euro;11 million concerning the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I hope that never creates a problem.  I am sure, now that we have raised the issue, we will be coming back to the Comptroller and Auditor General to find out its extent across all Government bodies.  Between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Government Procurement, somebody needs to get a handle on the matter to ensure we are not here next year finding &euro;3 million had been issued in prepayments to a contractor that went bust.  I need to see lessons learned across the public service from what happened in DIT.  One function of the Committee of Public Accounts is to make sure the public sector learns from what went wrong.  Mr. Deane gets the gist of what I am saying.  I have made my point and he knows where I am coming from.  It is not personal.  I am a little surprised the system has not adequately registered the risk, which was actually realised in some places.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Office of Government Procurement for attending, for the materials supplied, and for offering to forward information on any outstanding matters referred to today.</p> <p>  We have completed our public meeting.  We will be meeting in public session on Thursday, 14 June, when we will be meeting representatives of the State Claims Agency and the HSE.  That will be followed by a meeting with Nursing Homes Ireland, subject to confirmation, and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  We shall now go into private session to do the committee's private work.  I thank the witnesses very much for attending.</p></speech>

It fits with what Sinn F&eacute;in has been arguing for quite some time, that is, that we need to move from relying on administrative sanctions alone.  Those days are gone.  Good riddance to them.  This section chimes with what Deputy Doherty's legislation identified.  I refer to the lacuna or loophole that had been acknowledged by the Central Bank whereby bankers, insurers and others who lie or give false information to the Central Bank, cannot be jailed under current rules.  There have been some media reports recently that suggested the Government is considering its own legislation on this issue and on broader white-collar crime issues.  Can the Minister of State offer us some information on that at this point in time?</p> <p>  The use of criminal sanctions and jail time for white-collar criminals is where we need to be going in policy terms.  That means a focus on individual responsibility.  That is something the Central Bank has pointed to in its submission on white-collar crime.</p> <p>  Could the Minister of State outline how the maximum penalties, of ten years' imprisonment and a fine of &euro;10 million, were arrived at?</p></speech>

Under MiFID 1, there was also a fine of &euro;10 million and the potential for ten years in jail.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-31a.928" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018053100002#C01200"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p> <p>  In page 6, line 6, after &ldquo;paragraph (b)&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and subsection (3)&rdquo;.</p> <p>It is fair to say that Deputy Pearse Doherty and I are not totally in opposition in terms of these amendments.  We both want to ensure that long-term financial services which are not of a fixed or definite duration can be investigated by the ombudsman under the longer time limits applying to long-term financial services.  These Government amendments are squarely aimed at ensuring that financial services which are long-term in nature but which do not specifically fix their duration can be investigated by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  </p> <p>  The first amendment is technical and is required by the substantive amendment.  The substantive amendment allows the ombudsman to investigate cases where the duration is not fixed but where it is reasonable for a consumer to expect its duration to be longer than the five years and one month threshold by virtue of the manner in which the services operate, the type of assets with which it is connected, or by virtue of representations made by the financial service provider.  It specifically excludes current accounts and other financial services of an indefinite duration which do not have such characteristics.  </p> <p>  I appreciate that this is a complex amendment, and I can see the attraction of the simplicity of the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  However, I consider that it would capture more than we agreed we would include in the expanded definition of long-term financial service.  For example, a consumer opening a current account on starting his or her first job or when he or she goes to college might reasonably expect that it will last more than five years, but we have been clear that such a product is not and should not be considered a long-term financial service.  </p> <p>  These Government amendments mean that whole of life cases, which are not of fixed duration by definition, can be investigated by the ombudsman subject to the time limit in section 51 of the 2017 Act.  Contrary to the common understanding that these time limits rule out misconduct that occurred prior to 2002, the current legislation permits the ombudsman to investigate cases outside this limit in particular circumstances.  Section 51(2)(3) provides for a time limit of, "such longer period as the ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in all circumstances to so extend the period".  This gives the ombudsman the discretion to extend the time period to cover events that occurred earlier than 2002.  However, I should stress that there are conditions attaching to the exercise of this discretion.  There must be reasonable grounds and it must be just and equitable in all circumstances.  This means it must be just and equitable to both sides, both the consumer and the financial service provider.  </p> <p>  Officials from the Department were in detailed discussions with the Office of the Attorney General to see whether it was possible for the office of the Parliamentary Counsel to draft a constitutionally robust amendment which would allow whole of life complaints to be made to the ombudsman without time limits.  However, I would have concerns that it is arguably unfair and potentially unconstitutional to require the ombudsman to depart from these time limits regardless of whether he considers it fair or reasonable.  The key question for legislative time limits for the bringing of complaints or legal actions is whether the Oireachtas has struck a reasonable balance between the rights of the plaintiffs, the applicants, the interests of the defendants-respondents, and the public interest.   </p> <p>  I believe that the current Act, with the proposed Government amendments, strikes a reasonable balance.  For these reasons I am pressing the Government amendments and cannot accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-31a.929" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018053100002#C01300"><p>We welcome this group of amendments, which take aim at the same points, the inclusion of certain groups that, by the spirit of the legislation, should have redress to the Financial Services Ombudsman but which the ombudsman has ruled currently do not qualify.  I am of the view that it is possible and arguable that the findings of the ombudsman could be challenged, but the best thing to do is to clear up any uncertainty by making it crystal clear and precise that they do indeed qualify.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, wrote to the Minister in October about this issue.  The Minister responded positively and has acted with the amendments tabled today.  The group in question are members of one member schemes which fell foul of the definition of long-term financial service.  The issue was the definition of the word "fixed".  Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment sought to remedy this problem by introducing a new definition of a financial service in which the consumer could reasonably expect the service to last more than five years and one month, the point being that the definition of "fixed" was too restrictive.</p> <p>  As the Minister of State has outlined in his comments, his amendments very much tackle the same issue, and we are satisfied that they resolve it.  We will consequently support those amendments and will withdraw our own.</p> <p>  The next challenge, as we see it, is amendment No. 5, which I believe has been ruled out of order.  We should all be of one mind on the issue it raises; it allows access to the Financial Services Ombudsman for those people who bought whole of life insurance products and other whole of life products before 2002.  There are some concerning issues being brought to the attention of Deputies about these cases.  The interpretation of the 2002 Act by the ombudsman means that these people are being barred from the process.  Amendment No. 5, which has been disallowed, was tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty, and would have made an attempt to get to the heart of this issue.  At the core of the legislation recently passed was a new rule that a consumer complaint within three years of being aware of an issue, or that they could reasonably be considered to have become aware of it, would allow a person access to the Financial Services Ombudsman process.  This replaced the old six year blanket rule.  Many people have benefited from that change, but in the case of very long-term products backstop has become a problem.  We can make no judgment of the merits of the cases or whether the complainants have a good case or otherwise, but the point is that they deserve access to the process.  This is something that Deputy Pearse Doherty and my party intend to return to on Report Stage.  Given that the amendment was ruled out of order, I would like the Minister of State to commit to dealing with this issue and will consider it at that stage.  </p></speech>

We are satisfied that the legislation that was passed last year is sufficient.  I will read the note and we can then discuss it through the Chair.  The current legislation permits the ombudsman to investigate complaints about long-term financial services that occurred before 2002 in particular circumstances.  Section 51(2)(3) provides for a time limit of, "such longer period as the ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable in all circumstances to so extend the period".</p><p>This gives the Ombudsman the discretion to extend the time period.  I would stress there are conditions attaching to the exercise of this discretion.  There must be reasonable grounds and they must be just and equitable to both the consumer and the financial service provider.  It is a matter for the Ombudsman to make this decision and the Ombudsman is independent.  The follow-on from that is important because it is something on which we are all like-minded.  We want the Ombudsman to have the authority to deal with these matters.  The Ombudsman has the authority.  It is a matter for his discretion whether to use that authority.</p><p> I have a note that I want to put on the record.  The Ombudsman will always consider whether the exercise of this discretion is appropriate when a long-term financial service is not being investigated due to time limits.  The exercise of this discretion does not have to be requested by the complainant.  I understand from the conversation between Department officials and the Ombudsman that there were only a small number of cases.  I did not get the actual number of cases or whether the requester has requested him to exercise his discretion.  To date, the Ombudsman has not exercised this discretion.</p><p> We are satisfied that the legislation is solid and that it is allowable for the Ombudsman to investigate but, as of now, he has not sanctioned any of those requests that have come to him.  I do not have the actual number to go beyond the 2002 period.  We have done our bit.  The members, as Members of the Oireachtas, have done their bit in regard to the legislation.  We are satisfied it is sufficiently strong.  It then moves to the Ombudsman for him to exercise his discretion to facilitate an investigation to a pre-2002 long-term financial services product.</p><p> As Deputy Michael McGrath has just arrived, I will read the note again.  Section 51 of the 2007 Act, the Act that we all put a good chunk of time into dealing with last year to get over the line, provides for a departure from a rigid six-year rule because the complainant has three years from the date he or she became aware or ought to have become aware of the cause of action to make a complaint.  While there is a general time limit of 2002, in regard to the conduct being complained of there is a provision for the possibility of a longer period extending to before 2002 where the Ombudsman decides it would be reasonable to allow a longer period and would be just and equitable in the circumstances.  It is a matter for the Ombudsman, therefore, to facilitate an investigation prior to the 2002 time schedule that is part of section 51 of last year's Act.  It is a matter for the discretion of the Ombudsman.</p></speech>

It is all well and good to say that in certain circumstances the power exists but it is clear that power or discretion is not being exercised.  I am sure Deputy Doherty and others can furnish him with examples of cases but there are people who are coming up against this obstacle.  There are people who have what are essentially legitimate complaints about products that predate 2002 that have not been able to proceed because of the decisions of the Ombudsman.  At the very least, that requires a further examination.  If these people have complaints, whatever their merits , the spirit of which come within the meaning of the change in the six-year rules, there is clearly a problem in that regard.  I ask that the Minister of State would consider that before Report Stage.  I am sure Deputy Doherty can furnish him with examples.  We will be returning with amendments to that end on Report Stage.</p></speech>

We have had the further look.  The spirit of the legislation was clear to anybody who sat through the debate on it.  I sat through it on this side and the other side of the House prior to 11 months ago when I was a member of the committee.  We want the Ombudsman to look at this.  It is very clear.  It is a matter for the Ombudsman to do so.  I respectfully put it to the committee that we do not believe there is more we can do.  We believe it is a matter for the Ombudsman to use his discretion, which he is allowed to do, to investigate these matters.  The view of everybody on the committee, going back to last year, was that these would be allowable and investigable by the Ombudsman.  That is very clear in my mind from when I moved to this side of the committee addressing the Members and also, when I was a member of the committee, being addressed to by other members of Government.  The spirit of the legislation is very clear.  I do not believe we can do any more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-31a.934" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018053100002#D00400"><p>What the Minister of State has said is significant.  On a separate occasion I will ask the committee to write to the Ombudsman to look for data on the number of cases that have come before him that are in this category where the alleged mis-selling, for example, would have occurred prior to 2002 and where he has opted not to use the discretion to avail of the powers this Oireachtas gave to him under the Act to have a look-back.  In that context, we should be looking for the information on the number of those cases, his reasons and his interpretation of the legislation on which we all worked hard to secure its passage.</p> <p>  We spoke on Second Stage about the issue of whole-of-life policies, which are very important.  There are many people who have been very badly burned, so to speak, and I know the Minister of State is also aware of individual cases.  I have sat down with many of those people and I am convinced that the terms and conditions of those products were not fully explained.  There is certainly a case to be made in some instances that there was mis-selling, therefore, it would be very disappointing if the Ombudsman decided not to use the powers the Oireachtas gave him.  It comes down to the interpretation of the reasonable grounds to extend the look-back prior to 2002.  That is something we need to tease out further.  We need to keep an open mind on this issue between now and Report Stage but it is very important that the committee would seek that clarification prior to Report Stage and that we reserve the right to introduce more explicit amendments at that stage to remove any element of doubt and make this absolutely clear.  Obviously, they need to be constitutional but if we need to further strengthen the option the Ombudsman has to look back prior to 2001, I and my party would be in favour of that.  However, we need an explanation from the Ombudsman first and if we can get that prior to Report Stage, that would be important because there are many long-term products.  It is not just whole-of-life products.  Those are important but there are many other long-term financial products, and those are the very products we designed that amendment for to enable them to be dealt with.  I know mis-selling is a very difficult case to prove if we are looking back over 15 or 20 years in terms of who said what.  The documentation may be limited.  It is a very difficult case to prove but I am disappointed to hear that the Ombudsman has had that power for a period of months and has chosen not to exercise it.  If we are allowed I would make the suggestion that the clerk would put that question to the Ombudsman.</p></speech>

The spirit of the legislation was that the Ombudsman would have the opportunity to investigate these matters.  I have no doubt that was the spirit of the law.  We believe we have gone as far as we can go.  That said, I suggest that we would leave the opportunity available from Committee Stage to Report Stage to further examine it and talk to members of the committee to see if we can come to a position where these are available to be investigated.</p></speech>

What I am saying is that there is a matter of discretion on the part of the ombudsman's that he has to date chosen not to investigate any of these.  We can only give the ombudsman the authority to do so but we cannot explicitly instruct him or her to do so.</p></speech>

We have worked hard on it and we feel as though we have pushed as far as we can.  It might be that somebody else feels they can push a little further.  We are not questioning the ombudsman on this.  I am sure that this committee has authority to do so.  On Report Stage, it is open to pursue it again.  We might have some more information at that stage.</p></speech>

It has been well discussed.  Some months ago I went onto the website of the office of the ombudsman as I had a query from a constituent.  There was no information there about the change in the law, no clarity on the change to the six year rule and the discoverability clause that we introduced.  I contacted the office and got information from it but for consumers who want to know where they stand, there has been no real awareness campaign about the change in the law and what it means exactly.  That is an issue and is something that we might highlight in correspondence with the ombudsman.</p> <p>  In common with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, we retain the right to bring this issue forward again on Report Stage which will presumably the week after next.  Hopefully by then we will have clarity from the ombudsman, if we write today.  </p></speech>
