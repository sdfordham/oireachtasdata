T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh &aacute;r gcur i l&aacute;thair eolasach agus d&eacute;anfaimid gach iarracht ceisteanna na mball a fhreagairt.</p> <p>  We were very pleased to be invited to present before the committee today.  Our presentation is in two parts and I propose to give the entire presentation.  The first part will look back on the previous year in terms of achievements in Teagasc and issues arising for the service.  Then, as requested by the committee, I will talk a little about the current situation in the dairy sector.  We are also happy to answer any questions committee members may have on other issues of concern.  </p> <p>  As Deputies and Senators will know, Teagasc is a science-based organisation which endeavours to support innovation in the agrifood sector with a focus on profitability, competitiveness and sustainability.  Teagasc has four goals that it strives to implement.  First, we have a very clear focus on the competitiveness of the agriculture and food sector, which makes us somewhat different from comparable organisations internationally whose focus on productivity and competitiveness has slipped somewhat.  Our second goal is to support sustainable farming and the environment, while our third goal is to promote economic diversification of the rural economy and to enhance the quality of life of people living in rural areas.  Finally, we are very conscious of the substantial moneys that the taxpayer grants each year through the Oireachtas grant-in-aid and we aim to deliver value for public money.  </p> <p>  The chart included in our submission to the committee is an attempt to summarise what we consider to be the integrated nature of the organisation, where within one organisation we combine research with advisory or extension services and education services.  These are intimately related and our goal is to transmit knowledge for the benefit of farmers and Irish food companies.  That is why we see it as critically important that the research is complemented by both the extension and education services.</p><p>We deliver the various activities through a series of seven programmes: animal and grassland; crops, environment and land use; rural economy and development; food research; education; advisory; and administration and operations.  Since the extensive rationalisation that has taken place within Teagasc, we now have a streamlined structure with three key units within the organisation, namely, the research directorate, the knowledge transfer directorate which is split between advisory and education and the operations directorate.  It is a constant challenge to maintain coherence and integration, especially between the research and advisory services.  </p><p> I draw the committee's attention to some important highlights from last year.  I am sure many members are already familiar with some of them but it is useful to give a brief reprise nonetheless.  We continued to be actively involved in the promotion of genomics in animal breeding.  The committee will be aware of the significant developments that have taken place in the dairy sector and the plan is to extend those to the beef sector, which is much more challenging, and to the sheep sector.  A major highlight of last year, after a hiatus of a number of years when the soil survey was suspended, was the completion of the national soil survey, thanks to substantial funding support from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  That will be a very important resource in the years ahead.  We were actively involved in providing scientific verification for Ireland's sustainability credentials.  In particular, in conjunction with Bord Bia we have developed the carbon navigator, which is an aid to farmers to farm sustainably from a carbon perspective.  Last year, the Government concluded successful CAP negotiations and Teagasc was extensively involved in providing technical advice during that process.  </p><p> Despite the difficulties in the advisory services that have been well publicised, Teagasc maintained approximately 43,000 paying clients and we are particularly pleased to point out that there were 13,000 farmers involved in discussion groups throughout the country.  In the dairy sector alone, approximately 6,000 of the 18,000 farmers in that sector were members of discussion groups which is a substantial proportion.  We continued to work very closely with Ireland's food companies and would interact with about 250 companies on an annual basis, in the sense that this involves a transaction with Teagasc.  Of course, we also have a lot of interactions of a more informal nature.  We also continued to work very closely with a variety of stakeholders in the beef industry through the Better Beef programme.  We have also been involved in supporting the national position in regard to the nitrates action programme and climate change policy.  We had a very busy year on the education front and we continue to be very busy in this area, mainly in response to the rural development programme and the measures that were directed at young farmers in particular, which resulted in a substantial increase in the numbers taking part in our part-time agricultural programmes.  </p><p> In terms of the budgetary position, we have provided a chart which illustrates the evolution of Teagasc's total expenditure from 2008.  The most noticeable change is the significant reduction in payroll expenditure.  On foot of the implementation of the employment control framework and the moratorium on staffing, the pay bill has reduced by about &euro;26 million over that period.  Pension expenditure in recent years has been around the &euro;40 million mark.  Unusually for a State organisation, the Teagasc pension bill is paid out of the grant-in-aid and is a substantial component of that.</p><p>The most variable element, and the most challenging on a year-to-year basis, is non-pay expenditure.  It is important to note that if we were to strip pensions from our expenditure, Teagasc generates some 40% of the remaining expenditure from activities which do not come under the grant-in-aid component.  This would include fees from the advisory services, which come to some &euro;11 million per annum.  We also have had significant successes on the research front in regard to the winning of competitive tenders and so on.</p><p> On the staffing front, as members will see from the slide, there was very little change in the numbers between 2001 and 2009.  However, with the imposition of the public sector recruitment embargo, we saw a substantial reduction to the end of last year of the order of 25% across the whole organisation.  That reduction was more acute in the advisory services because of the age distribution of staff.  The Teagasc map has changed quite radically in recent years in that we have rationalised our office structure substantially.  That process is now virtually complete with the exception of the Kinsealy site, which we are in the process of closing and relocating to Ashtown.  We hope to dispose of the Kinsealy site in the next year or so.  We are down to 52 advisory offices around the country and four colleges which we own and manage on behalf of the State.  We also subvent substantially three private agricultural colleges and we have seven research centres.</p><p> As I indicated, the largest and most challenging adjustment in staff has been in the area of advisory services.  The chart shows the extent of the reduction, particularly from 2008 or 2009 onwards.  Remarkably, we have managed to maintain our paying client numbers at in or around 45,000 despite a reduction in front-line advisory staff numbers from around the 400 mark in 2008 to the current figure of 235, a fall of some 32% over the period.  There is significant variation around the country, with staff problems more acute in some areas than others.  We have particular challenges in Cork, Meath, Mayo, Tipperary, Galway, Clare and Kerry-Limerick, and impending difficulties in some other counties as staff plan to retire in the next couple of years.</p><p> On the education front, our staff complement now is 93 or 94, which includes teachers and technician staff to support those teachers.  Nonetheless, despite the very difficult staffing circumstances, we have managed to maintain substantial enrolment in our colleges.  I mentioned earlier that there is a significant influx of students this year and will be in the coming years because of the rural development programme.  We planned to take in an additional 1,000 students in the coming years through distance and part-time education in our regional centres.  In fact, based on queries to date, we estimate this figure will be significantly exceeded within the next year or so as the message goes out to young farmers about the significant benefits attached to enrolling in education.  However, there are significant staffing shortages across all colleges.  We were fortunate last year, on foot of a decision by Government, to be able to take on a large number of contract lecturers to cope with the additional demand.  That certainly has helped the situation.  We also secured five new additional posts, which have helped substantially to ease the burden in the colleges.</p><p> On the research side, we have a smaller number of permanent researchers.  We expect those permanent researchers to supervise PhD students and win external research tenders, which enables them to employ highly qualified young graduates on a contract basis.  As the slide shows, in terms of a metric of performance, publications output continues to advance and stands at about three publications per year in top international journals.  Of course, this is only a crude indicator at one level.  We take the view that if our scientists are not publishing in international journals, then the quality of the advice that can be garnered from their knowledge will not be up to acceptable levels.  However, as in other sectors, we are facing significant shortages on the research front right across the organisation.</p><p> I will conclude this section of the presentation by highlighting some of the challenges and opportunities for Teagasc at this time.  We have never experienced more intensive demand for our services than we have in recent years, from both farms and processing.  I will refer presently to the situation in regard to dairy farms, where there is growing demand from farmers for support in planning expansion and also from the processing side.  As processors gear up to process the additional milk, in particular, there has been a significant demand for research in processing.  I already mentioned the challenge we face in regard to staffing.  We hope that shortage will be alleviated by the implementation of a spending cap rather an employment cap, but it has not happened yet.</p><p> We are looking very carefully at investment for our infrastructural needs.  Up to last year, we managed to sell off several valuable assets, which helped us to make necessary investment.  We have now come to the end of that process and must find other ways to fund our capital programme.  I referred to the exceptional demand for education and the Teagasc green certificate in the past year or so, and we expect that demand to increase, as I indicated, in the next couple of years.  In the past year, we took a major step in trying to respond to the demand for a green low-carbon agri-environment options scheme, GLAS, service.  To that end, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Farm Relief Services.  In the area of food processing, we have committed a substantial increase in investment to Moorepark Technology Limited and plans are well advanced to establish a food innovation hub at Teagasc Moorepark.  We also continue to be focused on climate change and sustainability.  A particularly significant development in this regard is the establishment of what we are calling a sustainable farm at Teagasc Kildalton.</p><p> I turn now to the second area on which the committee asked us to focus, namely, prospects for the dairy industry.  The table I am now displaying contains key information in this regard.  I ask members to concentrate on the Total Cost row, which is an estimate of the total costs of dairy production extracted from the Teagasc profit monitor.  We give the data for the average, for all farms that complete a profit monitor in dairy, and for the top 10% and bottom 20% of farms.  I would like to clarify an issue about which there is a great deal of confusion at times.  When we talk about total costs, we are excluding family labour, own land and owned capital.  That is a very important point to note.  Members will see that the average cost is 23 cent per litre, which ranges from a low cost of 18 cent on the top 10% of farms to a relatively high cost of 29 cent on the bottom 10% of farms.  This is a key metric in the context of reduced prices for dairy products and volatility of prices.</p><p>The committee will notice the substantial range and performance and if we were to extract the data for beef, sheep or cereals there would be the same variation.  It is almost a law of nature to some extent.  One thing that saves Irish agriculture is that we have relatively low debt.  Even dairy farms with debt, the debt is under &euro;100,000.</p><p> We are all conscious of the challenges that dairy farmers face following the removal of quotas plus the major opportunities.  One point that continues to be of concern is that so few farms exercise even basic financial management of their farm situation.  That is a significant concern particularly in the context of the post quota era.  We continually assess farmer intentions in the dairy sector as to likely increases.  It is clear from the most recent survey of plans for the period 2015 to 2017 that about 60% of dairy farms are planning to expand.  The red coloured line shows that about half of the farms plan to expand by 10% and 20% and another 30% or so plan to expand by up to 10%.  When all that is combined, we think that by 2017 the growth of milk according to this analysis would be of the order of 17%.  </p><p>I draw to the attention of the committee the diagram at the top right hand side which depicts the trend in milk deliveries.  A point worth making is that the food harvest base is from 2007 to 2009.  Between that base and last year there has already been a significant increase in milk production of the order of 15%, which is already in the bag, so to speak.  We reckon that over the next three years - beyond that it becomes a bit fanciful - there will be another 17%.  Our view is that it will not be that difficult to achieve the 50% increase.  In the box at the bottom of the same page we show what it might mean in terms of the additional number of cows which is of the order of 333,000.  Substantial additional investment will be required.  We reckon there will be larger farms and certainly farms will specialise to a greater degree, as we have already seen.  There may also be some increase in on-farm and off-farm employment and certainly more land will be used for milk production.  </p><p> Price volatility is a constant refrain in the agricultural sector.  The chart illustrates this quite well.  We have gone back a long way to illustrate the point here.  Taking the period from 1992 up to 2006, it is clear that milk price on average is around 28 cent per litre with a fairly narrow range of fluctuation of about plus or minus 2 cent.   We move into a new era of volatility from 2006 up to the current year.  From 2006 to the current year, it is clear that the level of milk price increases on average to 32.5 cent but the fluctuation also increases to about plus or minus 6 cent per litre.  We are pencilling in a figure for this year of about 27 cent on average.  I would not want to be held to this because it is rather like backing the horses at Cheltenham.  These are average annual prices.  Roughly we are looking at a fall of about 8 cent to 10 cent or somewhere around that from last year's average.  Given the data I presented earlier on the cost of production, the implications are very clear, particularly for the high cost producers.</p><p> On coping with volatility, the chart tries to tell a story about how farmers can cope with volatility.  The problem is illustrated in the chart quite well.  The blue line shows the fluctuating milk price in schematic terms and the dotted lines indicate the different price ranges.</p><p>A low cost producer is in a much stronger position to withstand volatility but clearly a high-cost producer, as indicated by the red dotted line, will face severe competitiveness challenges.  In terms of managing volatility a longstanding refrain of Teagasc is that cost control is essential; the data speak for themselves.  The lower cost farms are more resilient.</p><p> It is important that farms try to build up a cash reserve.  In other countries there are mechanisms in place to assist them to do that, in Ireland it has to be done on a voluntary basis.  We are doing that in the Kilkenny greenfield farm.  Those who are familiar with that farm will see how we are dealing with volatility there by building up a cash reserve.  We cannot emphasise enough the importance of cash flow budgets, not only for the farm expense but for the household expenses, particularly in the current year.  The processors can assist by having a significant portion of the milk locked into a contract.  I am speaking here only about price volatility but volatility can arise in other areas also, not least, the weather.</p><p> Dr. Tom O'Dwyer heads up our dairy knowledge transfer programme.  In the current year we are trying to focus on the concept of resilience.  I think of this as the ability of a farm to bounce back in terms of if it gets a shock how prepared it is to recover.  This is where having a low cost base is critically important.  We have held several seminars at the beginning of the year around the country to focus on cash flow management.  Clearly discussion groups are a huge support to farmers in the current situation and for the future.  Farmers learn more from each other than they will ever learn from an external facilitator or adviser - that is no criticism of the adviser.  It is just that people extract much greater value from the examples and experience of their peers.</p><p> We continue to push the idea of the profit monitor.  We think it is essential that as many farms as possible maintain a profit monitor.  We have a number of documents that we consider would be of assistance to farmers in the planning process.  As I have stated, we have had a series of spring seminars around the country, the response to which has been huge.  I attended a number of them.  What came as a surprise to me was the way farmers engage with a simple cash planning exercise.  When simplified, we found a huge engagement at that level.  </p><p> I draw the attention of the committee to a final initiative we are desperately trying to implement in the current year as we see a huge demand for this.  We are being bombarded by farmers who want assistance with expansion, yet there is a staff restriction in place.  Despite that we have put together a creative response.  We are planning to set up a national team that can work with a local adviser to help a farmer draw up a physical plan and a financial plan that could be used to draw down funding from financial institutions.  We are encountering delays with that at the moment because of the shortage of key staff but, hopefully, that will be resolved in the not too distant future.</p><p> In summary, our approach to dairy expansion is that the resilient farm is the farm that will be sustainable in the long run.  In simple terms that is the farm that strives to minimise costs in the system.  We are very conscious of the advice we give in the current circumstances.  I do not know what it is, maybe it is a psychological trait in us all, but there seems to be a drive to expansion before farmers take adequate account of rectifying deficiencies in their farms.</p><p>We have a simple phrase in this context, "better before bigger" but it is a hard message to get across.  It is if the dog has been left off the leash in that farmers just want to tear off out the field.  We recognise that responding to volatility is a relatively new issue for dairy farmers, unlike their counterparts in other enterprises who have had a long-standing battle with price volatility.  We see a role for stakeholders and the industry and have had a number of joint programmes with the dairy co-operatives.  They are a very good way of enabling industry to put together measures and programmes that will support their milk suppliers.  </p><p> I have already outlined the challenges with regard to cash flow.  Cash is king in the farming business and it is a question of trying to manage it.  Finally, the big challenge for us is to try to assist farmers to expand sustainably from an environmental point of view and more particularly, from an income point of view.  We want the young farmer who expands today to still be in business 20 years or 30 years from now and to be able to pass on that farm to the next generation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015031000002#P00300"><p>Regarding the annual report and the figures therein, we see a huge increase in the pension bill because of retirements.  In that context, one could question the return to the State from the early retirement policy.  Pensions account for approximately 22% of costs in Teagasc.  Does Professor Boyle see that growing in the future, in actual cash terms, or has that figure reached its peak?  In other words, will people leaving exceed the numbers coming into the organisation?</p> <p>  My other question is related to this issue.  Professor Boyle said that Teagasc is earning 40% of its income and some of that income comes from purely commercial work.  Can Professor Boyle tell us how much of Teagasc income is derived from work on CAP schemes, including the area-based payments scheme, the agri-environment options scheme, discussion groups and so forth?  In other words, how much is Teagasc dependent on an indirect subsidy from the taxpayers of Europe to fund its operations?  If the CAP were to change in the future, what effect would that have on the income stream for Teagasc?</p> <p>  I have been a consistent opponent of blanket embargoes.  I can never understand the position of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard, which proves that some things never change no matter who is in Government.  Even if Teagasc could hire staff who would pay for themselves, it cannot do so because of the embargo.  That said, if Teagasc is hiring staff who would pay for themselves, it is only fair that the long-term pension contribution be factored in, on an actuarial basis.  That is reasonable but I believe that Teagasc should be allowed to hire staff where there is work to be done.  </p> <p>  I ask Professor Boyle to clarify an issue for me.  D-day for the GLAS scheme is 30 April.  In response to a parliamentary question last week the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine told me that there are over 350 registered GLAS planners.  Apparently 700 have been trained but only 350 have been accredited to date.  Of the 700 who have been trained, how many come under the aegis of Teagasc and how many of the approved GLAS planners are Teagasc planners, either direct or indirect?</p><p>Allowing for other work that Teagasc has to do with regard to area-based payments, young farmer applications and so forth, how many plans does Professor Boyle think each planner will put out per week?  </p><p> I am fascinated by what Professor Boyle had to say about the dairy industry.  He seemed to be telling us that in order for farmers to maintain relative immunity to price volatility, they must keep their costs down.  The big variables are input prices and capital expenditure.  In respect of the latter, he is saying that farmers should not over-borrow.  The efficiency index supplied to the committee shows the top 10% and the bottom 10%.  In that context, does Professor Boyle know whether there are more farmers in the bottom 10% who would be classed as small farmers?  In other words, is there a relativity between farm size and efficiency in terms of cost management?  Are there more big farms in the top 10% of the efficiency index?  That may be the case but it may also be the case that those in the top 10% are much more highly geared, which is a counter balance in the sense that their profit may not be all it is made out to be.  Perhaps the operators at the low end have not borrowed so heavily so what they lose on the swings, they gain on the roundabouts.  Is there a pattern there in terms of younger farmers and older farmers?  If these figures are not readily available, perhaps Professor Boyle will supply them to us at a later date.</p><p> Do we know if the more efficient farmers are those in the older age group who have a lifetime of experience in management or are the younger farmers more efficient?  Do we know anything about age versus efficiency?  I am particularly keen to find out if we know anything about the efficiency, in terms of cost control and output, of the new entrants to dairying.  I have a hunch, which could be proven wrong, that some new entrants might not be very efficient because they do not have the savvy that the old hand would have.  </p><p> We had a very interesting presentation recently on what I would call treadmill farming.  This is the scenario where, as happened in New Zealand and Northern Ireland, production increases but profits do not rise accordingly.  Furthermore, risk is increased because margins are much tighter and if anything goes wrong, the farmer is much more vulnerable.  Does Professor Boyle have any information on that?  </p><p> On sheep research, concern has been expressed that there is only one Teagasc research station working on sheep and none working on hill sheep at all, to my knowledge.  Furthermore, part of the sheep research station has been given over to a demonstration beef farm, funded by a certain meat factory.  Professor Boyle will know that sheep farmers are concerned about that and I ask him to clarify whether it will impact on sheep research.  Does Teagasc have any plans to do research work with hill farmers?  In terms of hill and mountain farmers in the west I believe we need a united brand for black-faced sheep.  They should all be sold under some label like Connemara lamb or similar, regardless of whether the animals come from Donegal, Kerry or elsewhere.  We need a national brand for that type of sheep because each region trying to sell it on its own does not give scale or season.  We must overcome that problem.  Has Teagasc worked with farmers to try to get them to work with their counterparts in other regions?  It is difficult enough to get farmers in different regions to see that if they do not put scale into their marketing they will not have a chance.</p><p> It is better for farmers to do simple accounts, factoring in the 89% of costs and taking a stab at the rest, than for them to be doing no accounts.</p><p>Sometimes it can get so complicated that they just give it up as a bad job.  In the profit monitor, e-accounts and the rest, are there variations to suit different levels of farming and the different levels of educational attainment of the farmers, so even a farmer with a very basic approach can at least keep some type of record of how they are proceeding, particularly in high productive systems such as dairying?</p></speech>

My first question is about the education programme in Teagasc and the colleges.  It might not be relevant to the annual report but every year I encounter a number of students who have applied for grants to Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, rather than to Teagasc for attending college.  They always get caught by SUSI because it does not tell them until the end of the process that they are not covered for Teagasc colleges.  In fairness to Teagasc, it is very good about accepting late applications.  However, perhaps it is something Teagasc could make students aware of at an earlier stage, so they do not take the SUSI route.  Regardless of what one tries to tell SUSI, it waits until the very end until it tells them they are not eligible, and that is usually after the closing date for Teagasc applications.</p> <p>  Regarding dairy pricing, like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v I would be interested to hear about the size of the farms and herds in the bottom 10% and top 10%, in terms of the profitability and so forth.  It is clear from Professor Boyle's presentation that there will be a fair degree of rationalisation within the dairy sector over the next number of years.  Has Teagasc conducted any research into how great that will be?  Looking at the figures, it appears that the bottom 10% and probably the bottom 20% will be squeezed out, because they do not appear to be able to sustain the volatility.</p> <p>  There is a chart showing the total costs, a breakdown of the costs and the profitability.  It shows a total cost of 22.9 cent per litre.  On the next chart there is an average cost of 27.4 cent per litre for 2013.  What accounts for the difference between those two cost figures?  It would make a difference to the viability of farms.</p> <p>  We were given a presentation previously in which it was said that farmers should concentrate on grass-rich production in order to keep costs down in dairying into the future.  I always understood we had grass-rich production.  How much capacity is there to produce more grass to enable costs to be kept down?  The input costs for dairy farmers in the North in terms of feed are approximately four times the costs in the South.  If it will be necessary to produce more feed in order to increase production, that will obviously affect the margin as well.  Is there much spare capacity within the dairy sector to produce more grass to sustain larger numbers of cows on farms?</p></speech>

My first question relates to the goal of encouraging diversification of the rural economy and enhancing the quality of life in rural areas.  Some of Teagasc's personnel were involved in the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report last year.  The sustainability of rural Ireland has become a topical issue in recent months for a number of reasons, although I believe it has been over-hyped to a large extent.  Like me, Professor Boyle was in Belview last week.  Jim Bergin made an interesting point about increased production in the Ballyragget area in Kilkenny.  There are 79 farmers producing milk in that area and he said that the increase in the amount of milk produced in the next number of years would mean that &euro;10 million extra - I am open to correction if that figure is not right - would be pumped into the local economy in that space of time.  That is a huge amount of money.  Is any work being done on how that money will be spread in the local economy or on what can be done to try to encourage more off-farm or outside the farm gate production, or on other issues in that regard?</p><p> This time last year there was a crisis in the beef industry and, rightly or wrongly, Teagasc received a certain amount of criticism for the advice it may or may not have given regarding bull beef.  It was a major topic at the time.  As everybody knows, when prices improve, last year is quickly forgotten.  However, some people do not forget it.  What has Teagasc done in the intervening period to educate people on that issue?  Bull beef was the main issue this time last year, although I realise the debate moved on to the price of steers later, and it was suggested that Teagasc had advised farmers to go that route in the years prior to that.  What is the current position?  Does Teagasc envisage a role for bull beef in the future, or is it doing any work on that area at present?</p><p> There will be huge opportunities and challenges in the dairying industry in the next number of years.  The main point made in Professor Boyle's presentation is that approximately 20 years ago, in 1995, the price of a litre of milk was 27 cent or 28 cent.  Today, he predicts a similar price range.  Unfortunately, however, the price of production has increased by 50% in that 20 years, which is not sustainable on those figures.  In the same period of time we have seen the New Zealand and Northern Ireland experience.  To return to Deputy Pringle's point regarding grass-rich production, from our information and following a recent visit we made to our colleagues in Stormont, when we discussed this issue, it appears that farmers in the North have moved away from grass-rich production and have started to concentrate on extra feeding, which is a huge cost.</p><p> Professor Boyle mentioned education, which is crucial.  At a recent cow sale in Kilkenny, farmers were beating themselves up paying &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 for replacement cows.  There is not much logic in that.  I realise it will be very hard to manage that, but there must be some realism in the market as well.  If people are going to pay that to try to increase numbers, there will be a very sad ending.  There will be many tears.  Somebody will be blamed, and it will not be the person who is spending the money on the day.  It will be somebody else's fault.  How to get around educating farmers on that point is crucial for the future.</p><p> On the New Zealand experience, there has been much talk about how farmers there have increased production by a huge amount in the last 20 years.  They started at the point where we are now and they are now at a multiple of that.  However, the picture is not so rosy there at present.  There are animal welfare issues, and they have not increased their income.  Obviously they have increased their production, but the profit per farm has not increased.  That is a huge issue and we must learn from it.  Is Teagasc referencing New Zealand with a view to putting structures in place to educate and inform our dairy farmers on what challenges might lie ahead by comparing where New Zealand is at present and where we are now as a starting point?</p><p> With regard to dairy farm numbers, when we joined the EU in 1973 there were approximately 166,000 dairy farmers in the country.  At that time it was probably a romantic scene to be pushing the churn out to the edge of the road and so forth.  It has since become an industry and a business.  There are now approximately 18,000 dairy farmers.  Does Teagasc envisage many of those being lost in the rationalisation over the next period of time as the industry tends to get bigger?  Will the so-called inefficient dairy farmers be lost in the process?</p><p> I come back to the general point.  In his presentation Professor Boyle talked about staff numbers.  Will Teagasc get away from the form filling practices which have obviously taken up a lot of time in the case of single farm payments, GLAS, the AEOS, etc.?  Will there be more emphasis on getting into the field and being more research based than on form filling?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015031000002#T00300"><p>I will ask my colleague Dr. O'Dwyer to deal with some of the dairy questions, although there are a few general points to be made.</p> <p>  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked about pensions.  Clearly, pension costs are a big drag on our grant-in-aid, as can be seen from the figures.  The number of pensioners now significantly exceeds the number of staff.  I hope the ratio will not deteriorate too much, but I certainly do not see the balance being reversed in the near future.  Our hope is that we will have stability.  At least, the position is transparent in our case.  There are many agencies and Departments in which the same issue arises.  However, because of our accounting standards we are obliged to calculate the actuarial cost of pensions and the point is well made.</p> <p>  The Deputy also made a good point about the indirect support for Teagasc through various EU schemes.  In recent years this support has decreased substantially because of the disbandment of the REPS which was a massive programme for Teagasc.  It was not that we made a profit as such, but we were enabled to recruit a large number of staff to process the applications and had to recover the full cost, which was a requirement of the scheme.  In recent years, obviously, the removal of the REPS has been a significant factor in the reduction in our staff numbers.</p> <p>  The basic payments scheme continues to be a very important source of activity for us.  While the fees are relatively modest, at &euro;145, for a relatively small income unit, nonetheless it is very significant when it is all added.  Probably 40% of our clients fall into that category.</p> <p>  This raises a point which is related to something Deputy Pat Deering said.  We are looking at this area very closely because, alongside the work on the issue of scheme support, we have a remit to support development on farms.  Farmers are - I will not say willingly - more prepared to pay for something that will benefit them directly such as support in applying for the singe farm payment, now the basic payments scheme, a GLAS payment, etc.  They are slightly more reluctant, although this has changed somewhat, to contribute to membership of a discussion group.  When the dairy expansion scheme was introduced - it was a subsidy for farmers to join discussion groups - we received an increase which lasted for three years.  We retained a significant number of these farms and were pleasantly surprised.  Once farmers joined a discussion group for the first time, they realised there were benefits to be gained over and above the grants they were receiving.  It took a little persuasion, but they stayed in the scheme.</p><p>Over the longer term, farmers appreciate that what we might call development support is of benefit to them in helping them to generate sustainable income.</p><p> Over time, even if we were to stabilise advisory numbers at present levels, we will need to look very carefully at the extent to which we are involved in what might be called scheme-support activity because of the pressure of work, particularly at this time of year and especially in the dairy area.  For the past couple of months, most of our advisers have been tied up with applications for GLAS, single farm payments, the young farmers scheme etc., when I think we all agree they should be out on the farms supporting farmers.  We will see a shift from that type of activity and more towards development.</p><p> The Deputy asked a number of questions about the planners.  I have some answers for him but I do not have all the answers.  I propose that I submit a detailed response on that.  I agree with the Deputy.  Our assessment is also that there are about 450 qualified planners.  Most of them would be in Teagasc, but they are people who are fully engaged in other activities, and that was one of the reasons we did not and could not get directly involved in GLAS planning, as it is called.  That is why we entered into a strategic alliance with FRS.</p><p> FRS has recruited 80 qualified planners.  In our assessment, certainly that is capable of achieving our aim.  As Deputies know, in the first tranche of GLAS 30,000 will be accepted.  We have targeted about 8,000 of our clients and we think we have enough planners to do that.  They are under huge pressure because the deadline is tight; we would like more time.  We anticipated a much longer planning period, as I think everyone did.</p></speech>

I will let Dr. O'Dwyer talk about the dairy side.</p> <p>  I am glad to have the opportunity to address the issue of sheep research, because there has been a lot of misinformation.  The basic point is that the location of the beef farm will have no impact, good, bad or indifferent, on the sheep programme in Athenry.  That land was not Teagasc land.  As members know, it was compulsorily acquired by IDA Ireland, which then rented it back to us.  We are renting it at the moment.  We did not have productive use for that land.  We took the opportunity to locate a commercially run beef farm with the best available research on one site alongside what we think is now a highly successful sheep demonstration farm.  The main point is that there is no encroachment on the capacity of the sheep programme and there never was.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on hill sheep.  We have looked at different ways of delivering our research services.  We have a number of hill sheep farms involved in what we are calling our Better Sheep programme.  These are actual commercial farms on which we are doing highly applied research.</p><p>We believe that this is an adequate way of dealing with and responding to the needs of hill sheep farmers via the better farm programme.</p><p> I completely agree with the Deputy's assertion in respect of branding.  We are involved with the Mayo lamb and Kerry lamb groups to which he referred.  I visited the Kerry lamb project, which has proven really successful and which illustrates the beneficial role Teagasc can play.  The organisation acts as a sort of honest broker in the context of bringing people together and organising them into groups.  There is scope for more of these groups to be established, but it must be noted that a great deal of management and co-operation are required in respect of them.</p><p> I could not agree more with the Deputy in the context of what he said in respect of accounts.  I was trying to make a specific point earlier in the context of our experience with the seminars we hosted just over a month ago.  We produced a one-page cashflow plan for those seminars and it encouraged farmers to engage in a way that surprised me.  We found ourselves reminding the farmers who attended that they have to pay their tax bills and that this should be included in their accounts, as should information relating to any of their children who are attending university or college.  This might seem quite elementary at one level, but it was the first occasion on which people had the opportunity to put it down on paper.  What happened at those seminars was an eye-opener for me and we learned a lesson from the experience.</p><p> I take Deputy Pringle's point about colleges and SUSI.  We bend over backwards to try to accommodate our students.  In view of the massive amount of information with which parents and students must deal, I accept that they can sometimes be misdirected.</p><p> Grass-rich production is obviously a cornerstone of Teagasc's research and advisory programme.  In answer to the specific question that was posed, I must state that there is massive potential in this area.  Unfortunately, however, the challenge lies - I have been hearing this for 40 years - in realising that potential.  We reckon that 15 tonnes of dry matter per hectare can comfortably be produced on most Irish grassland.  On dairy farms the average rate of production is 7 tonnes, but there are some exceptional performers.  The challenge in respect of this matter is massive and it also gives rise to a puzzle.  When I speak to farmers who began with very poor knowledge about how to manage their grasslands, I am surprised by the length of time it takes to develop expertise.  It could take up to two years of intensive effort and participation in discussion groups in order for them to learn a completely different management approach to the use of, for example, concentrate feed.</p><p> I agree with what Deputy Pringle said in respect of Northern Ireland.  The evidence is there but it is sometimes difficult to obtain information from the North of Ireland.  However, we have assembled it and made comparisons.  The competitiveness of the Northern Ireland dairy system is certainly in question on foot of the fact that those involved in it have drifted away from grass.  As a result, there definitely is more capacity.</p><p> I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Deering's assessment.  It is my personal view - I think this is backed up by research - that the driver of rural development must, first and foremost, be agricultural development.  There is no question in my mind in that regard.  Unfortunately, we can sometimes get locked into a discussion about rural development which tends to focus on schemes, and that then defines our approach.  Schemes are very important supplements and complements, but if there is not a vibrant agricultural sector supported by upstream and downstream sectors, then it is difficult to identify from where the injection of economic activity is going to come.  That is one message which emanated from the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA.  We know from our research that it is vital to have the necessary infrastructure in place.  The road network has been improved substantially and this has made a major difference in the context of transport costs, access to urban areas, etc.  Obviously, broadband is a big issue - and increasingly so - in many parts of the country.</p><p> On the beef industry, our position on bull beef is consistent.  We have carried out research and the results we obtained are very clear.  The slaughter of very young bulls, which was an issue in the middle of the crisis, just does not pay off financially.</p><p>That was our finding and we presented it to the committee some time ago.</p><p> As far as I am concerned, all of our analysis stands up to scrutiny.  There are some exceptional beef farmers who can produce bulls which can be slaughtered at a very young age, namely, 15 or 16 months.  The producers in question really are exceptional and they prove the rule, which is that the extra period on grass is required in order to make production economic.  As the Deputy noted, however, everything has changed in light of the situation with regard to price and we have moved on.  We have consistently informed farmers that they need to discuss the type of animals they are producing with their local factories and, ideally, they need to obtain contracts.  There is an issue in respect of consumer acceptance and we are doing a great deal of work in respect of this.  Again, our evidence indicates that there is no great differentiation on the part of consumers in respect of very young bulls and those which are 22 months or older.  Perception is everything in the marketplace.  We have been informed that the real issue relates not to taste but rather to the size of the cut.  As far as the economics are concerned the message is very clear: with grass systems - which are the most sustainable from an environmental and economic point of view - it is very difficult for most farmers, even those who are really good at what they do, to produce bulls efficiently at anything less than 22 months or so.</p><p> I already dealt with the issue of form-filling and I reiterate my view to the effect that the position in this regard is going to change.  In the context of the New Zealand experience, the one thing a person learns in the context of agriculture is that averages are very deceiving.  I have only just returned from New Zealand and I can state that there is a great deal happening within the average in question.  For example, there are some exceptional performers and there are some very poor ones.  There is no doubt that the poor performers have got into serious debt.  The south island of New Zealand is very similar to Ireland.  The winters there are somewhat harsher and many farmers are obliged to house animals during the relevant months.  My observation of the position in New Zealand is that people are depending a great deal on the continued appreciation of land in order to justify their investments.  From recent experience in other areas, we are all aware of the difficulties to which this kind of approach can give rise.  If I was in their shoes, I would really be worried about the over-dependence on land values.  As is the position here, one must unpick the average.  Debt is certainly a major issue.</p></speech>

I refer to the recruitment embargo and Teagasc's ability, or lack thereof, to hire staff who can pay for themselves.</p></speech>

A couple of difficulties arise and it is a question of trying to unravel from where the objection is emanating.  It is certainly possible to build in an actuarial cost of pensions and identify a proper cost in respect of recruiting an adviser.  There is no question that this can be done.  If there are then non-Exchequer finances available either from farmer fees, the proceeds of agribusiness or whatever, I see no logical reason why staff could not be recruited.  We live in hope.  I am very positive with regard to the so-called new expenditure cap and when the detail relating to this is worked out, then recruitment may be possible.</p> <p>  There are probably other reasons for that which we are discussing and some of them relate to a legitimate discussion regarding the nature of the work we do.  I refer, in particular, to scheme work and the legitimate question which arises as to whether this could be done by a non-public agency.  That may partly explain the position which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has adopted.  The other reason relates to the significant issues that have arisen in the context of employment law with regard to contracts of indefinite duration and so forth.</p><p>I presume the committee is familiar with this also.  People who are taken on on a contract basis can establish and have established employment rights.  It is very difficult to restrict the employment contract satisfactorily.  In other words, there are perceived risks in the recruitment of staff, which I can understand, and it is our job to try to work around them and try to explain where we are coming from.</p></speech>

Let us take the same rankings as on the chart - the top 10% and the bottom 10%.  The average herd size was 101 dairy cows.  Those in the top 10% in terms of efficiency had 103 cows, while those in the bottom 10% tended to have a smaller herd size of 81 cows.  These figures suggest that those in the more efficient cohort do not have herd sizes any bigger than the overall average, while those who are less efficient tend to have a slightly smaller herd size.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's question on gearing, the figures I have with me are for interest payments and depreciation.  If one takes the level of interest as being reflective of the level of borrowing and the level of depreciation as being reflective of the level of on-farm investment, the average interest figure is 0.7 cent per litre.  The figure for those in the top 10% is 0.4 cent, while the figure for those in the bottom 10% is 1.1 cent.  The farmers in the highest cost category, namely, those in the bottom 10%, tend to have higher interest costs, which suggests they have higher borrowings.  They also tend to have higher depreciation costs, which suggests they have higher on-farm investments.  Perhaps this is the reason they are in the higher cost category.</p> <p>  Without looking at the figures, we know from dealing with farmers that the cycle on farms tends to be rather clunky.  One can have a large on-farm investment of perhaps &euro;200,000 and then very little of a sizeable nature in the next ten to 15 years.  In that period the costs of production will be diluted as cow numbers and production are ramped up and the farmer literally sweats the assets.  Those in the lower cost category tend to have lower borrowings and lower depreciation costs.</p> <p>  I do not have any information in response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on younger versus older farmers.  In terms of cost efficiency and the output of new entrants, it is a recognised fact that new or start-up dairy farms on greenfield sites are less efficient in the initial two to three years, or even four years, of production.  This is the case for a number of reasons.  One has a younger herd.  One could have all heifers in the herd and they produce less than a mature herd.  One could have brought together animals from different sources which could give rise to animal health issues.  Another issue is the management experience of the farmer concerned; experience is built over a number of years.</p> <p>  To counterbalance this, what we are finding in engaging with some of the newer entrants and through research conducted by colleagues is that new entrant dairy farmers bring no baggage to the table.  They are like a blank canvas.  They come to Teagasc or talk to other consultants to get the best advice available.  They talk to our advisers and researchers to get the latest research and best advice available and implement it.  It is like teaching an old dog new tricks.  Many of the new entrants want to learn and do it right.  They avail of the latest technologies in breeding, grassland management and cost control.  In time they will be very efficient, but the initial two to three years can be very daunting and challenging.</p> <p>  In response to the question on treadmill farming, as the director mentioned on the summary slide, we absolutely recommend "better before bigger" and "skill before scale".  Despite what might be said to the contrary, we are not promoting having more cows at all costs.</p><p>A large cohort of farmers have no place thinking about increased cow numbers.  They can produce more milk from existing resources, in other words, the same number of cows and the same level of investment by being more efficient.  This is a message that is hard to sell at times, but that is our position.</p><p> The director commented on having simpler accounts.  I will add that every farmer must complete financial accounts for taxation purposes.  In our toolbox of financial supports for dairy and other farms we have a very simple one-page manually completed work sheet for the analysis of farm accounts, with as simple a measure as the percentage contribution of premia to net profit.  In addition, there is a profit per hectare measure and a calculation of cashflow.  We encourage our advisers to use this in a situation where a profit monitor is not being completed.</p><p> To move on to the questions asked Deputy Thomas Pringle, I have addressed the question on the top and bottom 10%.  On whether smaller farmers will be squeezed out owing to rationalisation, we will see a reduction in dairy farmer numbers, from the current level of 18,000 to approximately 16,000 in the next five years or so.  Interestingly, the number exiting dairying has been matched by the number of new entrants in recent years, with the result that the overall number of dairy farmers each year has, on average, largely remained unchanged in the past three to four years.  What might happen is that we might redefine what is a smaller farmer.  He or she may be someone with 30 to 40 cows, whereas in the past he or she had ten to 20 cows.  That is one thing I could see happen because average herd size is going to increase, from approximately 65 to approximately 85 cows.  </p><p> The other thing that will happen is that smaller farmers will not be able to generate an adequate income from dairy farming alone.  Therefore, they may have to look at supplementing their income to a greater extent through off-farm employment.  They can still remain dairy farmers, something we should not forget.</p><p> I am not clear on the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the figure of 27.4 cent a litre.  Perhaps he might provide clarification for me.  His question on grass rich versus grass-poor dairying ties in with the questions on New Zealand asked by Deputy Pat Deering on whether we are referencing New Zealand in informing and advising.  The research conducted by a colleague on grass-rich versus grass-poor systems was certainly informed by experience in New Zealand.  What has happened there in the past five to seven years is that there has been a loss of focus; certainly there has been a drift from a situation where farmers were very much focused on grass-rich systems towards grass-poor systems.  An increasing percentage of dairy farmers are now involved in grass-rich milk productions systems.  When we engaged in that piece of analysis in Ireland, we were able to show that there was a greater likelihood that farmers who were following a grass-rich milk production system with a greater reliance on grass for a greater proportion of a cow&rsquo;s diet would have a margin of &euro;2,000 per hectare or more.  There is absolutely more scope for increasing the amount of grass in a cow&rsquo;s diet.  One starts by growing more grass and the key to increased growth is improved soil fertility.  Approximately 12% of soils farmed by dairy farmers is at optimum soil fertility levels.  That will present a real challenge for the advisory service, advisers and farmers in the coming years.</p><p> I will move on to questions asked by Deputy Pat Deering on the spread of additional revenue in the local economy.  To add to what the director said, that money is spent on additional services to support dairy farmers.</p><p>There are contractors, input suppliers, AI services, accountants and all the support services that are needed to service a functioning dairy farm.  Obviously there will be increased employment, both on-farm and off-farm, as milk production increases.  On-farm there will be additional milkers, additional farm managers and so on, and off-farm there will be the likes of farm relief services, milk transport, and other examples such as that.</p><p> On how we go about educating farmers about the perils of dairy expansion, one could say it is interwoven through all our advisory activities, starting from our media and open days, which are aimed at the large mass audience, down to our group activities - as the director said, we have approximately 6,000 dairy farmers in our dairy discussion groups - and then down to one-to-one activities with farmers such as planning and cost analysis.</p></speech>

About two years ago members of this committee attended the Green Week in Berlin and one of the stands that impressed me a great deal was about scientific advances that had been made in improving yield.  Is Ireland at the cutting edge of that technology that ensures that we have the maximum yield from dairy herds, particularly in light of the ending of quotas?  Is there any indication what impact the projected increase of 330,000 in the national dairy herd might have on Ireland's carbon footprint and on climate change?</p> <p>  There were extensive articles in today's newspapers about pricing, and one of the references that struck me was that there was no transparency in the deals struck with the processors and the supermarket multiples.  Teagasc has suggested a price of 27.5 cent per litre but the articles refer to prices of 33 cent per litre, which farmers indicated resulted in only about 2 cent profit per litre.  The price of non-branded liquid milk, which costs around 73 cent or 74 cent if one buys it in Superquinn or Tesco, was compared with branded milk, which costs &euro;1.24 per litre.  This is where the question was raised about lack of transparency.  The articles said it was a closely guarded secret.  In my opinion there is no transparency.  What are the witnesses' views on this?  Do they have any input into this?  Surely there should be transparency.</p> <p>  One thing that keeps recurring is farmers saying they do not get a fair price for what they produce.  I understand that only something like 8.4% of the total milk production in this country is liquid milk.  Is there a fear that because of the expansion of dairy processing as a result of the ending of quotas and the emphasis on infant milk formula and non-liquid milk processing, we may find ourselves somewhat similar to Europe where UHT is used more than fresh milk?  I think this would be a disaster and I do not think the consumer would take kindly to it.  They are the sort of general issues and I am curious to know whether the witnesses have a view on them.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations and answers so far.  I congratulate Professor Boyle and Dr. O'Dwyer on their involvement in the Food Works programme, which is in its third year.  It is a fantastic programme for brilliant young entrepreneurs who want to be innovative and come up with international businesses that can trade food.  Teagasc has been involved with it for three years.</p><p>I want to build on the other questions so excuse me if I am a bit rough and just going in at the edges.  There was a quite startling article in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>a few weeks ago about robotics, automation, planning and processing which suggested that robotics will replace 35% of jobs, especially those that are repetitive.  Taking dairy farming as an example, milking will become automated.  How are we going on that and how are we looking at it, particularly with regard to dairy farming?  Even doing accounts may become automated.</p><p> I worry about the staff shortages in Teagasc.  Enrolments are up 154%.  Since 2000 the number of staff at Teagasc has fallen by 42%.  How can Teagasc strategise and prepare for the future and the challenges that are ahead of it if we do not lift the embargo on recruitment?  The value of Kinsealy must be huge; that might help to hire a few new staff that are badly needed, because there has been a brain drain at Teagasc and it needs to get in some brilliant people to help it look to the future.   </p><p> This is a strange question - it is coming out of left field - but I know Teagasc has a test going in Carlow on GMOs.  Peru, I am glad to see, has provided in law to keep GMOs out.  Ireland is a small island.  We have to dare to be different.  The Origin Green programme is wonderful.  Climate change is upon us.  Though I will not be here for the witnesses' answers, I will be looking back on them later.  Has Teagasc ever undertaken a proper scientific test on water quality and fluoride?  We are the only country left in Europe that fluoridates its water.  I know most farming people have wells, but many farms do not.  As we are the only country left in Europe that has fluoride in its water, what effects does that have on our agriculture?  Are we doing tests on our food?  What are the levels of fluoride in our cheese, milk and other dairy products?</p><p>  How closely does Teagasc work with the EPA?  I am reluctant to pick names but I will pick one that I am close to, the aluminium plant in Askeaton.  Are emissions and air quality being monitored?  How closely do Teagasc scientists work with the EPA?</p><p>  I could go on but I think that is enough from Senator O'Brien for today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.45" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015031000002#AA00300"><p>I thank the Chair and welcome the witnesses.  It is always good to discuss the future of agriculture rather than look back.  I think it is noteworthy that a whole generation lost out because of the milk quota that was introduced in 1983, me being one of them.  I grew up on a dairy farm where expansion was not possible.</p> <p>   The witnesses mentioned a few things and I will rattle through them very quickly.  The debt on farms has been low to date and the witnesses have said this is essential going ahead.  I agree but I do not like the surge in debt.  Sweating the asset has been mentioned.  That is a very funny way for a business to chug ahead, because it exposes it to cashflow difficulties at certain times and it is the very time that a business is under pressure that the market works against it.  I think we should be looking at sustainable investment.  </p> <p>   Basic financial management has been mentioned and farmers should be made aware of it, if nothing else.  I feel that Teagasc has a role in this.  So has the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  E-monitors are important, certainly, but so is sage management and issuing invoices.  Farmers essentially produce milk, and they are excellent at doing so, but they never write an invoice.  We need to move towards a situation in which they understand how to do this and treat it as a business.  Also, farmers tend to do their book work at night.  They tend to try to do it with their wives or whoever is there.  It is done haphazardly.  If farmers were asked to do book work in the busy calving season they would say, "Don't be annoying me."  Businesses cannot work that way.  I suggest that we try to get the message out that farmers need to start employing people who sit in front of a computer and do it properly.  I know in my case I could not face a computer so we got somebody to do it.  When one looks at the cost of those personnel - I will just pick a figure of &euro;12 per hour - that would be well offset by the fines that would be paid out if there was an audit.  That needs to be made clear.  There are huge resources of labour in the countryside.  Many people who are rearing families are free from 10 a.m to 3 p.m.  They will work part time and they are fantastic.  They will get the work done consistently.  We are not getting that out there.</p><p>I will not dwell too long on it.  The milk price shown here is 39 cent per litre, giving a net profit of 16.4 cent, with the top 10% earning milk prices of 40.8 cent , a net profit of 23 cent.  There is not a huge difference in the price they get for milk - which is surprising, because I thought with the butterfats and proteins there would be - but there is a huge difference in their profit.  I am not sure what year this pertains to; is it 2014?</p></speech>

I can tell Dr. O'Dwyer - Deputy Deering mentioned this earlier - that there is a lot of paying off for in-calf heifers of &euro;2,500 with a net profit of 5.1 cent per litre.  One could get to the fifth lactation before one would see anything.  I got out of milk in 1991 - one could guess my age based on that - but it was essentially &pound;1 per gallon at the time, which was the equivalent of 28 cent per litre.  To think we are talking about that same price 24 years later is quite scary.  While I am absolutely for increased production and am absolutely for driving on, we need to be sure we are doing it on a sound economic footing.  I wonder if that is being spelled out strongly enough in our agricultural colleges.  I really believe that youth is a great asset, but it needs to come with a health warning.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Dwyer mentioned increases in dairying, but where is the land going to come from?  I sure as heck will not start milking cows; I could not even try.  Mind you, if tillage keeps going the way it is going, it might be difficult.  I wonder whether it is going to come from beef, from tillage or from land that is currently idle.  There is not much of that around.  The interest costs for people investing were mentioned.  A cent per litre is quite high.  Is Teagasc encouraging forward selling and is it doing enough to teach people the basics of soil science?  I have an opinion about soil science; I believe it is the start of it all.  If the basics and the soil are not correct, one is on a hiding to nothing.  There are many people who walk out on the land and are not able to identify a weed or proper pasture, or who do not know the basis of the soil their grass is growing on.  It is quite frightening to hear that only two thirds of soil in Ireland is at optimum capacity.  It is no wonder some farmers are getting 15 tonnes of grass per hectare and some are only getting seven.  How can one expand if one is on eight or nine tonnes per hectare?  It makes no sense.</p> <p>   I agree with the witnesses that rural development should not be driven by schemes.  I believe many of the schemes exist to flatten out the curve of production costs.  In the past there was a gallop to collect every bit of money we could in schemes, including the beet payments, which got rid of the sugar industry.  We saw where that left us.  Averages are misleading.  There was an AIB farm representative one time who had a great saying, even though it was slightly rude: "If your head was in the fridge and your tail end was in the fire, the average would be good, but it would not be a great place to be."  Averages should be given with another health warning.  </p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned land in New Zealand and appreciation of the land, but this shows that the funding is probably not coming from the right area.  It is not coming from farm families; it is probably coming from the larger industry.  Could he elaborate more on diversification, an area I am very interested in, in that smaller farms will probably need to diversify while they keep farming?  In the last budget, income averaging was increased to five years, but this also incorporated off-farm income, which is very important here.  What cow numbers would Dr. O'Dwyer suggest are needed to be lucky at that?  Would it be 80 or 100 cows?  I know it is all variable on price, but from a strictly financial point of view, it strikes me that a price of 40 cent per litre, even though it might sound large, is what this country needs to facilitate sustainable investment and allow monies to be put aside for reinvestment.  The cost of production is increasing hugely, which is a worry.  While we saw Saudi oil prices drop this year, the cost of fertiliser increased.  For sustainability in this industry, what is the ideal herd size?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentation, which was very informative with a lot of work done on it.  Back at home we work very closely with Teagasc and I am involved in discussion groups.  An issue which comes up quite a lot at the moment is places for education.  It is a great incentive for young farmers.  Will we be able to deliver the necessary courses for them for the green cert? I believe there were 175 applications for 39 or 40 places in Sligo-Leitrim.  I know it came up at the launch in Bundoran that Teagasc was looking for more staff or resources to do that.  I want to agree with the whole GLAS application issue, which looks as though it was very short and will have to be extended.  It is something we will work on.</p></speech>

I will not repeat many of the points in the questions I was going to ask.  It was mentioned in the presentation that a key point for farmers is the necessity to build up a cash reserve and that other countries have methods of dealing with this while in Ireland it is voluntary.  When other countries are referred to, does that mean subsidies?  How do other countries do it?  What options are open to us? I believe it is possible in the US to have insurance against price volatility.  Is that something the witnesses see us being able to do here?  How could we go about that?</p> <p>  The point about staff in Teagasc is taken on board.  I was going to raise my concerns about the basic payment scheme, but as the Chairman said, we are probably going to work on this as a committee and follow up on it ourselves, so I take that as noted.</p> <p>  On the diversification of the rural economy and enhanced quality of life in rural Ireland, are there any links between Teagasc and the Leader programme as it is rolled out?  While it is all well and good to have aspirations, and I completely agree that agriculture is going to have to be the key driver of regeneration in rural Ireland, if much is to be done then money is key.  Does Teagasc have any interaction with Leader?  If it does not, could it access funding through the Leader programme?  In what areas does Teagasc see that money could be spent to enhance its goal?</p> <p>   In the overall context of discussing the dairy industry, concerns were raised last year about the beef herd being a subset or spin-off of our dairy herd as opposed to being an entity in its own right.  There are concerns that this could happen with further dairy expansion.  Could the committee hear the witnesses' views on that and how best to avoid that happening?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015031000002#CC00600"><p>I will try to deal with the variety of questions raised.  I propose to go through them and my colleague will supplement any of my answers if he needs to and if I commit any errors, omissions or otherwise.</p> <p>  On Senator Mooney's first question regarding yields, some of the most spectacular and substantial developments in research over recent years have been on the dairy side in genetic gain and better management.  We had a fertility issue in the dairy herd and that is now pretty much resolved at this stage.  We have benefited in terms of yield, in the broad sense of the term, over recent years and that has been well quantified.  We reckon that with the genetic research alone, with ourselves and the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation working closely together, there has been a cost-benefit ratio of about 8:1.  It is a very good story.</p> <p>  The Senator raised a very important question for public policy regarding the implication of climate change, and Teagasc is projecting an additional 330,000 cows.</p><p>There are two dimensions to the production of emissions.  On the one hand, there is the level of emissions produced per cow and then there are the number of cows.  On the first indicator, the level of emissions produced per cow, we have made substantial improvements in Ireland in recent years in driving down the level of emissions or, more particularly, in terms of per kilogram of milk output.  That has come about as a result of considerable research.  Virtually every improvement in efficiency on farms, and we can take any indicator, be it a fertility indicator, the grazing season or whatever it may be, leads to an improvement in a reduction in the level of emissions per kilogram of output, and that is a positive.</p><p> The other side of that is that if we increase the numbers, there is a balancing act.  We would argue and have consistently argued, and there is beginning to be a shift in international opinion in this area, that the target for agriculture of a blanket cap on emissions is a very simplistic target and that the focus should be on the emissions produced per kilogram of product because that only focuses on the most efficient location in which to produce milk, beef or whatever.  We could be very successful in Ireland or in Europe, even though we are very small, in capping emissions through very draconian measures, but that would only lead to an increase in emissions elsewhere.  We hold to that point of view.  However, the fact of the matter is that the policy is the policy.  The Deputy is right in that respect.  The increase in the number of cows, adjusting for any reduction in emissions per unit of milk produced, will of itself lead to more emissions, although not many more because there is a balancing act within that equation.</p><p> This relates to the question that Deputy Heydon raised about the trade-off with the beef herd.  There is no doubt in our view that the beef herd will be reduced.  The extent of that is difficult to say, but there will be a trade-off there for the simple reason that many dairy farmers under the quota regime with additional land had suckler cows, and those suckler cows obviously are not as valuable post-quota.  We will see a shift there and that will be a balancing act, but it raises issues Deputy Heydon has highlighted about the implications for the beef sector.</p><p> I note the Deputy's point about the transparency of the price of milk.  We would all agree that the price of milk is more transparently determined, if unsatisfactory from a farming point of view at times, than is the beef price or the price of meat.  That is not an answer, but it is a fact none the less simply because, by and large, we have a co-operative structure.  The Deputy raised an interesting point about liquid milk and I had not thought about it before.  Clearly, the economics of producing liquid milk and the labour involved in its production with all-year round calving are very difficult and challenging.  We have made some significant inroads in terms of the economics with our research farm in Johnstown Castle, where we have a liquid milk farm and we employ the same principles in relation to grass utilisation, which would not be the traditional way to produce liquid milk, and certainly the economics are far better there.  However, the Deputy raised an interesting question about the potential shortage of fresh milk.  I agree with him that this would not be a satisfactory situation.</p><p> I appreciate Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's acknowledgement of the food works programme.  We work very closely with Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia, and some very successful companies have been established on foot of that initiative.  She raised an interesting question about the development of robotics in agriculture.  We are doing a certain amount of work on that, most notably in the Kilworth farm and the Dairygold farm near Moorepark where we have an autograss milk product.  I do not know if many members have visited that farm but it has an automatic milk system within a grazing system which is unusual.  Most of the automatic milking systems are within grain-fed systems.  There is no doubt that there will be greater use of robotics.  Robotics is probably too narrow a way of framing what the future will look like.  The agricultural sector will increasingly use advances in other areas.</p><p>We have linked up in a very interesting alliance with the Tyndall National Institute in University College Cork, which is the national micro-electronics institute, and it is producing some fascinating electronic devices, for example, to improve the efficacy of disease management and so forth.  The developments in this area are amazing.  It has come to us and said that it thinks agriculture is ripe for the development of some of these devices and we are working closely with it.  There are some fascinating areas involved and only time will tell how such developments progress.  Sometimes we find that these developments often suggest a more positive future than is realised in practice, but none the less we think there are opportunities.  There are a couple of very interesting areas.  For example, most recently we have been involved with a small, innovative company in Moorepark in investigating a grass measurement device, which is a very impressive kit.  It allows the farmer to measure grass using a plate meter, transmit that information via Bluetooth to a mobile phone, and the farmer can calculate grass wedge and so on.  That is the future direction in this area.  My experience from a recent visit to New Zealand is that we are not too far off from being able to apply yield mapping to pastureland, and that has certainly been beneficial in the cereals area.  It would be hugely beneficial in pasture production because we could reduce, for instance, the cost of fertilisers.</p><p> A related area has already emerged.  I am sure members have heard of the phrase "big data", and the idea is that a great deal of information is being assembled because we are measuring so many things, cow movements and so on via transponders from which we can infer useful information.  That is all part of this mix.  It is all linked into the development of various devices, and certainly there is potential in this area.</p><p> On the staffing issue, I wish to make a point about the embargo.  Notwithstanding the embargo, we obtained sanction to allow us to make mission-critical appointments, and I acknowledge that.  That were very important, particularly in very difficult situations. </p><p> The education service in Teagasc was mentioned.  There are always some year-to-year problems and people do not always get the course or the college they seek, but we are committed, and are supported by Government in this, to accepting every qualified student.  We would view it as a failure if we were not able to do that, and that is our commitment in the context of the young farmers scheme.</p><p> As members will know, the deadline has been extended for farmers to qualify for top-up payments in terms of the completion of their programme.  I advise Senator Comiskey that we are confident we will be able to cope with the demand over the period available to us, and we have been supported in this regard.</p><p> Senator Mary Ann O'Brien raised the issue about the GMO trial in Oak Park.  This has been a controversial programme because we have a very small plot.  We had 27 potato plants in the first year and it is part of an EU-wide project.  We have no bias in this respect except to provide information.  I always make the point that the best defence in situations where there is uncertainty is information.  That is where we are coming from on this.  The purpose of this project, as has been demonstrated, is to address the issue of late onset blight and to examine the ecological implications of planting crops.  This is not a transgenic experiment where a gene is transposed from a wild plant that has resistance to late onset blight.  This is a debate we have had to have.</p><p>I refer to the debate on the amount of chemicals used to deal with this problem - I cannot think of the number just now, but several repeated applications are required to deal with the challenge.  We have to look very seriously at what, effectively, is a more environmentally friendly alternative.  This is a modest project and, as a research organisation, Teagasc is of the view that we have do some work in this area.  We are not doing any work on fluoride and water quality.  We have a close relationship with the Environmental Protection Agency, which is a very important agency with regard to the agricultural sector.  Teagasc works very closely with the EPA.  We have our perspective and they have theirs.  Our interest is to protect commercial agriculture while adhering to required standards.  For example, the EPA provided substantial funding for the soil survey, of which Teagasc is very appreciative.  That survey is very valuable from the EPA's perspective and it is hugely valuable from our perspective.  That is an example of how we can work together in the interests of the sector.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Barry's comments about debt and what he termed the surge debt, which is a very good description.  He reiterated the importance of both cashflow and financial management generally.  He put his finger on the biggest challenge for Irish agriculture; it is really not so much a technical challenge as a business challenge.  The challenge is that farming needs to be treated as a business.  I have been fortunate to have visited New Zealand, and the message I have come back with is not the scale - which is impressive - nor the technical capability, but the fact New Zealand dairy farmers talk business.  A relative of mine from New Zealand visited Ireland and when he was talking to his Irish relatives one would think they were talking about a different industry.  My New Zealand relative was asking the Irish dairy producer about his return in equity, but it was a dialogue of the deaf.  That is the key difference.  I agree with the comments on book work.  I refer to Deputy Barry's point about employing people to do financial analysis.  Farmers are required to do a lot of things related to scheme obligations, for example.  They do what they are required to do.  They will carry out a soil analysis as part of REPS or AOS.  However, they do not then use that soil analysis in their purchasing decisions.  In my view - and this is a terrible but useful phrase - they do not take ownership of the information.  There is no problem in a person getting someone else to do certain work because that might be more efficient, but it is most important that one use that information, interpret it and be on top of it.  The farmer may not have produced the information, but he should be on top of it and he should use it to improve his income situation.</p><p> Deputy Barry made a very important point, which was relevant also to an earlier question from Deputy Pringle about the 24.4 cent price for milk.  It is contained in a table we have supplied.  That figure is from the national farm survey and it is a more representative sample.  Naturally, one would expect a higher cost of production from a national sample.  The farmers who come into the profit monitor are probably better farmers to begin with or they would not be doing the profit monitor.  Teagasc has been criticised, and with some validity.  It is important to note that the cost of heifer rearing must be added to the total cost figure.  We reckon this could be anywhere around 4 cent per litre, which is a substantial cost.  Other costs should be included.  For example, we have not included a cost for family labour, and this could mean the addition of another 5 or 6 cent.</p><p> I refer to another aspect of New Zealand agriculture.  When a New Zealand dairy farmer talks about production costs, it is always a fully comprehensive measure of cost, whereas in Ireland - this is something we may need to discontinue - we have the tradition of excluding certain items that would never be excluded in the New Zealand context, where land costs would be included in the total.</p><p>I refer to our greenfield site farm in Kilkenny which is an example of where all the costs are explicit.  Heifer rearing is included because we have contract rearing of heifers so it is an explicit cash cost.  The labour and land costs are also included.  It is a much more rounded measure of cost which is what is important, particularly in a difficult circumstance.</p><p> I agree completely on the point about soil science which is the foundation of all agricultural knowledge.  The figure quoted here is quite alarming.  Dr. Tom O'Dwyer quoted 14% of soil samples as being optimal.</p></speech>

I was making this point elsewhere.  I refer to the period of economic expansion in 1958 when soil fertility was emphasised.  It is ironic that nearly 60 years later, we have an issue.  I remember at another meeting with this committee when a Deputy asked me about the sea sand subsidy and it brought back memories of the early 1960s.  The view in Teagasc is that soil fertility has to be a major plank of the new Food Harvest 2025 because it is a basic requirement.  There has been a slippage in recent years.  I take the points raised about land availability.  It is the old conundrum and it goes back to farming not been seen as a business.  I am very hopeful that the innovative changes in the budget will reap rewards in time.  It may take a few years for that message to get across but I am hopeful.</p> <p>  Deputy Heydon raised the issue of the management of hedging.  Insurance schemes are available internationally, some of which are private schemes and many are State-subsidised.  There is a significant risk attached because, invariably, the State ends up carrying the can.  I refer to problems of moral hazard, for example, from my reading of these schemes.  It would have to be an EU-wide scheme rather than just in Ireland or else the scheme would be bankrupt very quickly.  The idea of a farmer voluntarily holding case reserves is an inefficient response to the issue.</p> <p>  Deputy Heydon referred to the Leader schemes.  Teagasc has very extensive relationships with Leader.  We operate through Leader via our options programme by which Teagasc can sit down with a farm family and discuss their options for the future.  Some of those options might well involve the development of an on-farm, off-farm business.  Having clarified a family's options and looked at the opportunities, we would then pass them on to Leader as one of the key funding agencies.  I wish our relationship with Leader were closer and I have argued for that but it is, none the less, very close.  Many of our advisers and regional managers are members of Leader boards around the country and I actively encourage that participation.  For example, Teagasc was heavily involved in the CEDRA programme along with all those agencies.  We try to play the role of honest broker.  We have almost daily contact with 40,000 farmers which is a substantial pool and therefore we are a resource which Leader can use.  </p> <p>  I take the points made about the beef sector.  There is a need for a debate on the significant issues in that sector.  I refer to the numerical relationship and that the reduction in beef numbers may be a consequence of an expansion in dairying.  The nature of the cow is another issue that farmers have brought to my attention.  They ask what is going to happen to the beef industry if there is a greater expansion in cross-bred animals.  That is a legitimate point of view which will feature in the Food Harvest 2025 debate.  We are very hopeful that research could nuance that relationship between beef and dairy, particularly with regard to sex semen and managing the progeny, the production of male and female animals.</p><p> I hope I have dealt with all of the questions raised.</p></speech>

I probably did not explain myself properly, but I was trying to get across a concept on which Professor Boyle had put his finger, namely, the value of a farmer running a business as a policy maker.  Farmers might look at all of the facts, be they financial or based on analysis, and make a decision on them.  Many farmers want to engage in the raw digging and data analysis, but by the time they have all of this done, they do not have time to sit down and consider their business as a whole.  They are incredibly good at working out financial matters in their heads, but I do not feel the bookkeeping is being done properly.  Many years ago a good friend of mine who was farming said to me that the first figure he put into the accounts was what he wanted to earn.  One must pay to put the kids through college and for everything else.  When I see a reference to the exclusion of farm family labour, it makes me upset because it is not reflective of the basis of a sustainable industry.  The figure in question should be taken out and the raw data seen.  Does it include the cost of heifer rearing?</p></speech>

I would love to see the data with everything included.  If we had them, we would have a true reflection of the industry.  The figure in my head, 40 cent per litre, is more reflective of where we need to be.  I know that we are price takers in many respects, but I would hate to feel we are encouraging people to enter the industry, expand too rapidly and take on debt - a big issue - using false promises.  It would be very easy for someone to read the documents and say the costs listed were the actual costs and bank on them.  We need to be realistic if we are to proceed sustainably.</p></speech>

That is a variable feast.  </p> <p>  With regard to heifer rearing, we have the heifer enterprise recorded separately.  I gave the Deputy the estimates.  One could certainly add another 10 cent to the cost, on average, for heifer rearing and family labour.  It is a ballpark estimate.</p></speech>

I drew attention to it because it was an important point.  Many of our discussions are not about total costs, as we have defined them, but often about variable costs.</p></speech>

The reason we present the costs in the way we do is the mix of enterprises on dairy farms varies.  Some dairy farmers might have a tillage enterprise alongside a dairy enterprise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015031000002#HH00900"><p>That might make the figures worse.</p></speech>

We look at the dairy aspect on its own, the tillage aspect on its own, etc.</p> <p>  On the cost of heifer rearing, we have an imputed cost as part of the output, but it is not reflected as a cost.  However, it is included in the output, which means that the profit figure has been adjusted.</p> <p>  I wish to pick up on one or two other points made by Deputy Tom Barry.  With regard to sustainable investment, I totally agree with his observations.  We are absolutely clear in the message we are providing for dairy farmers on prioritising investment.  There is a scarce amount of money to be invested and it must be invested where they will obtain the greatest return such as in increasing soil fertility and grazing infrastructure.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to surge debt.  I had not heard that term before and would say it is one I will be using.  Equally as challenging as the set of circumstances in which a farmer decides to take on the investment out of cash flow is where he or she decides to expand following a good milk price year, such as 2013 and 2014.  He or she might decide to keep extra heifers or extra cows and build a milking parlour.  If, however, he or she was to suddenly face a year with a poor milk price, he or she would have no cash reserves and would not have gone to the bank to borrow.  What would be his or her chances of recapitalising the investment to try to get over the issue?  In some ways, farmers who go to the bank and secure funding on the basis of their having put together a strong business plan and who might have a large debt are more robust because they finance their investment property.  This might be worth considering.</p><p> I totally agree with the Deputy's comment on the notion of employing a bookkeeper.  I fully support this, particularly considering the scale of turnover of some of the larger dairy farmers.  In rural towns there are small businesses, including hairdressers, grocers and plumbers, that employ bookkeepers and the turnover of which is lower than that of some larger dairy farms.  It is absolutely mind-boggling.  There are businesses such as IFAC offering the service.  I firmly believe there is a role for part-time bookkeepers, as the Deputy outlined.</p><p> On the message for colleges, the tools for dairy farmers we are using such as the profit monitor, the cost control planner and business planning tools are being used by dairy students in colleges.</p><p> Determining future herd size is like asking what is the length of a piece of string.  The figures we have presented show that, for the average farmer in 2014, the margin per cow was &euro;800.  Eighty cows by &euro;800 is &euro;64,000 in dairy income alone.  There is a single farm payment on top of this and perhaps a margin in the replacement enterprise.  There is a sizeable income from an 80-cow herd.  However, the margin for the bottom 10% is &euro;400 per cow.  Therefore, to have the same margin, those in this category need to double their herd size.  The challenge facing dairy farmers is whether they want to farm very well with 60 or 80 cows, with the ultimate ambition of being in the top 10%, or farm with a herd twice the size but with a lower level of performance.</p><p> Deputies Tom Barry and Martin Heydon referred to schemes in other countries.  In Australia we are aware that there is a farm management deposit scheme to help with volatility.  In New Zealand there is an income equalisation deposit account.  Both countries have been coping with milk price volatility for more years than we have in Ireland.  These schemes have proved very attractive to dairy farmers.</p><p> The other points raised have been covered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015031000002#JJ00200"><p>The issue of the total cost involves a mindset people need to grasp.  An old concept which might have been used by ACOT was that of standard man days.  Using it, one could very easily calculate the amount of time involved and extrapolate from it the actual cost of production, even on mixed-use farms, irrespective of the set-up.  It may be an old principle, but it is certainly applicable.</p> <p>  I thank both Professor Boyle and Dr. O'Dwyer.  The key to the biggest indigenous industry is knowledge.  It is matter of knowledge transfer.   We sometimes tend to forget that Teagasc is a rare breed, particularly in terms of research.  It draws almost all of its funding from independent sources.  Certainly, if it is funded by industry, it is done in such a way as to ensure it remains completely independent.  The approach to the dairy herd is typical in this regard.  Any organisation involved in research, giving advice, training and education in what is our biggest indigenous industry has to be a key to everything that happens in the industry.</p> <p>  The committee might have focused a little on carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.  We produced a land use report, to which both Teagasc and the EPA contributed.  Last week I presented it to Commissioner Hogan.  It forms the basis of many of the arguments made.  Soil science, farm management and animal herd health status are keys, as is the efficiency of food production.  It is exactly as Professor Boyle said on the basis of emissions per kilo of product produced.  There is no point in giving up on this simply because it reduces the overall percentage.</p><p>If one were to be flippant about it, if German car manufacturers moved here, we could reduce the percentage in a simpler way and achieve the same target.  However, that is too simplistic for this serious matter.</p><p> Members will have found today's meeting refreshing.  Teagasc, alongside policy-makers, is important in terms of changing the mindset.  Collectively, we point the ship in a particular direction.  We have spent far too long, and still do, concentrating on what the best outcome from payment schemes might be as opposed to having better before bigger, skill before scale and improving behind-the-gate efficiencies.  The only way we will fulfil all the aspirations for rural development is to have a healthy agricultural community that makes money from what it produces.  Otherwise, this will not work.  We are too dependent on fighting a battle every five or six years on a Common Agricultural Policy that will inevitably change into a public good policy.  We need a land use policy that goes beyond CAP.  The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas goes a good way towards this.  In a countryside like ours, agriculture has been key but overlooked in recent times because of industries that appreciated land values in other ways that proved a folly.  We should revert to the original principle.  I hope that our committee will keep this issue in the public domain.  Teagasc's contributions by way of its annual report and its presentation today are important.</p><p> I was going to ask one or two questions on the issue of schemes.  Teagasc should be consulted by departmental officials on the design of the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, as it will be Teagasc that will implement it.  This is not a criticism of anyone, but doing this would streamline the process so that, when the closing date arrives, people will be able to meet it.  As the key planner, it is important that Teagasc be involved with departmental officials throughout.</p><p> That is my piece.  We will adjourn for a fortnight.  We will have no meeting next week because it happens to be our national day, so I wish everyone an enjoyable day, but not too enjoyable.</p></speech>

Today we will hear from Mr. Simon Carswell, author and journalist, on relationships between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.  This is the first of several sessions on this theme this week.  Mr. Carswell is Washington correspondent with <i>The Irish Times</i>, a position he has held since December 2012.  Previously he was finance correspondent and covered the banking crisis from 2007 to 2012.  He is the author of two books, <i>Something Rotten - Irish Banking Scandals</i>and <i>Anglo Republic - Inside the Bank That Broke Ireland</i>, a bestseller in 2011.  A graduate of Trinity College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology, he was also a news reporter and news editor at <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  He is a regular contributor on radio and television and was named national journalist of the year in 2011 by National Newspapers of Ireland for his coverage of the banking crisis for <i>The Irish Times</i>.  He is very welcome to the inquiry.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I am Washington correspondent with <i>The Irish Times</i>, a role I took up just over two years ago, in January 2013.  Prior to that, I was finance correspondent with the newspaper reporting on the banking sector and before that I worked for <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>for seven years, first as a business reporter from 1999 to 2004 and then as news editor from 2004 to 2007.  I started as finance correspondent at <i>The Irish Times</i>in September 2007 as queues of depositors started to form at Northern Rock bank in the first run on a British bank in more than a century.  As this was the first story on which I worked at <i>The Irish Times</i>, one could say my arrival at the newspaper coincided with the start of the global financial crisis which hit the UK and Ireland.<br/><br/>In 2004 I began researching and writing a book on the history of scandals in the Irish financial sector.  That book, <i>Something Rotten - Irish Banking Scandals</i>, was published by Gill &amp;amp; Macmillan in 2006 and covered scandals in the Irish banks dating back to the early 1970s up to the 2004 overcharging scandal at AIB.  I examined the culture within Irish banking during that period.  While covering the deepening banking crisis, internationally from 2007 and domestically from 2008, for <i>The Irish Times</i>, I began to work on another book in mid-2010 that became <i>Anglo Republic - Inside The Bank That Broke Ireland</i>.  That book, published by Penguin Ireland in September 2011, was my own inquiry into what had happened in the run-up to the 2008 Irish banking crisis and the 2010 international bailout.  Both books were written while I was on short periods of paid leave from <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>and <i>The Irish Times.</i><br/><br/>I continued to report on the banking sector until December 2012 when I was appointed to my current role, based in the United States.  In a letter dated Friday, 13 February 2015, received from the committee requesting my attendance, it asked me to appear before it to talk specifically about the relationships between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.  Specifically, it has asked me to speak about how the property sector - investment and-or development - and the banking sector interacted with government, elected representatives and the State during the period prior to the banking crisis in Ireland and the nature of the relationships between these groups.  It has also asked me to talk about controls or structures, if any, to regulate these relationships and whether being a small country is a factor, or not, in any such relationship.  I will try my best to address these topics in this discussion.<br/><br/>I must point out that it has been over two years since I wrote regularly and in depth about Irish banking.  I have since immersed myself in a broad range of very different subjects.  Also, as I live in the United States and have not been able to access many of my notes from my time reporting on the banks while with <i>The Irish Times</i>, I may not be able to shed light on some of the committee's queries, but I am happy to help where I can and will try my best to answer any question it want to ask me.  I must also stress that I am bound by journalistic privilege that prevents me from disclosing sources of information in any work I have done where these sources have asked me to maintain their anonymity. <br/><br/>On the subject of discussion, I would characterise the relationship between the major players in the property sector, the construction industry, government, certain elected representatives and the banks, as well as the relationship between the Government, the banks and the financial supervisory authorities, as extremely cosy in the period leading up to the 2008 banking crash.  To take a phrase from former Finnish civil servant Peter Nyberg&rsquo;s thorough report on the causes of the banking crisis, the various players, including politicians, builders, bankers and regulators, displayed &ldquo;behaviour exhibiting bandwagon effects both between institutions (herding) and within them (groupthink).&rdquo;  Nothing I came across in my research would contradict that statement.  On the wild frontier of the Celtic tiger era, Anglo Irish Bank was the one trick pony in a frenetic land grab, leading a poorly regulated and highly competitive race for market share and profit. <br/><br/>These relationships appear to have been too cosy to have allowed any one of these collective groups, be it banks, government, builders or regulators, to shout stop and offer the kind of critical dissent that might have changed the behaviour of all and the direction in which the country was heading.  If one of these groups had had the courage to put its head above the parapet, I believe there might not have been the crisis we had or at least it might not have been as severe as it was.  For these parties, it was too comfortable and self-serving for some to stay in the crowd and stick with the consensus, particularly when so many were making so much money.  The result was that contrarians were ridiculed, silenced or ignored to ensure the credit fuelled boom continued for years as their past warnings did not come true.  These cosy relationships would prove extremely costly.  While the cost of the banking bailout to the Irish people stands at &euro;64 billion, excluding recoveries coming from the sale of shares in the banks or better than expected returns from the National Asset Management Agency, it is worth stressing that the overall losses and capital wiped out by the crash amount to far in excess of this sum.  The losses on loans, mostly to the property sector, across all of the banks in Ireland came to well in excess of &euro;100 billion, including tens of billions of euro covered by the UK Treasury.  This is sometimes forgotten.<br/><br/>For the record, I do not accept the proposition put forward by many of the key players involved in policy-making, banking, building or regulating that there were so many people responsible for the crisis that it is difficult to pin individual blame on a few.  Moral responsibility for the excesses of this period can be cast widely, but legal responsibility for what happened and what was permitted to happen far less so.  There were a limited number of people involved in key decisions, in particular those decisions taken in response to the crisis that had major consequences. <br/><br/>In the decade leading up to the crash long-standing relations had developed between the political classes and the property-banking nexus.  The investigations by the Mahon tribunal of inquiry illustrate the corrupt connections between politicians and landowners-builders and it is worth stressing that the tribunal only covered elected representatives and property deals in Dublin.  In times more recent than the property deals examined by the tribunal senior Government figures and politicians, notably from Fianna F&aacute;il, were seen on quasi-social occasions such as high profile horse racing meetings rubbing shoulders with prominent builders.  Even if some politicians and public representatives mixing in these circles did not directly encourage the property boom - there was certainly a number of very prominent cases where senior politicians did, both in terms of their public remarks and policy decisions - these associations at least created the perception that the most powerful people in the country supported and championed the property industry. <br/><br/>Politics and business regularly overlapped.  There are examples of politicians and public representatives getting involved in land speculation deals, building projects and property investments, in one notable case, in partnership with a major figure from banking, while continuing to serve as public representatives, right up to and during the economic crisis.  Builders and property developers were also active in politics.  Of the donations received by the political parties in Ireland in the four years between 2002 and 2005, building, property development and construction related companies, with builders and developers personally, donated tens of thousands of euro to Fianna F&aacute;il which was in government during these years.  That party accounted for almost the entirety of the political donations made by the property sector to political parties in these years.  Individuals who worked in the political arena afterwards took up highly paid roles representing and lobbying on behalf of construction and financial industry groups, interacting with people with whom they had previously worked closely in politics.  Easy and ready access to politicians brought easy and ready access to policy and decision-making that drove the growth of the property and financial sectors. <br/><br/>There are a number of well documented examples of these sectors bearing strong influence on the policy making process in the years running up to the crisis.  These helped to inflate the credit bubble and frenzied property buying and weakened potential policy or regulatory actions that might have dampened activity, both in the property market and the banking sector.  Certainly, there were no effective controls in place to regulate these relationships.</p><p>  Government tax policies and incentives for the commercial property market have been widely attributed as a factor in inflating the property bubble.  These subsidies were left in place and were only starting to be phased out during the frothiest years of the property bubble as a result of the relations between the property sector and Government/elected representatives and aggressive lobbying by commercial interests.</p><p>  Despite an outside expert urging the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in high-profile reports in 2000 to remove tax incentives for property investors, the party was lobbied intensively by the construction industry and incentives were left in place in the 2001 budget.  Mortgage interest relief was reintroduced for investors, helping them to offset the cost of their property speculation against their taxes.  Such measures only added to increased activity in the property market.  Had the incentives been removed it might have made some think twice about investing more in property and cooled the market somewhat.</p><p>  That Government and the next Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government said they would end the tax incentives for a multitude of property development types, from multi-storey car parks to student accommodation to nursing homes to over-the-shop apartments, but they were ultimately extended from 2004 until 2006 and in some instances right up to the start of the financial crisis in 2008, the years covering the most frenetic period of the property/banking bubble.  These decisions were taken after heavy lobbying by the construction industry.  The Government of the day said in 2004 that it would review these tax-based property incentives.  In the 2006 Finance Bill some tax reliefs were eliminated by the Government while the decision was taken to phase out other reliefs up to 2008. </p><p>  The financial sector was equally robust in pushing its own interests with Government and Government officials, through established relationships between its representative groups, when it came to legislative changes it wanted or when it was unhappy about measures that might rein in the activities of its industry.  In 2006, the banks wanted a change in the rules on what collateral could be used to borrow in the international markets.  They lobbied heavily Department of Finance officials and Government to the highest levels in a well-co-ordinated campaign that included representations made at a private dinner in one of the country's biggest banks for a senior member of Government.  This is illustrative of relations between the banks and the pro-banking Government of the time.  At one point the Department of Finance was described by one of its own officials as being "under siege" in the lobbying campaign by the financial industry.  The aim was to get legislation passed to allow the banks to issue bonds backed by commercial mortgages.  The financial sector won out.  The legislation was passed in early 2007, at the peak of the property boom, making it easier for banks to borrow more money to provide more loans to more customers.</p><p>  The Financial Regulator was shown to be equally malleable by outside interests when it came to moves that might have taken some of the heat out of bank lending.   In 2006 the Financial Regulator started to consider the introduction of compliance statements for the directors of banks.  These would allow the Regulator to force management and the boards of the banks to stick by assurances they gave, for example, agreeing to reduce their lending into one particular area, and would have given the regulator an important tool to exert greater control over the activities of the banks.  After intensive lobbying by the financial services industry, the Department of Finance asked the Regulator to drop the process of consultation with the industry on the measure.  It was shelved in favour of the measure being considered in a wider overhaul of financial services legislation at some later unspecified date.  One of the reasons cited for dropping it was that it would damage the country&rsquo;s international competitive edge in financial services.  This was a regular refrain from the banks, and was repeated by the Government and Government officials when it came to opposing stronger regulatory tools to curb the activities of the banks.  As Governor Honohan stated in his report on the causes of the banking crisis, more aggressive action was not taken to stop the practice of lending 100% mortgages to home-buyers because excessive weight was given to the damaging effect of competition from foreign banks on domestic lenders if curbs were introduced, "probably in light of lobbying objections from institutions".  This shows how the Financial Regulator was, as well as trying to regulate the banks, on the bandwagon with the industry and Government in trying to promote Ireland as an attractive destination for international banks to conduct business.</p><p> The lobbying by the banking industry extended to one notable case involving Irish Nationwide Building Society.  For years the senior management at the building society had been lobbying for a change in legislation that would have allowed the building society to demutualise and be sold immediately in a private trade sale in one fell swoop, instead of waiting a period of five years after demutualisation for a trade sale.  That legislation came under the Fianna Fail-led Government in the summer of 2006 and the lender was almost immediately put up for sale.  At that time Irish Nationwide was dressing itself up for a trade sale by showing itself to be as profitable as possible.  This coincided with a period when the building society pushed itself very heavily away from its traditional roots as a mortgage lender that helped people buy homes into a more lucrative guise as a boutique lender to builders, and even a partner with some of its developer customers on speculative projects.  Some of the heaviest losses incurred by the building society were on loans provided in the period leading up to and after the passing of this demutualisation legislation.</p><p>  Irish Nationwide's senior management was perceived as having strong political connections.  That, I believe, coupled with the fact that the building society had operated unchecked by any kind of effective regulatory action on corporate governance issues for many years, gave the lender a sense of invincibility and misplaced confidence in terms of the financial risks it took on, to carry on its business as it saw fit.  Despite repeated problems of corporate governance at the building society, the regulator adopted a stand-off approach with the lender, preferring to wait until the institution was sold in a trade sale as a means to resolving these problems rather than tackling them head on.  This wait-and-see game proved to be extremely costly given the kind of loans that were advanced during this period.  Irish Nationwide has cost the Irish public &euro;5.4 billion, an extraordinary loss rate on a lender that had &euro;12 billion in loans.  </p><p>  As for the interactions between the regulator and Anglo Irish Bank, their cosy relationship meant that the bank's massive exposure to the property market was allowed to balloon out of control with devastating consequences for the country.  Remarkably, regulators knew that the bank was aware that it was in breach of its own internal limits on property lending.  It is even more remarkable that regulators were comforted by the fact that the bankers knew that they were in breach of their own limits.  This is the kind of strange logic that existed in the country's poor regulatory regime that showed the weaknesses of light-touch regulation and how bankers could skirt around the rules.</p><p>  In 2008, Anglo Irish Bank had a strong link between its boardroom and Government buildings, though it is still unclear just how useful this connection was to the bank at the time of its greatest need, in the days leading up to 29 September 2008, the night of the guarantee.  It raises a question, which I cannot answer: did these connections play a factor in the thinking of those in charge on that fateful night behind the decision not to take the bank, the only Irish financial institution that had gone over the cliff edge at that stage, into public ownership by way of nationalisation legislation or to consider some other stop-gap measure rather than a costly blanket guarantee?  Given Anglo Irish Bank's frantic, last-gasp efforts to raise concerns and press influence in political and regulatory circles about its deteriorating funding position, it would appear that the bank's connections were not so well developed to be effective.</p><p>  While Anglo Irish Bank was very close to the country's most active builders and property developers, and so too was Fianna Fail, it might be too far a leap to conclude that Anglo Irish Bank and Fianna Fail were equally close.  The bank and the party certainly had a number of deep contacts at the highest levels.  My research found that these contacts bore little fruit for the bank, although it is unclear what influence Anglo Irish Bank's developer customers might have had with their friends in politics.  For the most part, in the run-up to the crisis, the bank was too busy lending money to builders and making vast profits from the booming property market to be distracted by developing and working political contacts.  In the post-guarantee period, prior to the bank&rsquo;s nationalisation, there were more pronounced efforts made by the bank to curry favour in political circles.</p><p>  As for the future, the recent publication of the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014 to regulate lobbying of Government members and State officials by corporate and other concerned interests is a step in the right direction.  This will force groups, companies and organisations involved in lobbying Government to file the details of their contacts with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Further steps could be taken, such as the compulsory logging of all contacts, even informal ones, that the Taoiseach and Ministers have with outside parties concerning representations on policy and-or legislation, and for these contacts to be disclosed publicly and regularly.  Often it is only through Freedom of Information requests by the media that these contacts emerge.  Some contacts, however, may never appear in official records because departmental officials know not to commit to paper certain things that might be "FOI-able".</p><p>  The committee has also asked me to discuss whether Ireland being a small country is a factor in terms of the relationships mentioned above.  I cannot answer that because who knows what would have happened if Ireland was three times the size.  However, I think that the fact that this is a small country should serve as another reason why it is so important to document all contacts that policy-makers and their advisers have with outside interests on policy representations, as onerous as that record keeping might be.  Any concerns about unintended consequences of forcing those connections and contacts out into the open are, in my view, over-played.</p><p>  Sunlight is good medicine. This country needs to let in far more light and be far more transparent, along with being more open to listening to and accepting of countervailing views, if it is to recover fully from the recent dark past.</p></speech>

They are ultimately responsible for what their financial institutions do.  Then the Central Bank and the regulatory authorities should have seen the banks had lost the run of themselves and there were certain issues in their institutions such as limits on lending.  Successive Governments were responsible to step in if there were any regulatory gaps.  The role of the auditors and, as has emerged in the crisis, the rules auditors worked by, were too narrow and backward looking, rather than forward looking and pointing out risks which existed in particular institutions.

Within that there were two significant bursts.  It was more than 30% for six months in 2004 and nearly 30% again in 2006.  The warning bells should have gone off in the early 2000s.

It had convinced itself it was not a property lender.  It also got too close to its borrowers.  Simply put, it had too many eggs in one basket.  The bank had four main areas of cover in how risk was approached and how it protected its loans.  The first was cash flow and rental income from buildings and properties.  The second was the value of the property itself.  The third was cross-collateralisation where Anglo had borrowers' other assets in its portfolio.  If the first three areas did not work out then the fourth area of cover was the personal guarantee where Anglo itself could go after the developer or builders.</p> <p>  Stripped away, all those securities it believed it had all centred around property.  I believe the bank recognised this and that it was getting too heavily into the property market.  An internal instruction was issued that Anglo would try to bring property development on the loan book down to 20% and reduce this over time to 15%.  That it was unable to stick to those limits shows how close the bank was to its borrowers.  It was unable to pull back from that sector.  Later credit reports in 2005, 2006 and 2007 show the bank could not meet the restraint it wanted.  At that stage, the risk was its closeness to borrowers.  In the book I quote a former senior Anglo executive where he felt that customers were running the bank.  I would tend to agree with that.</p></speech>

The other banks would also have seen Anglo championed by the investment community.  The sheer scale of the profits made at Anglo was too tempting for the other banks - they really had to try and get a slice of the action.  For example, AIB set up this win-back team to look at how it could get some of that business which Anglo was getting.  The other banks also got involved, maybe not as aggressively as AIB.  There was the added injection of foreign banks, particularly Bank of Scotland Ireland, owned by Halifax Bank of Scotland and also Royal Bank of Scotland through Ulster Bank, which very aggressively got into the market.  The saying in AIB was that "Anglo joined us for breakfast and now it is eating our lunch."  This shows the competitive edge there.  Other banks were very concerned that Anglo was stealing the march on them, to the extent that Anglo might even mount a takeover for Bank of Ireland.  That is how impressive Anglo's growth was and how much money it was making.</p></speech>

One is looking at the other side of the balance sheet there rather than the loans.  There was a huge push to lend as much as one could but the funding side of that struggled to keep up.  Anglo was able to borrow in the wholesale markets to fund that lending growth because of Ireland's entry into the euro and the access to vast pools of funding without currency risk.</p><p>That gap got bigger and bigger as the bank tried to keep up with providing loans to customers in the market.  At a particular point, over 50% of its funding was from wholesale markets.  It was borrowing very very short and lending long; the average duration of its borrowing near the peak of its lending was well below a year, and the average length of a loan was three or four years.  With such a gap, if there is any kind of stress in the liquidity market, that bank will be in serious trouble.  It is not unique to Anglo.  Many of the banks in the market had that very heavy reliance on wholesale funding.</p></speech>

At that time, a lot of assets that the Irish banks used were backed by residential mortgages.  They were regarded as much more likely to be repaid, therefore of better quality.  By including commercial mortgages in those packages of bonds the banks were following an international trend.  There were other countries doing that.  What that did was it allowed, for example, in particular, Anglo, because it had more commercial mortgages than other banks, to be able to package them up, go to the market and say, "Invest in our bond, buy our debt," and subsequently they would get money in and be able to use it to lend on into the banks.</p> <p>   I think one of the issues raised during the lobbying for that Bill was raised by the regulatory authorities which said that there was greater inherent volatility by comparison with other asset classes in terms of valuation and default experience.  So that legislation was passed in the face of some opposition from the regulatory authorities.</p></speech>

There were a number of brokers in that firm who said, "We think Anglo has reached the peak of the market and it is no longer a stock that we would tip to our investor clients."  Anglo had a reputation for aggressively attacking any dissent in the market and it responded very negatively when it heard through investors in the investment community that there were a number of brokers who were saying to their clients, "No longer back Anglo."  Many international investors took interest in it.  Often when there is a contrarian in the investment market who puts its head up and says, "We have changed our view in contrast to everyone else," many of the more high risk investors would think that is worth looking at and as a result some of those people would either start looking at shorting the stock, which is making money from the share price falling.  I think the response of Anglo was, "We need to fight that, we need to counter that very negative talk against the bank in the market."</p></speech>

It was not alone.  Only one or two banks said they were told by the regulator not to use the guarantee to solicit deposits.  Certainly, it made such news that day that Ireland was regarded as a safer bet because the Government was standing behind it.</p> <p>   The perception on the night was that Anglo was still going to be nationalised even after that decision was made.  The view was that the decision made on the night of the guarantee was a stopgap measure that might buy the banks some time.  The Government, through the Central Bank, in consultation with the banks that went in that night, asked each bank for &euro;5 billion to tide Anglo over which, if one looks at the rate of loss of deposits for the bank, would have brought it to the weekend, maybe a little bit longer.  So the measures that were introduced that night were regarded by people leaving the building that night as buying time.  I think the view was that nationalisation was still very much on the table but the regulatory authorities expressed concern that a bank could not be nationalised mid-week because of the complications and technical issues that come with that.  The belief was that nationalisation would still happen at the weekend.</p></speech>

I think the debate at that time arose from the scandals that are outlined in <i>Something Rotten: Irish Banking Scandals</i>, the first book.  The regulatory regime that was established in 2003 was in direct response to some of those scandals that emerged, particularly with customer funds, the likes of the bogus non-resident accounts arising from the DIRT issue and also some of the overcharging by some of the other banks in the market and the purpose of that regime was to protect the consumer.</p><p>In terms of the creation of a regulatory regime, in 2003, the regulator was set up as an independent entity within the Central Bank.  The focus, in establishing it in that way, was too much on the consumer.  </p></speech>

However, it did not have a prudential director as a statutory member of the board, which says more about the emphasis that was on the consumer.  As emerged from the crisis, there should have been more focus on the prudential aspects of the financial system.  Everybody will remember the advertisement in which the phrase "I don't know what a tracker mortgage is" was used.  A more appropriate phrase might have been "I don't how safe my money is and I don't know how safe these banks are."</p></speech>

The industry includes not only the banks but all financial institutions, including in the insurance area.  Concerns would have been raised about whether the measure was too heavy.  The regulatory authorities were set up on the basis that they were principles based, which is what we now see as light-touch.  This is potentially an onerous statement and onerous rules to apply to directors.  The concerns raised by industry played well with the Department of Finance concerns.  This relates back to the more general issue of one of the mandates of the Financial Regulator within the Central Bank being to make Ireland attractive as a place in which to set up financial business.  They did not want this type of rules-based compliance statement to be introduced at that time because it would have caused a problem for the sale of Ireland as a pro-business country for the financial sector.</p></speech>

Certainly, there were individuals within the banks who would have raised reservations about where the banks were going.  Another notable example is mentioned in <i>Anglo Republic</i>.  In this regard concerns were raised about the banks' funding and, as I said in response to a question from Senator D'Arcy, the gap between short-term funding within the bank and long-term lending.  It was noted within the bank - if my memory is correct, I think this was in 2006 - that the bank was potentially very exposed if there was any kind of issues in the funding markets.</p></speech>

Again, the point was to not isolate any one institution as being the weakest or the strongest.  If it was announced the next day that a guarantee had been introduced but that it was only for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide this might have raised questions the other financial institutions individually.  The blanket guarantee provided cover for all institutions.  By the same token, some of the other banks were concerned that they would have been lumped in with those two institutions because the perception would be created in the market that if Anglo Irish Bank, which many people knew was in serious trouble, was being guaranteed the other banks being guaranteed were equally in serious trouble.</p></speech>

It is important lending in particular areas is curbed, so that the regulator could, in respect of likely exposure in a particular sector, step in and apply limits and force the financial institution to abide by that.  This needs to be backed up by aggressive action to ensure those limits met.  It is not only rules, but actions, that are required.  If both of these requirements are met there is a much greater chance of preventing something like this happening again.</p></speech>

Monetary policy is applied first and foremost to the biggest economies.  A blanket monetary policy was applied across a patchwork quilt of different economies, some of which needed low interest rates and others of which needed high interest rates.  Applying one interest to all economies creates the type of uneven credit scenario we witnessed during the crisis, leading to some countries to experience to boom in lending we experienced.</p></speech>

They would create a bond and go into the debt markets and sell the bond.  That legislation allowed commercial mortgages to be used, which had not previously been allowed, to raise funding in the market.</p></speech>

It would have been co-ordinated by the financial industry groups and also individually.  The senior bankers in each institution would also have sent letters to Department of Finance officials to say that this was a good thing.  They would say the same thing, although they might change it slightly.  That is what led to the comment from a Department of Finance official that they felt they were under siege at that point.<br/><br/>Also, as part of the lobbying campaign, we are aware of a high profile private meeting that took place between a senior banker and a member of the Government at a dinner.  We know from the correspondence after that dinner, which I got under freedom of information, that the legislation was discussed.  The banker described the legislation as enlightened and innovative, and a model for the political, public and private sectors.  I will quote from the letter that was sent by the senior banker to the member of the Government:<blockquote>I can honestly say that I find it hard to remember when I have had an as enjoyable, insightful and stimulating few hours discussion.  You raised a particular interesting issue, indeed challenge, on the question of influencing or at least informing the debate on where and how we take forward this great project that is modern Ireland.</blockquote>That was an example of the type of access the industry got to the Government on that issue.</p></speech>

That would have helped the bank; it would have made the bank more stable.  However, it also would have allowed the bank to use the money it had borrowed by selling the bond through passing it on in lending to customers.  On one point, one could say that it makes the bank stable.  If the money just sits there, that is fine as it is stable.  However, if it uses it to lend more money to customers, clearly it is increasing its risk depending on where the money goes.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify something.  Page 218 of Mr. Carswell's book refers to the night of the guarantee, when bankers from AIB and Bank of Ireland were in the discussions.  Mr. Carswell said that the two banks thought the money would only be needed for the short term as the bankers were led to believe from the discussions that night that Anglo Irish Bank would be nationalised the following weekend.  Who led them to believe that Anglo Irish Bank would be nationalised the following weekend?</p></speech>

I am not sure if it was stated explicitly that Anglo Irish Bank would be nationalised at the weekend.  The view was that nobody on the night knew what the effect of the guarantee would be, which is why they wanted &euro;5 billion both from AIB and Bank of Ireland.  I think that the bankers when leaving had the sense that the bank was going to be nationalised that weekend.</p></speech>

When they met in Government Buildings did the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank come up for specific discussion?</p></speech>

There were representations made.  Affidavits have emerged in more recent times which outline the accounts of each of the bankers who were in those meetings.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of them.  I think the representations that were made on that night by at least one of the banks was, "You need to take out Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide because they are major issues".  They were causing problems for them.  AIB and Bank of Ireland felt that having Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society not dealt with and the perception of the market that there was something very wrong with Anglo Irish Bank - Irish Nationwide Building Society was not quoted on the market-----</p></speech>

It is a critical point in terms of the guarantee.  Obviously, we are getting evidence from many people appearing before the committee.  In Mr. Carswell's view, was the distinct impression given that it would be nationalised?</p></speech>

I refer the Deputy back to what I wrote in the book.  I think there was a sense, leaving that night, that Anglo Irish Bank was going to be nationalised.  Nobody knew what would happen with the guarantee when it came into force, whether they would get funding and how the market would react.</p></speech>

Given the fact that they were considering nationalising Anglo Irish Bank, clearly that gave some indication of issues with solvency.  There is a very narrow edge between liquidity and solvency in terms of a rapid run on liquidity.  In Mr. Carswell's investigations, did the issue of solvency arise?</p></speech>

It is not clear from the note whether it means the existing capital and then &euro;8.5 billion and the existing capital at Irish Nationwide Building Society and then &euro;2 billion.  It is not clear whether there were other sums involved, but the question was being asked.  Much of the attention that has been brought to this issue is that it was all about liquidity, but that note tells me that there were discussions around solvency.</p></speech>

I refer to chapter 14 of his book dealing with the guarantee.  Perhaps I can put some matters on the record and ask Mr. Carswell to confirm if he believes they are accurate.  Mr. Carswell refers to a view within Anglo Irish Bank on 29 September 2008 that it would be short at least &euro;1.5 billion the following day and that the bank would not be able to open the following morning.  Was that the clearly understood position within Anglo Irish Bank on that date, that it was an existential crisis for that bank as it would not be able to open on the following day?</p></speech>

The efforts made by the bank on that day, Monday, 29 September, and the fact that it approached Bank of Ireland and subsequently approached AIB shows what an emergency it was at Anglo Irish Bank at that point.</p><p>Also, they knew they were going to run out of money that night.</p></speech>

In terms of the figures the Deputy mentioned, they believed there was only &euro;500 million of bad debts.  I think they believed that.

The big debate is on what the bankers knew at a particular point in time.  I speak a lot about the difficulties in how banks value loan books at particular moments and assess the quality of loans.  Are borrowers repaying everything?  At this point, and it was established - there was certainly some reference made to it in the market - there was a very heavy roll-up of interest, which would suggest that the banks were not getting their loans repaid, but I do not believe that had fed through the system in terms of their auditing and preparation for later accounts.</p></speech>

I do not think they had jumped to the "what if" scenarios around the solvency of the banks, with the exception of the Department of Finance official I mentioned earlier in their memorandum.  I think it is the same memorandum, but I could be wrong, where it is ruled out by a member of the regulatory authority, that there is not a solvency issue with the banks.

It was almost regarded as a lender's failure to get a borrower's loan deal over the line.  That was seen as a problem for the lender and not the borrower, so the comment I made earlier that the bank was too close to its borrowers stands.  They were way too close, and I used the word "cosy" in my opening statement.  I think they were very cosy, and in terms of the inability of both the lenders looking to get the loan deal over the line and the people looking to approve that loan deal, that whole scenario was established to do whatever they possibly could to get that money to the borrower.  The question not asked at a much broader level by the senior management of the bank was, "Should we be doing all this lending into property?"  In the credit and risk committee that was never discussed.</p></speech>

There is very little paperwork on the guarantee, and we need to find out exactly what was the thought process behind the decision-making on the night of the guarantee, to go through the pros and cons list that was provided by the investment banks, the reason other options were not considered, and why this one was considered.  There has been some discussion on that publicly by one former significant member of Government but we have not heard their thinking on the thought process behind the reason it was chosen, and also the reason the other options were ruled out.</p></speech>

Was that voice heard anywhere in the markets?</p></speech>

Do we try to take some heat out of the property market or do we do something else?  The "something else" was that we need to pay people more money, in broad terms.  In terms of the wage growth that was set and the wage increases provided to people to be able to afford property, that was going at it the wrong way.  Rather than trying to put a limit on the market and take some of the heat out of the property market, the developments in pay and the increases in wages came at it the other end so that people could afford to borrow.</p></speech>

A tradition of silence and evasion prevailed.  Driven by an insatiable hunger for profits, some bankers had taken huge risks.  But whistleblowers were unwilling to remain silent, and they revealed the murky details, exposing sinister banking practices.</blockquote></p><p>Considering what was known in the early 2000s about these scandals and what was in the public domain, would Mr. Carswell have expected the regulatory and political authorities to be far more alert to what could develop in the banking system with the property bubble in the making?  Does it look like they learned, or did not learn, from scandals such as this?</p></speech>

If one looks at the culture within Irish banking over the period of the scandals the Deputy mentioned from the first book, I believe there was a switch in the 1980s to performance related pay and that that is really what drove this activity by the banks - the desire to maximise earnings.  It was always about beating the previous year's profits and bankers being set higher targets to meet goals, not just by their own institutions but also by the market.  They wanted to see the share price go in one particular way.  That should have alerted either the regulatory authorities or government authorities to understand what was going on in banking at the time and to take more aggressive action.  </p> <p>  Senator Sean D. Barrett asked how the nature of the regulatory regime had changed in 2003.  The focus was on protecting the consumer, not prudential standards in the banking sector.</p></speech>

Is it Mr. Carswell's view that this nexus of public representatives and land speculation deals would have had a decisive influence in allowing laxity in regulation and the type of legislation that might have been put through Parliament?  Would such decisions be influenced by this type of relationship?</p></speech>

Does he have a feeling for, or an understanding of, why the banks became so careless in the way they allowed loans to be made?</p></speech>

In some instances and some financial institutions the paperwork was done afterwards, at the same time the money was given.  All of the verification checks to make sure the customer was good for it were made as the loan was given.  Again, it goes back to the very close relationship between some of the banks and the borrowers.  The banks knew them so well that it was felt there was no issue and no worry about getting the paperwork done.  The key was getting the money out as quickly as possible.  Many rival developers were bidding for the same land and each developer may have been backed by a different bank.  It was the competitive race to buy the land which drove this process.</p></speech>

They became players in the deals.  Anglo Irish Bank had a wealth management division where many people had money on deposit, many of whom would also have been borrowers at the bank.  When there were opportunities to do deals for the wealth management division, the bank used the pot of money already in the bank to help to buy these deals.  Irish Nationwide was actually a shareholder in some developments with one of its biggest customers.</p></speech>

In some instances, the actual supposed equity or cash that was used in these deals would itself be borrowed so that in some transactions there would be debt on debt on debt and very little cash in the transaction.  Again it comes back to the fact that the banks were competing with each other with their customers to buy very valuable land.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Carswell aware of whether any of those private clients in banks were themselves politicians?  When Professor William Black appeared before the committee he talked about the myriad ways in which bankers take money out of the system, that is, they took cash out for themselves.  Is that something Mr. Carswell looked at or knows about and could he suggest in any way how bankers took the money out for themselves?</p></speech>

Most of the banks would offer share incentive schemes to their executives.  In particular, in Anglo Irish Bank, the senior management team would have significant amounts of shares, proportionately more than one would see at AIB or Bank of Ireland.  In terms of getting money out, they bought in but they did not cash out those shares because it would have been perceived as a weakness if the executives were cashing from their own bank.  I am not sure, I do not get how the Senator is saying they take money out.</p></speech>

Perhaps I can give an example.  In some instances the banks would approach the borrower asking if he was interested in the land and, if so, the bank would help the borrower to buy it.  The developer might be on the radar but may not have been interested until the bank raised the issue.  Certain developers aligned themselves with certain banks so that competing race to buy land was very frenetic as the property market was rising.  Clearly, at particular points in time, as Anglo's business model was doing so well, the other banks starting coming in.  In the period from 2004-07 in particular, there was a marked increase in competition between the banks and the foreign lenders were very actively becoming involved in the property development.</p></speech>

In a speech given in Dublin City Library in 2012, he said:<blockquote><br /><br />You hear talk now about Trichet, Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, threatening Ireland and some say the fear was that they would withdraw the funding from the Irish banks.  I'm not sure they could have done that but what they could have done is put pressure on the Government by increasing the charge and increasing the interest rate on that.</blockquote>Why did Mr. Carswell say this about the threat of the ECB to withdraw funding?  Why would or could it not have done it?</p></speech>

I was speaking somewhat blind about the content of those letters.  My understanding was that the threat at the time if the Government did not accept a bailout of the country - the fear within Government - was less about the money being withdrawn because it had been already been lent by the national Central Bank.  The ECB's way of cranking up the pressure on the Irish Government was it could increase the borrowing cost of that money.  If you go back again to what was the trigger for the bailout, it was the exposure of the national Central Bank and the European Central Bank borrowing to the Irish banks and how quickly that went up.</p></speech>

There is a difference.  Practically I do not think they could have done it.  You cannot withdraw funding if it is already lent.  They could certainly put pressure on to increase the cost of it.  That was the lever they could have pulled to put pressure on the Government.  It came under ELA, exceptional liquidity assistance funding.  It jumped so quickly  because the money was borrowed by all of the banks but in particular by Anglo Irish Bank through the ELA facility at the national Central Bank.  It had to be approved by the European Central Bank and required two thirds of the governing council to vote on it.

It was certainly played out.  When people want to apply pressure in this kind of very official correspondence, they do not say, "If you do not go into a bailout I am going to pull your money or I am going to start increasing your costs".  Obviously, the Government gets the correspondence and looks at it and says, "What can he do here?  How can he increase the pressure on the Government to accept the terms of an EU-IMF bailout?"</p></speech>

If you go back and look at what was on the table at that point, there was money - I cannot recall the exact figures - senior bonds were due by Anglo Irish Bank.  Because it was a defunct lender, obviously in the world of capitalism it should follow that those people should not be repaid because the bank is bust.  When the attempt was made to apply losses on senior bondholders it was like, "You cannot do that.  There  will be this contagion effect and all of your banks will be affected".  The ability to raise bonds and money as a result of that decision would be damaged.</p></speech>

He had a special position at the time of the crisis because he was a journalist and was able to see people speaking and acting publicly as well as speaking to them privately.  He was able to see things like briefings behind the scenes or lobbying activities and was probably made aware of them.  Was there a concern during the run-up to the crisis either personally within himself or in the profession about the extent and types of those relationships?  In Mr. Carswell's opening statement he talks about cosy relationships.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon Carswell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015031000002#M03600"><p>It depends what you are talking about.  Much like the debate around whether it was a liquidity or solvency crisis, the focus - I started in <i>The Irish Times</i>reporting day-to-day on the banks in September 2007.  It was all about liquidity at that point.  My focus in particular was how exactly banks were funding themselves, how this international crisis was affecting their funding.  In the latter part of 2007 and early 2008, did the banks have sub-prime assets on their books?  That was the real warning sign - if we saw some of those sub-prime assets on the books of the banks they could potentially be in serious trouble.  The crisis evolved and became more about domestic deposits through mid-point in 2008 and as we know with September 2008.  The concern about the relationships I speak about in the opening statement did not really figure in my coverage at that point because the focus was very much liquidity.  Certainly the questions started being asked.  As I mentioned before, in the report in May 2008 the level of interest roll-up, which is a sign of distress - borrowers cannot pay their interest so it rolls up - indicated that it was a risk to the banks.  In the middle of 2008 we started wondering how exactly these banks were being affected.  Then the liquidity crisis reached a peak with the guarantee and thereafter, in the following two years right up to the present, it is about solvency and the quality of the loans in these institutions.</p></speech>

I was surprised at the pace at which the crisis was developing, how quickly it happened.  I did not necessarily jump to what access do people have at this time.  We were following it as a day-to-day crisis, it was panic stations for a lot of these financial institutions in the second half of 2008.  We now know that Anglo was &euro;0.5 billion a day, up to &euro;1 billion a day.  The money was draining out of the bank.  There were daily meetings in the banks and daily reporting of just how bad it was to the Central Bank and Financial Regulator.</p></speech>

I think there was a sense that some institutions felt they were not as weak as another institution or that such an institution was much weaker than they were.  Again, the concern during that week was with the blanket guarantee, that it was not differentiating between the weakest and the strongest.  We now know that most of the institutions - given what they had on their loan books but which had not come through at that stage - were in dire straits, certainly from a liquidity point of view but some banks had solvency issues.  The market had not fallen to the extent that it did later which exposed those solvency issues.</p></speech>

There was a sense of out-and-out panic.  People were trying to figure out what was going on.  From the point of view of a journalist it was a fertile time to be reporting on it because one was able to find out a lot more.  People across the spectrum were speaking to me and other journalists to try to find out what I had heard.  It was a frenzy of trying to find out information about what was going on.</p></speech>

I do not know.  My focus was very much on the financial banking side.  I would say that the coalition partners were up to speed with each other on what was going on.  There is a incorporeal Cabinet meeting to agree the guarantee, as we know, so they were all contacted.  My understanding is that yes, there was certainly a concerted effort by members of the junior party in the coalition to find out exactly what was going on.  I do not think that anyone was kept in the dark.</p></speech>

In his response to the Chairman's first question, Mr. Carswell mentioned briefly the role of auditors.  Are the rules regarding how auditors audit the accounts of financial institutions post-crisis, effective?  Will the changes that have been made be effective into the future?  Several witnesses have pointed to a potential conflict, at least, in terms of how auditors are appointed by financial institutions versus their role in auditing the accounts of those institutions.  Does Mr. Carswell have any views or comments as to the method by which auditors are appointed?</p></speech>

I think the crisis showed that banks needed to put aside rainy day money so that should things go bad they would have enough general provisions.  There was an attempt, very late in the day, to apply general provisions.  After the guarantee period, the banks were saying that the loans had not gone bad but they had put aside a pot of &euro;500 million in case they do.  That should have been going on for years, even during the good times but because the credit markets were doing so well, the problems with loans were covered by a rising market.  That is what really shrouded all of the problems that occurred in the accountancy profession.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's question on how auditors should be appointed, I certainly think there should be a rotation of auditors much more frequently than there had been.  I think that would apply a fresh set of eyes to a set of accounts or financial statements.  With the nature of auditing, they may need to bring in some future forecasting as well.  That might require auditors to hire economists, mathematicians or people who can look ahead and foresee potential problem when one has 50% of the loan book in a particular sector that if the following ten things should happen there could be problems.  Auditors will say it is all about looking backwards, but I think there needs to be a focus on forecasting, but as I have said, I do not know if the changes cover that.</p></speech>

It was not just builders and property developers who were getting rich.  If profits were met as well as certain targets being met by bankers, they would get substantial share options and if memory serves me, bonus were paid over three years at Anglo Irish Bank.  If one is looking at bonus structures now, the changes to be made is to put it over a much longer period and that would certainly make bankers more prudent in terms of having their decisions on loans being viewed over a longer period, so that if a loan goes south the person may not be paid the bonus that was agreed at the time he or she had agreed the loan.</p></speech>

I will begin with his previous book <i>Something Rotten: Irish Banking Scandals</i>.  I have referenced it before in the inquiry.  He deals with the DIRT scandal on page 151 and he says, &quot;The controversy revealed that in 1980s and 1990s Ireland there existed a culture of State and bank sponsored tax evasion.&quot;  Could he speak to this for the committee and outline what he means in relation to that culture of State and bank sponsored tax evasion?</p></speech>

They knew that they were not non-resident.  They knew that they were resident so they were therefore bogus.  People recognised that there was a problem, Revenue Commissioners, senior Government departmental officials and the Central Bank.  Again, I mentioned it earlier, throughout the scandals the flight of capital was a big fear.  If we moved aggressively against these accounts, and it was estimated that there were substantial funds in these accounts, would that scare off the actual non-resident depositors in the Irish banks.  There was consideration given to how to find out if they were non-resident or not and the proposal at the time from the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition in 1983 was to get them to swear an affidavit.  The view was to ask every non-resident to swear an affidavit that the account and the money in that account belongs to them and they are not living in the Republic.  The view was that that would scare them off and they would just take their money elsewhere.  I think the flight of capital risk was completely overplayed in this period.  To me it was sometimes a convenient excuse when I looked at the scandals in that period.  Particularly in the 1970s and 1980s when the country was on its knees financially, it was totally overplayed and there should have been much more aggressive action.  There is a whole other inquiry which looked into all of this and the findings were that absolutely all of those players that I mentioned should have taken the action.</p></speech>

We do not know exactly the contacts that were made and I made reference to quasi-social occasions in my opening statement.  We do not know exactly the interactions that take place but we know they are close.  As a journalist I was always interested in this and I tried to get into Fianna F&aacute;il's Galway tent, for example, and I got in one time and I saw it.  I saw the close contact between the people they had invited or donors, whoever they were, and various Government Ministers.  What struck me at the time was, "I wonder what they are talking about."  We do not know.  That is the problem.  The lobbying that we do know is often found out through freedom of information requests to Government Departments.  The media, and certainly I, as a reporter trying to find out more, would be constantly hitting walls trying to find out exactly the relationships between these people and what it means in terms of forming policy on certain issues and it is not at all transparent.</p></speech>

We know, and the three banking reports have gone into this, that the tax incentives that were there for the property market certainly fuelled the boom, not just in buying land but in lending.  If a person could get their property sold quickly and could get a tax incentive to do so, to make it cheaper to borrow money or to buy land, then the banks would be encouraged to lend to that person, absolutely.</p></speech>

It is a different view than that put forward by Dr. Nyberg who was of the opinion in his report that, "The nature of systemic banking crises rarely allows blame and responsibility to be confidently allocated."  Mr. Carswell has purposely challenged this view by saying that there were a limited number of people involved in key decision-making.  When we talk about the limited number of people are we talking about single numbers, double numbers, or a couple of dozen?  What is Mr. Carswell's thinking in relation to the number of people that could be held accountable?</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, if one of those groups, like a bank, one bank, very openly said, "I am not going to go down there, I am not going down this route," I think that would have had an effect.  Would it have stopped the crisis totally?  I do not believe so.  It is very difficult to put a specific number but I think it could be brought down to dozens.</p></speech>

I think the communications of civil servants should be open to the public even with the passage of time.  I know there is the 30-year rule for State papers for example and obviously there are certain issues which require Cabinet confidentiality but as I said in my opening statement, I think sunlight is good medicine.  I think transparency is very important.  To get an understanding of what actually happened I think it is important to have contemporaneous access to decisions that are made by Government.  When I try to find out information on things that are going on at a particular point in time it is very difficult and freedom of information provides an opportunity or channel to get it, but this is a question I raised about a particular institution, a bank, that there is no transparency.  We do not know the process around, "Well, what about that line or this line?"  What is the process around why I have been denied access to that information?  I think the fact that we do not know makes it even more difficult.  I think those concerns that it leads to people not taking notes have been overplayed.</p></speech>

I cannot remember which one.  It explored the need to have something in our back pocket in case something happens.</p><p>That was all part of the crisis management preparations that went on.  There was a similar piece of legislation, but much broader, introduced in the UK called the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, which was effectively providing a regulator a toolkit to fix a broken bank or to take it out or decommission it.  It was very much of the time that governments were looking at that, in that the crisis was so bad and we had seen five or six months previously what had happened with Northern Rock, so we needed to be prepared.  That is where that came from.</p></speech>

People get paid a lot of money to hold them, in the teens in terms of percentage interest on what they would get on those.  I was surprised by how broad it was when it was announced the following day.  I was certainly surprised that there did not seem to be a very clear explanation as to why that debt was included.  It is not quite clear exactly who decided on the night to include it.  Somebody asked earlier about gaps in what we know.  That is a big gap, in my view, in finding out exactly why dated subordinated debt was included.</p></speech>

One thing that surprised me was that the ECB did not see that coming.  We knew it was a two-year guarantee from September 2008, so there was always going to be a funding cliff at a particular point.  I was surprised that the ECB was shocked that, suddenly, there was this huge increase in ELA borrowing.</p></speech>

The requirement for ELA was on the basis of what was in place for the two years following the guarantee.  Would the nature of the banks' capitalisation and liquidity requirements still have meant that they were inside the requirements for ELA after the guarantee had expired?</p></speech>

That was the problem in Frankfurt.  The European Central Bank's view was that it had taken on a credit risk with Ireland and it was exposed to Ireland because the State had stood behind the banks.  Therefore, it was the State effectively.  ELA is not for that purpose, and that is why there was alarm in Frankfurt and that is why there was that pressure that Senator MacSharry and I spoke about earlier.</p></speech>

Is he aware of any independent study or empirical evidence to suggest that nexus relations are any more or less pronounced here in Ireland and what, if any, are the effective means of controlling such relationships for the public good?  Has Mr. Carswell any other final comment he might like to add?</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, I think the fact that we are a small country and there is potential for more people - different people - to meet more often means that there is a requirement to have a very thorough register of lobbying, for example.  I think that it should be as detailed as possible, within reason of course.  I used the word "onerous".  I think it is important that we know who has access to Government decisions.  It is not a bad thing.  We just need to know so that we can figure out if decisions are made because there is certain undue influence brought to bear on a politician.  The transparency, I think, will improve the process by which citizens make representations to their elected representatives.</p></speech>

Hypothetically, if we improve regulation, do we run the risk that one of our American experts presented to us of an AIG, a body that is not regulated but has so many connections with the bodies that one is trying to regulate and save that AIG must be included as well?  Arising from that, is it possible to have a utility bank that would just look after people's savings and make the rest a casino, or are they inextricably linked, when we try to design a regulatory system for this sector in the future to make sure that none of this happens again?</p></speech>

As the Senator will know, the financial services industry is very innovative.  It will find new ways to make money, so it is a challenge for regulators to stay ahead of that.   If one improves the rules generally and improves the action and interaction of the regulator with the banking sector, it will help more than if one sets up a utility bank and leaves the other banks to it.

This is the fourth action plan.  Members will be aware of the backdrop to this, which was to try to achieve a cross-government focus on employment.  This is the central challenge we all face.  The model has been successful for a number of reasons.  It has motivated people across government to focus on employment and it has been monitored from the Taoiseach's office, which on a quarterly basis, gives additional impetus.  It is an annual process and every year we have the opportunity to discuss with both industry partners and a wider base of stakeholders what needs to be done.  That has always ensured fresh thinking in the plan.</p> <p>  The plan has made an impact.  It had two simple objectives in the early period, the most significant one being the return of 100,000 people to work by 2016 and, second, as the Taoiseach has often reiterated, to become the best small country in which to do business by 2016.  We have made substantial progress on both fronts.  The latest numbers suggest 90,000 additional people are back at work and, significantly, in the context previous queries by members when I have appeared before them, they will be heartened that over the past two years, all these new jobs have been full time.  The number of new part-time jobs has declined over the same period.</p> <p>  We are improving steadily in the competitiveness rankings, which reflects the effort to improve the business environment that we took on.  Initially, the focus was on export oriented firms and in the first three years, the plan was entirely driven by export growth through the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and tourism but, over the past 12 months, while exports remain strong, our agencies supported 35,000 gross new jobs leading to 15,000 net new jobs.  Exports remain a big driver when one considers that for every exporting job, typically another job is generated elsewhere in the economy.  However, we are experiencing a welcome return to growth across other sectors.</p> <p>  This year, like other years, we conducted an open consultation to take on the best ideas and we have focused on a number of four core issues.  We have instituted regional enterprise strategies for the first time and this is being driven by my Secretary General.  We intend to roll out these strategies within every region by July.  We see it as a good opportunity not only to focus on the agencies, which I have done in delivering at regional level through local enterprise offices, LEOs, EI and the IDA but also to engage and, hopefully, elicit new responses to the challenge within the regions.  To that end, we have made competitiveness funds available through EI and we have also decided that in six regions outside Dublin and Cork specific commitments will be made by the IDA to advance facilities and other property-based solutions will be a major core objective.  That has been a significant issue.</p> <p>  The second concern is to focus on startups.  Two thirds of all jobs in an economy are generated in the first five years of a company's existence.  In the difficult years between 2006 and 2011, approximately 93,000 jobs were created by such companies.</p><p>I believe it is realistic to double the target for the number of people we will employ in start-ups over a five-year period which would involve increasing start-ups by 25%.  It would also improve their survival rate by 25% and would seem more growth to scale.  The target is deliverable and is a big focus for this year.  We will have a start-up gathering later in the year that will put additional focus on implementation in that area.</p><p> The third area is the skills challenge.  We have often understood here that there is a war for talent in every country in the world.  A lot of the new sectors which we must build are very high in their need for new skills and we need to ensure we equip people with those skills.  Some of them involve new apprenticeships and is one key part of this year's activity.  The first call for new apprenticeships in many years was made last January.  This also covers other areas such as ICT and improving the skill-base across all areas.  We have clearly signalled that as in other areas referred to, this might be considered as disruptive reform in that it has a huge impact across the board.</p><p> The final area is around the whole business environment, which has been a continuing theme.  There have been many aspects to it this year.  Perhaps the biggest, in terms of impact, has been the introduction of the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland.  It has committed to provide &euro;800 million in additional resources to SMEs which have found life difficult in the banking environment.  The situation is improving but we still need to equip ourselves with more non-bank sources of funding.</p><p> The last matter I shall draw to the attention of the committee is largely a response to the urging of the committee.  This year, for the first time we have put in place a more clear evaluation framework.  We have identified ten areas against which we benchmark everything.  That means every activity is being benchmarked and they are listed on page 19.  It means every action taken is related back to its impact on some of these key indicators.  A lot of people were keen to see to what extent our actions related to objectives that we are trying to achieve.  One is never going to get an equivalency of action and impact, it is never as neat as that.  The initiative creates a discipline around which we organise and interrogate proposals that come forward to us.  </p><p> Seo &iacute; Seachtain na Gaeilge agus t&aacute; orm c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; as Gaeilge faoin bplean gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta le haghaidh An Post.  T&aacute;im l&aacute;n-s&aacute;sta go sroichfear an sprioc 100,000 post nua a chruth&uacute; i mbliana, bliain ioml&aacute;n roimh an spriocdh&aacute;ta.  I believe we will hit the 100,000 jobs a year before the target.  T&aacute; sprioc eile leagtha amach againn l&aacute;nfhosta&iacute;ocht buan a bhaint amach faoin mbliain 2018.  We have now set ourselves a target of full employment, on a sustainable basis, by 2018.  Ligeann n&aacute;d&uacute;r bliant&uacute;il an phlean d&uacute;inn tosa&iacute;ochta &uacute;ra a chur ar si&uacute;l gach bliain.  The annual nature of the plan allows us to introduce new priorities every year.  </p><p> Is iad na tosa&iacute;ochta nua i 2015 n&aacute; str&aacute;it&eacute;is fhiontair r&eacute;igi&uacute;nach a fhorbairt i ngach ceann d&aacute;r n-ocht r&eacute;igi&uacute;n.

It sets the target that within two years we will double the number of people working within start-ups.  Tionscnamh n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta talainne a fhorbairt chun cinnti&uacute; go mbeadh daoine ann leis na scileanna cu&iacute; chun &eacute;ileamh na n-earn&aacute;lacha fh&aacute;is a chomhl&iacute;onadh.</p><p>We intend to have the skills to support the growth sectors we have identified.

Every job we create is a life back on track.  It is extra spending in the local community and more money into the public services and public finances so we have the options of reducing tax burdens or improving the quality of services.  The work we do on employment is absolutely central to the longer-term ambitions we hold as a nation.</p></speech>

Gabhaim f&aacute;ilte freisin as ucht an &eacute;isteacht a bhfuil &aacute; thabhairt aige don choiste agus go bhfuil ruda&iacute; sa phlean nua seo a th&aacute;inig as an gcoiste seo.  T&aacute; fios agam nach bhfuil Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa ag an Aire agus mar sin cuirfidh m&eacute; mo cheisteanna as B&eacute;arla, ach beidh m&eacute; &uacute;s&aacute;id mo chuid Ghaeilge le linn coic&iacute;os na Gaeilge.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister.  The action plan for 2015 includes points raised by the committee over the past 12 months.  These include the need for regional plans and advanced property solutions in the IDA.  I wish to drill down several aspects with the Minister.  In 2014 the labour force fell, which suggests emigration.  We still have a problem with losing our talented people, the very people for whom the Minister seeks to have a recruitment strategy in this year's action plan.  If the plan is as successful as the Minister would lead us to believe, why are people still leaving the country?  Why is the talent we need to fulfil the objectives of the plan still leaving?</p> <p>  With regard to the CSO figures, of the 80,000 jobs the Minister claims to have created, 27,000 are one-person self-employed operations.  They work in self-employment for at least one hour a week.  During the lifetime of the plan will the Minister monitor how many of these 27,000 people manage to give employment to others and how many leave self-employment to move into the employed labour force?  The number of full-time employee positions created is approximately 50% of the jobs being added.  The majority of jobs seem to be part-time or in zero-hour contracts with little security.  What strategy is in place to address these issues?</p> <p>  With regard to commitments on finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, I am on record as stating it is a mistake.  We need competition in the banking market.  This does not provide competition in the banking market.  It does not make sense to give more money to the two institutions which work very closely together when we could have a new institution trying to shake things up.  Several weeks ago, the Minister announced an extension of the credit guarantee scheme with regard to allowing companies to use it to buy out their borrowings from banks exiting the market.  Has this come into operation?</p> <p>  Some banks which may not be exiting the market are selling their portfolios none the less, and are forcing small and medium enterprises to sell their loan portfolios to investment funds which will have no regard for the employment at stake.  Can we extend the credit guarantee scheme further to include banks staying in the market but actively selling their loan portfolios?</p> <p>  A total of 80,000 people have been on the live register for three years or more, which is the duration of the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>How have they missed out on all this success?  Is specific attention being paid to people who have been on the live register for that long?   Are they part of the 86,000 who are on activation schemes?  Are they churning around various schemes and not being given the chance to access the labour market?</p><p> I welcome the regional plans.  I am sceptical about them but will wait to see them.  What element of co-ordination is underway to ensure the plan we get in the midlands, which will be the first plan, is not replicated in other regions?  Is there co-ordination to ensure the unique selling points of each region are being delivered on and are not been replicated?  There is no point doing the same thing in every region and then the USPs being lost in that process.  Is there a central point for the creation of all the regional plans?  </p><p> Action 52 mentions that there will be a broadband tender in 2015 to get high speed broadband to places where it is not available.  Will the Minister elaborate on that because the national broadband plan published by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, some weeks ago mentioned a deadline of 2020 for a connection to every area which does not have high speed broadband.  I am fully in agreement with the Minister in terms of self-employment and the need for start-ups but we will not have a start-up culture in this country until we get broadband right.  If Romania, which has a very dispersed rural population, can have one of the biggest animation businesses in the world because it got its broadband right, surely we can get ours right also.  </p><p> There is a commitment to cut red tape.  If we are to be the best place in the world to do business in 2016, what specific items of red tape will be cut?  Has agreement been reached on what the Minister defines as red tape and what business might define it as?  Other people or, for the want of a better description, former social partners might define red tape as rights.  What is the position on getting agreement on what constitutes red tape among all sectors because the lack of agreement often stops red tape being removed?</p><p> Bh&iacute; r&oacute;l ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta chun tionscadal idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta a thabhairt go dt&iacute; ceantair Ghaeltachta.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015031000002#H00200"><p>I thank Deputy Calleary for his comprehensive set of questions.  It is true that the labour force fell and that we still have emigration.  However, the latest figure we have is to April of last year and it shows a 30% decline, so a emigration fell from approximately 34,000 to roughly 21,000.  I believe the figure has come down since, and is still on the way down, but we await the figure to bear that out.</p> <p>  The only credible response to emigration is job creation.  If we can continue to grow employment at this pace and with the targets the IDA, the local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland have set, we can deliver full employment over the next four years.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland targets, combined with a reasonable recovery in those other sectors, will deliver that for us but we must keep a sensible set of policies to deliver it.  That is the response to emigration and I would have the ambition that we would see zero emigration over that four-year period. </p> <p>  In regard to the self-employed, we track how many remain as one-man bands and how many grow.</p><p>We track some of them.  Most of the local enterprises grow to having more than one; typically they are two to three person enterprises.  Equally, we see this with the competitive start funds and HPSUs.  They are tracked and all have the capacity to grow more and, by and large, they deliver this.  Some do not grow as rapidly as we would like, but we are tracking them and intend to become more forensic about it.</p><p> We believe survival and scaling are crucial.  The CSO provides a good analysis of the cohort of start ups each year and how they grow.  Interestingly, in that really tough period half of them perished, but the other half created 93,000 jobs.  We are becoming more forensic and also trying to gear our policies to drive growth through mentoring.  We are reviewing our mentoring strategies and, as part of the regional strategies, very keen to build more enterprise hubs to give start-ups a chance of surviving.  One of the things we will be looking for in the regional bids is that they add value and create an environment in which these enterprises can grow.</p><p> If one looks at the QHNS and the increase in employment in the two years 2013 and 2014, all of the extra employment is full-time.  The figures for part-time work actually declined.  I do not accept, therefore, that the majority of jobs are part-time.  In so far as we have data, they prove that most of the growth is in the level of full-time employment.  Yes, there are 450,000 people working part time, but part-time work has always been a feature as it suits some people.  However, we are growing the level of full-time employment.  That is one of the features.  In the last quarter it is interesting that there was a sharp fall in the numbers working part time.  That is a pattern in a recovery that is picking up.  Businesses might initially only take on people part time which then grows.</p><p> We are looking at zero hour contracts.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, issued a consultancy contract which the University of Limerick won.  It will examine the extent of the problem in Ireland.</p><p> The Deputy is being less than fair to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  It is true that it is working initially through the pillar banks.  In the first quarter it has signed up to deliver &euro;400 million through them.  However, the rest of its 2015 programme is to develop new products and new entrants.  It definitely has a mandate to attract and support new entrant to the market.  As that is a key part of its mandate, it is not just about the flow of money, as it were.  As it is a wholesale bank, in the short term it is putting money through the established network, but its ambition clearly is to move well beyond this.  It has set out its stall.  They are longer term loans of up to ten years.  They will be at a lower coupon rate and have a higher risk appetite.  We will now have an arrangement whereby the credit guarantee can be a part of this, and I hope one can have an enhanced set of offerings.  Obviously, it is working its way through.</p><p> We have a credit scheme.  We are drafting the legislation, but, as I told Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n previously in the House, it has proved more complex than we had hoped.  However, we have got over the problems with it and I expect it to move along quite swiftly.  It will include any exiting bank or new entrant; therefore, we are not confining it to existing banks.  I hope, if there are new vehicles, it can be extended to them also.  Clearly, that is our intention.</p></speech>

Let us take the example of a bank that is in the market and selling a portfolio of loans and a customer who is responsible for a loan and trying to obtain finance from another bank but cannot get it.</p><p>The bank is staying in the market.  It is cleaning up its loans and clearing out underperforming loans but the customer's loan is the kind that seems to be falling between the cracks on this.  The bank is not actually exiting the market but it is selling off its loan book.</p></speech>

It cuts both ways.  Some of these investment funds have bought the loans quite cheaply and on some occasions they are willing to enter into reasonable restructuring arrangements.  We are keen to try to fill the gap in so far as we can.  I will get an official to track down some of the examples the Deputy has mentioned so that we can see whether we can accommodate them.</p> <p>  In regard to being three years or more on the live register, it is a striking feature of the QHNS that in the past two years, some 75% of the people who have left the live register have been long-term unemployed, while 25% have been short-term unemployed.  Therefore, there is an impact on the long-term unemployment rate as reported in the QHNS.  Back in 2012, the Pathways to Work programme specifically targeted long-term unemployed people.  It targets and tracks this cohort and has set a target of getting all of these people back into work.  They are consciously tracked within the programme.  This is one of the areas where the programme is ahead of target, in terms of the progress it is making with that group.  The Deputy is right, we always face the danger of people falling between the cracks when we get a shift in sectors.  There is not an easy fit between the skill base of the old sectors in decline and the new sectors.  This is an area that will require sustained work and we need to refresh the instruments for doing that continually.  The call for apprenticeships this year will, I hope, provide a significant opportunity and we must ensure we help people progress to those opportunities.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's fear that we might have a one-size-fits-all enterprise strategy in the regions, but that is not our intention.  We have a regional manager of Enterprise Ireland or the IDA in charge of each region.  These have a mandate to do the preparatory work in the region, to identify within each region the actions that will come from the education and training boards, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland and to bring in the stakeholders to consider what new actions can be taken.  We will have a competitive call for funding and will look not for replicas of previous ideas but for the best ideas from each region.  We expect them to build off regional strengths.  We are trying to structure the strategy in a way that it is not a replica of previous strategies.  The strategy must from be bottom up if it is to succeed.  From the IDA perspective, there will be some top-down input in that it has to look at the identification of sites for advance facilities.  Essentially, these are identified around magnets, such as institutes of technology or similar.</p> <p>  On the broadband question, I understand the tender is to go out in 2016 and that work is under way so that we can have a tender by the end of the year.  Much of the mapping work has been done.</p> <p>  In regard to red tape, it is not in any way an eroding of people's rights.  We would see the Workplace Relations Commission, where the same delays are no longer being encountered, as providing a saving.  Also, the new companies legislation means that from June of this year, people will be able to set up a company with one director and with no requirement for an AGM.  One document sets out the company.  This is a saving, as is the cutting of the threshold for an audit for such a small business.  These are the sort of savings we are after.  We have identified in the plan interactions between the State and business, where we feel going on line or adopting a new approach will improve effectiveness and reduce compliance cost.  However, this in no way alters the policy objectives underpinning the setting up of a company.</p> <p>  On the role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, it is intimately involved our entrepreneurship roll-out and both through our implementation group and the regional implementation group.  We see the &uacute;dar&aacute;s as a central player and stakeholder.</p><p>Its remit is stronger in certain regions than others, but we see it as a crucial player, so we are integrating it into that process.</p></speech>

We are using the CSO data as the authoritative data.  The CSO has confirmed that the net figure of 90,000 is the relevant one for the period since the first quarter of 2012.  Obviously, the agencies collect other figures.  We publish the figures which are independently audited not by the agencies but by means of an independent survey.  They are consistent.  In the past three years we have seen a net increase of approximately 27,000 in the numbers of full-time and part-time jobs supported by IDA Ireland and a net increase of approximately 17,000 in the numbers of full-time and part-time jobs supported by Enterprise Ireland.  The total figure of approximately 44,000 is consistent with the CSO's target.  Obviously, there is independent tracking also.  For example, Bord F&aacute;ilte tracks the tourism sector.  The different sources of employment numbers are consistent in their patterns.  We have defined full employment as 2.1 million people at work.  I think the latest number is 1.938 million.  It is clear, therefore, that there has been a substantial increase in employment as we aim to deliver on the target.  It is credible that we can do this.  If we are to be consistent in meeting our target, we have to reduce the unemployment level, which has decreased to 10% from 15%, to between 5% and 6%.  We are factoring in a need to reduce the rate of emigration to zero.</p></speech>

Its job is to have an evidence-based system for increasing the minimum wage as the system can absorb it.  Obviously, there is a balance to be struck by it in looking at employment creation on the one side and increasing the minimum wage on the other.  That is the balance that will be struck by the fine group of people who are involved who will look at the evidence.  Having it evidence-based is the correct way to proceed.  As the Deputy knows, the Taoiseach has flagged that an input will be made in July.  If this creates issues or problems for employers, mitigation will be looked at as we move towards the budget.  Obviously, the Government will be keen to implement the independent proposal made to it.  Growth in living standards and employment numbers, both of which we need to see, can go hand in hand.  Much of what we are doing involves trying to improve productivity and facilitate business innovations that allow higher living standards to be achieved.</p> <p>  Before I respond to what the Deputy had to say about younger people, it is worth focusing on the strong evidence on the pay front.  The average salary in IDA Ireland-supported employment is approximately &euro;55,000.  The average salary in Enterprise Ireland-supported employment is approximately &euro;42,000.  A very considerable part of the growth in employment is coming from these companies.  We know the average pay of many of those who have benefited from the employment increase because we actually record these figures.  If one examines the CSO's indications for the sectors that are growing, one will see that employment is growing in many high paying sectors, particularly professional services, information and communications technology and high-end industry.</p><p>Of course there is some growth in employment in sectors that are traditionally lower paid, such as the hospitality sector.</p></speech>

There is a mixture of low and high pay, but that is as one would expect.  It is well beside the point to pretend that this is in somehow an increase in low-paid employment.  Much of it is in very highly paid professional services, such as ICT.  Much of the growth areas are in strong sectors with a good, firm, solid base.  It is worth taking a look at some of the recent announcements.  Since the turn of the year we have had such announcements in Fermoy and Dundalk, as well as Combilift in Monaghan, Lakelands in Cavan, Apple in Athenry, Airbnb in Dublin and Northern Trust in Limerick.  These are all in high-paying, good, solid sectors offering long-term prospects.  It is particularly good to see the strength of companies like Combilift, which are combining with other companies to make a pitch to the new apprenticeship scheme.  We will see such companies using the education and training boards to fuel the next phase of growth.  That is what we need to see and it is something that we are encouraging very much.</p> <p>  I hope something was not lost in translation but I think Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n was concerned about the prospects of people aged under 35.  There is no doubt that emigration has hit that age group most strongly but unemployment levels are falling in those age groups and we are seeing growth there.  There is now solid demand for employment in a lot of new sectors.  We are seeing recovery right across areas, including construction, that were traditionally driving emigration.  It will take time to get emigration down but it has dropped by 30% in the last 12 months.  The data show that and it is a significant and healthy step.</p> <p>  In a small open economy one needs to examine the net emigration figure.  People are leaving and coming, which is a feature of the Irish environment.  We want to ensure that on balance there are more people coming than leaving.  That is the target we are trying to achieve.  Our ambition for full employment is the only credible approach.  The sort of policies that will make that a reality include a focus on enterprise, competitiveness and innovation, particularly in these Irish-based companies.  These are still the drivers we will need to ensure growth and, indeed, tax policy is consistent with that.</p> <p>  The IDA has set targets for a 30% to 40% increase in the number of projects in each region.  The IDA admits it did not hit the target on the last occasion but as we have discussed in this committee on a number of occasions it is steadily growing that.  Back in 2011, it was just 23%, while last year it was up to 37%.  There is traction, therefore, and that continues to be the case, as can be seen from some of the announcements since the turn of the year, particularly the one in Fermoy.  Anyone who has visited Fermoy will know what a great boon that was, as is the Athenry decision.  There is a proven track record given that the IDA is putting nine advance facilities into each of the regions.  It is a proven model whereby the IDA can win projects and it will also enhance its ability to deliver this target.</p> <p>  The employment base in the LEOs is a combination both of the existing county enterprise boards, as they were, and the new local authorities.</p><p>We are continuing to work with each of them to ensure there is a proper complement of staff.  We also have sanction for some recruitment within the LEO network where we will be filling posts and we will have a graduate programme under which we will supplement the LEOs with graduate placement.</p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of clusters.  That is a challenge that is part of the regional strategy.  The IDA ill be seeking to build off the base of the institutes of education and the existing base of companies.  Clearly it will work with the pharma industry, not only in the south but in the south east where there are strong medical devices and ICT in the west in several regions.  As food is increasingly seen as a very strong cluster in certain regions it must be developed and we are seeing engineering particularly connected to agriculture which is a really strong cluster.  The way to build those is by having the apprenticeship schemes and research and to develop support and clustering of those companies.  One of the things we would hope to see emerge from the regional call is that there are serious clusters forming within regions around which a network can be built.  While Enterprise Ireland and the IDA can, to a degree, from their own knowledge of their base identify the clusters, much of this is about getting people to come forward with their own commitments, to work together and to draw down funds on the basis of the quality of proposals that are put together.  This is a way of developing new clusters or new networks or maybe just start up hubs or accelerators.</p><p> There are many things we could see emerge in our regions that would strengthen their capacity.  It may be food hubs or design hubs.  There are different ways in which we could play off the strengths of any one of those regions and their base of companies and their education base.  Waterford Institute of Technology is outstanding.  As it is located in the south east I know it better but there are some very strong technologies there from which one could see a greater regional impact emerge.</p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of online trading.  This is a huge change that is occurring and it is impacting on the high street.  We are putting in place online vouchers.  The former county enterprise boards and now the local enterprise offices are encouraging more people to go online.  The online route is a very successful strategy for many rural based businesses and is doing very well.  I could show members dozens of companies which have transformed their performance and their prospects through very good online trading models.</p><p> I do not deny that we continue to have a problem in rural high streets.  I am aware from people I meet that there is a change in the way people consume literature, music and even boutiques are changing.  There is a huge change and it is posing serious challenges to some of our traditional high street activities.  We have to innovate, there is no way of going back.  One cannot tell consumers to change back to the way they were, we have to offer ways to adapt.  Online trading and the smarter retail compliance portal which we are developing are ways of helping the retail sector to get through this difficult period.  In time, consumer demand recovery will be a big part of this and we are gradually beginning to see that recovery spread.  It is making an impact.  It can be seen in certain areas of retail but, unfortunately, not on all parts at this stage. </p></speech>

There are many other cross-Border initiatives which are not being developed by InterTradeIreland.  In the context of INTERREG, there are infrastructural projects under way.  There are a number of areas in which collaboration continues to take place.  Obviously, both sides have experienced difficulties in the context of funding.  In the light of budgetary considerations, InterTradeIreland has encountered such difficulties.  However, there is goodwill and also very practical support in encouraging companies in the South to trade in the North and <i>vice versa</i>.  There is healthy growth in cross-Border trade, which is the ultimate test in what we are trying to achieve.  There has been progress, but both economies must continue to grow.  The growth figure for the North stands at 1.8%, which is a sign that there is increasing confidence.  The cross-Border surveys we conduct indicate growing confidence and expectations among businesses that they are going to be able to take on additional employees and also increase their levels of spending.</p><p>We are doing all we can to provide support.  Enterprise Ireland already provides placements - for example, under its leadership for growth programme - for Northern companies that want to develop the capabilities of some of their leaders.  There is a great deal of practical collaboration.  We are also taking a joint approach to many of the projects relating to Horizon 2020.  Eight North-South collaborative projects have won funding in the first phase of Horizon 2020.  It is our ambition to win &euro;145 million for such projects overall.  In the context of support for Horizon 2020, Enterprise Ireland has very close connections with its counterpart organisation in the North to ensure the joint approach to which I refer will be successful.  The projects we have put forward jointly have enjoyed better success rates.  There is a great deal of practical work being done and it is having an impact.  It may be low key in nature, but it is extremely practical and delivering results.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015031000002#Q00800"><p>N&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilge agam; therefore, I will speak in English.  </p> <p>  The Minister is to be congratulated on the employment figures.  Employment levels have improved hugely and the Companies Act 2014 is going to be of considerable assistance in reducing the difficulties experienced by start-up companies in seeking to commence operations.  There are still problems when it comes to establishing new businesses.  On previous occasions I have referred to the fact that the authorities in New Zealand have made it possible for a new business to establish operations in one day at a cost of less than &euro;100.  In Ireland a person seeking to set up a business must first approach a commissioner for oaths to make the necessary arrangements.  On the second day he or she must go to the Companies Registration Office and, on the third, will be obliged to register for VAT and corporation tax.  On the fourth, he or she will receive his or her company seal.</p><p>I understand it takes six days in total to get a new company opened in Ireland, whereas it can be done much more quickly in other countries.  Singapore is number one for ease of doing business, while Ireland is number 13.</p><p> A disappointing omission from the plan is any reference to the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  There was at least a mention of it last year, but it is not mentioned at all this time, even though it continues to be a huge deterrent to anybody wishing to set up a business.</p><p> The plan does include a reference to crowd funding, which offers a viable alternative to bank funding.  It is possible to do something in this regard, but it will require legislation to ensure people will be confident to invest on this basis.</p><p> I have some concerns about the tradition of leaving old laws and regulations in place rather than automatically getting rid of them.  The Government has a policy of seeking to remove legislation that no longer applies from the Statute Book, but that policy does not seem to have come as far as it should in practice.</p><p> An issue that attracts a lot of attention is that we in Ireland are very poor when it comes to language learning and skills.  There have been several instances where foreign companies have set up here with the intention of taking on hundreds of staff only to discover that Irish people cannot apply because they do not have the required foreign language skills.  That is a problem that remains to be addressed.</p><p> The Minister will not be able to solve all of these problems or solve all of them easily, but one issue he could address without delay is that of business start-up procedures.  It should be possible to do more online rather than requiring people to do four, five or six things.  The Minister has emphasised that increasing the number of business start-ups is a target for him.  Something can be done here to help ensure that target will be met.</p><p> The Minister has heard me speak about the French system under which the same laws do not apply to small companies as are applicable to large companies.  This means that a firm employing fewer than 50 people is not required to meet the same level of regulation as a company on the scale of Google, for instance.  If we are to succeed in making Ireland the best place in which to do business, we must ensure it is easy to start a business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015031000002#R00200"><p>I appreciate the Senator's deep interest in these matters.  If it would be helpful, I will send him the metrics tracked by the Companies Registration Office, CRO.  To be fair to that office, it has cut the number of days involved in the process of setting up a business and increased the percentage of interactions that can be completed online.  The progress in this regard is very impressive.  The Revenue Commissioners, meanwhile, comes out as one of the best, if not the very best, in the world when it comes to ease of complying with the corporate taxation process and so on.  I will ask the new head of the CRO for a report on what more could be done to move the process online.  Between now and June, a major effort is being made to familiarise people with the new company set-up process.  People will have to, over 18 months, opt for one or other of the new company structures.  As a consequence, there will be something of a peak in work as we try to migrate people from the old, more bureaucratic system to the newer, simpler one.  We might have to accept a slight blip in the numbers because of that large body of work, but it will be well worthwhile.  The Senator has been very consistent on this issue and we will seek to come back to him on it.</p> <p>  The consolidation of legislation is a hugely complex process.  We have put through the Bill to establish the Workplace Relations Commission and I thank Deputies and Senators for their patience in working with us on it.  They saw how complex that legislation was and it did not involve a consolidation of labour law, which is a project that remains to be done.  Consolidation is important in the longer term, but it can be very grinding work.  One of our priorities was to have the consumer and competition agencies merged.</p><p>We wanted to have Forf&aacute;s integrated into the Department and create a new dynamo in Shannon to drive the whole region.  We wanted to get our workplace relations scheme up being to world class, with a much more efficient way of doing things.  This has taken priority, if one likes, over the sweeping out of the attic of old laws and regulations.  However, I take the Senator's point and the matter is certainly on my agenda.</p><p> The lack of language skills is a real problem.  We have a competence in languages.  From memory, approximately 38,000 students take languages in their leaving certificate examinations, obviously excluding Irish and English, which is a substantial part of the total cohort.  While we have a significant number who have language competence, they do not appear to be able to fill some of the positions for which one needs a language.  They do not speak the language and this appears to be a problem in meeting many of the language requirements of businesses.  Where people have a reasonable competence to speak German, French or Spanish, with sales or technical capability, we are definitely setting targets to improve in this regard.  Acquiring language skills is a longer term project and probably is within the education system.  The aforementioned figure of 38,000 is not a bad number and it is probably a question of increasing the competence level of those 38,000 people to a level at which they could do more with the language.</p><p> As for small company exemptions, obviously they will be introduced this year with the Companies Act on the audit side, while the accountancy directive will have measures on the audit side.  However, if we were to dilute labour rights for companies below a certain size, the Government would rightly be excoriated for so doing by Deputies Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, John Lyons and others.  There are some rights one cannot reduce by virtue of a company being small.  It is difficult to identify measures if they are related to a company's size - audit being a good example - but if there are practical examples from the French, I would certainly be open to considering them.  There is a limited amount of crowdfunding, an issue on which a group from the Departments of Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation - the SME State bodies group - is working.  I must obtain a report for the Senator on the progress it has made.  Nothing made it this year into the legislative programme and while some would like to see tax advantages, they did not make the cut.  However, it is certainly an idea to which we can be open.  In other countries it is a small but interesting area.  While it is not massive, it is one we definitely must keep in mind.</p><p> The question of upward-only rent reviews comes down to constitutional change.  Were one to cut the rent paid to people who might themselves have debts, it is clear one would have to compensate them.  With all of the other obligations taxpayers are trying to meet, taking up the slack for high rents simply has not been affordable.  The Government has looked to the market to adjust and while I accept that it has not always adjusted, there has also been a good deal of progress in this regard.  </p><p> I believe those are the issues which were raised.</p></speech>

Everybody has talked about the recent development by Apple, but we must also examine the role of the county council through the county development plan.  My colleague from Athenry, Councillor Peter Feeney, very much led the concept of the Athenry-Oranmore economic corridor which he pushed as part of the county development plan.  It is a region that is well served by motorway infrastructure, including the M6 to Dublin and the planned Cork to Tuam motorway which is under construction and will be very important in terms of job creation and future investment.  The area is also well served by a 220 kV power line.  It should be acknowledged that the county council was to the fore in pushing the concept of the strategic corridor.  Not everything comes from the Government and the local authorities have a very important role to play.</p><p> Broadband has been mentioned and is part of the plan to be put out to tender.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, has laid out the plan which must be pushed to ensure it will happen.  We have had so many launches of broadband strategies in recent years by successive Governments that there is an element of disbelief that this will happen.  The previous national broadband plan did not work.  While it looked good on paper and we debated it at county council level, it did not deliver proper broadband infrastructure to the most rural regions.  The new plan must deliver; it must be rolled out, must be real and ensure rural areas receive a proper service.  The Government must obtain permission from the Commission regarding EU state aid rules and the plan needs to be pushed to ensure it will happen quickly.</p><p> Does the Minister envisage any role for credit unions or will the strategic bank be sufficient in providing funding for SMEs?  This issue has been debated here previously.  Will he consider extra competition from the credit unions?  There was a pilot project in Kilkenny.  We have moved from over-reliance on the construction sector to a situation where we need to encourage house building.  We have a very comprehensive Government plan on social housing and acknowledge the creation of more than 7,000 construction sector jobs in 2014 and the plans the Minister is preparing on the reduction of the social and affordable housing requirement to 10%, with the stipulation that the houses will actually have to be provided and that there will be no cash buy-out in lieu of responsibilities.  Given that lending to developers is not an easy or popular concept, how will they obtain finance?  Not everybody can decide in the morning to become a developer.  Not everybody has the wherewithal, capability, knowledge and confidence to apply for planning permission and build 30 to 100 houses.  Previously, developers would have funded new developments from the proceeds of the sale of existing developments and by borrowing.  Does the Minister envisage any issue regarding having enough builders interested in building and being able to secure finance to fund projects?</p><p> I have consulted senior people in Galway regarding software engineers and there seems to be a worldwide shortage and an inability on the part of universities to provide places and produce graduates.  Perhaps the standard of mathematics is too high.  This issue must be examined.  People may need to be directed, pushed, advised or incentivised to move into the area.</p><p>I look forward to the regional plans.  An area like mine obviously has both strengths and weaknesses.  The Government has targeted tourism in Connemara through the Wild Atlantic Way and the greenways, and the cuts to the travel tax and VAT have incentivised tourism development more widely.  In Galway city and its outskirts, we have been fortunate to attract foreign direct investment which has been hugely beneficial this year and in previous years.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA have helped Galway to attract investment but it is also clearly a popular destination because it has the infrastructure and critical mass of population.  We have also seen the beneficial impact of clustering on the region.  I commend the Minister, his Department and the relevant statutory bodies for their work in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015031000002#U00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the support he has shown for the regional strategy.  He correctly noted that bigger infrastructural players are also important to the development of the regions.  We see the regional enterprise strategy as an annual strategy which drives enterprise capabilities but also offers opportunities to incorporate regional strategies into longer term infrastructural planning on the part of councils.  We want to ensure enterprise priorities are part of the regional thinking of local authorities and the system of regional governance when it comes to infrastructure planning.  In the short term we are working with what we have but in the longer term we will be able to make an input into deciding what infrastructure might be usefully developed.  I recognise the work that the council has done in respect of the strategic corridor.  One of the lessons of the Athenry example is that by working with the IDA and giving some thought to infrastructure, property and other types of solutions, we can strengthen the capacity of our regions.  We want to see more people working to the same set of objectives in order to deliver wins in the regions.  I was surprised at the disconnect that had developed in some cases between agencies and other stakeholders in the regions.  This will bring the stakeholders together in a very tangible way, while also oiling the relationship with funds which they can jointly compete to deliver.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the challenge and importance of broadband.  In terms of providing the last 30% with decent bandwidth, we are looking at covering 96% of the land area of the island to reach that 30%.  The first 4% got 70% and the remaining 96% gets the other 30%.  That is indicative of the scale of the challenge of delivering the network but it is crucial none the less.</p> <p>  We envisage that credit unions can be players in the loan guarantee scheme.  Other issues of a regulatory nature have curtailed them at times, however.  I understand that last week the Department of Finance attempted to introduce a matchmaker arrangement between developers, equity providers and bankers.  It is some mixture of mezzanine finance, lending and equity.  Developers probably got used to the model of 100% lending, which is gone forever.  This matchmaking reflects an attempt to develop new models.  I have not heard a report on the success or otherwise of the initiative.</p><p>There are players in this field, but we must match them with the sites that can be developed.  It is regarded as a high priority and I hope it will prove to be a successful model.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has introduced other instruments via the planning Acts, for example, applying flexibility in development charges to existing as well as new permissions.</p><p> There is a worldwide shortage of software engineers.  We have set a target in this year's plan to increase the output of ICT graduates by 60% by 2018.  This is one of the areas in which industry, universities and other institutes of education have collaborated well.  They have good Springboard and graduate programmes in place and there has been good work experience and cross-fertilisation in the sector via the education network.  However, even this ambition is not enough.  In 2011, 45% of needs were met domestically.  By 2018, we plan for this figure to be 75%.  We are pushing up the percentage, but we are chasing a moving target that is growing larger.</p><p> The Deputy is right, in that more work is necessary on the choices people make in their careers.  The extra points for mathematics led to a 70% increase in the number opting to take honours maths.  We should start considering whether we could include other incentives, financial or otherwise, to encourage people to take courses that would undoubtedly fuel a great deal of growth in new sectors.  Some work is being done on the impact of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  I am looking forward to meeting the team working on that project and gaining an understanding of the constraints on the HEA.  Moving from one type of education to another quickly is difficult, but we must find ways to meet skill needs.  I agree with the Deputy in that respect.</p></speech>

There is an inherent problem in terms of attitudes towards foreign direct investment and indigenous industry.  We have had considerable success in developing indigenous industry, creating jobs and so on and it should be made clear to the rest of the world that this is as important as encouraging foreign direct investment.  Since the 1950s, it has been the "sexy" bit.</p> <p>  We must encourage more entrepreneurs.  We know from studies that early stage businesses create the most jobs.  There is some scepticism in Departments in that they do not trust entrepreneurs.  I do not want present company to take this personally, but when it comes to social welfare, maternity leave and so on, the employer or self-employed person has stricter rules applied to him or her as if he or she is up to something in claiming maternity benefit.  As such, there is a major job to be done in the social welfare system.  The fact that starting a business or being self-employed is a demanding way of life is ignored.  Businesses cannot survive otherwise; it is not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job.  A string of penalties are applied to the self-employed but not to their employees.</p><p>We have to sort that out fast and get the message out that we want more business start-ups.  We are doing the rapporteur study, the Chair has initiated the study on women entrepreneurs from this committee.  It will highlight these points as we go along.  The big, sexy companies like Glanbia are brilliant when they are expanding but they all started out small.  I would like to see the Minister saying via megaphone that it is important to Ireland to develop our own indigenous companies, although we are delighted to have foreign direct investment and the 12.5% corporation tax rate is brilliant.  We are standing on our heads to get them to come. </p><p> Regarding the self-employed, the Minister knows as well as I do that there are brakes on people from a social welfare point of view.  The taxation system should be there to encourage more entrepreneurs.  I must repeat that there is a negative attitude towards self-employed people in the Department.  I am not being personal, there are very good people here, but others definitely feel the self-employed are up to something and do not trust them.  It is a cultural thing and we have to get over it.  When I was a teenager, to go into business or trade was seen as the pits, God almighty.  It took us a good while to cop on that we needed it.  It is still very much the attitude within the bureaucracy that they are up to something.  </p><p> What can we say about indigenous industry?  We want more Irish people whom we believe in and trust.  How do we encourage them from a tax point of view?  It is an even greater problem now, as the economy is turning, that people want to go and get good jobs in Google, Facebook and the likes.  I was discussing it with my colleague, Connie Doody, who set up Lir Chocolates with me.  She was wondering how involved in our society people working big jobs on big salaries in multi-nationals are.  Are they so well paid and looked after?  From my observation here in Leinster House, the management of people in the public sector does not seem to take account of the person.  If someone goes into Google or something like that, management is going to be training them for the job, watching them develop.  They need employees to do that.  What is happening with the human person who comes in the door into the public sector?  Are they encouraged to develop their career?  Are they put into the job where they have the appropriate skill?  We cannot afford to have a square peg in a round hole in private business.  There is great potential for entrepreneurship in the public sector as well.  We have had numerous examples of that and need more.  </p><p> I congratulate the Minister on what he has done, although he dodged the emigration question a bit.  I have been on to the Central Statistics Office trying to get the exact figures and we only have them up to April 2014.  There are 1,600 people emigrating per week, 800 Irish and 800 non-Irish.  Very few of them are coming back.  The Taoiseach said last week that emigration has a devastating impact on our economy as we lose the input of people of talent and energy.</p><p>Finally, I will turn to the sidekick of the TILDA study in Trinity, in which the ESRI is looking at the effect of emigration on older parents and particularly the mothers, who see their children going off.  It affects older people in particular to see their children going off and not wanting to come back.  It affects their mental health and their happiness.  Given all the ambition they had and sacrifices they made to send their children to university and to third level colleges, that must hurt.  As the report says, it affects people's mental health and this leads to physical decline.  We talk about the ones who emigrate, but what about the ones who are left at home, whose children have gone off?  I presume emigration has decreased somewhat, but the official figures are still 1,600 a week.</p></speech>

The gross increase considerably exceeds that of the IDA.  We are seeing a new pattern evolve in what the Germans would call Mittelstand companies.  Enterprise Ireland has played a significant role in that, developing the leadership for growth programme, which the Senator knows about.

They are globally ambitious now.  Combilift is a good case.  It recently committed to a greenfield site and will increase its numbers by 200.  We are seeing more and more of those companies.  That is part of it.  The other part of it, as the Senator rightly says, is start-ups.  To be fair to my Department, 70% of our money goes to Irish businesses and 30% to foreign ones, so far and away the majority of our money goes to small start-ups, growth phasing, and scaling.  To listen to the announcements, one might not think that was the ratio, but much of what we have done in the last while is aimed at start-ups.  The tax relief available to start-ups has now been extended to all sectors.  We are unique in Ireland in having competitive feasibility, competitive start, high-potential start-ups and equity investment from the State.  One will not find that anywhere in Europe.  We have 26 incubators in every institute of technology; we have the local enterprise network in 31 counties; we are reviewing the mentoring programmes; we have stripped out company law to make it much easier to set up a company, so that those start-ups have a much cleaner ability to form companies; and they have tax concessions for the first three years.  Much has been done between microfinance and the young entrepreneurs competition last year, which received a staggering 1,100 responses.  There is a great deal happening and people are seeing that Ireland is a good place to start a business but maybe it is too well-kept a secret and we should be promoting it more within-----</p></speech>

It is an educational process.  It is about letting people see that to try and to fail is not the end of the world and getting more serial entrepreneurs.  We also want to see more people supporting entrepreneurship in their own communities.  I do not think official Ireland has some downer on the self-employed or small employers, but I take the Senator's point that we need to make that interaction, while absolutely legitimate, easier to do.</p><p>Our interactions, including the time it takes to get a work permit, the time it takes to get an employment case heard and the time it takes to form a company, are improving all the time.  Within my Department I have set the expectation that we will continually improve those metrics because they are the key to the interface with small companies or those that might be forming.</p><p> I believe the Senator is looking at the gross figure for emigration and she needs to look at the net figure.  There are always people who come and go, but the net figure, which hit a high of 35,000, is on the way down now; it was 21,000 at the last time it was recorded.  The net flows are moderating, which is in accordance with us creating employment.  The figures were at their peak when there was zero or negative jobs growth.  Now as we see employment grow, they are coming down.  The only way to get them down to zero is to have better employment growth and more opportunities at home.</p><p> The Senator raised a much bigger issue of developing talent in the public service.  I would say the Secretary General would be better equipped to answer that.  It has certainly been a difficult time in the public service.  There have not been promotion opportunities and it has been very bottled up, which has an impact.  However, to be fair there has been an extraordinary entrepreneurial spirit, if one wants to call it that, in being willing to change systems.  That is happening throughout.  I see it in my Department, with all the agencies we have merged.  We have changed working relationships across the board.  It is there in both the public and private sector.  It perhaps is not acknowledged as much as it should be in the public service.</p><p> Today, on the day that is in it, we should acknowledge the success of Pfizer, which has undergone an extraordinary adjustment.  I know the unions, SIPTU and TEEU, have been very influential in getting a deal across the line that has allowed those jobs to be secured in Cork.  It is a fantastic indication that people with their backs to the wall have been flexible, whether they have been in the public or private sector.  That has been one of the success stories of this very difficult time, indicating that people have had the ingenuity to solve difficult problems.</p><p> I am reminded of the former Senator, Mr. Joe Lee.  I am not sure if members have read his book.  He used to say all we wanted was a safe job in the public service, a bit of land or a job in the bank and that was the height of our expectations or ambition.  We now have a very different generation who regard entrepreneurship as natural.  They have the self-confidence that goes with that.  I hope the policies we are putting in place will build on that.</p></speech>

Has a date been set for the launch of the midlands one, in which I am obviously very interested?</p> <p>  On the talent bank and the national skills strategy, Senator White referred to the report on women in entrepreneurship.  She gave me credit for initiating it, but in fact she initiated it and I supported her in it.  A witness who appeared before the committee talked about the importance of salesmanship in everything that is happening here at the moment.  She was very clear that it is not necessary to be the expert in order to get a company up and running.  Someone with the skills and talent to get the company going can bring in what is needed.  She made the point about salesmanship.  The Minister referred to sales and language.  I ask him to comment on whether we should focus more on it.</p> <p>  I attended the launch of the Startup Gathering last week.  It is a tremendous initiative and I hope it will be very successful.  What outcomes does the Minister expect from that through the Action Plan for Jobs?</p> <p>  Regarding what Senator White was saying about the Enterprise Ireland funding, is it possible for us to get details on the amount of investment in companies on a county-by-county basis?  I recently came across a document indicating that more than 400 jobs had been created in County Offaly, which I represent, through Enterprise Ireland investment.  I thought that was a fantastic figure but nobody is really talking about it, whereas if there was an FDI announcement of 30 jobs, it would be all over the newspapers.</p><p>Sometimes we do not recognise our own talent.  These are the people who are working on the ground and developing, over decades perhaps, outstanding companies and who are aided and abetted by the State agencies and the Departments.  From that perspective, it would be good for us to come up with some idea of, first, how we can get the word out about the outstanding indigenous companies we already have across the country and, second, how to reach out to others which might need a little more support.  The Government has already done this in a way through the website<i>actionplanforjobs.ie</i>.  This is a great idea as it brings together all the supports available to start-ups.  <br/><br/>I have also heard comment on local employment offices, LEOs, and whether a consistent approach across the country is being applied or whether they are being left to their own devices with different budgets and emphases in different areas.  It might be possible to clarify that.  Finally, there is a question about the CEDRA report and how this fits in.  There are some great recommendations in the report such as on rural economic development zones.  Some counties have already been proactive on this.  How will that report feed in so that we can see results very quickly?  Marrying the regional strategy and the CEDRA report may be the blueprint for getting action into the regions very quickly. </p></speech>

It is at the front of the queue.  However, we want it to be the best it can be.  We are therefore not rushing it out too quickly.  We want to ensure whatever we have learnt is applied.  The national talent drive is crucial.  With the establishment of the education and training boards, a big priority for this year is the engagement of both them and the higher education institutes with enterprise, and to improve their interplay.  The jury is out on how successful this is.  We had the apprenticeship call.  I hope it is successful.  We need to see more engagement by enterprise with our education system.  There probably has been faults on both sides.  The education and training system may have got a little detached and employers probably could not afford to maintain traineeships and apprenticeships.  This bridge needs to be rebuilt.  Rebuilding this bridge is a big issue and the Minister of State, Deputy English, is committed to it.</p> <p>  On salesmanship, Mr. Fitzgerald tells me that we have a call out for Springboard courses to help firms sell internationally and to develop related skills.  This would be in the second quarter of this year.  I agree that we are great at marketing but not at selling.  Ultimately, people have to sell our products.  We have undervalued this skill.  We may look to go back to the well again next year in this area because it is probably underdeveloped.  </p> <p> The Start-up Gathering, at this stage, is modelled somewhat on the tourism initiative, The Gathering, except it is sectorally driven.  Five sectors and five cities have been identified as well as the sort of programmes to be run.  The initiative has a call out.  The KPI, key performance indicator, if one wishes to call it that will depend on the quality of the call.  Eoin Costello is very enthusiastic and he has a very good committee.  We have put some money in and he has good sponsors behind him.  It is something we should be doing to get the message out, not only internationally but at home, that start-ups are a part of what we are.  It should be part of our DNA.  The initiative, which dovetails with our implementation of the enterprise strategy, will have an impact.  We discussed at our ministerial board how we can get more recognition for this kind of Irish based initiative.  We are looking at how we could do it and we will revert to the committee on that.</p><p>I wish to thank members of the committee for their support for <i>actionplanforjobs.ie</i>.  At every meeting I attend, I am struck by the small percentage of people who really understand what is out there for them.  Some 90% have said they do not fully understand what is available and they want more information, so we are trying to make that easier. <br/><br/>We want to make local enterprise offices more consistent and every one of them will have to submit a plan that will be vetted by the centre of excellence in Enterprise Ireland.  They are under a service level agreement and we will be seeking a consistency of approach.  We also want to promote some innovation so we will be having a competitive call.  In that way, those with good ideas who are showing ambition and innovation in partnering in their county, will win more resources.  We hope the combination of consistency plus some incentive to do new things will be a successful approach.  <br/><br/>The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, will shortly be making an announcement on the Leader programme which is an element of it, as are the rural enterprise development zones.  Members of the committee should therefore direct such questions to her Department, rather than mine.  I hope that what we are doing at regional level will dovetail with some of these initiatives, even though we have a stricter focus on building enterprise start-ups.</p></speech>

This is the beginning of a very important process.  We have given ourselves a significant and important task, to set up an electoral commission in Ireland.</p><p>I will be brief in my opening remarks because I would be better off hearing from the members of the committee and starting the process of engagement.  That would create more value from the time we have.</p><p> On 27 January last, I stood with the Chairman of this committee on the steps of Leinster House to announce the publication of the consultation paper on the establishment of an electoral commission in Ireland.  I said then, and have repeated many times since this is an issue of the highest priority.  I feel passionately about it because the establishment of such a commission is long overdue.  I am here to listen to the views of committee members as parliamentarians and as practitioners with expertise in how the current system works.  To be frank and to be fair, there is not necessarily a right and wrong answer to many of the issues here.  It is about fermenting the collective view of all of us about how we should proceed, what we should proceed with and exactly what we are defining.  We have to leave our political affiliations outside the door on this issue.  This is about democracy and about elections, which are the ultimate tool of democracy.  It makes sense to work together to bring about the reforms we all desire and need.  There is a good and practical reason for the approach we are talking about today.</p><p> A key lesson from international experience is that significant changes in electoral governance ideally need to command broad political and public support.  Quite frankly, there would be no point in the Government driving home an electoral commission.  It would be a waste of time.  Broad political and public support is needed from across the body politic.  The people have to come with us.  We have to see measured improvements in what we are doing.  That is why everyone has to be involved in this.  For those reasons, consultation is not just desirable - it is absolutely necessary.  There is a fermenting process here.  Over a good period of time, we will constantly return to issues and re-evaluate positions.  We will need to do that.  The role of this committee is absolutely central to this process.  That is why we have gone down this route.  It is important that we build and maintain momentum in developing and implementing the necessary legislation.  Therefore, I welcome the priority the committee has given to this consultation paper.</p><p> I was in the Seanad last week to debate a Private Members' motion on the establishment of an electoral commission.  I found our good exchange of ideas and views most helpful.  Some of the Members of the Seanad who were present for that debate are here now.  I hope they will get a chance today to elaborate further on their views.  I hope those who did not get a chance to speak last week will get a chance to do so today.  It is important to hear from all members of the committee if time allows.  The consultation paper sets out 11 questions.  As the members of the committee have seen them, I do not need to read them out again.  I will summarise the significant issues that members are being asked to examine.  First, they will need to consider what functions should be assigned to an electoral commission.  Some or all of the responsibilities assigned to various bodies and office holders in the current system could be assigned to the planned new structure.  We need to learn from the good models that are in operation elsewhere and are examined in the consultation paper.</p><p> The paper also reviews earlier proposals from Oireachtas committees, political parties, research reports and a myriad of other sources.  There is a wide range of opinion on what exactly such a body should do and how it should work.  It is clear that improving the electoral register is an important driving force underpinning the desire to establish an electoral commission in Ireland.  I am sure colleagues will want to discuss this.  The register of electors is probably the single topic that is most frequently debated and is most prominent in all the reports and recommendations we have.  Most proposals see some form of centralised system of registration being managed by the new electoral commission.  For example, it could assume responsibilities from the local authorities.  One option envisages the new commission overseeing the work of local authorities, which could continue to have a role.</p><p> Most of the proposals made by other bodies to date involve the transfer of the operational responsibilities of my Department in respect of elections to the electoral commission.  I would like the committee's views on that.  I am fairly open to this.  The role that is likely to be played by the current D&aacute;il returning officers in a new configuration has been considered to a lesser extent.  What do we need to do there?  What role will there be?</p><p>We need to consider whether the electoral commission will take on the responsibilities currently performed by the Standards in Public Office Commission under the electoral Acts.  The review of electoral boundaries and the role currently performed by the Constituency Commission are also identified as potential responsibilities.  We need to do a great deal of deep thinking on this issue as the analysis shows that changes in population are going to cause issues continuously.  It may be time we looked at this in a different way.  Voter education appears commonly and prominently as a possible role.  Another issue is whether the electoral commission would have an advisory role in respect of the Minister.  I am open on this one, although I am not sure about it.  The role would need to be defined, but is there a role at all?  That is something we will have to debate.  It is not self-evident what functions should be assigned to an electoral commission or how it should work.  These are questions that we will have to answer.</p><p> Another issue is the cost of an electoral commission.  A key reason for the creation of new public bodies lies in the scope to improve cost-effectiveness and efficiency in the use of public money.  The costs associated with different aspects of the current system are set out in section 3 of the consultation paper.  I ask members to examine them in their deliberations and consider them when they come to make recommendations.  It cannot simply be assumed that economies will be achieved in setting up a new body.  This is an important point.  It cannot be assumed that just because we set up an electoral commission savings will be generated.  We do not need to look 1 million miles back into history to know this.  It is possible that net savings may not be achieved, especially if new and additional work is to be assigned to the electoral commission.  Given the scale of expenditure in administering the electoral system and the cost of setting up a new body, financial considerations must be part of the debate.  However, they are not the only part of it, but where do we draw the line?  Is it about efficiency, democracy, or economies of scale?  Of course, it is about democracy, but at what point do we say financial considerations and a more costly structure must be taken into account?</p><p> The next issue is the membership of an electoral commission.  As the consultation paper shows, electoral management bodies internationally vary in their numbers of members.  It has been observed, however, that those with large memberships are usually less effective.  Different options are considered in the consultation paper.  We could have a membership comprising various independent office holders or nominees, as we have currently with the Standards in Public Office Commission and the Constituency Commission.  We could use a different model.  A key issue is whether the commission should include members from a political background such as former Members of the Houses.  There are very different opinions on this issue and they are set out in the consultation paper.  I would really like to get the views of committee members on this point, on which I have a mixed view.  I can see why one would use former politicians and practitioners, but I can also see why people might not want them on the commission.  Whoever the members of the commission are, we need to ensure they will be selected or appointed in a manner that will seek to guarantee their independence as absolute.</p><p> Accountability, performance and audit are key and need to be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the independence of the electoral commission.  The experience in other countries points to both the desirability and necessity of having accountability mechanisms linked with democratic institutions.  These include, for example, formal reporting arrangements to a designated parliamentary committee; the identification of a specific Minister as a liaison with the electoral commission; independent audit arrangements, and the publication of documents against which performance can be assessed, including a statement of strategy, budget plan and an annual report.  Do we want to replicate similar arrangements here or do we want to do something different?</p><p> I made it clear when launching the consultation paper that the task involved a significant job of work.  From a timescale point of view, we need to do it as efficiently as possible, as well as doing it right.  That is paramount.  The establishment of an electoral commission will not take place before the next general election.  It will take a number of years to establish it.  The development of legislation is a necessary first step which we are now taking.  Before the end of this D&aacute;il, I intend to have the legislation in place.  That is what I want to commit to.  When the committee reverts with its views, I will proceed with the preparation of the heads of an electoral commission Bill and will not be found wanting in driving this work forward.  I would like to discuss timescales with the Chairman here or off-site at some point.</p><p>I will be guided by the members regarding the timescale for reverting to me.</p><p> The lessons from other countries are worth heeding.  Significant change takes time and requires planning.  It took almost four years to amalgamate the current functions of the New Zealand Electoral Commission into one body.  This was done on a phased basis between 2008 and 2012.  The transfer of the electoral register was handled as a specific phase.  Establishing the National Register of Electors in Canada took almost four years from commencement in 1993 to full implementation in 1997.  It took a further three years after implementation for the changes to bed down, and there were teething problems.</p><p> In 2008, the preliminary study on the establishment of an electoral commission, prepared by the Geary Institute in UCD on behalf of my Department, considered the phasing of the task.  It envisaged a two-stage process.  The principle of adopting a phased approach in establishing our electoral commission is consistent with practice that has worked elsewhere.  Do we need to do it here?  Is our system less complicated, more complicated or suited to phasing?  We need to make decisions on which functions are to be prioritised for inclusion within the electoral commission structure from the outset.</p><p> Having regard to the complexities involved in changing the system of voter registration, there may be a case for addressing this as a stand-alone project.  It is a question of determining whether the system of voter registration requires a separate body of work.  We will have to consider whether we need a three-phase approach rather than a two-phase approach.</p><p> There are many issues for the committee to consider and many choices to make.  This is an open process.  I must state quite clearly to all members present that it is a very open process for me.  It is not about a Government approach but about one that encompasses all views across the political sphere and, eventually, the public sphere to ensure we can put in place a process for an electoral commission is a sustainable way, setting out clear functions from the beginning.</p><p> I look forward to questions and the two-way conversation we are to have.  At some point, either today or at another time with the Vice Chairman and the Chairman, we will talk about the timeline for the committee to revert to us with its deliberations.</p></speech>

This is not about the Government driving something forward or having a defined view.  We need a general view and consensus of many of the issues we are discussion in this regard.  How we run elections into the future is fundamental to our democracy, so we need to get consensus and general agreement on all of these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.509" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1102" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015031000002#F00700"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the committee to deal with this important matter.  I believe the setting up of an independent commission is a great idea.  Sinn F&eacute;in would certainly support it and has been calling for such a body for a long time.  The Minister is right that this initiative is of such importance that it requires support across the political spectrum and that we need to build consensus.  It is not in anybody's interest that any shoddy or outdated practices in regard to how we run elections or referenda continue.  The independence of the body is important, but  it must be seen to be independent.  Therefore, how members are appointed to it is a crucial issue.</p> <p>  I am inclined to agree with the Minister in regard to the size of the body.  The international research referred to shows that if a committee is too big and unwieldy, it does not work.  At the same time, it is important to ensure a balance of the necessary level of expertise.</p> <p>  I have raised the issue of the register of electors many times, particularly with the Minister's predecessor.  We have huge concerns about the register. We sought reform of the register in the North and at the time, the Establishment and media raised stories about impersonation and the like.  The register was reformed and there is now a better system in place.  This was great for Sinn F&eacute;in, because reform stopped impersonation by other parties and our share of the vote rose immediately in the following election.  This was a good outcome for Sinn F&eacute;in, but also a good outcome for democracy.  Currently, we have people register twice or thrice, which is not right.  Other people are missing from the register.  I know it is up to each citizen to ensure he or she is registered.  The current register of electors will only work if all citizens over 18 are convinced they should be actively involved and should check the register every November to ensure they are on the draft register for the coming year.  If they notice a duplication of their name on the register, they should notify the local authority.  We must move away from the current approach.</p> <p>  In the past, I have suggested the use of PPS numbers for registration, but I am aware there are issues in that regard because there are more PPS numbers than people.  The Minister's predecessor told me one day that we had close to 7 million PPS numbers, far in excess of the number of people living in the State.  The huge number of PPS numbers can be accounted for by emigration, immigrants returning to their countries and various other reasons.  We need to look at other models and to take a new approach.</p><p> Regardless of what we do about an electoral commission, the register of electors is something that has bugged me over the last number of years.  I used to get very annoyed when people who have been on the register for a number of years and are getting on in years and who, when an election was called and they went to vote, found that they were not on the register for whatever reason, even though they had not moved house.  I have seen people going through that experience.  Tying it to an address does not work.  We must tie it to the person.  The entitlement to vote must be tied to every person when they reach the age of 18 years, and we must find a mechanism to do that.  I am not convinced as to how we can do it at this point, but our party is open to finding a better way of doing it.</p><p> That brings me to the timeline.  We must separate the different tasks.  The register of electors is the most important issue to be addressed.  It is very hard to get it right.  Consider the fact that there are far fewer councillors now.  Whether we like it or not, councillors played a role in ensuring that the register of electors was correct.  That was particularly so with town councils, where there is a great deal of mobility with people moving about.  Town councillors would make it their business to know who was registered in a street, or if somebody in the street was registered twice they would not be long in bringing it to the attention of the local authority officials.  There were scandalous incidents.  In a recent election, 28 people in one house were registered.  There was terrible things like that happening.</p><p> This is of great importance.  At best, I reckon the register is 80% accurate.  That 80% accuracy must be seen in the context of court cases having been held over one vote.  We have seen that.  In my county, County Laois, there was a court case over one vote.  It involved a Labour Party candidate and a Fine Gael candidate.  I believe the Fine Gael candidate ended up with the vote and the late Larry Kavanagh lost out.  That is too important to be left as it is.  It is something we should have started working on last year.</p><p> With regard to the Seanad, the Government lost the referendum on its abolition.  My party would have abolished it in its current form, but we want to have a reformed Seanad.  Obviously, how people get there and what their task will be when they get there are of crucial importance, but how to get there is the big issue.  The election system for the Seanad is archaic and must be dealt with.  The panels bear no resemblance to the Ireland of today.  I am not saying there should not be sectoral panels, as they serve a purpose, but we must examine the ones we have and how people are nominated onto them.</p><p> I will conclude on the boundaries and the boundary commission.  Yes, they possibly could be amalgamated.  The Minister's house is now in the Offaly constituency, or very near it.  If not, the constituency is getting close to his back yard.</p></speech>

It was separated into two three-seat constituencies.  I know the reason is the 30,000 limit and so forth.  County Laois now has a part of south Kildare with it.  There are now two three-seat constituencies.  We should try to have similar sized constituencies throughout the State, in so far as we can do that.  It is very arbitrary that a constituency should suddenly go from five seats to three seats.  There is also the situation with the Sligo-Leitrim-Cavan-and wherever else constituency.  There are four counties included in that constituency.</p><p>That does not sit right.</p><p> There is also the issue of how the local authority boundaries link in with D&aacute;il constituencies.  It may not always be possible to tie the two together and to base D&aacute;il constituency boundaries on local authority ones but we should try to do so as much as possible.  People elected to the new constituency covering Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Donegal will have to deal with four joint policing committees, four county managers, four sets of lobby groups at local authority level and four sets of local councillors.  Unless they fly around by helicopter, it will be very difficult for them to represent that constituency properly.  In so far as we can, we should try to watch the county boundaries, although it will not always be possible, and local authority electoral areas.</p><p> We should try to have similar sized constituencies and have five seat or six seat constituencies.  The Minister would not argue with that the next time around because it would suit his party and it would probably suit us.  I would not mind about Fine Gael, it would have three seat constituencies if it had its way.</p></speech>

There is one in my county that is more than 45 miles long, from Coolacrease on the Offaly border to between Culahill and Johnstown in Kikenny, which is a huge area to cover.

The commission, or an independent body, must have a role in addressing those issues and in trying to ensure the local authority areas can be represented properly.  Fewer councillors are being elected, so people should have a relatively manageable area to cover.  After all, these people are doing this on a part-time basis.</p> <p>  The issue of D&aacute;il boundaries and three, four, five and six seat constituencies should be put into the frame in terms of the commission.  We need an independent commission which has the support of the House.</p></speech>

It is imperative the Government honours its commitment to set up an electoral commission to safeguard electoral integrity and to provide an independent, well-structured and staffed office to oversee certain aspects of election functions.  As the previous speaker said, Ireland's electoral register is patently incapable of being updated and maintained within the existing structure.  It comes into focus at election time when we see the number of errors.  In one election, there was somewhere in the region of 8,000 errors in the electoral register.  That needs to be addressed to bring greater integrity to the quality of the register.</p> <p>  Setting up an independent electoral commission is urgent.  It was promised in the past but was never delivered.  There is need for a single body, similar to that in Northern Ireland which Deputy Stanley mentioned, to foster public confidence in the whole democratic process.</p> <p>  We all remember what happened with the e-voting machines in 2004.  Approximately &euro;54 million was squandered and 7,500 machines became obsolete.  We do not want that to happen again.</p><p>I hope it will not happen. </p></speech>

I presume the commission will be totally independent of Departments, etc., and will have its own staff independent of Government as well.</p> <p>  The local authorities located throughout the country have done their best to maintain the register but its care is not within their remit.  The task has placed an undue burden on resources and staff, particularly in smaller local authorities and where the rate base is very low as in counties Leitrim and Longford.  Local authorities do not have the staff to compile the register.  This matter should be looked at on a roll-on basis rather than having a new register every year.  I hope that will be a function of the new commission.</p> <p>  The register has been woefully neglected.  Has the Minister looked at the electoral system used in Northern Ireland?  It was introduced 30 years ago and has proved successful.  In that jurisdiction there is an onus on people to register and for young people to register a year before they are due to vote.  There has been an uptake of between 80% and 90% in Northern Ireland.  A cost may be involved.  Does the Minister know how much it would cost to set up an electoral office in the Republic?  I would like to know how much this whole exercise will cost.  </p> <p>  E-voting was very contentious in this country and was introduced by the previous Government.  Is there a proposal to return to e-voting?  The initiative has worked successfully in Australia and other countries in the southern hemisphere.  Have we looked at their systems and at how they work?  I have been told that Australia is leading the way as a model of good practice for an e-voting system.  Will compulsory voting be introduced in this country at some future date?  It has been introduced in some parts of the world.  It is important, going forward, that we foster integrity and public confidence in a new system.  </p> <p>  I have outlined a few issues.  I am sure everyone will have an opportunity to make a submission on the establishment of an electoral commission.  For a long time I have felt that we needed a single body to improve the current electoral system.  I hope that when the new system is introduced it will comprise a rolling register because it makes no sense to start the register from scratch every year.  The reason people who have been on a register for 50 or 60 years have often found themselves omitted from voting when they arrive at a polling booth is because the current system starts from scratch each year. </p> <p>  Does the Minister envisage that the electoral commission will take over control of electoral expenditure from the Standards in Public Office Commission?  Will the new electoral commission take over the function?  There is a body in place to do such work at present.  Will the electoral commission be given responsibility for such a task?  Will it be given responsibility to examine electoral spending issues?  Such matters are currently addressed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015031000002#K00100"><p>Does the Minister agree that a meaningful reform programme relating to the electoral system and the Oireachtas should go hand in hand with the evolution of the electoral commission?  It is clear that they must interact and most people agree that we do not have a reform programme currently.  As a Senator, I was bewildered that the only idea, which I did not consider to be meaningful, that the Government had was a referendum to abolish one of the Houses of Parliament.  That came as a surprise to many people given, at the same time, the D&aacute;il virtually remained unchanged.  The list of what are cited as reforms is minimalist and we have to go back to the drawing board again.  Many areas need to considered for radical reform.</p> <p>  The electoral process is the responsibility of several Departments and agencies and 31 local authorities and it is clear that it is not fit for purpose.  This major issue needs to be examined.  I fully agree with the Minister's comment that reform should be based on a consensus among all political parties because of the very nature of what is involved and because of how fragile the democratic process can be at times.  The electoral registers that existed years ago were based on information provided by rate collectors and they missed very few people back then.  We were happy with the electoral register but nowadays the names of people who left the country years ago and so on are to be found on it and, therefore, we have a messy registration system.  That plays into the results at elections and there is an urgency about this matter.</p> <p>  The Minister invited the committee to make recommendations.  How broad will the consultative process be and how far will it go?  A timetable is vital for this.  There is a feeling that kicking this to touch is the way go, and this has applied to all governments, but that is wrong.  We have to be serious about a definite timetable as to how this will be done.  Constituencies and counties have been cannibalised.  One only has to go to the local pub and speak to someone to realise how confused people have become.  Deputy Stanley had to check, for instance, where Offaly starts and Tipperary ends.  That is the case throughout the country.  I do not question the Constituency Commission because it had exceptionally good people on it but its recommendations have not appealed to people on the ground.  They build up loyalty to their counties and constituencies but when out of the blue, the commission proposes changes, the county loyalty is gone.  I do not have answers to this but a root and branch examination of how these decisions come about how they fit in with the democratic process is needed.</p><p>Perhaps answers are immediately available, but the man and woman in the street certainly require definite answers as to why this is happening.</p><p> It is important to look at how business is conducted, which is why I state reform and the idea of an electrical commission must go hand in hand.  Nobody in the Oireachtas feels happy with the amount of material which must be examined and digested to ensure it leads to what is best for the democratic system.  This may be an internal issue within the Civil Service or the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Anybody looking at it for the first time would certainly feel it needs to be examined to see whether it is working.  In my younger days I worked in a county council, and I remember experts being brought in to measure output.  They monitored the work to the level of measuring how long it took to walk between a desk and a filing cabinet.  The same happened with the workers on the roads; their work was measured and a bonus scheme was provided.  This was done in a fundamental way at that level of administration.  Here, at the pinnacle of government responsibility, it needs to be examined also.  The Minister gently shook his head when I suggested there was not really any great reform taking place.  We should measure this reform and outline it.</p><p> To return to consultation, the people with whom we must consult include those who have the vote.  If we do not get the timetable right there will be no electoral commission and we will continue with multifaceted involvement in the electoral process from Departments, agencies and local authorities.</p><p> Nobody is fully certain that the manner in which the count system takes place is above question.  It needs to be examined.  We have seen cases where questions have been asked.  If the issue exists now it existed 20 or 30 years ago also.  I do not recommend this, but rather than pushing it to the backburner again would it be possible to take a piecemeal approach?  Could the question of the register be looked at immediately?  Could the accounting system and the transfer of votes be examined immediately?  Could defining the constituencies be revisited without waiting?  Does the Minister feel this is a five, ten or 15 year process?  He will not see it in the life of the present Oireachtas, but does he envisage it definitely happening in the life of the next Oireachtas?</p></speech>

On average, 40% of those on the electoral register, four out of ten people, do not exercise their democratic right.</p><p>In fact, the figure has gone above four out of ten in recent years.  This is an issue that must be addressed.  I am aware of families where neither parent has ever exercised his or her vote.  We should consider putting in place a mechanism, as some other countries have, for removing persons from the electoral register who do not avail of their vote on two or three occasions.  It is wrong not to exercise one's right to vote.  On the other hand, there are cases where people who have left home to live abroad and rear their families, in the United State, London, Glasgow and many other places, but opt to remain on the electoral register.  When I questioned one such family about it, the reason I was given was that they come home on holiday for two or three weeks every year and if that holiday coincides with an election, they wish to be able to vote.  That is not right.</p><p> Other speakers referred to the importance of maintaining proper voting records.  When one presents at a polling station, one's name is crossed out on the register and, at the end of the day, it is possible to tot up the number of registered persons who actually voted.  An electronic record should be kept of the names of those who exercise their vote.  On one occasion I attended a hearing on applications to be included on the supplementary register and I happened to ask the official whether one particular applicant was a tall, curly-haired man.  When this was confirmed, it became clear that the same man was on different registers in the one town and was voting at polling stations across the road from each other on the same day.  Deputy Bannon referred to the situation in Northern Ireland.  I overheard a conversation in a club six or seven years ago which revealed that the same individual to whom I just referred had voted 11 times at polling stations across the Border.  I assure colleagues that he was not voting for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  It seems he went around all day, from Newry to Ballymena, casting his 11 votes and taking pride in doing so.  The system is not right on the other side of the Border, no more than it is here.  People must take responsibility in this matter, but it is also paramount that we eliminate possible abuses, whether by way of PPS numbers or some other means.  That must be given serious consideration.  If such abuses have gone on in the past, they will continue into the future.</p><p> Having listened to the Minister speaking in the Seanad, it is clear he is passionate about reform.  I wish him well in the task and hope it will not take four years to complete the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.541" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015031000002#M00200"><p>I am very supportive of the establishment of an electoral commission.  I take the point as to whether we should be seeking evolution or revolution.  It is true that one may achieve revolution by doing things by degrees and producing a revolutionary change over time.  That is possibly the way it will go in practical terms.  An electoral commission will be an important part of political and institutional reform.  We would all start with the electoral register because it is so much the obvious place to start.  When domestic rates were in place, there was a direct relationship with voters, with calls being made to their doors on a regular basis.  There was a rationale at that time for keeping the register up to date and it was known who was living in all the houses in a particular area.  That relationship no longer exists and I doubt it will exist for any service in the future because so much is now done online.</p><p>Positioning it with the local authorities might not necessarily lead to the greatest of results.  It is the obvious place to put it, particularly in the context of where people are located.  Perhaps it might be possible to analyse what happens on a daily basis or in the context of the review of the electoral register.  There are different practices in different places.  For example, the county in which I live has a very high transient rate because Maynooth College is located there.  This might not be the case in other places, which may have more stable populations.  Different circumstances may obtain at various locations.  I am of the view that a rolling register is absolutely the way to go.</p><p> People tend to miss cut-off dates.  In that context, there could be a great deal more engagement in the context of allowing people to register online.  I accept that there is a need to authenticate any information which is provided online but an auditing process could be put in place to facilitate that to which I refer.  People now do a great deal more of their business online and I am of the view that real possibilities exist in this regard.  I take the point to the effect that it is not necessarily about saving money but rather about doing things differently and achieving better outcomes.</p><p> If that which is proposed is going to represent an evolution and if it is going to be done in a sequential way, it would be useful to map out the range it should cover.  There is a tendency to tick boxes and to state that something has been done when only 50% of the work has been completed and when there is a need to go significantly further.  One of the absolute basic principles of any electoral commission is that it should be independent.  Regardless of how it is done, putting in place a rolling register will very much depend on the mechanisms that will be available.  Norway has been working on its system for the past 20 years and people there are able to do a great deal online.  The collaborative approach taken in Norway has given rise to massive administrative savings.  I suspect that we could work towards adopting such a model here.  People in Ireland can already access Revenue's online service, which is very good.  There are serious possibilities in terms of the online option.</p><p> An issue of concern is that which relates to the Standards in Public Office Commission and the fact that it does not always have the ability to carry out particular functions in the way it would like.  We know, for example, that there are spending limits which apply at election time.  I am aware of a number of people who have exceeded those limits - sometimes by quite a distance - at every election since they were introduced.  We all exceed the limits and it is quite difficult for the powers that be to monitor what goes on at election time.  There is no point in setting standards if people can bypass them without any real sanction being applied.  It is necessary for audits to be carried out in order for behaviour such as that to which I refer to be detected.  The people who are more likely to carry out such audits - or who have the ability to carry them out - are those who are already busy during election campaigns.  Perhaps audits should be performed during elections but people must have the wherewithal to carry them out in circumstances where valid complaints are made.  It should not be down to, for example, an opposing candidate to make a complaint.</p><p> The limits to which I refer were put in place for a very good reason.  They are generous and a great deal of money is wasted during election campaigns.  As a result, there should not be any necessity for people to exceed them.  If they are exceeded, then we must ask from where the money involved is coming, consider the question of influence, etc.  These are the very matters with which the Minister is trying to deal.</p><p>I would like some thought put into that element and how the Minister would fund it.  I may well make a submission on it.</p><p> In regard to electoral funding spending, the Leaders' allowance, now the parliamentary standard allowance for Independents has been included in the remit of the Standards in Public Office Commission, an issue on which I had argued on many occasions.  All of that funding should be properly scrutinised and the electoral funding should be part of it.  For example, 17% of the current D&aacute;il is made up of Independents.  If there were no Independents, the electoral funding pot would be the same.  However, it is not reduced by 17% by virtue of the fact that the D&aacute;il is made up of 17% Independents.  It may well be that money could be better used.  When people talk about turnout at elections, part of that has to do with people seeing a relationship between voting and outcomes.  There is a role for independent education, so to speak.  It is fine in secondary school but when people actually get the vote it is of more value to them.  I would like to see some funding made available to an independent body for the purpose of public engagement on the value of voting.  I do not think I have ever come out of an election campaign where people have not asked if they have used their vote correctly.  That is the kind of thing people say.</p><p> The single transferable vote is very easy to use but people tend to think it is more complicated because it is complicated to count.  We all know this.  Even in this there is a role for an independent body to have an ongoing programme of education in place.  There are obvious issues such as the referenda and how to administer them.  Sometimes there can be criticism of, say, the McKenna judgment where it is felt there is an imbalance in terms of the strength of public opinion.  There may well be merit in looking at this.  An independent commission would have a level of authority by virtue of the fact that it is independent.  I definitely think we are all on the one page in regard to actual register about the roll programme.  That is the obvious first step.  It would be useful to agree on what other elements should be examined so that it is not something that is concluded and the view is that the work is done.  There is much more to be done and it needs to quite ambitious.  The point I am making is that it is for the next Government to pick up where this one leaves off.  </p><p> There are some very serious academics on the stakeholder paper.  We probably underuse some of the academics in developing policy.  Every one of those is serious in his or her own right.  I would hope we would continue to look at best practice in other countries to see whether we can evolve into a political system where people will come and look at us, rather than us going to look at them.  That is possible but it has to be ambitious.</p></speech>

Surely that is the first thing we should try to address, as well as the quesstion of scrutiny.  This is a big effort, yet we still have not achieved it.</p><p> People who may be away on polling day want to vote but cannot do so.  Where are we going in this regard?  We must be grounded in reality and if we could achieve that, maybe we could talk about the pros and cons of how and where we can extend the franchise to people who have connections with this State.  </p><p> In this era, we could be accused of taking democracy for granted.  Senator Brennan referred to voter apathy and low turnout.  When one drills down and examines the anomalies in the electoral register, however, one can see the numbers going out to vote.  While it may be different for general or local elections, the figures are still not where one would like to see them. </p><p> People talk about the confusion surrounding referendums, including the children's rights referendum, and we must listen to what they are saying.  This country had been plagued by scandals affecting the care of children and many cases were cited where the law was too restrictive.  It was said that we needed a referendum to change the law and firm it up to ensure that children are protected.  The turnout at public meetings on that referendum was low, however, so the vote did not surprise me at all.  In fact, that vote took place on a Saturday to accommodate young people.  I visited as many polling stations as I could that day just to touch base, but many presiding officers remarked on the low turnout of young people.  I think therefore that something more fundamental is wrong.  </p><p> Protests and civil disobedience that cross the line into criminal behaviour are a serious attack on law and order, which is the very basis of our democracy.  We will not have these freedoms, including the right to walk down the street, unless we all observe the law.  Whether or not we like the law, it has to be obeyed.  There are democratic ways to change laws which entail a respect for differences. </p><p> We have seen the shocking situation of what happened to the T&aacute;naiste in Jobstown.  Could the people who detained her for several hours accept that she has as deeply held a conviction about the decision she was making, as they have?  One does not achieve anything in a democratic fashion by intimidation.  We should all take stock of our democracy, but are we taking it for granted?  We should look at countries where democracy is not operating and where people do not have civil liberties.  There can be chaos where a few people take control for their own betterment, and in many cases the west is supporting them.  We have an awful lot going for us here, but if we lose sight of that we will be in a terrible quandary.</p><p> As regards our democratic electoral system, people may ask: "Why can't you just do this?"  We are not an autocracy, but democracy is laborious and most of the time it is not glamorous.  It is about conversation, whether at public meetings or with those coming into a constituency office.  We listen to things with which we may not agree, but we are all citizens and it is about discussing matters.</p><p> We are examining the situation to make the electoral system more interesting to young people, but is it interesting for them?  We need to look at what it means to be an Irish citizen.  Citizenship ceremonies were introduced under the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  They are a good idea because citizenship in a republic has value, rights and responsibilities.  It seems, however, that we cannot talk about responsibilities in this country because we feel we have been so oppressed as a nation that it now has to be about people's rights, but there is a balance to be struck here.</p><p> We need to begin a conversation with bright, young people who have availed of significant educational opportunities and achieved many of the freedoms our forefathers sought for the nation.  However, many of the citizenship programmes I have seen in schools seem to be only for those who choose to do them.  I believe the Minister's job, whether we have an electoral commission or not and despite the pros or cons for it, is to ensure a more systematic approach to this issue.  People must be helped to understand the power of a vote.  They must understand their power, that one man or one woman equates to one vote, no matter who or what the person is.  However, people feel so disenfranchised that they believe their vote is not worth anything.  It is worth exactly the same as my vote or the President's vote.  We need to bring that civic pride in the country back to the people.  We have a democracy which is not perfect, but we strive towards excellence.  We need to have these conversations, which go to the heart as opposed to the appearance of democracy and how we do things.  Everybody needs to vote, no matter what.  This does not mean they know the perfect vote to make or the perfect person to vote for, but that they try their best, just as politicians try their best.</p><p> We talk about electoral reform, democratic revolution and so on, but sometimes people forget that the people who have been elected pretty much represent the people who elected them and that there are all sorts of politicians and all sorts of people.  Therefore, to suggest there can be a general consensus on how politicians in our democracy should operate is not entirely honest.  It has been very attractive in the period we have experienced in recent times, when we have been on an unprecedented economic roller coaster and have seen a flux in terms of politics, to think that we can decide instantly that we can bang on the table and have things the way we want them.  That seems to be what many protests have been about.  I fully accept people's right to protest, but we need to take stock of what is being sacrificed.</p><p> Whatever way we approach these issues, we need to get to the heart of the participation of citizens in the democratic process.</p></speech>

Much of what I intended to say has already been said and will be dealt with by the commission.  In the context of boundaries, I come from a county where while one of my local councillors is a member of Meath County Council, when it comes to a general election, her constituents vote in the Louth area.  I do not agree with this division.  If someone is part of a particular county council, they should be part of the same area for a general election.  This is an issue any commission should examine.</p> <p>  The register of electors is another issue.  I often wonder why people are not automatically added to the register when they turn 18.  Getting young people to register is a matter of getting them interacting with what is going on around them.  I spend much of my time in secondary schools discussing with transition year and fifth and sixth year students the importance of voting.  I try to help them understand the importance of voting and encourage interest in what happens here and how what we do relates to what they do and makes a difference.  Education is a key issue and an electoral commission should focus on it.</p> <p>  The membership and independence of the commission is important.  The Department and the Minister must take on responsibility for oversight of the commission, but the commission must maintain independence.  I have read that in three out of four countries which have appointed members to a commission, they were not appointed by politicians.  Who appoints them in such a case?  Is the appointment made by a judge?  How should we go about the process of appointment and what approach is the Minister leaning towards?  What timeframe does the Minister envisage for the establishment of a commission?  I know he has said he wants to push this forward as quickly as possible, but does he think it will take four years or longer or will it take a shorter time?  I would welcome a commission, but it is important all the different factions come together under it.</p> <p>  There is also a question about the cost of establishing a commission.</p><p>Many different Departments, at local and national levels, play their part and a lot of the cost has been absorbed which we do not know about.  Therefore, it is important we carry out a proper cost analysis of the initiative.  I look forward to participating in the continuing discussion of this matter.  </p></speech>

I am sure the Minister took notes of what everybody said on that occasion when he asked us to do a job.  I presume he came here today to hear what we have come up with.</p> <p>  In 2008 this Oireachtas committee published a report entitled The Future of the Electoral Register in Ireland and Related Matters.  Therefore, we do not have to reinvent the wheel and the findings of the report should be taken into consideration in the first instance.  However, people's views change over time so public consultation would be good.  As the Government's report indicated, Ireland is behind the curve because two thirds of jurisdictions worldwide have such a system.</p> <p>  Of everything that has been mentioned today, boundaries are a huge issue.  If one looks at the boundary situation in this country one will discover that the Garda use different boundaries from health boards and health boards use different boundaries from local authorities.  As Deputy McEntee has said, there are different electoral boundaries for D&aacute;il elections, etc.  I must state that it is difficult to get D&aacute;il and local authority boundaries right in terms of population but boundaries should be synchronised more, particularly to aid the work of public bodies. </p> <p>  Voter registration should be included in the electoral commission.  In terms of election spending and donations, we have seen recent newspapers reports on funding from the USA, for example, going into the North of Ireland and then making  its way into the Republic.  Therefore, we must outline rules and procedures that stipulate whether such funding can take place.  If such funding is being availed of by one organisation then there should be rules and regulations to stipulate how such funding is raised and we must ensure there is transparency all the way through the process.  </p> <p>  Senator Brennan mentioned the old slogan of "vote early and vote often" but it is obvious that some people are voting more than once.  The recent recommendations made by the Geary Institute recommended that PPS numbers be used which is the situation that prevails in the UK.  I do not see anything wrong with such a provision.  There was an outcry when we tried to introduce the use of PPS numbers for water services and people rejected the suggestion.  Other countries use PPS numbers and I do not know why the idea is so opposed in Ireland.  </p> <p>  At present the management of the electoral system is spread between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, 31 local authorities, a clutch of agencies, including the Standards in Public Office Commission, the registrar of parties, the constituency commissions, the referendum commission and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I would like to see an evaluation of the cost involved to carry out this work by all these bodies.  We would save money if we put it in one little hoop.  Making a saving is not the prime aim and objective, we must get it right.  When the Government looks at funding I suggest every aspect is taken into consideration and we marry these.  </p> <p>  The Geary Institute also recommended that public bodies share data information.  I agree that should happen and suggest it be written into statute law somewhere.  As far as I know, voting by post is allowed in the UK.  The residents of the UK can vote before they go on holidays.  If they can do it then why can we not do so here?  One could not have a system that did not use PPS numbers because it would be wide open to fraud.</p> <p>  I will not comment on political engagement because it has been spoken about enough.  On electronic voting, I will not talk about going into a booth to press a button because everybody loves to use a peann luaidhe to vote but I must ask the following question.  If Irish people can bank online then why do we not trust online voting?  Members of the Oireachtas are bad at trusting cloud computing and we really do not avail of the option.  Online voting is something that could be considered.</p> <p>   When we discussed the electoral commission in the Seanad I mentioned surplus votes.  I do not know whether anybody has mentioned the subject here today.  I would like the Boundary Commission to ban posters.  I never erected posters for my first election but I never had the courage to leave them down after that occasion.  We have moved on since then and now live in an electronic age.  A rule should be introduced to ban posters because they litter the place, in addition to which CO2 emissions have increased due to all of the corry board signs used.</p></speech>

Is an alliance of like-minded people who agree a common policy on nine issues but not on a tenth a political party or is it a group of Independents working on every issue bar one?  As political parties have changed, I would like to see a definition of what "independent" and "alliance" mean.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, the issues of funding and so on must be examined.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015031000002#S00300"><p>There was a great overlap.  There are no right or wrong answers to some of the questions asked.  It is matter of coming to a consensus on many of the issues raised, drilling down to gather as much information as possible and making decisions on that basis.  There is no such thing as best practice; there is just practice and there are circumstances.  One can take the Kilmeaden cheese approach in that one can take the best and get rid of the rest.  That is my attitude.  With regard to elections, many things happen in different jurisdictions which could not and should not be replicated here.  We need to adopt elements of what is done elsewhere, but the entire suite could not be replicated here because circumstances are different.</p> <p>  We have had a lengthy discussion about voter registration and the maintenance of the electoral register.  The local authorities do it at one level, while others do it at another.  Reference was made to door to door checking and different practices, but what would be acceptable?  The Australian Electoral Commission reports that 91.4% of eligible voters are registered and that its target is 95%.  Will we ever exceed a figure of 90% or 95%?  In England the registration rate is 91.8%, while in Northern Ireland where there was an improvement following the introduction of a new system, the rate has regressed substantially to 88%.  The registration rate for the Scottish referendum was one of the highest ever, at 97.8%.  We need to dig into a phenomenal number of issues in this regard to ascertain what is the best thing to do.</p> <p>  We have to come to a consensus on what we are trying to achieve, which is to define the functions of an electoral commission.  If all of the questions set out in the document are boiled down, we must establish what the functions should be.  I would like this to be as ambitious as possible and concur with the member who said what it should be.  I would also like it to incorporate as much as possible and that is my starting point.  I would like it to incorporate everything we have discussed, but I am not sure it can because there are so many layers to each issue.</p> <p>  We need advice from the committee on how to do this.  We will set out the functions and what we want.  If we are ambitious, should we do this in two or three stages or should we take out the electoral register and address it as a separate project?  That might be the right way to proceed because it is a technical and specific issue.</p> <p>  The independence of the commission, how its members are selected and its relationship with the Government or the Minister of the day must be defined.  These issues need to be addressed in the 11 questions posed.</p><p>The independence of the body is paramount and it must be transparent.  Those included in it must have experience and we need to examine the appointments process.  </p><p> To give the committee my thoughts, we will probably have to go down the route of using PPS numbers, despite the problems in doing this because we cannot continue in the way we are going.  There are issues with PPS numbers, given the number issued compared to the number of people living here, but we need a system.  In my previous life I built databases and a unique identification code is required to tag items or people in this scenario.  Using PPS numbers seems to be the obvious solution.  We have all heard stories about multiple voting.  One's name can be on the register 400 times, 11 times or twice, but this does not mean that one must vote 400 times, 11 times or twice.  Anyone who does so is breaking one of the most fundamental laws of the State.</p><p> Constituency boundaries are a bugbear of mine.  We may have to consider constitutional change in tandem with this as we cannot go on much longer with how constituency boundaries are managed.  I am open to debate on this issue.  The draw towards conurbation in Dublin and the population pull means the limitations on the population per seat figure cannot continue.  It will cause additional issues in breaking up counties.  I agree with the many Deputies and Senators who have stated people who are elected must deal with multiple local authorities, HSE zones and administrative districts for various services, which is difficult.  What is also very difficult is that the people of Coolbawn, from where my grandmother comes, now vote in County Offaly, even though they do not want to do so.  People in other areas the Vice Chairman knows such as Terryglass and Borrisokane also vote in County Offaly.  I canvassed in Shinrone during the last election and the people there did not want to vote in County Tipperary.  We had a debate about the position in Moneygall because it is half and half.</p><p> Scale issues arise with regard to local electoral areas.  A local electoral area in south Kerry extends from Ballinskelligs to Dingle.  It is enormous.  The continuous breaking of county boundaries for D&aacute;il constituencies will cause more and more problems because of how the administration of local authority areas has been dealt with.  We will have to examine how we should deal with this issue.  Do we need a larger number of seats in constituencies?  We possibly do in some cases, if we do not make other changes.  Like the Vice Chairman, I am from County Tipperary where the local authorities have been merged and other bodies have also been amalgamated.  Then part of the county was included in a constituency in County Offaly.  It is not consistent.</p><p> I agree with e-voting and the use of technology but in a completely different way from how it was done previously.  I am open to it on the basis of maintaining the democratic process and explaining how votes are transferred.  None of us wants to get away from the thrill we get at the count centre.  We will have to embrace technology, but how we do so is the issue.</p><p> The concept of compulsory voting was tried in Australia and thrown out.  Given the psyche of the Irish people, forcing them to do something in any way, shape or form would not be a very good idea.  If we try to force people to vote, they will not do so.</p><p>I think Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the electoral spend.  Those points have been well made.</p><p> The committee should consult far and wide.  There are many good people who have much knowledge of this space.  Is it evolution versus revolution?  It is revolution through evolution.  I do not think we can do all of this in one go.  We will have to do it in stages but it is revolutionary and it should not take a long time.  I will return to the time issue in a minute.</p><p> We have the postal vote.  Deputy Mulherin made a very good point in that we propose to give votes to people outside the jurisdiction when people living in it, who are temporarily out of the country, may not be able to vote.</p><p> I refer to voter knowledge and education which is a bugbear of mine.  Everyone of us will have had the following experience when canvassing in a referendum.  People will say they do not understand the issue and know nothing about it but there will be two or three pieces of literature and  advertisements from the Referendum Commission on the different points in the referendum.  There is something more fundamental there, namely, the value of one's vote.</p><p> There has been quite an amount of movement in terms of education over the past number of decades but people are still disengaging.  It is not that they are not listening to the radio, watching television or getting literature through their letter boxes; it is that they are choosing to disengage.  That is the real issue we must address.</p><p> The last issue raised was limits on postering.  There are limits on postering and I favour limiting them even more.  We need to be very careful in regard to the different types of postering used.  Use of electronic road signage must be banned because it has the potential to cause hazards.  We need to take a fresh look that, which I will do.</p><p> We talked a bit about timelines.  There is a myrid of issues - we could talk about this topic for a long time - in regard to the 11 questions and the different sections.  In regard to timelines, I would like to be able to bring in the heads of the Bill by the end of the summer, which would mean that within three to four months, the committee's recommendations would be back to me.  My preference would be three months.  There is a huge amount of work in this and much consultation is required.  We have presented a huge document which needs to be digested.  All the issues raised here are in that document.  I would be surprised if anything raised here was not in it, except the issue of postering.  </p><p> It is my ambition to have this legislation drafted before I leave office with a view to the next administration implementing it.  On that basis, I would like the committee to come back to me within three to four months when we can begin work on the heads of the Bill and look at drafting the legislation by late this year or early next year at the latest.  That is my commitment to the committee.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be back again this week, ahead of the General Affairs Council which is due to take place on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and will discuss the European semester 2015.  The March General Affairs Council will prepare for the meeting of the European Council which is due to take place on 19 and 20 March.  The European Council will have three agenda items: energy union; the European semester, which discussion will include a broad exchange of views on the economic situation in the European Union; and external relations.  The external relations component will focus on relations with Russia and the conflict in Ukraine, as well as the forthcoming Eastern Partnership summit in Riga, Latvia, and the deteriorating situation in Libya.  In addition to preparing for the European Council, the General Affairs Council will consider the 2015 European semester and inter-institutional issues.</p> <p>  Before I look ahead to next week&rsquo;s meeting, please allow me to update members briefly on the outcome of the February meeting of the General Affairs Council.  The Latvian Presidency presented the outline of its priorities for the semester, highlighting a focus on boosting investment, energy union, trade, the digital agenda and the Eastern Partnership.  The Council also engaged in a comprehensive discussion on counter-terrorism.  The renewed focus on this issue followed, of course, the tragic attacks in Paris in January.  The Council took stock of various measures advanced within the European Union to combat terrorism, ahead of a joint statement by EU Heads of State and Government later that week.  </p> <p>  The Presidency presented the state of play on a proposed technical amendment to the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, regulation.</p><p>The Council also noted the annotated agenda for the March European Council and had a brief exchange of views.  Ministers present had a working lunch with Commission First Vice President, Frans Timmermans, during which a broad range of issues relating to the Commission&rsquo;s work programme for 2015 were debated, including better regulation and inter-institutional relations.</p><p> I will now turn to the March General Affairs Council.  The meeting will focus primarily on preparations for the European Council.  The first issue to be discussed is energy union.  Geopolitical events, worldwide energy competition and the impact of climate change have all prompted a focus on securing the Union&rsquo;s energy future.</p><p> The Council discussion will be shaped by the recent communication from the Commission on a framework strategy for a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy.  Ireland very much welcomes this communication, which sets out a roadmap for assuring secure, affordable and climate-friendly energy across all member states.  Among a number of initiatives, the Commission has set out plans to enhance regional co-operation, introduce new legislation to ensure supply of electricity and gas, increase EU funding for energy efficiency, and report annually on the state of the energy union.</p><p> It is anticipated that the European Council deliberations will focus on two key aspects of the energy union project, namely, enhancing energy security and reaping the benefits of the internal energy market.  Given the centrality of energy policy to achieving our climate change ambitions, there will also be an exchange on how best to co-ordinate our diplomatic action in order to increase the Union&rsquo;s leverage and effectiveness ahead of the critical climate conference in Paris next December.  It is important that we act effectively to ensure that other states match the ambitious goals agreed last year by the Union.</p><p> Enhancing Europe&rsquo;s energy security is essential for peripheral, poorly connected member states, of which we are one.  Diversifying the routes and sources of our energy, and putting in place adequate infrastructure to support this diversification, will be necessary to meet our energy challenges of the future.</p><p> Developing indigenous resources, particularly in the area of renewable energy, will be also very important for increasing security of supply.  The energy union strategy will seek to ensure that Europe retains its leading global role in renewable energy.  Ireland has one of the best offshore renewable energy resources in the world, particularly wave energy, and Irish researchers and entrepreneurs are at the forefront of technological developments in this sector, particularly in the marine centre in Ringaskiddy in Cork.  I recently witnessed this first hand with my French counterpart, Harlem D&eacute;sir, to when we visited Ringaskiddy, UCC and the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster.  The visit exemplified the energy union in action.  We also explored opportunities for co-operation between Ireland and France in the area of renewable energy, and discussed a possible submarine electricity interconnector between Ireland and France.  Both countries of course have very large coastlines and have marine resources in that regard.</p><p> There are currently three external relations items scheduled for discussion at the European Council.  These are relations with Russia and the situation in Ukraine; the Eastern Partnership; and developments in Libya.  Developments on the ground in Ukraine will shape the European Council discussions both on Ukraine itself and on broader EU relations with Russia.  In particular, progress on implementation of the 12 February Minsk agreement will be reviewed.  After a troubled beginning, the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine appears to have taken hold.  Prisoner exchanges have taken place and both sides have begun withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line.</p><p>This is welcome.  However, the situation remains tense and fragile.  It is crucial that the OSCE monitoring mission is given full and unhindered access to all areas of the conflict zone, so that it is in a position to definitively verify that weapons have been withdrawn, and confirm the locations to which they have been taken. </p><p> The question of further economic sanctions is likely to be a feature of the European Council discussions.  Following consultations with EU member states and a subsequent video conference with France, Germany, Italy, UK and US, President Tusk stated on 3 March that leaders had underlined the close linkage between sanctions and the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, making it clear that the EU was ready to take further measures if the agreements were further violated.  Ireland has consistently favoured the dual-track approach adopted by the EU, involving both political dialogue and robust sanctions, with a view to bringing an end to the conflict that has claimed over 6,000 lives and caused untold hardship.  I will have an opportunity to hear the Ukrainian perspective directly when, together with EU colleagues, I will meet with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Klimkin in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council next week.</p><p> The European Council will hold an orientation debate ahead of the Eastern Partnership summit, which will be held in Riga on 21 and 22 May.  The Eastern Partnership aims to enhance the EU&rsquo;s relationships with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The summit will allow the EU and its eastern partners to take stock of developments in the Eastern Partnership since the last summit in Vilnius in 2013, and to consider the path ahead.  The summit will offer the opportunity, in particular, to assess initial progress by Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in the implementation of their EU association agreements, with assistance provided by the EU.  The D&aacute;il approved the terms of the agreements on 28 January, after a debate and consideration of the agreements by the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This paves the way for their ratification by Ireland, which will be completed before the Riga summit. </p><p> The European Council will also discuss the situation in Europe&rsquo;s southern neighbourhood, specifically in Libya, and consider the implications for the security of the EU, in terms of illegal migration and terrorist threats.  Recent months have witnessed a number of factions competing for political legitimacy and seeking control of Libya&rsquo;s cities and its infrastructure.  The vacuum of effective state control has been exploited by terrorist groups such as ISIS with devastating results.  The conflict is also creating a growing humanitarian crisis in much of the country.  A UN-facilitated talks process is now seeking an inclusive political agreement which would lead to the formation of a government of national unity, a ceasefire and the finalisation of a new constitution for Libya.  The EU is fully supportive of these efforts.</p><p> The European Council will discuss the economic situation in the EU and conclude the first phase of the 2015 European semester.  While economic developments were disappointing for most of last year, we are now seeing some signs of a more positive economic outlook for Europe.  The year 2015 is the first since the onset of the crisis in which all member state economies are expected to record economic growth.  Importantly, this more positive economic outlook is also beginning to feed through to Europe&rsquo;s labour markets.  The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in the Union was 9.8% in January, the second consecutive month that it was back in single figures.  We do, however, need to bear in mind that this figure masks significant regional variations &ndash; and that youth unemployment, in particular, remains a formidable challenge.  </p><p> The committee asked me to provide a brief update on the situation in Greece.  On 20 February, agreement was reached among the Finance Ministers of the euro area to extend the Greek programme by up to four months.</p><p>This is a welcome development, which demonstrates Europe&rsquo;s solidarity in supporting Greece until it has regained full market access.  The purpose of the extension is to allow a successful conclusion of the fifth review of the Greek programme, the disbursement of the associated funds and discussions on a possible follow-up arrangement.  As part of the agreement, the Greek Government has presented its proposals for reform measures.  These measures will now need to be further specified and then agreed with the institutions by the end of April.  Yesterday, the Eurogroup discussed procedural issues relating to the negotiations.  It was confirmed that technical negotiations between the Greek authorities and the institutions would commence tomorrow in Brussels.  Ireland, together with other euro area member states, understands and empathises with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  This is why there has been a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new Government, while also respecting existing commitments.</p><p> I will return shortly to consider the European semester, but first allow me to finish on the General Affairs Council agenda.  Over lunch, Ministers will discuss how the Council might contribute to a revision of the 2003 inter-institutional agreement on better law making, on which the Commission is expected to issue a proposal later this year.  The objective of such a revision would be to update and enhance existing arrangements for inter-institutional cooperation, in order to improve the legislative process and, ultimately, deliver better outcomes for our citizens.  While no decision will be taken at this juncture, I look forward to a productive discussion which will advance our goals of strengthening inter-institutional co-operation and delivering better regulation.</p><p> I will now focus the remainder of my statement on the European semester for 2015.  The March European Council will conclude the first phase of the European semester by providing guidance to member states for submission in April of their stability programme updates, under the Stability and Growth Pact, and national reform programmes.  I expect that there will be strong political reinforcement of the key priorities set out by the new Commission in the annual growth survey it presented in November &ndash; that is, a boost to investment; a renewed commitment to both national and EU-level structural reforms; and continued fiscal responsibility.</p><p> The Commission is also due to present proposals this year for an improved and updated Europe 2020 strategy.  This means making sure we have the right post-crisis arrangements in place for supporting growth and jobs across Europe.  The Commission&rsquo;s preparations in this regard will of course be informed by the public consultation to which the present committee made a contribution in November, as was reviewed when I attended the Seanad last week.</p><p> The Commission&rsquo;s proposals for a renewed Europe 2020 process have been deferred until later in the year, keeping the political focus before the June European Council on getting the new "Juncker investment plan", as it is known, up and running.  Progress in establishing the European fund for strategic investments remains firmly on track.  Indeed, finance Ministers are due to agree today a general approach on the draft regulation, allowing negotiations to open with the European Parliament.  </p><p> On 26 February, the Commission presented a comprehensive assessment for each member state, under the 2015 cycle of the European semester.  There is now a window of more than two months before draft proposals for the next round of country-specific recommendations are produced by the Commission on 19 May, for adoption subject to amendment by the Council.  This is a significant procedural improvement introduced for this year&rsquo;s process that is designed to support stronger national-level engagement with the Commission&rsquo;s assessment, including by key stakeholders and national parliaments and committees.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the assessment in the new country report is a broadly positive one, reflecting the strength of the economic recovery under way, supporting in turn a gradual unwinding of the deep imbalances developed during the crisis period.</p><p> It is worth recalling that we are only one of five member states whose budgets were found by the Commission last November to be fully compliant with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The country report strongly commends the progress we have made in recent years, noting that Ireland was the fastest growing economy in the EU in 2014, with that growth expected to continue in the coming years.  It notes in particular that recovery has been jobs rich and recognises that public sector indebtedness declined in 2014, public debt is on a downward trajectory, financial sector challenges are diminishing, external accounts have strengthened considerably and the labour market situation has improved.</p><p> The purpose of the report, while recognising progress, is to identify where further work is needed or weaknesses or imbalances remain.  The Commission does this in respect of every member state.  Among the areas for further work, the Commission includes the need to continue to pay attention to unemployment, especially long-term unemployment.  As the committee is aware, this is a key priority for the Government.  The Commission also points to the need to ensure that small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, can access the finance they need.  In this regard, the Government has recently put in place the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p><p> The report assesses progress implementing our 2014 country-specific recommendations, CSRs.  As committee members will be aware, Ireland received seven CSRs last year.  These covered public finances, health care spending, active labour market policies, social inclusion, access to finance, non-performing loans in the financial sector and legal services.  Progress is broadly on track and consistent with policy directions already firmly established at national level.</p><p> Preparation of Ireland's national reform programme, NRP, for 2015 is under way.  It will formally report on the progress in implementing our CSRs as well as progress towards our Europe 2020 targets in the areas of employment, research and development, climate change and energy, education and social inclusion.  The NRP will also set out the macroeconomic context, which is further elaborated on in our stability programme update, which is due for presentation to the Commission in April.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the views of the committee on the semester process and the key priorities and challenges that might be reflected in this year's NRP.  Similarly, views are being sought from a wide range of civil society stakeholders.  It is important that engagement with the European semester be supported and national ownership be encouraged.  Last year, my predecessor, the then Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, presented a draft of the NRP to the committee for discussion and consideration before submission to the Commission.  If the Chairman is agreeable, I would be delighted to return to the committee to discuss our draft of the NRP in the coming weeks or April.  I thank members for their attention during what was a reasonably long speech and look forward to whatever comments or questions they may have.</p></speech>

Today, we will limit contributions to three minutes per person because of the time constraints.  I will try to keep mine to that.</p> <p>  I wish to raise two subjects, namely, Greece and Macedonia.  Regarding Greece, many believe that the four-month programme agreed in February is starting to unwind.  My understanding is that, of the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, of &euro;2 billion that was requested, &euro;500 million was given and has more or less been spent and Athens is just a few days away from running out of money.  The finance Minister, speaking in today's press, stated, "I can only say that we have money to pay salaries and pensions of public employees.  For the rest we will see."  The situation seems to be worsening and the language appears to be heating up.  For example, Mr. Jeroen Dijsselbloem appeared to reject the reform proposals in Brussels yesterday.  He stated, "We have to stop wasting time and really start talks seriously."</p> <p>  That is one side of the argument.  On the other side in Greece, the defence Minister, Mr. Panos Kammenos, spoke about the possibility of Europe forcing Greece, which we have said we will not do.</p><p>He stated: <blockquote><br /><br />If Europe leaves us in the crisis, we will flood it with migrants, and it will be even worse for Berlin if in that wave of millions of economic migrants there will be some jihadists of the Islamic State too ... If they strike us, we will strike them.</blockquote></p></speech>

I am concerned that we are seeing an increase in the temperature of the argument and ask the Minister of State whether he thinks the different positions are reconcilable.</p> <p>  In regard to the situation in Macedonia, we have previously discussed issues relating to the Balkans.  We are concerned about the political situation in Macedonia where the government has jailed several journalists and the leader of the opposition who was making charges of wrongdoing against it, including eavesdropping of citizens, electoral fraud and interfering with the judiciary.  The Prime Minister promised an inquiry, but concerns have been expressed that it will not be independent.  When the General Affairs Council debates issues pertaining to the Balkans, I ask the Minister of State to raise these concerns.  I will ensure the details are sent to his office in advance of the Council.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.577" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015031000002#G00400"><p>We have a lengthy agenda and, while I would love to discuss the issue of Greece, I will focus on the eastern partnership arrangement with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia which we ratified as Irish Parliamentarians.  Given that Europe was a contributor to the unsettling events that occurred in Kiev, Donetsk, Luhansk and elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, I ask the Minister of State for his assurance that he will speak in the best interests of these countries in order that the European Union does not repeat the mistakes it made in the past.  I am conscious that Russia is viewed with differing degrees of intensity by those countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union.  Estonia and Latvia, for example, view Russia as an occupier rather than as a liberator.  They also have a more intense antipathy to the Russians than those of us who never witnessed occupation, other than by the British.  The key issue is to understand President Putin and the Russian Federation's attitude to what the European Union is doing in regard to these association agreements.  </p> <p>  Will the Minister of State assure me that he will set out a distinctively Irish position on the need for dialogue with a view to understanding the fears felt throughout the Russian Federation?  I am sure he is conscious that the European Union now realises, rather late in the day, that it is losing the propaganda war among, for example, Russian speakers in various countries which were formerly occupied, including, in particular, Ukraine.  I understand the summit may address the issue of developing a counter-propaganda machine on behalf of the West.  Perhaps the Minister of State might elaborate on how he thinks this propaganda machine would work.  I ask him to convey to his counterparts in Europe that the propagation of the right-wing elements in Ukraine, including fascists, neo-fascists and ultra-nationalists, only fosters the same propaganda in Russian media that we are trying to prevent.</p><p>Therefore, it is the EU's prerogative, in trying to react to Russia's negative propaganda, to show that they are not our allies and we do not support them.  In the formation of the present Government, one of the first disastrous moves it attempted was to outlaw Russian as Ukraine's second language.</p><p> We are moving into very sensitive territory.  We are approaching 2017, a very important period in Russia's history.  More important, I have lost friends in eastern Ukraine as a result of this debacle, and I do not want to lose friends in Moldova.  Members will remember the results of the election in Moldova and how sensitive these matters are.  The biggest political party is called a socialist party which is more pro-Putin and communist Russia than the official communist party.  There is a very delicate balance.  The people of the region must be understood if we are to keep them on the pro-European path.  I appeal to the Minister to use the well-established political dialogue process which we are very good at to keep the temperature down so that we are not seen to ally ourselves with those who give propaganda to Mr. Putin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.579" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015031000002#H00200"><p>I subscribe to Deputy Eric Byrne's views on Ukraine.  In the D&aacute;il, I have spoken in depth on Ukraine.  Much of Europe was sleepwalking regarding the corrupt Ukraine regime and did not consider how Russians were being treated in Crimea and in the eastern border areas.  Over the years, many of us have been raising the issue of large Russian-speaking populations being denied the right to speak their language and have it recognised and to join the police force, army and civil service.  This has allowed a disenfranchised group of people to seek solace where they originally came from, namely, Russia.  While I have no sympathy with Mr. Putin, I have sympathy with many of the Russian-speaking people.  It has been belatedly acknowledged across Europe that many in Ukraine were completely corrupt.  Some acknowledged their support for Hitler and his policies, while we sat by idly, year after year, knowing that whole groups of people, particularly the Russian speakers, were being treated badly and an outcome was inevitable.  Although we have to do something, it is probably a little late for Europe to intervene now.  There was no acknowledgement across Europe of the part Ukraine played in the debacle between Russia and Ukraine.  While I do not agree with Mr. Putin and his tactics, I sympathise with many Russians, whom I have spoken to and met, across different European countries such as Latvia regarding how they feel they are being treated by various governments.</p><p>I read an article in <i>Time</i>magazine in America which reported a comment by one of the top economists that what the troika had done was completely unrealistic and asking Greece to do what they were doing was nearly impossible.  The Greek debt stands at approximately &euro;317 billion, or 170% of GDP.  It is unpayable and impractical.  The Greeks cannot do it.  James Galbraith, who is recognised as a pretty good, reasonable economist, has said the conditions set for Greece are &quot;not recuperative, but punitive in character&quot;.  We all accept that because of the major unemployment and deprivation in Greece, there are social consequences that must be dealt with.  There are tax consequences where tax was not being collected.  Greece needs to create jobs in order to build the economy.</p><p>Basically, I imagine they are the three main cornerstones on which Greece will survive, that is, dealing with the social issues, tax and unemployment.  I seek the views of the Minister of State in respect of this unpayable debt.  If one thinks about this debt, it is 170% of GDP and while paying back what the troika and the European Union is asking of them would take 50 years, they still would be living in poverty.</p></speech>

While three minutes does not give members time to do justice to the issues involved, I have a couple of questions.  Does the Minister of State agree it is important, at this sensitive time in particular, that further arming of any side in Ukraine is not considered?  Britain has announced it intends to send military personnel to the region in the form of approximately 75 troops in the coming weeks.  The United States has announced it will send a battalion of soldiers to train Ukrainian battalions.  Does the Minister of State agree such steps towards greater militarisation are not helpful and that one should seek a demilitarisation of the process?  If one learns lessons from Ireland, that was one of the successes in that regard.  Will the General Affairs Council discuss this matter?  While all members condemn Russia's military involvement in support of the rebels, what precisely is Ireland's position?  Will Ireland seek more sanctions or what unique message will Ireland be sending to people in that region in this regard?</p> <p>  I have been asked to inquire of the Minister of State whether the COSAC contribution will be reflected in the updated 2020 strategy.  While I would like to think the remarks regarding Greece and migration were perhaps not very sensible throwaway comments, there is a lot of anger and frustration in Greece.</p></speech>

As for the talks themselves, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has stated there is a lack of detail on the Greek side and I am told the Eurogroup meeting was fairly short.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is quoted as saying that future negotiations on reforms will be based out of the office of the Greek Deputy Prime Minister, which again suggests the Finance Minister of Greece now is being shunted aside.  However, I have read material online in which he has stated this was not the case.  He was blaming this on bad journalism but it also appears to be following a narrative coming out of Ireland to the effect that there is no detail and nothing substantial is coming from the Greeks.  We appear to be the only ones coming out with that line, certainly in public, and I am interested in finding out what precisely is happening in this regard.</p> <p>  I refer to the statement by Jean-Claude Juncker that our future as Europeans will one day involve a European army.  Further statements in this regard have been made, such as when the head of NATO talked about looking forward to the day Ireland joins NATO and so on.  Will the Irish Government be saying anything in respect of Mr. Juncker's wishes?  Will Ireland raise its opposition to joining any European Union army in particular during this discussion on Russia?  Again, I am coming from the angle that I wish to see greater demilitarisation, not militarisation and this pushes people further into corners.  I apologise to the Chairman for going on.</p></speech>

Part of the function of the Minsk agreement was to encourage Ukraine to introduce further reforms.  Ireland's approach is to seek a broader strategy in respect of relations with Russia, rather than looking only through the prism of Ukraine.  In regard to the Irish view on sanctions, our position is that we want the terms of the Minsk agreements to be upheld.  We welcome, for example, recent prisoner exchanges and de-escalation, and we have always said that sanctions should be scalable.  Therefore, our urging would be to encourage further de-escalation, which would lead, as a consequence, to reductions in sanctions.  We are not of the view that a military solution is in existence for the problems in eastern Ukraine.  That has consistently been the Irish position.</p><p> The Chairman had a question about the Republic of Macedonia.  The situation there is not on the agenda for the forthcoming General Affairs Council, but I would be happy to raise the issue on his behalf and accept his helpful suggestion that a note be sent to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Certainly, the situation in the Republic of Macedonia is very worrying.  I understand Commissioner Hahn recently visited there.  I will be glad to raise the matter on behalf of the committee.</p><p> I have read some of the commentary by the Greek defence Minister but it was not part of our discussions.  I have not seen the full text and cannot comment on his possible motivation other than to note that the broader migration issue is a concern, particularly for southern European countries.  Europe's migration policy will be discussed by the EU later this year and we hope it will be done in a measured manner, taking all valid concerns into account.</p><p> In regard to developments in Greece, the issue of specific detail is being discussed today.  It is not accurate to say that questions around detail are only being asked by Ireland.  The Chairman remarked on the comments yesterday by the Greek finance Minister, Mr. Dijsselbloem.  There is no denying that the situation in Greece is very challenging, with immediate concerns which need to be addressed in the coming months.  We must see progress in the coming days.  Financing is required this month to meet IMF repayments, interest payments and other financial obligations.  To say there is no time to lose is an accurate assessment of where we are at.  Much of the negotiations are of a very technical nature.  They are ongoing today and tomorrow and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is in attendance.  We will have more detail in the coming days and it is to be hoped there will be progress and success for all concerned.</p><p> Have I covered all the points that were raised, Chairman?</p></speech>

It was disappointing that all parties did not support what was proposed.  A process is ongoing in respect of the matter to which the Deputy refers.  While we wish to see progress in many areas in accession and applicant countries, there is no doubt that propaganda is emanating from Russia.  That is why moving towards a normalisation of relations between the EU and Russia is extremely important, not just in the context of Ukraine - particularly the eastern part of the country - but also with regard to a large group of countries which share the very worthwhile ambition to move towards obtaining the democratic freedoms enjoyed by those who live in member states of the European Union.  Ireland will seek to support all such countries in whatever way possible.  As the committee will be aware, further discussions involving the Eastern Partnership are due to take place in Riga on 21 May and these will place greater focus and emphasis on all of the relevant matters.</p></speech>

As members know, this committee is holding a series of meetings to examine the impact on Ireland should the UK decide to withdraw from the EU.  A referendum on this question has been promised by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, MP, if he is returned to power following the general election in May.  This committee took the decision to examine this matter at this time in view of the potential impact it could have on Ireland.</p><p>Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence associated with today's proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I expect that Sir Bill Cash has something similar in the House of Commons that he has to say at the beginning of every meeting.</p></speech>

I am very glad to meet the committee.  We greatly value the personal and political relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The Chairman and I have known one another for some time.</p> <p>  Speaking for myself, my own personal family relationship has Irish origins.  My grandmother was a Collins from County Cork.  John Bright, who was a great defender of Ireland during the 19th century, was my great grandfather's cousin.  He was a great friend of Daniel O'Connell on whom I am giving a talk in the Irish Embassy in London towards the end of this year.</p><p>Frederick Lucas was a Member of Parliament for County Meath, which is not very far from the Chairman's constituency of Meath East.  For practical purposes I feel very strongly about the Irish involvement.  At the more immediate and practical level, I think I was the first to recommend that we should make that &pound;1 billion loan to Ireland at the time of its financial troubles a few years ago.  I was greatly heartened to hear what the Minister of State said just now regarding the improvement in the Stability and Growth Pact.  I wish the country well because that is the way I feel about Ireland. </p><p> I would like to say also, because everything is not always sweetness and light, I recognise there are differences of opinion about the general question of the relationship of member states to the European Union and the need for change in that relationship.  It is well known that I strongly believe we need a fundamental change in the relationship as far as the United Kingdom is concerned because otherwise we will be greatly disadvantaged.  I will go into the reasons for that shortly.  The population in the United Kingdom is getting on towards 70 million, which puts us in a very different category from many other EC countries, other than countries such as Germany and France.</p><p> As far as I am concerned the heart of the issue is the question of democratic accountability and, as has been a constant theme of COSAC for a number of years, of which both your Chairman and I are members, also a question of democratic legitimacy.  The issue of the national parliaments in relation to the EU institutions, which we debated yesterday in the House of Common and which they are debating again today, is a critical factor because the obligations of member states to accept and comply with EU obligations is an evolving and ever integrating process, compounded by the majority voting system in the Council of Ministers, particularly as reformed since 1 November 2014.  By virtue of this reform Germany and France with two smaller states have a blocking minority and so forth.  There is the over-riding question of the role of the European Court of Justice.</p><p> In 2014, after taking extensive evidence, my committee, an all party committee, unanimously went so far, rightly in my opinion, having regard to the nature of the impact that the European Union is having on our democratic system as to propose that we should be able unilaterally to repeal legislation where it was necessary to our national interest and also to veto issues in the pipeline, both of which were implicit in the original entry to the EC.  The European Communities Act 1972 was a voluntary enactment by the United Kingdom Parliament in respect of which I would simply make one point, which is that the United Kingdom is the only member state which does not have a written constitution and therefore from that point of view we are in a different position from some others.  Our engagement in the European Union is therefore voluntary, as Lord Bridge made clear in the famous definitive case of Factortame some years ago. </p><p> I do not believe it is possible to have two governments and two parliaments covering the same issues because of the inconsistency and the contradictions that emerge and the tensions generated simply mean that the European Union, as I believe has become evident, simply cannot work on the current footing.  There is a democratic inconsistency between decisions which are taken by voters in general elections and ongoing decisions which are taken under the general rubric of the treaties themselves, and actual decisions that are taken by the Council of Ministers, often without a vote as such and done by consensus.  What the electors subsequently discover has been proposed and-or implemented, through the European institutions, for example by virtue of regulations, over which they  have little control or say, short of a referendum.</p><p>To this I would add the way in which COREPER functions and I would refer the committee, if it has not heard of it or come across it, to VoteWatch, a very distinguished body, headed up by Professor Simon Hix, which illustrates the fact that of the order of 90% of all European Commission proposals go through.  There may be some adjustments and there may be one or two things that get lost but basically it is around 90%.  That, I think, indicates the sheer tsunami of legislation that is coming through and raises serious questions in my judgment about the degree of democratic accountability.  It is also, perhaps, worth noting that <i>The Observer  </i>newspaper on 22 February, in relation to the question of a referendum, indicated in an opinion poll that 51% would leave.  I would go further and say from the evidence I have from a series of polls over many years that if a new relationship was negotiated on the basis of the United Kingdom returning to a structural change in the architecture of the Union as trade and political co-operation with the democratic sovereignty fundamentally being in Westminster that the figure would go up to around 70%, which is pretty significant.  <br/><br/>The European Union, in my judgment, is in a state of democratic and economic crisis and there seems to be no appetite for examining the reasons this is so, particularly in terms of the need for structural change in the architecture of the European Union to return ultimate decision making, while insisting on trade and co-operation, back to those who are elected in general elections to their national parliaments.  There is much talk of subsidiarity but little or none in practice.  I would add that President Barroso, at the time when he was President of the Commission, stated that the European Parliament - and only the European Parliament - is the parliament for the European Union.  That does not bode very well for the national parliaments.  That was post Lisbon, when we were supposed to have further and additional powers.  We discussed much of this in COSAC.<br/><br/>There is also the problem of the over domination of one country - Germany - over the economic and political position of the European Union, not only within the eurozone but by consequence also within the EU as a whole.  What was referred to earlier about the question of Greece and the very dramatic crisis which emerged yesterday is a very good indication of that degree of disorder.  I would also like, subject to the committee's views, to remind ourselves that there was substantial pressure - some would even say bullying - which took place at the moment when Ireland was in crisis a few years ago.  If I am right in what I can recall, the troika arrived in Dublin without even so much as the formal consent of the Irish Government, let alone the Irish Parliament.  The attitude of the troika was graphically described by Deputy Eric Byrne just now and I think the Chairman referred to it indirectly in terms of the situation which is currently under discussion among the Finance Ministers.  This is yet another indication of the attitude, as I said to the Prime Minister in the House of Commons last week.  I challenged him on the language that Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble has been using.</p><p>It is very unhelpful when one is talking in terms of crises within individual countries which are under intense pressure.  We need to be very realistic about what is going on.  The late Brian Lenihan was under very considerable pressure at that time.  Members will know more about that than I do, but I was watching it pretty closely and I got a very nasty feeling that there was something going on which was both pressurising and very unhelpful to resolving the difficulties Ireland faced.<br/><br/>I believe there was at one stage a rule of no bailouts.  We can park that one because we now know the whole European Union functions on bailouts.  In fact, it goes even further than that; it actually prints the money to pay for the bailouts on a scale which is simply unbelievable.  However, that is an economic argument into which I will not go but I am very worried about it because one earns money by taxing proper enterprise and not just by printing it in the printing presses.<br/><br/>The EU is not merely sleepwalking but is accelerating into disorder which is reflected in what I said I thought would happen when I wrote a book in 1990 called <i>Against a Federal Europe- The Battle for Britain</i>.  I hope I do not sound presumptuous when I say that in that book, I said the European Union and European government - this led me to lead the rebellion against Maastricht treaty all those years ago - would be accompanied sooner or later by the internal contradictions of all the kinds I have described and the economic pressures creating a problem of protests, riots, massive unemployment and the rise of extremism.  There are not many people who would seriously dispute that has actually happened as well as the lack of jobs for young people.  If one looks at Podemos and Syriza and at where the pressure is coming from and asks where all this is leading, I would have said there is a very strong case for everybody to take a step back, to have a really good look at the landscape without prejudice to the existing treaties and to ask what all this is for and if we want to have peace and security, which were what the original intentions of the European Community, now the European Union, were meant to be.  <br/><br/>Although many people have received huge sums of money and they have a defence commitment that goes with Article 5, because of the interconnection, none the less the intrinsic internal implosion, which is now virtually unstoppable, is the moment when we should pause to ask what kind of European Union we want, not to mention the imbalance in terms of trade between Germany and most of the other member states.  As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, we run a deficit with the other 27 member states of more than &euro;50 billion per year while Germany runs a surplus with the same 27 member states of more than &euro;50 billion year.  We would regard that as pretty indicative of the state of play for the United Kingdom.  We have a surplus selling the same goods and services to the rest of the world because we have these enormous opportunities in regard to the Anglo sphere, with our commercial ties, the language advantage we have and so forth . <br/><br/>We are confronted by a political union which is being presented more forcefully by Angela Merkel, as Chancellor Kohl did before her.  This is not a new issue.  National parliaments are being dumbed down and the element of trust is gone.  More than 60% in many countries in Europe have lost trust, according to the euro barometer poll.  The turnout in the European Parliament elections was barely 43% and that 43% only held up because quite a lot of older people voted.  The level of turnout among younger people in the European elections was derisory.  We are confronted by an unbalanced Union, which we see in regard to Greece, for example, but potentially other member states, such as Spain.</p><p>Furthermore, it is clear that subject to a referendum in the United Kingdom, the issue of Britain's role outside the eurozone, because we are certainly not going back in, and therefore being confined to the second tier of a two-tier European Union, is that the UK has a permanently decreasing role of influence.  I believe this cannot be remedied by the mantra that the UK has influence merely by being at a table, where the influence is diminished by the voting system and institutional arrangements defined by the <i>acquis</i>, not to mention the role of the Court of Justice which, under sections 2 and 3 of our European Communities Act 1972, overrides our Supreme Court and our Parliament.  This <i>acquis</i>, which can only be changed by unanimity and treaty change, is a real problem.  None of the answers to the problem is remotely on offer from the other member states.  Everybody is locked into the belief that one cannot change any of this.  Personally, I believe this is political suicide.  The European Union is creating a very serious problem for itself.<br/><br/>Hence the growing case for exit by the UK, bearing in mind that we have these external Anglosphere opportunities and a very substantial surplus with the rest of the world.  In any event, we would continue to be in a mutual trading relationship and political co-operation with the other member states, even if we were outside the EU.  I strongly believe it would not be in German interests, for example, if it were to knock out the approximately &euro;20 billion worth of cars and trucks that come into the UK, nor would Germany contemplate allowing it to happen.  At the same time, the EU as a whole is becoming less competitive in the big league table.  Then there is also the problem for us of the City of London, where we have lost five or six of the last seven court challenges.  In respect of over-regulation for business in general, as I am sure Ireland is discovering as well, even according to Peter Mandelson, when he was the Trade Commissioner over-regulation was costing the European Union 4% of GDP.  It is not a good story.<br/><br/>Many member states have made it clear that they wish the United Kingdom to remain in the EU.  I had a one-to-one meeting with the Norwegian Foreign Minister a week ago and he said that too.  However, this ultimately must be decided by the UK, and this must be through a referendum in the relatively near future.  The UK will hold the EU Presidency in 2017 and I do not believe it is practical to have a referendum then.  We must have it soon and I hope it will be in 2016.<br/><br/>This is the ultimate test.  If there is a paramount need in individual member states that the UK remain part of a European relationship, and I refer to Ireland in this context but other countries share that view, in light of our contribution to European matters over the last 100 years and more and also the fact, if I can put it in simple terms, that we saved Europe twice from tyranny, and with Irish help in the trenches, the issue must be decided by us.  If the UK remaining part of a European relationship is to be sustained and if this is so overwhelming an interest for the other member states, then in the national interests of other member states and in the European interest as a whole, bearing in mind our historic role, does this not lead to an essential question of restructuring the EU for this purpose?  If we are so integral, and if everybody says we must stay in, is there not a point where action becomes part of the dialogue to ensure that we get what is needed to preserve the integrity of Westminster as a national parliament?  In my view, this is not special pleading.  It is based on fundamental principles of democracy, freedom and common interests, which we all share.  The stakes are very high, but the principles of democracy are not negotiable and are fundamental in our national interest, and the preservation of our national parliament lies at the centre of this concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015031000002#S00100"><p>I thank Sir Bill Cash.  I have two questions for him.  His script states, &quot;In any event it would continue to be in the mutual interests of the member states of the EU and the UK to continue to trade and to achieve political co-operation, even if we were outside the EU&quot;.  In the event of an exit, some would say the <i>quid pro quo</i>relationship would not be possible.  The model would be more akin to the Swiss and Norwegian models, whereby the UK, in order to gain access to the Single Market, would have to make a contribution to the EU budget and adopt certain rules, regulations and legislation enacted in the Union.  What is Sir Bill Cash&rsquo;s view on that?  He referred to the imbalance in trade and stated it is in the interest of the Union to continue to trade.  He alluded to the United Kingdom having a population of 70 million and to a market of potentially 430 million to 440 million people.  Is he convinced there could be a relationship of equals?</p><p>My second question is on the motivation for an exit from the EU.  A remarkable aspect of Sir Bill Cash&rsquo;s contribution, on which I could be wrong, is that I did not hear the word &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; mentioned once.  The Irish audience often hears that the United Kingdom&rsquo;s motivation is based on immigration.  Members of the committee visited the United Kingdom recently to discuss this issue with political colleagues and organisations there.  It was put to us clearly that there are two groups interested in pushing the issue of renegotiation or Brexit.  One is concerned with the sovereignty issue, and that is very much what Sir Bill Cash has been discussing this afternoon.  The other concerns immigration and what is perceived to be a large number of additional immigrants entering the country over recent years.</p><p>I have a question on how the latter issue affects us in Ireland.  As Sir Bill Cash knows, we had the common travel area before the European Union was founded.  Ireland, along with the United Kingdom, has opted out of the Schengen agreement.  One motive behind an exit would be the desire to control the amount of immigration into the United Kingdom.  I include immigrants from countries within the European Union.  One could expect to see some restrictions placed on the entry of French citizens, for instance, yet those citizens could fly directly to Dublin from Paris and get a train to Belfast, thus entering the United Kingdom without having to show any passport.  Alternatively, they could drive through the open borders.  A French citizen who decides to visit or work illegally in the United Kingdom could fly to Ireland and make his way across the Border.  Ireland is probably the only country from which this could be achieved.  If French citizens entered the United Kingdom via the English Channel, they would have to show some sort of identification or ticket to do so.  How would this work? How could those who are concerned about the level of immigration into the United Kingdom be convinced that suitable structures would be put in place at the Irish end to prevent people using Ireland as a back door into the Untied Kingdom?</p><p>I invite Senator Kathryn Reilly to ask her questions, and she is to be followed by Deputy Eric Byrne.</p></speech>

He commented on democratic accountability and "structural change in the architecture of the EU to return ultimate decision making" to national parliaments.  He referred also to the over-domination of one country, an imbalanced Union, the decreasing role of influence, the voting system and institutional arrangements.  He spoke about the fundamental change in the relationship and, perhaps, a return to a structure of trade and political co-operation whereby democratic accountability, sovereignty and ultimate decision-making would be returned to Westminster.</p><p>In an ideal world, what kind of concrete changes or fundamental restructuring would the witness like to see?  He has referred to the integrity of Westminster as the national Parliament and bringing decision-making back, but what changes would he like to see in concrete terms?  He might outline one or two.</p><p> Sir Bill Cash also referred to the preservation of the national parliament as the centre of concern.  Are there any potential negative repercussions of exit?  Domestically where people considered there were negative economic consequences, could there be a backlash?  Finally, I pick up on something the Chairman was saying on the personal and political relationships between Ireland and Britain.  Aside from trading relationships, how does the witness see any exit affecting relations?  Specifcally, how would he propose to deal with North-South arrangements here and in the North of Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.621" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Sir William Cash" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015031000002#T00200"><p>Very simply, the model I would go for would not be the EEA, with which there are serious problems in relation to free movement.  That raises the question of immigration also.  The Swiss model, which is EFTA plus, would be the direction in which I would go, with us regaining our place in the WTO.  In other words, we would re-establish relationships on that footing.  At the same time, I recognise the question of the North-South Irish dimension.  All I can say, as I said at the beginning, is that we have very strong personal relations and, I think, political relations which have been getting better and better in relation to both North and South.  The improvements, with some difficulties, which are embedded as a result of the Good Friday Agreement and other developments and the goodwill that has been generated are such that we would overcome any issues.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to a backlash, but I do not see one.  While there are risks on the economic front and we trade with the European Union on a very substantial footing, it is only approximately 40% of our trade.  I will not bore the committee with all the economic arguments, but I assure the members that very strong arguments have been put forward by distinguished economists to demonstrate why we would not be disadvantaged economically and that the myth that 3 million jobs are at risk is a nonsense.  Nevertheless, that is still put forward as an accusation by some of the organisations that disagree with the kind of analysis I have on the subject from, for example, Roger Bootle.  We have some very powerful economists on our side of the equation.  When the person from the Institute of Fiscal Studies was quoted to the effect that 3 million jobs were at risk, he said immediately that it was Goebbels-like propaganda which he had never issued.  Nevertheless, it is still part of common parlance.</p> <p>  Our small and medium size businesses are heavily over-regulated.  Many people want a new relationship.  Irrespective of whether they want specifically to get out, they want a new and fundamental change in the relationship.  All of these things indicate that the good common sense of the British people is coming through.  They are being realistic and there is a real opportunity for our relationship with other countries in Europe to continue while extending our relationship with the rest of the world.  I do not see it as a backlash, to put it as simply as that.  We have a very good opportunity to act here.</p><p>With regard to the role of the City of London, we have multinationals, Goldman Sachs and other big companies making statements regularly.  Does anybody really think that the British people as a whole will be influenced by international bankers when they come to a decision like this?  I do not think so.</p></speech>

For example, we are an international trading country with a small population and an open economy.  So we are somewhat different from many other European countries.  With our bailout, we had to do things quickly because there was huge erosion in terms of confidence and capital flight that could not be tolerated.</p> <p>  Sir Bill Cash mentioned quantitative easing, which incidentally has been practised by Britain.</p></speech>

Surely the European Union represented a coming together of national parliaments, a sharing of sovereignty, a sharing of democracy.  That has been proven by the European Union to date in that it has succeeded in achieving the greatest single period in European history of peace, co-operation and economic development.  Does Sir Bill Cash agree that the European Union has developed immeasurably economically in the past 60 years in a way that it had not done before?

In the United States there was no union in the beginning, but there was a civil war that was fought on the basis of a union or otherwise - there were other issues as well.  However, it produced a union that has grown and stuck together.  Unlike the European Union, the United States has a single currency, from which Europe shied away, much to its detriment.  I believe that unless and until a single currency prevails across Europe, there cannot be economic or political cohesion to the extent that would be naturally beneficial to the Union.  The people of Europe will not be able to access the benefits of that huge 450 million people Single Market.</p> <p>  Sir Bill Cash mentioned the need to protect the democratic system of his national parliament.  We would all like to think the same thing.  We would like to think that we have protected it to a fairly considerable extent.  I imagine the French believe they have managed to protect the democratic system.  How does Sir Bill Cash suppose that 28 member states can each protect the system, as they know it, and the tradition of their particular parliamentary system, some of which have had varying degrees of democracy over the years?  Is it possible in a union?</p><p>Does Britain contribute to the concept of that union?  Has Britain immersed itself in the concept of the European Union since the beginning?  Or, as would appear from what Sir William has told us, has Britain looked at it from the outside?  We have a number of people in this country who look at it from the outside as well and as yet do not recognise that the European currency is our currency on which we depend.  There is a possibility that Britain has looked at the EU from the outside and a "them and us" situation has developed.</p><p> I put it to Sir William that it is not in the interests of the EU or of Britain to separate.  I predict that in the event of that happening, Europe will find itself at loggerheads with itself in the very near future.  This has happened before, with the full knowledge of all concerned, when all were watching what took place without saying anything and each in turn decided to seize the opportunity for their own particular gain.  My view is that it does not work that way and we have moved ahead from that.  If we retrench and go back on our word to our fellow Europeans we will be setting an unwelcome and hugely destructive standard.</p><p> Mr. Barroso was quoted as saying that the only EU Parliament was the Parliament of the European Union.  He was right, of course.  We cannot have 28 member state parliaments all claiming to be parliaments of the European Union.  They are parliaments within the EU and constituent bodies of the EU and the parliamentary system.  National parliaments influence the European Parliament and European thinking.  </p><p> Over recent years, we have heard about the Swiss, Swedish and Finnish models.  All kinds of models have been brought before us in their economic and historical contexts.  In the case of Britain it is somewhat different.  Although Britain is a much bigger country than Ireland with a much bigger population and much more economic clout, it is now a little like Ireland.  Things have moved on from the time of the Commonwealth, which was much more powerful and influential 60 years ago.  Now, Britain is much more dependent on the European Union and trade with the EU.  Does Sir William believe that an exit from the Union, which he believes the British people will choose as is their right, will benefit the UK economy in any way?  Britain will have to make the same contributions to the EU as it does now if it intends to trade with it.  </p></speech>

We will send Sir William a copy of the final report.  To a man and a woman, and not from an Irish nationalistic perspective, it has been argued here that an exit would be disastrous for both Ireland and England.  Sir William is aware that we in Ireland are very supportive of the European relationship.  He is also aware that we have a divided island, and his traditional allies are the Northern Unionists who sit in his Parliament.</p><p>It would be interesting to know what position they might take post an election.</p><p> Unfortunately, our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues have left.

One made the comment that, currently, the UK has the best of both worlds.  It has the Common Market and all of the benefits derived from same while it has its own currency, central bank and so on.</p> <p>  Deputy Byrne touched on the question of the impact on the Union.  If Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were to vote "No", which is possible, while England voted "Yes" to exit and the overall vote was "Yes", what would the implications be?  The SNP has taken some soundings in Scotland along these lines.  Would such a scenario hasten the break-up of the Union?</p> <p>  In light of our meetings last week, three issues keep arising: loss of sovereignty, on which Sir William has a strong view; immigration and the free movement of people, which I believe he mentioned; and bureaucracy, red tape and so on.  Various facets of Sir William's party have different problems with these issues.  Some are more easily solved than others, with bureaucracy and red tape probably the easiest.</p><p>A number of countries would share Sir William's concerns in that regard.  Some countries might find common ground on the issue of immigration and free movement, while sovereignty is a bigger picture.  Is there scope for some of these issues to be solved in order to persuade members of Sir William's party to support continued membership of the Union?  If the UK leaves, we have a vested interest in terms of our common border with Northern Ireland.  How does he envisage the operation of a land border with a country that is not in the European Union?  After all that has happened, passport controls would certainly not be desirable.  Ireland might be viewed as an easy way for EU migrants to enter the UK.</p><p> The party appears to be becoming more anti-EU at the grassroots level.  Where does Sir William see scope for former pro-Europeans?  If Michael Heseltine or Kenneth Clarke came along today as young aspiring MPs, would they even get through the selection process to stand for Parliament?  They were capable individuals with strong voices, even if Sir William might have disagreed with them on European issues.</p></speech>

Deputy Kyne and the Chairman raised the issue of immigration.  The fact is that we are actually a small island.  We debated this very issue in the House of Commons yesterday because I had to force the Government to accept an amendment on the question of the Commission's work programme.  For more than a year, it had refused to hold a debate on free movement.  My committee had recommended that we should have a debate on the floor of the House of Commons on benefits migration and benefits tourism.  It resolutely refused such a debate but it would not tell us why other than that it was a matter of collective responsibility.  As Deputy Kyne indicated, it is a very controversial subject.  The reason it is controversial is not because people do not like immigrants, although some elements clearly take that view, but because of practical questions about size, scale, social housing and education.  Many people take a realistic and common sense view of immigration.  A large number of people who come from other countries to do things in the fields for the agriculture sector, and in London generally, are playing an important part in the British economy.  Incidentally, one can hardly be surprised that they want to come to the United Kingdom given that we have a very good economy thanks to this government, or at least matters are certainly improving a great deal.  There is a natural magnetism towards the United Kingdom.  I do not want to present an entirely negative picture of immigration but practical questions arise.</p> <p>  I believe we will resolve the specific issues of the North and South of the Border because of the common purpose we would have if Ireland recognised that, in an effort to tighten the relationship, we would be out of Schengen, just as we are now.</p><p>I do not see a practical problem because it is between us and Ireland, and our arrangements regarding voting and common travel have been embedded for a very long time.  Our historical ties are such that I do not see a problem.  Any problems that did exist would be ironed out.  I do not see it as a problem for Ireland.</p><p> I cannot say whether we will enter an EFTA type arrangement, given that I am offering only my personal views based on having been on the committee for 30 years, having studied it carefully and being chairman, although I am not speaking as chairman.  However, while I do not want to sound presumptuous, if we were to enter an EFTA type arrangement, we would have a very good opportunity for other countries to join us in the new EFTA arrangements.  Although this would not be the view of Deputy Durkan or, perhaps, anybody else in the room, I believe, given the extent to which Ireland is connected to our economy, that there are other countries which, if there were a structural change in the relationship, could look to their electorates.  Given that these countries want to have European co-operation and trade, they could consider all the advantages in terms of the implosion that is happening with protests, riots and unemployment.  Given that the UK has this dynamic within it which is extremely valuable to us as a country - I refer to Ireland - a new relationship could include Ireland in its framework as well as some other countries in an EFTA type arrangement.  We could have the advantages of co-operation and - if I may say to Deputy Durkan - the UK's strength, history and tradition, mixed as it might be thought to be.</p><p> I do not buy the argument that the EU has created peace since 1945.  Bluntly, NATO and the Cold War did that.  The EU is moving in the direction I predicted in 1990, towards implosion.  It is time, as I said earlier, that people stood back and asked whether there could be a new relationship between all the countries.  I must address the question Deputy Durkan raised on the extent to which we are examining the European issue from the outside.  No.  I would say the opposite.  We are very much examining it realistically from the inside, and those who agree with me do not like what we see as it has evolved, although I voted "Yes" in 1975.  I also voted for the Single European Act in 1986.  However, I proposed an amendment, which I was not allowed to debate then although I could now, specifying that we should preserve our sovereignty within that framework.  I believe there is far too much ideological nonsense about the fact that one cannot come up with a new concept of a European co-operative association, such as EFTA plus, in which everybody could benefit from trading co-operation without being bullied and forced into doing things by a majority vote when they do not want to.  Such bullying creates more internal resentment and democratic and economic protest, which we are seeing throughout Europe with the exception of Germany and one or two other countries.  There is another model.  The single currency has proved to be a straitjacket which has caused immense problems for many countries.  I see Deputy Durkan shaking his head.  There are countries that regard it as a straitjacket.  One cannot devalue within it.</p></speech>

For practical purposes, Europe already is at loggerheads with itself and this is evident.  It may not be that there have been riots and protests in Ireland but go to Italy, Spain, Greece or other countries, Portugal also has had its dose, and there are really serious problems that could be avoided by having a more flexible arrangement.  The idea of having vetoes does not mean to say one would use them the whole time.  As for the way one could achieve co-operation, which I would have thought is what subsidiarity ultimately is all about, one would achieve that degree of agreement whereby, if it was clear there was a vital national interest a particular country could not stomach, one would not go down that route.  If I may, I will refer to the White Paper of 1971 when we joined.  That might seem a long time ago but it is only 40-odd years.  The structure of the 1972 Act with which we still live, and which is quite clear - it is a very short Act - effectively rules out the idea of our being able now, as a result of subsequent treaties, to exercise a veto.  However, at the time the aforementioned White Paper went through, it included a very important statement that when entering the European Community, we would do so on the basis that in our vital national interest, we would retain the veto.  Moreover, there was an interesting further sentence that went on to state that to do otherwise would endanger the very fabric of the European Community itself.  This was because people recognised that if one tries to push everybody into a compression chamber and they do not want it, one will get the lack of trust that now has developed to the level of up to 60% to which I referred.  In addition, one will have a low turnout of approximately 40% of the whole of the European Union.  Moreover, as I believe some countries have compulsory voting, this means the turnout was very low indeed.  This is not good evidence that everything is hunky-dory and it is very important for us to step back.</p> <p>  If I may, I will refer briefly and finally to the question of what will happen within the respective parts of the United Kingdom.  I think Deputy Kyne is right and that in Scotland, there is a very different perception as reflected by the SNP.  The SNP had a meteoric rise around the time of the referendum and is embedding itself.  I think I was the first to identify this point and will give the joint committee a book I wrote about John Bright afterwards, which has a chapter on the entire question of Britain and Ireland in the mid-19th century in respect of the issue of home rule, but at the 1922 Committee a few weeks ago, I stated that I thought Alex Salmond would be like Parnell.  I said that what will happen is he will come down and some even think the SNP might get 40 to 45 seats from Labour.  I agree with the Deputy that they are very different in their attitudes to the European Union, but in the event of a referendum, David Cameron, in reply to a question I put to him, has ruled out the possibility that Nicola Sturgeon was putting forward, which is that Scotland would have its own separate referendum regarding the European Union or would be able to disaggregate the votes that were taken in the referendum.  I can only state that they will strive for that, as they will strive for the disintegration of the United Kingdom because like Parnell's objective, that is absolute for them, and will create massive disruption in the House of Commons.  This is why I was in favour of English laws and presented my paper to Chequers for that purpose when David Cameron invited us there.</p><p>I think there is a real problem with the SNP.  By the way, I do not think the SNP will enter into a formal coalition with the Labour Party because that would be a Trojan horse for the Labour Party for sure.  There is a lot of debate about this.  Alex Salmond is a very accomplished political performer and, more than that, practitioner.  He will create havoc if he has a lot of seats and holds the balance of power.  On the European issue, I remind the committee that the preponderance of the United Kingdom population is in England.  We could be presented with some very difficult questions if the SNP comes down and really disrupts the House of Commons on the basis that it wants to achieve independence for Scotland.  I do not disagree with the Deputy that the SNP has a different view on the EU, although I have heard it is not as consistent as some people think.  There are people in Scotland who recognise that being part of the United Kingdom has great advantages.  It should not be forgotten that we won the vote on that by ten percentage points.</p></speech>

I know it is a long time ago, but this is what he said:<blockquote><br /><br />We know that we have made no discoveries, and we think that no discoveries are to be made in morality, nor many in the great principles of government, nor in the ideas of liberty, which were understood long before we were born ....  We have not been drawn and trussed, in order that we may be filled, like stuffed birds .... with chaff and rags and paltry blurred shreds of paper about the rights of men.</blockquote>That was his reply to Thomas Paine.</p></speech>

I remind people that mobile phones should be switched off or left in aeroplane mode, as they interfere with the broadcasting of proceedings.  This meeting marks the beginning of the joint committee's pre-legislative scrutiny hearings to examine the heads of the public health (alcohol) Bill, which the Minister for Health has published and referred in early February to the committee for its consideration.  The joint committee has a consistent record in promoting a range of health measures.  Members have been interested in and supportive of measures to tackle tobacco consumption as well as alcohol and substance misuse, and given the public interest in the issue raised by the Bill, the joint committee has consulted with key stakeholders and will engage with the public on these proposals.  We have asked for written submissions through the joint committee's page on the Oireachtas website and have received almost 60 submissions on the Bill.  The joint committee will hold meetings on the Bill, beginning today, with stakeholders, academics and experts.  At the end of its deliberations, the joint committee will produce a report to the Minister noting key issues and recommendations.  Our second session will be held on Thursday, 12 March at 11:15 a.m. when we will be joined by Dr. John Holmes from Sheffield University's alcohol research group, who is an international expert on minimum unit pricing of alcohol.  In addition, the Minister for Health has intimated to the joint committee that he wishes to attend the conclusion of its hearings in order to engage with it before the joint committee produces its final report.</p> <p>  I welcome to our meeting this afternoon Professor Frank Murray, who is the president of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI, and chair of its policy group on alcohol.  He is also a liver specialist at Beaumont Hospital.  I also welcome his colleagues accompanying him: Dr. Len O'Hagan, chief executive officer of the RCPI, Professor Aiden McCormick, Dr. Stephen Stewart, and Ms Siobh&aacute;n Creaton, head of public affairs and advocacy.  All the witnesses are welcome and I thank them for their attendance.</p> <p>  Before we commence, I remind witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I must leave the meeting at 5.55 p.m.  In the absence of the Vice Chairman, is it agreed that Deputy Neville will take over as Acting Chairman?  Agreed.  I invite Professor Murray to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Frank Murray" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015031000002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I am here to speak on behalf of my fellow liver colleagues here, as well as the other people in the medical profession represented by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, RCPI.  I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to speak about the heads of the public health (alcohol) Bill 2015.  I am representing the RCPI's policy group on alcohol, which has made a submission to the joint committee.  Our college represents more than 10,000 members and fellows who work as hospital consultants, registrars and senior house officers in hospitals, as well as in other health care settings at home and abroad.  RCPI doctors work in 27 specialties treating all types of medical condition including cancer and liver diseases in both hospital and community settings.  They work on the front line of the health services with nurses and other colleagues caring for patients, many of whom have come to us as a result of hazardous or problem drinking.  That really is why we are here today.</p> <p>  It has been estimated that approximately 1,500 hospital beds are occupied every night in hospitals directly because of alcohol harm.  This costs approximately &euro;1.2 billion per year, and in view of the current crisis in beds, with hundreds of patients on trolleys in accident and emergency departments, it is a national shame.  As liver specialists, I and the three doctors present are saddened and shocked by the increased number of deaths due to cirrhosis of the liver, which has doubled in the last 20 years.  This doubling in the death rate from liver cirrhosis and liver failure reflects the doubling in alcohol consumption in Ireland that had taken place in the preceding years, because we now are drinking more than twice what we drank in the 1960s.  Alcohol also is classed as one of the most important causes of cancer in Ireland, primarily breast, colon and oesophageal.  Alcohol also is a factor in suicide, domestic abuse and incidents and accidents.  One in ten first admissions to Irish psychiatric hospitals in Ireland are alcohol-related, and more than 25% of all injuries presenting to accident and emergency departments are alcohol-related.</p> <p>  We believe Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol is at crisis point.  The World Health Organization tells us that almost half of all Irish drinkers engage in heavy episodic drinking on a regular basis and that Ireland is close to the top of the binge drinking league worldwide.  Research also has shown that approximately 80% of Irish adults consume alcohol and that more than half of those are classified as harmful drinkers by their own admission.  Approximately 10% of those who consume alcohol are dependent on it, and this percentage rises to 15% in the 18 to 24 year old age group.  This means we live in a country where virtually every family is affected by alcohol, and I doubt there is anyone in this room who does not have a family member or friend who is affected by problems related to alcohol.</p><p>As doctors, we are increasingly caring for more than 200,000 chronic dependent drinkers who are attending with organ damage, cancers, cirrhosis and liver failure, heart failure and problems related to the brain and nervous system.<br/><br/>Every weekend parents worry about their children getting involved in drinking games or being hurt or killed in road traffic accidents or fights when they go out with their friends.  Everyone is affected by the social disorder in towns and cities late at night.  There is also an enormous economic cost that we are all bearing.  It costs &euro;3.7 billion a year to provide health care and public order enforcement as a result of problem drinking.  About a third of that, just over &euro;1 billion, is spent annually by the Government on providing care in accident and emergency departments.  This is an enormous sum that has the potential to do much good in many other areas of society if it could be otherwise deployed.<br/><br/>As an advocate of public health measures, the RCPI has commended the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the Government on its introduction of this legislation, which is an important and major step in tackling Ireland&rsquo;s problem drinking.  Legislators have listened to us and have taken action.  We wish to support them fully.  RCPI has come together with Alcohol Action Ireland to form the Alcohol Health Alliance Ireland to advocate for the adoption of this Bill.  The Bill contains many of the evidence-based measures for which our policy group, made up of experts caring for people affected by alcohol use, including liver specialists such as myself and my colleagues, psychiatrists, paediatricians and general practitioners, has called.<br/><br/>We know there are powerful and well resourced vested interests who will be working to dilute some aspects of this legislation to safeguard the profits they are required to deliver for their shareholders.  It feels like a David versus Goliath situation in that we are not funded from the public purse, but there is a groundswell of support for this legislation.  Research by the Health Research Board showed that a majority of the public are supportive of measures to tackle problem drinking, even if they are not the most vocal in this debate.  It is a kind of silent majority.  There is plenty of public discourse about alcohol and unease about our image as a nation of heavy drinkers.  This is not something of which we are generally proud.  I believe the time is right to implement radical solutions to address the awful problem of alcohol in Ireland.<br/><br/>There are many looking to the committee as legislators to step up and grasp this opportunity to introduce new laws that will immediately save lives.  Committee members should be confident that not only is this legislation necessary but it is what the public demands.  The introduction of a minimum unit price for alcohol, reducing the availability of alcohol and restrictions on advertising and labelling of alcohol products are the way forward if we are serious about changing the way people consume alcohol.<br/><br/>Although we are supportive of the legislation, we are concerned about the lack of timelines provided in it for the implementation of minimum unit pricing, as well as for a sports sponsorship ban and the statutory code on the display of alcohol.  We call on the committee to ensure that these measures will be enforced once the legislation is enacted.<br/><br/>Minimum unit pricing is the single most important aspect of this legislation.  It will reduce the flood of cheap alcohol that tends to be disproportionately consumed by young drinkers as well as problem drinkers.  Robust evidence from Canada shows that it will immediately mean that lives are saved and that fewer people are harmed as a result of their use of alcohol.  It also has the beneficial effect of reductions in crime levels.<br/><br/>It is worth reflecting that Ireland made history and showed great leadership in introducing the workplace smoking ban in 2004 in the face of a powerful tobacco lobby.  We have the opportunity again, particularly as a small country, to take a lead role in regulating the sale of alcohol.  As well as saving lives here, the adoption of minimum unit pricing would facilitate the implementation of similar legislation in the UK and further afield.  We support setting a minimum unit price of at least &euro;1, the same price as a litre of milk.  It needs to be around this price to be effective.  Whenever this issue gets discussed, the debate quickly seems to focus on how much a bottle of wine will cost.  As there are eight to ten units in a bottle of wine, that would price it between &euro;8 and &euro;10.<br/><br/>It is important to reflect on what has happened elsewhere.  Interestingly, countries such as France and Italy, which are major wine producers, have managed to dramatically reduce national consumption of alcohol in recent years at a time when the amount of alcohol being consumed in Ireland has been rising rapidly.  Consumers in France and Italy tend to drink better or higher quality wine but less of it.  Italians used to drink twice as much as Irish people <i>per capita</i>but now they drink less than half.  We are not prohibitionists, and most of us take a drink.  It is important, however, to state that there is no safe level at which to consume alcohol.  Just in the past few weeks, research published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>debunked old myths about a drink being good for us, with findings that drinking alcohol is of no benefit to anyone&rsquo;s health.<br/><br/>One does not have to be addicted to alcohol to get cirrhosis of the liver.  Forming a habit of regularly drinking pints or glasses of wine will damage one&rsquo;s liver and other organs in a serious way over time.  We care for many patients who have found themselves unwittingly in the tragic situation of not being addicted to alcohol but drinking heavily and habitually and developing organ failure as a result.<br/><br/>Tackling the price and availability of alcohol is the most effective way to change our relationship with alcohol.  This is why we want to see separation of sales of alcohol so that it is not displayed beside everyday groceries.  It is not an ordinary commodity.  We also welcome the intention to enable better enforcement of a ban on selling to those who are underage.  We can see how well environmental health officers have enforced the smoking ban.  We want to see similar resources and priority given to policing sales to those who are underage as part of the new legislative package.  The Bill should include provisions for strict regulation and enforcement around online drinks promotions, a reduction in the number of outlets where alcohol can be purchased, and further restrictions on opening times.<br/><br/>We also want to see a timeframe introduced for the phasing out of sponsorship of sports events by the alcohol industry.  The tobacco industry opposed the move to ban advertising of its products in 2003, claiming it would result in damage to sport.  Clearly that did not happen, but this argument is again being rolled out to protect lucrative campaigns that are enormously effective in terms of recruiting the next generation of drinkers.  It is disappointing that the public health (alcohol) Bill will not contain a ban on sports sponsorship.  This is a provision we will continue to advocate.<br/><br/>There is very strong evidence to link promotion of alcohol through sports sponsorship with early and more problematic alcohol consumption in young people.  Drinks companies are investing in advertising and sponsoring these events because they achieve their purpose - namely, they boost alcohol sales.  We strongly recommend that a commencement date be set for the phasing out of alcohol sponsorship of sport in the medium term and a target date for the ending of all alcohol sport sponsorship in the longer term.<br/><br/>In the weeks and months ahead, the committee will hear about the nanny state and will be asked why it is necessary to introduce measures that affect the entire population when hazardous drinking affects only a few.  There are more than 200,000 chronically dependent drinkers, which represents a large number of people requiring care and support, whatever way one looks at it.  International research, as well as doctors, nurses and those on the health care front line, can say that Irish people generally drink in excess of recommended low-risk limits.<br/><br/>There are also important issues of social justice in introducing the measures in this Bill.</p><p>The socially disadvantaged suffer disproportionately from the effects of alcohol.  The proposed measures will help these individuals and reduce health inequality.  While we have made great strides in extending life expectancy, quality of life can be infinitely improved by drinking less alcohol.<br/><br/>One of the leading public health advocates, Professor Geoffrey Rose, tells us that the best way to address large-scale public health problems is to manipulate the environment and context.  In this case we are looking to members, as legislators, to control the price and availability of alcohol and seize the opportunity to finally help us to banish the image of the drunken Irish and save the next generation from certain health harms<font color="#2F2F2F">.  </font>Let us grasp the opportunity to turn off the tap of cheap, harmful alcohol and set a constructive path for drinking alcohol in Ireland.</p></speech>

Professor Murray outlined in stark detail the difficulties that we as a nation have with drink and our unhealthy relationship with alcohol.  For a long time, there has been a tacit acceptance that we have a little problem with drink which we are incapable of dealing with or facing up to as a mature society.  While the issue has been swept under the carpet for a long time, it has come to a head in recent years, notably in our hospital emergency units at night, especially weekend nights.  Alcohol leaves a trail of destruction in its wake in terms of health and societal damage.  We stand at a crossroads as we decide how to address the problem.  While my party welcomes the proposed Bill and hopes it will make an impact, it is only a stepping stone.  Further measures will be required, including an overall ban on alcohol advertising.</p> <p>  I propose to elaborate on several issues that arise in this regard.  If we want to bring members of the public with us, we must base our thesis and ideas on facts and frame the Bill accordingly.  Many people regard the World Health Organization statistics on binge drinking as extreme and will argue that the maximum number of units per week set by WHO does not take Irish habits into account and is not based on scientific evidence.  A person we would consider to be a light drinker would be categorised as a binge drinker under the WHO threshold for maximum alcohol consumption.  I ask Professor Murray to elaborate on that issue.  We need a firm acceptance that the World Health Organization standards are those on which we should base our efforts. </p> <p>  We must persuade the wider public, legislators and everyone else concerned to accept the difficulties the country has with alcohol.  Has the introduction of minimum unit pricing or similar measures in other countries resulted in an immediate improvement, for example, in respect of the visibility of the alcohol problem on the streets and in emergency departments at weekends?  How long does it take for such measures to filter through to health outcomes?  I presume it takes some time before they feed into health outcomes, such as reductions in the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver, which can be seen in statistics?  Is there any scientific evidence to show that health outcomes begin to improve dramatically and quickly following the introduction of such measures?</p> <p>  Professor Murray referred to younger people.  Every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night when young people head into town, parents worry about whether their children will return home in one piece or end up in an emergency department.  This is a genuine and ongoing concern among parents.  As I stated, one only has to walk the streets of any town or city on a Saturday night to see the extent of the problem.  Those who would prefer not to do so need only walk the streets on a Sunday morning to see the evidence of the problem on doorways all over our cities.  </p> <p>  Much of the underage drinking that takes place is done in advance of going out.  Parental supervision is needed and parents must at least encourage their children not to binge drink.  A change in behaviour is required.  While I am not viewing the past through rose-tinted glasses, there has been a societal shift in how Irish people drink.  Previously, when people started drinking at an earlier age, an element of collective supervision was involved.  Young people drank in a public house where bar staff, neighbours and other people were present and, as such, they drank in public forum.  Drinking habits have changed dramatically, however, as statistics on off-licence sales show.  I ask Professor Murray to address that issue. </p> <p>  I have often made the following suggestion because I believe it merits discussion.  Alcohol is frequently purchased legally but subsequently gets into the hands of underage young people.  An 18 year old can legally purchase as much alcohol as he or she likes.  If he or she has a friend aged 16 who has a girlfriend aged 14, illegal and dangerous drinking will quickly take place among this peer group.  If we are to encourage people not to engage in this type of unsupervised drinking, perhaps we should consider increasing to 21 years the age at which alcohol can be purchased in off-licences as opposed to on-licensed premises.  It may be worthwhile considering this option, as it could help address the problem of young people binge drinking in an unsupervised environment at home and the practice of "bushing", as we used to describe outdoor drinking.  Is there any evidence available internationally to show that increasing the age requirement reduces binge drinking and damage to young people?  I have often considered this option because I have seen 18 year olds buying alcohol in industrial quantities in off-licences.  This drink is then consumed behind a shed or somewhere else by 14 or 15 year old children.  </p> <p>  When an off-licence opens in an area, public representatives almost immediately receive calls from local residents raising the issue of anti-social behaviour and drunkenness in the vicinity of the premises.  While many off-licence owners act responsibly and only sell alcohol legally, much of the alcohol sold in off-licences is consumed illegally.  Is my proposal worth examining?</p> <p>  Even among medical professionals, one hears the view expressed that a drop of whiskey or glass of red wine every evening is good for the blood and so forth.  There is an acceptance that some alcohol is okay.  Professor Murray indicated that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption.  People who should know this fact must explain it openly.  General practitioners should not tell patients that a drop of whiskey in the evening will aid sleep or thin the blood, because such throwaway remarks embed themselves in people's thinking.  We then hear that a couple of pints here and there or a drop of whiskey or half a bottle of wine every night is not that bad.  Medical professionals need to be very clear on that issue. </p></speech>

I would like to have seen a focus on below-cost selling, which we see quite an amount of on the shelves of the bigger supermarkets.  Turning off the tap of cheap, harmful alcohol suggests we are looking at a particular cohort of society.  It is also reflected in the Professor Murray's sentences:<blockquote><br /><br />The socially disadvantaged suffer disproportionately from the effects of alcohol.  The proposed measures will help these individuals and reduce health inequality.</blockquote>They are not a people apart, these individuals.  I am concerned about the language to some extent.  Looking back, I have known people from all sectors of my community who have been challenged by alcohol.  They were not confined to the socially deprived or disadvantaged.  The notion is that we are going to do something wonderful for a particular cohort of people, but the real impact and effect is unproven.  People who are seriously challenged by the need for alcohol are going to continue to find a means to access what their systems require.</p><p>There is no panacea for the issue.  It must start with education and a range of other supports.  I am concerned that the notion is we will have addressed something worthwhile if the less well-off are left in a position of greater disadvantage in accessing alcohol as a result the measures involved.  That is not the starting point we should be working from.  Alcohol injures people across the social strata and all incomes are impacted.  It is not only harmful, cheap alcohol but harmful alcohol.</p></speech>

I will not revisit the points I made earlier, but I have a concern that the thrust of this critical measure will impact on a particular cohort of people more than it will on others.  The person who currently pays &euro;18 or &euro;20 for a bottle of wine, for example, will not be impacted in any serious way.  It will be those who buy cheaper alcohol options who will feel the effect.  There is a picture many people have in their minds that the drinkers this measure seeks to target are, in the main, young people drinking six-packs behind the bike shed.  The reality is different.  In the case, for instance, of people who have worked all their life but have no employment today, the six-pack while watching football on the television is a weekend treat.  They are not the people who are creating anti-social disturbances.  We need to look at the reality in a more holistic and rounded way.  People who are in some way disconnected from the reality of life for many within what are broadly described as deprived or disadvantaged communities are not seeing the full picture.  There will be a more serious impact from these proposals on those who are least well off in our communities as against those who can better afford the more expensive choices when they visit the off-licence.</p> <p>  I am not convinced this measure will have the intended impact.  What it comes down to is its effectiveness, and I am not convinced in this regard.  In raising these concerns, I do not intend to be obstructive to the passage of the legislation.  It is important, however, to question what is proposed and tease out the measure to ensure it will be effective.  As well as the effectiveness or otherwise of the legislation, my other concern, as I have indicated, is that it should ensure equality across the board rather than targeting one sector of the community.  I would be very enthusiastic about the proposals in regard to below-cost selling.  In the case of minimum pricing, however, the question arises as to who will gain from it.  The excise duty that applies to alcohol products is calculated on the unit measure, not on the actual price.  When we introduce minimum pricing regulations, we are increasing the price but the excise duty remains the same.  Where is the take from that for the Exchequer?  I would have been happier, if we are to have minimum pricing or an increase in cost, to see it being done by way of an increase in excise duties.  That would bring more moneys under central government control which could then be ring-fenced and employed in addressing the terrible outworkings of alcohol abuse, not only on individuals but, even more disturbingly, on those around them, including partners and children, who may suffer even more from the terrible effects of alcohol abuse.  I would have liked to see any revenues accruing from an increase in the cost of alcohol being put to effective and better use.  As it stands, it is the manufacturers, Diageo and other players, who will be raking in the money.  I realise the intention is that they will actually have less money coming in, but I am not convinced it will play out that way.</p> <p>  Will Professor Murray indicate the source of the various statistics he cited?  The indication that 1,500 hospital beds per night are occupied by people directly as a result of alcohol use is one figure that stands out for me as party health spokesperson.  Professor Murray indicated that the incidence of cirrhosis of the liver has doubled in the past 20 years, which is reflective of the doubling of alcohol consumption in Ireland in the past 50 years.  It is important to note that this doubling in consumption is reflective of certain changes in society.  Fifty years ago, women in the main were not going out to public houses, and lounges as we know them today barely existed.  There is now gender equality in terms of access to alcohol socialising in an open way, which is a welcome development.  It is not something we need to be scared of and the doubling of alcohol consumption does not necessarily reflect a fall in standards.  It is, to some extent, simply a reflection of the fact that 51% of the population have joined the other 49% over that period in enjoying a social drink.  That is a very good thing.</p></speech>

Most of us make our own deals with the devil when it comes to alcohol.  People who understand what alcohol is all about have made decisions about certain compromises they make in return for the non-medical effects of alcohol.  A reality we must all face, however, is that if everybody in the country stopped drinking - if, by some miracle, the good Lord appeared in the sky tomorrow and made us all turn away from alcohol - a number of things would inevitably happen.  Liver failure would become far less common.  While it would not disappear, its incidence would be much reduced.  There would be a decrease in liver, pancreas, oesophagus, tongue, throat, breast and colorectal cancers.  Pancreatitis would become an uncommon disease, and rates of heart disease would go down.  There would be a major decrease in violence, including domestic violence, rape and other sexual offences.  Teen pregnancy rates would dramatically decrease.  There would be a decrease in spending on health matters and a reduction in the burden on hospital emergency departments.  I am not sure whether we would still have the appalling situation I saw in St. Vincent's Hospital this morning where one of my colleagues was standing over a trolley trying to get to one of our patients who was waiting to be seen in the emergency department.  Certainly, however, there would be far fewer people presenting at emergency units and hospital waiting lists would be shorter, including waiting lists for elective surgery.  There would be more time available for families to spend together and improved family finances.</p> <p>  I understand Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's sensitivity on this issue but I am speaking not as a social commentator or as somebody who will be running in an election again but as somebody who wishes to speak the truth, as I see it.  It is a fact that the burden of three of the greatest scourges in our society, namely, alcohol, tobacco and obesity, are disproportionately borne by poorer people.  The reasons for this are complex but these are facts that cannot be avoided.  If we can prove that increasing the price of alcohol will decrease its consumption, then we can be confident that doing so will bring disproportionate benefits to the people who can least afford the scourge of alcohol in terms both of their personal health and their personal finances.  Moreover, it will have a net major positive effect for society as a whole.</p> <p>  In going forward with policy, we must bear in mind that as a community of legislators, physicians, health administrators and health advocates, we can have only one goal when it comes to alcohol and that is to decrease its consumption greatly in society.  It is interesting to note that at a time when we had a national reputation for being drunks, we actually had a relatively modest alcohol intake by international league table standards.  This intake level increased enormously through the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, however, and on through the time of our economic boom.  While Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point about changing social mores may be a factor, there is also the sad reality that when we got a few bob, we spent it on booze.  That is what happened.  How many of us, back in the 1970s or 1980s, heard somebody who had a minor windfall at bingo or by way of a bonus at work measuring their good fortune on the basis that a pound meant an extra eight pints that night?  That was the type of calculus people tended to use.  The truth is that we had the potential for an unhealthy relationship with alcohol in the past but it only reached full fruition when we got money.  Professor Murray will correct me if I am wrong but my understanding is that since the contraction in the economy, there has been a decline in the use of alcohol.  Although it remains at a level far in excess of what it was prior to the catastrophic rise in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, it is now somewhat lower than it was at the absolute peak.</p> <p>  Our job, as I said, is to seek to decrease alcohol consumption.  The industry, on the other hand, has another job, which is to increase alcohol consumption.</p><p>All the manufacturers want to do is sell more alcohol.  I am not moralising about it; it is a statement of fact.  If they come to us and say they want to be our partners in some attempt to decrease alcohol consumption or ensure alcohol is consumed more responsibly, they are lying.  I am sorry for the unparliamentary word, but that is the reality.  The only thing they want to do is sell more alcohol and, therefore, we need to understand that they are not our partners, our colleagues or our collaborators in this undertaking.  Many of us, myself included, may have tremendous social friendships with people who make their living in that way.  I do not want to moralise about them, but when it comes to business, as Don Corleone would say, they are enemies.  They are not on our side.  They are our opponents and we should not in any sense invite them into the embrace of public policy formation.</p><p> Practically, I would share my professional colleagues' disappointment that there is not an immediate blanket ban on alcohol sponsorship of sporting events.  I think it is not only desirable but also feasible, and we can work our way around it.  It is critically important that we understand all the reasons why all of us should have only one goal when it comes to alcohol policy, and in our own personal lives, which is to decrease alcohol consumption.</p></speech>

We met the other day in room A in Leinster House and I thought his presentation there was excellent as well.</p> <p>  In 1997, I visited Canada and toured there with a choir.  Our main stay was in British Columbia, and we were taken aback by the fact that in most places we sang people were poor and had drinking problems.  One of the biggest problems out there at the time was, and probably still is, the native Indians, who were at the worst end of the scale for alcoholism and everything else.  Historically, people would say that land was bought for a bottle of whisky back in the Wild West times.  It was a real experience travelling around, but when we got deeper into parts where native Indians were still living, we found that alcohol consumption was huge and there was plenty of trouble around it.  </p> <p>  A few things hopped off the page.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in mentioned the number of beds being used at night, which has doubled in 20 years.  Anytime we have discussed alcoholism, most people have said this is at crisis point.</p> <p>  I am always surprised at airports to see that although, when boarding a flight, we are asked to use travel packs of toothpaste and deodorant, on the way back, people can bring in litres of vodka and other alcoholic drinks which sometimes go completely undetected.  That needs to be looked at in airports, particularly from a security viewpoint.</p> <p>  I want to ask Professor Murray about foetal alcohol syndrome in young babies or children.  I have dealt with many long-term foster parents and adoptive parents, and one of the issues that has arisen recently concerns children with foetal alcohol syndrome.  It does not become apparent until they are three years of age or older, yet difficulties have arisen because of that.  One parent told me that her 13-year-old child was never told at school how important it is not to drink when one is pregnant because it can affect the baby.  Education in this regard is the key in schools, although some people disagree.</p> <p>  I do not have any more questions.  I found Professor Murray's document very interesting.  What is the most important recommendation he would make concerning this Bill?</p></speech>

I would like them to spell out why they are here.  Do they have a vested interest?  Are they here as doctors?  I have just had an opportunity, during the vote, to speak to some of our elected representatives, who tell me they do not agree with minimum unit pricing.  They have not sat on this committee and have not heard of the different hazards involved.  Therefore, the witnesses need to spell it out loudly and clearly to Deputies, Senators and the general public.</p> <p>  I am not a killjoy or a puritan, but I am here as a mother who, years ago when my kids were teenagers, worried about whether they would come home safely at night or be beaten up.  I am a concerned member of the community and a public representative.  I have lots of friends and family members who have had problems with drink.  I would like the witnesses to spell out for the listening public why they are here.</p> <p>  We are in here every second week talking about the accident and emergency departments and patients on trolleys.  If, for example, we could sort out the 200,000 people who Professor Murray says are chronic dependent drinkers, how many beds would be freed up in our hospitals?  How would our accident and emergency departments work then?  </p> <p>  I will give one example.  I spoke to a young doctor - not a junior doctor or consultant, but a registrar - who was in an accident and emergency department recently.  He was trying to deal with a lady having a heart attack, yet beside him in the next cubicle was someone who was drunk and disorderly.  That person took way more energy and observation than the poor woman having a heart attack.  We need to get real.  I hear different excuses, including minimum unit pricing and below-cost selling.  I presume, however, the medical witnesses are here because they are on the front line dealing with people who are dying.</p> <p>  I heard patients speak at the Royal College of Surgeons and I felt sorry for the individual concerned, but I am sure doctors are used to that all the time.  One of our committee members mentioned women drinking.  I would like the witnesses to spell out the difference in the effect that the same number of units of alcohol has on men and women who consume them.  Are doctors seeing more women coming through for such treatment?</p> <p>  Deputy Byrne referred to foetal alcohol syndrome and, as a school principal, I have also seen that condition.  It is sad because it could have been avoided, yet such children carry that syndrome with them for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>  Those are the points I wished to raise.  I really want the witnesses to spell it out for Deputies and Senators who will be voting on this matter, as well as for the general public.  At the last meeting, I mentioned to Professor Murray that parents have contacted me wondering why their 17 and 18 year old children cannot buy cheap alcohol.  They have asked me why I am such a killjoy.  Will the medical witnesses here please spell it out?</p></speech>

I am a pioneer so, touch wood, drink does not really affect me as such.  However, it does affect members of my family, which is causing the problem.  Education is very important in getting young people involved.</p> <p>  I would like to ask Professor Murray's opinion on underage drinking and such issues facing many parents.  I come from Dundalk, but I am sure drink is a problem in every city, town and village in Ireland.  The main issues are the supply of drink to underage kids and the lack of real education, especially in secondary schools, on the dangers of binge drinking.  What would Professor Murray think of highlighting the facts of binge drinking in transition year, showing not only the danger to children but also the effects on their families and friends?  It is important to educate our kids at an early stage.  </p> <p>  I am a firm believer that if children can get a proper foundation in sport, they will develop their skills a lot better.  Many children go to secondary school at a young age and most of them stay back to do transition year.</p> <p>  As Professor Murray said earlier, alcohol is affecting nearly every family in the country.  As I said, I do not drink, but alcohol has been a major influence in my life.</p><p>What are the witnesses' views on highlighting this problem in transition year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.707" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015031000002#J00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  They have presented us with startling figures regarding the impact on the health service.  In that regard I want to follow up on a question asked by Deputy Mitchell O'Connor about the evidence base for their figures.  As someone who is active on social media, I have seen comments that the RCPI or others are scaremongering to encourage us to bring in this legislation.  It would be useful, therefore, if the witnesses were to reiterate categorically that these figures are based on evidence and their experience.</p> <p>  In terms of my personal experience, we often think of children when we talk about underage drinking, but I am also conscious of the indirect impact of alcohol on children's lives, whether it is domestic violence or abuse.  The Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, has spoken to the committee about the importance of alcohol being seen as a factor by social workers when they are looking into families' lives.  </p> <p>  Deputy Byrne mentioned the issue of foetal alcohol syndrome.  We give mixed messages to pregnant women about their intake of alcohol.  That is an issue the medical profession needs to examine, because as a society we do give mixed messages about alcohol, yet we have seen the serious consequences.</p> <p>  I support what the witnesses state in their submission about minimum pricing, placement and availability.  On the question of staff training, do the witnesses have a view on limiting the places where alcohol can be sold?</p> <p>  I agree with the witnesses on sports sponsorship.  My personal opinion is that whatever date we set, we should all agree on it.  I would like the date to be sooner, but why do we continue to delay doing that?  It is wrong, and it will have an effect on children.  We are providing in this legislation that marketing to children will not be allowed, yet they see that many of their sporting heroes are linked with alcohol products.  That is violating what we are trying to do here in terms of marketing.  We are clearly linking alcohol with children's sporting heroes.</p> <p>  Professor Murray gave the example of Italy in his contribution.  I am interested to know the key initiatives taken in Italy.  My understanding is that the way to change the impact of alcohol-related harm is pricing, availability and marketing.  Those are the three major issues to be addressed.</p> <p>  Many people, especially vested interests in the drinks industry, say that education and awareness is important, because if people are more informed they will change their behaviour.  My experience is that education can inform people but it does not alter their behaviour.  It is not coincidental that with the publication of this Bill there have been two major initiatives by the drinks industry, one of which is the Out of Control initiative.  The other involves Drink Aware, whose representatives have talked about visiting schools.  We will ask the Department of Education and Skills to give a categorical statement that the drinks industry will not be educating our children on alcohol.  Do the witnesses have any views, as medical practitioners, on the drinks industry having an involvement, whether in schools or in so-called consultations with the public, and using their well known and respected brands, thereby normalising alcohol?  I would be very interested to hear their views on that.</p></speech>

We had a debate in the Seanad on the ambulance service, which is used to bring people who have been drinking excessively to accident and emergency departments.</p> <p>  The winners of the Young Scientist exhibition this year did a project on alcohol consumption that involved interviewing parents and young people.  The connection between the attitude of parents and the attitude of young people going out socialising was interesting.  If we want to make any progress in this area we must start with parents, who will try to work with their children.</p> <p>  I am very concerned about another change I have seen take place.  The area I represented on Cork City Council for a number of years was around University College Cork.  When I first became a member of the city council I was aware that people went to the bars around UCC to drink, but people are now going into the supermarkets at 4 o'clock, 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock in the evening to buy alcohol to drink in their apartments.  The big change is that one gets a measure of alcohol in a bar, but when one is drinking at home there is no measure, and people are drinking a lot more.  I have seen people coming out of student apartment complexes at 11.30 at night intending to go into town.  They are barely able to stand, yet they are going out to socialise further.  How do we deal with the issue of measures, especially where college students are concerned?</p> <p>  That brings me to my final point.  A member of my family was flying home from a holiday recently when a message came over the intercom asking for medical assistance for someone who appeared to be in difficulty.  The person responded, to find that the person was experiencing delirium tremens, DTs.  He had been drinking consistently for nine days and had drunk at least 14 units of alcohol per day or two full bottles of wine.  The only reason the person was not drinking on the flight was that he had to drive home from the airport.  The medical person said the only medical solution he could offer was for someone to give that person a drink to assist him temporarily, but the immediate response was that if he is given a drink he will be unable to drive home.  That indicates that we have got the message across that people cannot drink and drive, yet we have not got the message across that there are health consequences to excessive drinking.  We have not had full success in eliminating drink driving, but we have made a serious impact on it.  Even heavy drinkers know they can no longer risk drinking and driving.  It is not just about the danger of drinking and driving.  We have not got the message across that if someone drinks excessively they are endangering their own lives.  That is particularly the case if someone is drinking excessively for a long period.  How do the witnesses believe we can work on getting across that message?</p></speech>

If they do not mind, I will respond now and then ask my colleagues to respond.  We will work as a team, as we have done previously.</p> <p>  I will make some comments to set the scene.  A common thread in all the members' contributions is that we have a substantial problem with the way we use alcohol in Ireland.  That is a common theme in all of the comments made and questions framed.  They have identified that problem.  We would call it a crisis based on its destructive effect on individuals and families and the resources it is consuming within the various parts of our society, including health care, where we are involved.</p> <p>  We have no conflict of interest here.  We are not selling any product.  The three medics here are at the nidus of the policy group.  We discussed the problems we saw in terms of the increasing number of younger people, particularly women, who are presenting with liver failure due to cirrhosis as a result of alcohol.  We come to it from the point of view of medics and carers.  We do not have any other conflict.  We are not selling a product.  We are particularly enthusiastic to be here because we believe the debate has changed.  We believe there is now a recognition in this country that there is a crisis.  We know from the Health Research Board survey that there is enormous support for taking radical steps to reduce the problems.</p> <p>  It is worth addressing the issue of minimum unit pricing.  Deputy Byrne asked what was the most important recommendation we would make arising from this legislation.  The single biggest item to us - we have discussed this in our policy group - is minimum unit pricing, because it has proven effectiveness.  I would argue with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who I believe is well motivated.</p><p>I respect and understand what he says but the social justice argument is very much in favour of minimum unit pricing, specifically because it targets people who are at greatest risk from a health care point of view and the young.  It is a very effective measure in that regard and it is evidence-based.  In regard to the speed of impact, it is dramatic, particularly for those who are problem and harmful drinkers and have liver failure or incipient liver failure, because the reduction in the amount of alcohol available to them on the basis of cost reduces the risk of their disease progressing rapidly.  This results in a fall in rates of hospitalisation due to alcohol related complications within a year or 18 months.  In addition, there is a fall in all types of crime related to alcohol over a more protracted period.  This is not speculation.  What we are saying is evidence based.  No pilot programme is needed.  The alcohol industry wants steps, other than the introduction of minimum unit pricing and restrictions on outlet numbers, to be taken because the industry knows those measures will impact on its sales and profits.  We come here without any conflict of interest.</p><p> Again from a social justice point of view, a recent study from Glasgow showed quite convincingly that the risk of death from cirrhosis due to alcohol was directly related to the number of off-licences in an area.  In areas where there are a number of off-licences and supermarkets, there is an increased risk of people dying from liver failure.  I will ask my colleagues to comment further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Stewart" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015031000002#K00200"><p>I am a consultant gastroenterologist in the Mater hospital.  We each see different societal demographics.  There is a poor population around the Mater hospital area whom I see at my clinic.  As has been said, society has changed.  It has especially changed over the past 30 years in its approach to alcohol, which some would say should be welcomed.  What we have discovered, however, is that women are drinking a lot more.  When I was a registrar in the Mater hospital in the late 1990s, alcohol related liver disease was in the main associated with 60 to 65 year old men.  It was very rarely associated with women.  I then went to the UK for 11 years and after that returned to Ireland.  In the intervening period, statistics for death from cirrhosis had doubled.  More people were presenting with and dying from cirrhosis.  The demographic of age had also changed such that the age at which people were being diagnosed with cirrhosis had reduced from 60 years to 30 years, 50% of whom were men and 50% women.  This is not something that should be welcomed.  It is a matter that must be addressed now.</p> <p>  The argument is made that minimum unit pricing will impact more on the poorer population.  We do not want to make it more difficult for poorer people to be able to enjoy themselves.  I will try to put some perspective on this.  A person who drinks two bottles of wine a week at a cost of &euro;5.50 per bottle will, following the introduction of minimum unit pricing, which will result in each bottle of wine costing &euro;8.00, be spending &euro;5 more a week on wine.  While that increase is not a substantial amount, it will result in countless lives being saved.  This is because the people on whom this will have the greatest impact is those who are drinking heavily.  A person who is drinking ten bottles of wine a week will be faced with a increase of &euro;25 in that regard.  These are the people we are targeting.  They are the ones we want to reduce their alcohol consumption.  Minimum unit pricing on its own will not tackle this problem but it is the single most important and most immediate measure that will have an impact.  In other words, a person could have cirrhosis but not be aware of it, but if they cut back on alcohol consumption, they will never find out they had it.  However, if that person carries on drinking, they could die within a year.  There will be an immediate improvement in that regard.  What is more, if it is made more difficult for people to buy alcohol, people will drink less.  Minimum unit pricing affects all demographics.  From a personal perspective when I go on holidays to a place where alcohol is cheap, I drink more.  How much a person earns is irrelevant.  If alcohol is cheap, people drink more, and if it is expensive, they drink less.  As such, minimum unit pricing impacts on all demographics.</p> <p>  If we do not tackle alcohol promotion that is targeted at 13 to 15 year olds, we will be storing up problems for the future.  We need to change the culture.  Italy and France were referred to.  The culture around alcohol in those two countries has changed.  It is not acceptable to be seen drunk in Italy.  France has updated its legislation around promotion.  That has led to a dramatic reduction in cirrhosis mortality there.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, education does not work and has proven not to work.  It is not that it might not work, rather that it has been proven not to work.  It is for this reason the drinks industry focuses on it.  We need to forget about education for now and focus instead on the three things that are evidence-based.  These are the things that will have an impact on my clinics.  Education from parents to children was also mentioned.  I am sure that if it were possible to legislate in that regard, the result would be a dramatic improvement.  Recent evidence from the Young Scientist Exhibition showed that parental drinking has a huge impact on children.  We do not have legislation which could assist immediately in this area, but it is important.</p> <p>  A recent study in this area scored the tightness of legislation in all European countries around alcohol.  The tighter the legislation, the lower the cirrhosis mortality rate.  We can be legislatively loose and accept higher cirrhosis mortality rates or we can be legislatively tighter and reduce those rates.</p> <p>  I will conclude with a story about a patient who attended my clinic a few months ago.  The man concerned had bled from varices from cirrhosis and was found unconscious on the floor by his daughter.  He was brought into the emergency department and resuscitated.  We then treated his variceal bleeding and he survived.  When I saw him six weeks later at my clinic, he told me he had given up drinking and would never drink again.  When I responded that I was delighted to hear that and asked why he drank so much, his response was: "I didn't know it was bad for me."  He then asked: "If it's so bad for me, how come it's so cheap, available at every corner shop and promoted so heavily?"  That is something we all need to think about.  That is the reason we are here today.</p></speech>

The issue of an increase in excise duty was raised.  To be honest, that is something for which I was pushing in the college.  When we discussed the issue further, however, a number of problems were identified, including that it would not prevent cross-subsidy and could result in below-cost selling.  This would mean that if we were to increase excise duty, we would also have to ban below cost selling, which seems a cumbersome way of going about achieving the same thing.  In my view, it would not address the social equality issue in that the same stratum of society would be affected.</p> <p>  On the point that 49% of the population, or females, are now drinking more, three or four years ago, along with the Health Research Board, we examined alcohol related mortality in Ireland by age and sex over the past 20 years.  Rates in respect of every group have dramatically increased.  The issue of on-sales and off-sales and whether it is better that young people go into bars rather than, as in the case of the students in UCC, drink behind sheds and go into town later when they are loaded up was also raised.  While I agree that intuitively it seems like a bad thing to do, we do not know long-term if it is better that they do that and, one hopes, grow out of it or that they become culturalised into going to bars.  There is an awful lot about alcohol that we do not know.  We are doing our best with the evidence we have.  Culturally, alcohol in Ireland is a different thing than it is in Canada, France or Italy.  Perhaps the solutions elsewhere are not exactly the same solutions we should apply here.  We believe the solutions proposed are the best and are evidence-based, but that is only the start.  I am sure that in five years time we will be back here talking about what worked a little and what else we can do.</p> <p>  We have also called in our submission for a levy on alcohol advertising which could be used to fund proper research in this area.</p><p>It would enable us to figure out whether the measures we are taking are effective and to design new measures to deal with the problem.  That is something we have not brought out but we should put it forward strongly.  The levy would be a small amount.  The companies spend between &euro;50 million to &euro;60 million a year advertising alcohol.  A levy of 5% on alcohol advertising would yield &euro;2.5 million a year to spend on high-quality research.  It would mean we could produce reasonable data and reasonable plans within a few years.  I strongly suggest such an initiative.</p><p> Intuitively, education is a fantastic thing but it does not work in my house with my kids.  I preach to them day and night, yet my advice seems to go out the door.  What seems to be important is peer pressure and example.  It is difficult for parents to preach about alcohol to their children when they can open a press and see bottles of wine.  When our friends come around, they sometimes drink more than they should.  It is an us problem, not a them problem.  We have a societal problem in that we have great tolerance for public drunkenness that I do not think we had 20 or 30 years ago.  I do not know how we should address these problems.  There is no policing of drunkenness any more.  One can be drunk and disorderly all one wants and it does not seem to make any difference.  This issue is tough for members, as legislators, as well as for doctors.  No amount of talking to transition students is going to change that when they come home and see their parents doing the exact opposite.</p></speech>

All of the data we used are in the public domain.  The figure of 1,500 beds is from the Department of Health.  I got the mortality data from the OECD database which was based on Ireland's submission.  All of the data are real data which outline the extent of the problem.</p> <p>  On minimum unit pricing, I am delighted to hear the committee has some people from the Sheffield group coming and that Professor Tim Stockwell has been before it.  The data on minimum unit pricing are hard data from the field in Canada and came through Professor Stockwell's group.</p> <p>  We are not talking about something that is soft and iffy but something that has been proven to work.  That is why we are so passionate about these matters, particularly minimum unit pricing.  We also believe there should be fewer retail outlets selling alcohol.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made an interesting point about a six-pack of bottles.  I am not sure one can buy a six-pack any more because one can now buy instead a 20-pack or a 24-pack.  The scale of marketing and selling has changed in a way that we think is very destructive because bigger units are being sold.  We should focus on minimum unit pricing and availability.  We think they are the areas of proven benefit.  I would argue they are both socially just and will improve the society in which we live.</p> <p>  The point made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and by my colleague, Professor Aiden McCormick, about excise and how the Exchequer would benefit is important.  It is something the smart people in the Department of Finance should think about.  In addition to minimum unit pricing, should they increase excise in some way for all sales in particular?  There is a lot to be said for such an initiative.  It would be of benefit because one would have increased price and more income paid into the Exchequer rather than to off-traders.  It is a great point.</p></speech>
