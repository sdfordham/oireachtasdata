    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon Carswell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015031000002#B00200"><p>Let me start by providing some background information on my work as a journalist.  I am Washington correspondent with <i>The Irish Times</i>, a role I took up just over two years ago, in January 2013.  Prior to that, I was finance correspondent with the newspaper reporting on the banking sector and before that I worked for <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>for seven years, first as a business reporter from 1999 to 2004 and then as news editor from 2004 to 2007.  I started as finance correspondent at <i>The Irish Times</i>in September 2007 as queues of depositors started to form at Northern Rock bank in the first run on a British bank in more than a century.  As this was the first story on which I worked at <i>The Irish Times</i>, one could say my arrival at the newspaper coincided with the start of the global financial crisis which hit the UK and Ireland.<br/><br/>In 2004 I began researching and writing a book on the history of scandals in the Irish financial sector.  That book, <i>Something Rotten - Irish Banking Scandals</i>, was published by Gill &amp;amp; Macmillan in 2006 and covered scandals in the Irish banks dating back to the early 1970s up to the 2004 overcharging scandal at AIB.  I examined the culture within Irish banking during that period.  While covering the deepening banking crisis, internationally from 2007 and domestically from 2008, for <i>The Irish Times</i>, I began to work on another book in mid-2010 that became <i>Anglo Republic - Inside The Bank That Broke Ireland</i>.  That book, published by Penguin Ireland in September 2011, was my own inquiry into what had happened in the run-up to the 2008 Irish banking crisis and the 2010 international bailout.  Both books were written while I was on short periods of paid leave from <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>and <i>The Irish Times.</i><br/><br/>I continued to report on the banking sector until December 2012 when I was appointed to my current role, based in the United States.  In a letter dated Friday, 13 February 2015, received from the committee requesting my attendance, it asked me to appear before it to talk specifically about the relationships between State authorities, political parties, elected representatives, supervisory authorities, banking institutions and the property sector.  Specifically, it has asked me to speak about how the property sector - investment and-or development - and the banking sector interacted with government, elected representatives and the State during the period prior to the banking crisis in Ireland and the nature of the relationships between these groups.  It has also asked me to talk about controls or structures, if any, to regulate these relationships and whether being a small country is a factor, or not, in any such relationship.  I will try my best to address these topics in this discussion.<br/><br/>I must point out that it has been over two years since I wrote regularly and in depth about Irish banking.  I have since immersed myself in a broad range of very different subjects.  Also, as I live in the United States and have not been able to access many of my notes from my time reporting on the banks while with <i>The Irish Times</i>, I may not be able to shed light on some of the committee's queries, but I am happy to help where I can and will try my best to answer any question it want to ask me.  I must also stress that I am bound by journalistic privilege that prevents me from disclosing sources of information in any work I have done where these sources have asked me to maintain their anonymity. <br/><br/>On the subject of discussion, I would characterise the relationship between the major players in the property sector, the construction industry, government, certain elected representatives and the banks, as well as the relationship between the Government, the banks and the financial supervisory authorities, as extremely cosy in the period leading up to the 2008 banking crash.  To take a phrase from former Finnish civil servant Peter Nyberg&rsquo;s thorough report on the causes of the banking crisis, the various players, including politicians, builders, bankers and regulators, displayed &ldquo;behaviour exhibiting bandwagon effects both between institutions (herding) and within them (groupthink).&rdquo;  Nothing I came across in my research would contradict that statement.  On the wild frontier of the Celtic tiger era, Anglo Irish Bank was the one trick pony in a frenetic land grab, leading a poorly regulated and highly competitive race for market share and profit. <br/><br/>These relationships appear to have been too cosy to have allowed any one of these collective groups, be it banks, government, builders or regulators, to shout stop and offer the kind of critical dissent that might have changed the behaviour of all and the direction in which the country was heading.  If one of these groups had had the courage to put its head above the parapet, I believe there might not have been the crisis we had or at least it might not have been as severe as it was.  For these parties, it was too comfortable and self-serving for some to stay in the crowd and stick with the consensus, particularly when so many were making so much money.  The result was that contrarians were ridiculed, silenced or ignored to ensure the credit fuelled boom continued for years as their past warnings did not come true.  These cosy relationships would prove extremely costly.  While the cost of the banking bailout to the Irish people stands at &euro;64 billion, excluding recoveries coming from the sale of shares in the banks or better than expected returns from the National Asset Management Agency, it is worth stressing that the overall losses and capital wiped out by the crash amount to far in excess of this sum.  The losses on loans, mostly to the property sector, across all of the banks in Ireland came to well in excess of &euro;100 billion, including tens of billions of euro covered by the UK Treasury.  This is sometimes forgotten.<br/><br/>For the record, I do not accept the proposition put forward by many of the key players involved in policy-making, banking, building or regulating that there were so many people responsible for the crisis that it is difficult to pin individual blame on a few.  Moral responsibility for the excesses of this period can be cast widely, but legal responsibility for what happened and what was permitted to happen far less so.  There were a limited number of people involved in key decisions, in particular those decisions taken in response to the crisis that had major consequences. <br/><br/>In the decade leading up to the crash long-standing relations had developed between the political classes and the property-banking nexus.  The investigations by the Mahon tribunal of inquiry illustrate the corrupt connections between politicians and landowners-builders and it is worth stressing that the tribunal only covered elected representatives and property deals in Dublin.  In times more recent than the property deals examined by the tribunal senior Government figures and politicians, notably from Fianna F&aacute;il, were seen on quasi-social occasions such as high profile horse racing meetings rubbing shoulders with prominent builders.  Even if some politicians and public representatives mixing in these circles did not directly encourage the property boom - there was certainly a number of very prominent cases where senior politicians did, both in terms of their public remarks and policy decisions - these associations at least created the perception that the most powerful people in the country supported and championed the property industry. <br/><br/>Politics and business regularly overlapped.  There are examples of politicians and public representatives getting involved in land speculation deals, building projects and property investments, in one notable case, in partnership with a major figure from banking, while continuing to serve as public representatives, right up to and during the economic crisis.  Builders and property developers were also active in politics.  Of the donations received by the political parties in Ireland in the four years between 2002 and 2005, building, property development and construction related companies, with builders and developers personally, donated tens of thousands of euro to Fianna F&aacute;il which was in government during these years.  That party accounted for almost the entirety of the political donations made by the property sector to political parties in these years.  Individuals who worked in the political arena afterwards took up highly paid roles representing and lobbying on behalf of construction and financial industry groups, interacting with people with whom they had previously worked closely in politics.  Easy and ready access to politicians brought easy and ready access to policy and decision-making that drove the growth of the property and financial sectors. <br/><br/>There are a number of well documented examples of these sectors bearing strong influence on the policy making process in the years running up to the crisis.  These helped to inflate the credit bubble and frenzied property buying and weakened potential policy or regulatory actions that might have dampened activity, both in the property market and the banking sector.  Certainly, there were no effective controls in place to regulate these relationships.</p><p>  Government tax policies and incentives for the commercial property market have been widely attributed as a factor in inflating the property bubble.  These subsidies were left in place and were only starting to be phased out during the frothiest years of the property bubble as a result of the relations between the property sector and Government/elected representatives and aggressive lobbying by commercial interests.</p><p>  Despite an outside expert urging the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government in high-profile reports in 2000 to remove tax incentives for property investors, the party was lobbied intensively by the construction industry and incentives were left in place in the 2001 budget.  Mortgage interest relief was reintroduced for investors, helping them to offset the cost of their property speculation against their taxes.  Such measures only added to increased activity in the property market.  Had the incentives been removed it might have made some think twice about investing more in property and cooled the market somewhat.</p><p>  That Government and the next Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government said they would end the tax incentives for a multitude of property development types, from multi-storey car parks to student accommodation to nursing homes to over-the-shop apartments, but they were ultimately extended from 2004 until 2006 and in some instances right up to the start of the financial crisis in 2008, the years covering the most frenetic period of the property/banking bubble.  These decisions were taken after heavy lobbying by the construction industry.  The Government of the day said in 2004 that it would review these tax-based property incentives.  In the 2006 Finance Bill some tax reliefs were eliminated by the Government while the decision was taken to phase out other reliefs up to 2008. </p><p>  The financial sector was equally robust in pushing its own interests with Government and Government officials, through established relationships between its representative groups, when it came to legislative changes it wanted or when it was unhappy about measures that might rein in the activities of its industry.  In 2006, the banks wanted a change in the rules on what collateral could be used to borrow in the international markets.  They lobbied heavily Department of Finance officials and Government to the highest levels in a well-co-ordinated campaign that included representations made at a private dinner in one of the country's biggest banks for a senior member of Government.  This is illustrative of relations between the banks and the pro-banking Government of the time.  At one point the Department of Finance was described by one of its own officials as being "under siege" in the lobbying campaign by the financial industry.  The aim was to get legislation passed to allow the banks to issue bonds backed by commercial mortgages.  The financial sector won out.  The legislation was passed in early 2007, at the peak of the property boom, making it easier for banks to borrow more money to provide more loans to more customers.</p><p>  The Financial Regulator was shown to be equally malleable by outside interests when it came to moves that might have taken some of the heat out of bank lending.   In 2006 the Financial Regulator started to consider the introduction of compliance statements for the directors of banks.  These would allow the Regulator to force management and the boards of the banks to stick by assurances they gave, for example, agreeing to reduce their lending into one particular area, and would have given the regulator an important tool to exert greater control over the activities of the banks.  After intensive lobbying by the financial services industry, the Department of Finance asked the Regulator to drop the process of consultation with the industry on the measure.  It was shelved in favour of the measure being considered in a wider overhaul of financial services legislation at some later unspecified date.  One of the reasons cited for dropping it was that it would damage the country&rsquo;s international competitive edge in financial services.  This was a regular refrain from the banks, and was repeated by the Government and Government officials when it came to opposing stronger regulatory tools to curb the activities of the banks.  As Governor Honohan stated in his report on the causes of the banking crisis, more aggressive action was not taken to stop the practice of lending 100% mortgages to home-buyers because excessive weight was given to the damaging effect of competition from foreign banks on domestic lenders if curbs were introduced, "probably in light of lobbying objections from institutions".  This shows how the Financial Regulator was, as well as trying to regulate the banks, on the bandwagon with the industry and Government in trying to promote Ireland as an attractive destination for international banks to conduct business.</p><p> The lobbying by the banking industry extended to one notable case involving Irish Nationwide Building Society.  For years the senior management at the building society had been lobbying for a change in legislation that would have allowed the building society to demutualise and be sold immediately in a private trade sale in one fell swoop, instead of waiting a period of five years after demutualisation for a trade sale.  That legislation came under the Fianna Fail-led Government in the summer of 2006 and the lender was almost immediately put up for sale.  At that time Irish Nationwide was dressing itself up for a trade sale by showing itself to be as profitable as possible.  This coincided with a period when the building society pushed itself very heavily away from its traditional roots as a mortgage lender that helped people buy homes into a more lucrative guise as a boutique lender to builders, and even a partner with some of its developer customers on speculative projects.  Some of the heaviest losses incurred by the building society were on loans provided in the period leading up to and after the passing of this demutualisation legislation.</p><p>  Irish Nationwide's senior management was perceived as having strong political connections.  That, I believe, coupled with the fact that the building society had operated unchecked by any kind of effective regulatory action on corporate governance issues for many years, gave the lender a sense of invincibility and misplaced confidence in terms of the financial risks it took on, to carry on its business as it saw fit.  Despite repeated problems of corporate governance at the building society, the regulator adopted a stand-off approach with the lender, preferring to wait until the institution was sold in a trade sale as a means to resolving these problems rather than tackling them head on.  This wait-and-see game proved to be extremely costly given the kind of loans that were advanced during this period.  Irish Nationwide has cost the Irish public &euro;5.4 billion, an extraordinary loss rate on a lender that had &euro;12 billion in loans.  </p><p>  As for the interactions between the regulator and Anglo Irish Bank, their cosy relationship meant that the bank's massive exposure to the property market was allowed to balloon out of control with devastating consequences for the country.  Remarkably, regulators knew that the bank was aware that it was in breach of its own internal limits on property lending.  It is even more remarkable that regulators were comforted by the fact that the bankers knew that they were in breach of their own limits.  This is the kind of strange logic that existed in the country's poor regulatory regime that showed the weaknesses of light-touch regulation and how bankers could skirt around the rules.</p><p>  In 2008, Anglo Irish Bank had a strong link between its boardroom and Government buildings, though it is still unclear just how useful this connection was to the bank at the time of its greatest need, in the days leading up to 29 September 2008, the night of the guarantee.  It raises a question, which I cannot answer: did these connections play a factor in the thinking of those in charge on that fateful night behind the decision not to take the bank, the only Irish financial institution that had gone over the cliff edge at that stage, into public ownership by way of nationalisation legislation or to consider some other stop-gap measure rather than a costly blanket guarantee?  Given Anglo Irish Bank's frantic, last-gasp efforts to raise concerns and press influence in political and regulatory circles about its deteriorating funding position, it would appear that the bank's connections were not so well developed to be effective.</p><p>  While Anglo Irish Bank was very close to the country's most active builders and property developers, and so too was Fianna Fail, it might be too far a leap to conclude that Anglo Irish Bank and Fianna Fail were equally close.  The bank and the party certainly had a number of deep contacts at the highest levels.  My research found that these contacts bore little fruit for the bank, although it is unclear what influence Anglo Irish Bank's developer customers might have had with their friends in politics.  For the most part, in the run-up to the crisis, the bank was too busy lending money to builders and making vast profits from the booming property market to be distracted by developing and working political contacts.  In the post-guarantee period, prior to the bank&rsquo;s nationalisation, there were more pronounced efforts made by the bank to curry favour in political circles.</p><p>  As for the future, the recent publication of the Registration of Lobbying Bill 2014 to regulate lobbying of Government members and State officials by corporate and other concerned interests is a step in the right direction.  This will force groups, companies and organisations involved in lobbying Government to file the details of their contacts with the Standards in Public Office Commission.  Further steps could be taken, such as the compulsory logging of all contacts, even informal ones, that the Taoiseach and Ministers have with outside parties concerning representations on policy and-or legislation, and for these contacts to be disclosed publicly and regularly.  Often it is only through Freedom of Information requests by the media that these contacts emerge.  Some contacts, however, may never appear in official records because departmental officials know not to commit to paper certain things that might be "FOI-able".</p><p>  The committee has also asked me to discuss whether Ireland being a small country is a factor in terms of the relationships mentioned above.  I cannot answer that because who knows what would have happened if Ireland was three times the size.  However, I think that the fact that this is a small country should serve as another reason why it is so important to document all contacts that policy-makers and their advisers have with outside interests on policy representations, as onerous as that record keeping might be.  Any concerns about unintended consequences of forcing those connections and contacts out into the open are, in my view, over-played.</p><p>  Sunlight is good medicine. This country needs to let in far more light and be far more transparent, along with being more open to listening to and accepting of countervailing views, if it is to recover fully from the recent dark past.</p></speech>

Before I bring in members of the committee I will set some broader scene questions with him.  Mr. Carswell's 2006 book entitled <i>Something Rotten: Irish Banking Scandals</i>covered various scandals at Irish banks dating back to the 1970s up to 2004 and that includes the overcharging scandal at AIB.  How would he describe the relationship that existed between the regulatory authorities of Ireland and the banks and also how would he describe the relationship between the banks and the Central Bank during those years up to the crisis?</p></speech>

Bankers could argue their way out of issues and regulators would sit back or turn a blind eye.  It was a very passive relationship between all those parties those you mention.</p></speech>

They are ultimately responsible for what their financial institutions do.  Then the Central Bank and the regulatory authorities should have seen the banks had lost the run of themselves and there were certain issues in their institutions such as limits on lending.  Successive Governments were responsible to step in if there were any regulatory gaps.  The role of the auditors and, as has emerged in the crisis, the rules auditors worked by, were too narrow and backward looking, rather than forward looking and pointing out risks which existed in particular institutions.  Regarding when they should have shouted "Stop"-----</p></speech>

There are a number of periods when that happened.  There were two big bursts in lending from 1997 to 2001 and then again from 2002 to 2007 when the rate of credit growth and the amount of lending going on was over 20% in that period.  Within that there were two significant bursts.  It was more than 30% for six months in 2004 and nearly 30% again in 2006.  The warning bells should have gone off in the early 2000s.

His book is a very good read, one of the best reads I have come across to date.  What is his interpretation of the Anglo business model in terms of risk, which some of the other banks have struggled to get a handle on?</p></speech>

It had convinced itself it was not a property lender.  It also got too close to its borrowers.  Simply put, it had too many eggs in one basket.  The bank had four main areas of cover in how risk was approached and how it protected its loans.  The first was cash flow and rental income from buildings and properties.  The second was the value of the property itself.  The third was cross-collateralisation where Anglo had borrowers' other assets in its portfolio.  If the first three areas did not work out then the fourth area of cover was the personal guarantee where Anglo itself could go after the developer or builders.</p> <p>  Stripped away, all those securities it believed it had all centred around property.  I believe the bank recognised this and that it was getting too heavily into the property market.  An internal instruction was issued that Anglo would try to bring property development on the loan book down to 20% and reduce this over time to 15%.  That it was unable to stick to those limits shows how close the bank was to its borrowers.  It was unable to pull back from that sector.  Later credit reports in 2005, 2006 and 2007 show the bank could not meet the restraint it wanted.  At that stage, the risk was its closeness to borrowers.  In the book I quote a former senior Anglo executive where he felt that customers were running the bank.  I would tend to agree with that.</p></speech>

He wrote, &quot;In 2004 AIB chief executive [who I will not name] established a win-back team as part of the bank's efforts to understand why the bank was losing business.&quot;  Were the other banks outside of Anglo prepared to move in a different direction in order to win back business they had been losing to Anglo?</p></speech>

The other banks would also have seen Anglo championed by the investment community.  The sheer scale of the profits made at Anglo was too tempting for the other banks - they really had to try and get a slice of the action.  For example, AIB set up this win-back team to look at how it could get some of that business which Anglo was getting.  The other banks also got involved, maybe not as aggressively as AIB.  There was the added injection of foreign banks, particularly Bank of Scotland Ireland, owned by Halifax Bank of Scotland and also Royal Bank of Scotland through Ulster Bank, which very aggressively got into the market.  The saying in AIB was that "Anglo joined us for breakfast and now it is eating our lunch."  This shows the competitive edge there.  Other banks were very concerned that Anglo was stealing the march on them, to the extent that Anglo might even mount a takeover for Bank of Ireland.  That is how impressive Anglo's growth was and how much money it was making.</p></speech>

There was no particular point where it could pull back.  If there was a point in time where Anglo could have shouted "Stop" would everything have been okay?  Given the strength of support for Anglo, even in 2004 it would have been too late.  I said in the book that it would take a benign dictator to try and stop that juggernaut of support in the market and around the banks, and to rein that back.</p></speech>

On page No. 59 of his book Mr. Carswell says that the chief executive of Bank of Ireland "could not get to grips with Anglo.  I said it in my own organisation, if there was ever a downturn or liquidity crisis they were done for, they were gone."  As subsequently noted, that liquidity crisis did come.  Was there a model in place that Anglo could possibly have survived if that liquidity crisis had not occurred?</p></speech>

One is looking at the other side of the balance sheet there rather than the loans.  There was a huge push to lend as much as one could but the funding side of that struggled to keep up.  Anglo was able to borrow in the wholesale markets to fund that lending growth because of Ireland's entry into the euro and the access to vast pools of funding without currency risk.</p><p>That gap got bigger and bigger as the bank tried to keep up with providing loans to customers in the market.  At a particular point, over 50% of its funding was from wholesale markets.  It was borrowing very very short and lending long; the average duration of its borrowing near the peak of its lending was well below a year, and the average length of a loan was three or four years.  With such a gap, if there is any kind of stress in the liquidity market, that bank will be in serious trouble.  It is not unique to Anglo.  Many of the banks in the market had that very heavy reliance on wholesale funding.</p></speech>

The aim was to get legislation passed to allow the banks to issue bonds backed by commercial mortgages.  The financial sector won out.  The legislation was passed in early 2007, right at the peak of the property boom, making it easier for banks to borrow more money to provide more loans to more customers.</blockquote>Is that legislation the Asset Covered Securities (Amendment) Act, No. 13 of 2007?</p></speech>

At that time, a lot of assets that the Irish banks used were backed by residential mortgages.  They were regarded as much more likely to be repaid, therefore of better quality.  By including commercial mortgages in those packages of bonds the banks were following an international trend.  There were other countries doing that.  What that did was it allowed, for example, in particular, Anglo, because it had more commercial mortgages than other banks, to be able to package them up, go to the market and say, "Invest in our bond, buy our debt," and subsequently they would get money in and be able to use it to lend on into the banks.</p> <p>   I think one of the issues raised during the lobbying for that Bill was raised by the regulatory authorities which said that there was greater inherent volatility by comparison with other asset classes in terms of valuation and default experience.  So that legislation was passed in the face of some opposition from the regulatory authorities.</p></speech>

There were a number of brokers in that firm who said, "We think Anglo has reached the peak of the market and it is no longer a stock that we would tip to our investor clients."  Anglo had a reputation for aggressively attacking any dissent in the market and it responded very negatively when it heard through investors in the investment community that there were a number of brokers who were saying to their clients, "No longer back Anglo."  Many international investors took interest in it.  Often when there is a contrarian in the investment market who puts its head up and says, "We have changed our view in contrast to everyone else," many of the more high risk investors would think that is worth looking at and as a result some of those people would either start looking at shorting the stock, which is making money from the share price falling.  I think the response of Anglo was, "We need to fight that, we need to counter that very negative talk against the bank in the market."</p></speech>

It was not alone.  Only one or two banks said they were told by the regulator not to use the guarantee to solicit deposits.  Certainly, it made such news that day that Ireland was regarded as a safer bet because the Government was standing behind it.</p> <p>   The perception on the night was that Anglo was still going to be nationalised even after that decision was made.  The view was that the decision made on the night of the guarantee was a stopgap measure that might buy the banks some time.  The Government, through the Central Bank, in consultation with the banks that went in that night, asked each bank for &euro;5 billion to tide Anglo over which, if one looks at the rate of loss of deposits for the bank, would have brought it to the weekend, maybe a little bit longer.  So the measures that were introduced that night were regarded by people leaving the building that night as buying time.  I think the view was that nationalisation was still very much on the table but the regulatory authorities expressed concern that a bank could not be nationalised mid-week because of the complications and technical issues that come with that.  The belief was that nationalisation would still happen at the weekend.</p></speech>

I think the debate at that time arose from the scandals that are outlined in <i>Something Rotten: Irish Banking Scandals</i>, the first book.  The regulatory regime that was established in 2003 was in direct response to some of those scandals that emerged, particularly with customer funds, the likes of the bogus non-resident accounts arising from the DIRT issue and also some of the overcharging by some of the other banks in the market and the purpose of that regime was to protect the consumer.</p><p>In terms of the creation of a regulatory regime, in 2003, the regulator was set up as an independent entity within the Central Bank.

However, it did not have a prudential director as a statutory member of the board, which says more about the emphasis that was on the consumer.  As emerged from the crisis, there should have been more focus on the prudential aspects of the financial system.  Everybody will remember the advertisement in which the phrase "I don't know what a tracker mortgage is" was used.  A more appropriate phrase might have been "I don't how safe my money is and I don't know how safe these banks are."</p></speech>

The industry includes not only the banks but all financial institutions, including in the insurance area.  Concerns would have been raised about whether the measure was too heavy.  The regulatory authorities were set up on the basis that they were principles based, which is what we now see as light-touch.  This is potentially an onerous statement and onerous rules to apply to directors.  The concerns raised by industry played well with the Department of Finance concerns.  This relates back to the more general issue of one of the mandates of the Financial Regulator within the Central Bank being to make Ireland attractive as a place in which to set up financial business.  They did not want this type of rules-based compliance statement to be introduced at that time because it would have caused a problem for the sale of Ireland as a pro-business country for the financial sector.</p></speech>

Throughout 2008 and up until after the putting in place of the bank guarantee statements were made by the Office of the Financial Regulator in which concerns were raised concerns about market comment and comment by newspapers.</p></speech>

Certainly, there were individuals within the banks who would have raised reservations about where the banks were going.  Another notable example is mentioned in <i>Anglo Republic</i>.  In this regard concerns were raised about the banks' funding and, as I said in response to a question from Senator D'Arcy, the gap between short-term funding within the bank and long-term lending.  It was noted within the bank - if my memory is correct, I think this was in 2006 - that the bank was potentially very exposed if there was any kind of issues in the funding markets.</p></speech>

Again, the point was to not isolate any one institution as being the weakest or the strongest.  If it was announced the next day that a guarantee had been introduced but that it was only for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide this might have raised questions the other financial institutions individually.  The blanket guarantee provided cover for all institutions.  By the same token, some of the other banks were concerned that they would have been lumped in with those two institutions because the perception would be created in the market that if Anglo Irish Bank, which many people knew was in serious trouble, was being guaranteed the other banks being guaranteed were equally in serious trouble.</p></speech>

It is important lending in particular areas is curbed, so that the regulator could, in respect of likely exposure in a particular sector, step in and apply limits and force the financial institution to abide by that.  This needs to be backed up by aggressive action to ensure those limits met.  It is not only rules, but actions, that are required.  If both of these requirements are met there is a much greater chance of preventing something like this happening again.</p></speech>

Monetary policy is applied first and foremost to the biggest economies.  A blanket monetary policy was applied across a patchwork quilt of different economies, some of which needed low interest rates and others of which needed high interest rates.  Applying one interest to all economies creates the type of uneven credit scenario we witnessed during the crisis, leading to some countries to experience to boom in lending we experienced.</p></speech>

It would have been co-ordinated by the financial industry groups and also individually.  The senior bankers in each institution would also have sent letters to Department of Finance officials to say that this was a good thing.  They would say the same thing, although they might change it slightly.  That is what led to the comment from a Department of Finance official that they felt they were under siege at that point.<br/><br/>Also, as part of the lobbying campaign, we are aware of a high profile private meeting that took place between a senior banker and a member of the Government at a dinner.  We know from the correspondence after that dinner, which I got under freedom of information, that the legislation was discussed.  The banker described the legislation as enlightened and innovative, and a model for the political, public and private sectors.  I will quote from the letter that was sent by the senior banker to the member of the Government:<blockquote>I can honestly say that I find it hard to remember when I have had an as enjoyable, insightful and stimulating few hours discussion.  You raised a particular interesting issue, indeed challenge, on the question of influencing or at least informing the debate on where and how we take forward this great project that is modern Ireland.</blockquote>That was an example of the type of access the industry got to the Government on that issue.</p></speech>

That would have helped the bank; it would have made the bank more stable.  However, it also would have allowed the bank to use the money it had borrowed by selling the bond through passing it on in lending to customers.  On one point, one could say that it makes the bank stable.  If the money just sits there, that is fine as it is stable.  However, if it uses it to lend more money to customers, clearly it is increasing its risk depending on where the money goes.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify something.  Page 218 of Mr. Carswell's book refers to the night of the guarantee, when bankers from AIB and Bank of Ireland were in the discussions.  Mr. Carswell said that the two banks thought the money would only be needed for the short term as the bankers were led to believe from the discussions that night that Anglo Irish Bank would be nationalised the following weekend.

I am not sure if it was stated explicitly that Anglo Irish Bank would be nationalised at the weekend.

Given the fact that they were considering nationalising Anglo Irish Bank, clearly that gave some indication of issues with solvency.

A concerted effort was made by the executive management team at Anglo Irish Bank to establish contacts with politicians.  Certainly a meeting took place in the weeks after the bank guarantee between the bank and members of Fine Gael.</p></speech>

I refer to chapter 14 of his book dealing with the guarantee.  Perhaps I can put some matters on the record and ask Mr. Carswell to confirm if he believes they are accurate.  Mr. Carswell refers to a view within Anglo Irish Bank on 29 September 2008 that it would be short at least &euro;1.5 billion the following day and that the bank would not be able to open the following morning.  Was that the clearly understood position within Anglo Irish Bank on that date, that it was an existential crisis for that bank as it would not be able to open on the following day?</p></speech>

The efforts made by the bank on that day, Monday, 29 September, and the fact that it approached Bank of Ireland and subsequently approached AIB shows what an emergency it was at Anglo Irish Bank at that point.</p><p>Also, they knew they were going to run out of money that night.</p></speech>

Mr. Carswell names an individual who I will not name but he states that the view within the bank, at the very end of September 2008, was that there were only &euro;500 million of bad loans on an overall loan book of &euro;73 billion.  That was the position as Mr. Carswell understands it from the perspective of the institution at that time.</p></speech>

Going into the evening of 29 September, Mr. Carswell has a detailed chronology but he is clear, and it is on the record, that Anglo was not involved in the discussions later in the evening of 29 September.

In terms of the figures the Deputy mentioned, they believed there was only &euro;500 million of bad debts.  I think they believed that.

The big debate is on what the bankers knew at a particular point in time.  I speak a lot about the difficulties in how banks value loan books at particular moments and assess the quality of loans.  Are borrowers repaying everything?  At this point, and it was established - there was certainly some reference made to it in the market - there was a very heavy roll-up of interest, which would suggest that the banks were not getting their loans repaid, but I do not believe that had fed through the system in terms of their auditing and preparation for later accounts.</p></speech>

I do not think they had jumped to the "what if" scenarios around the solvency of the banks, with the exception of the Department of Finance official I mentioned earlier in their memorandum.  I think it is the same memorandum, but I could be wrong, where it is ruled out by a member of the regulatory authority, that there is not a solvency issue with the banks.  That answers the Deputy's question as to what they thought at that moment.</p></speech>

Mr. Carswell has documented a lot of very useful information in his book but where does he believe there are potential gaps in our knowledge of the crisis and the crisis management, and where does he believe the inquiry could usefully focus its work to try to fill in those remaining gaps?</p></speech>

It was almost regarded as a lender's failure to get a borrower's loan deal over the line.  That was seen as a problem for the lender and not the borrower, so the comment I made earlier that the bank was too close to its borrowers stands.  They were way too close, and I used the word "cosy" in my opening statement.  I think they were very cosy, and in terms of the inability of both the lenders looking to get the loan deal over the line and the people looking to approve that loan deal, that whole scenario was established to do whatever they possibly could to get that money to the borrower.  The question not asked at a much broader level by the senior management of the bank was, "Should we be doing all this lending into property?"  In the credit and risk committee that was never discussed.</p></speech>

There is very little paperwork on the guarantee, and we need to find out exactly what was the thought process behind the decision-making on the night of the guarantee, to go through the pros and cons list that was provided by the investment banks, the reason other options were not considered, and why this one was considered.  There has been some discussion on that publicly by one former significant member of Government but we have not heard their thinking on the thought process behind the reason it was chosen, and also the reason the other options were ruled out.</p></speech>

Was that voice heard anywhere in the markets?</p></speech>

Do we try to take some heat out of the property market or do we do something else?  The "something else" was that we need to pay people more money, in broad terms.  In terms of the wage growth that was set and the wage increases provided to people to be able to afford property, that was going at it the wrong way.  Rather than trying to put a limit on the market and take some of the heat out of the property market, the developments in pay and the increases in wages came at it the other end so that people could afford to borrow.</p></speech>

A tradition of silence and evasion prevailed.  Driven by an insatiable hunger for profits, some bankers had taken huge risks.  But whistleblowers were unwilling to remain silent, and they revealed the murky details, exposing sinister banking practices.</blockquote></p><p>Considering what was known in the early 2000s about these scandals and what was in the public domain, would Mr. Carswell have expected the regulatory and political authorities to be far more alert to what could develop in the banking system with the property bubble in the making?  Does it look like they learned, or did not learn, from scandals such as this?</p></speech>

If one looks at the culture within Irish banking over the period of the scandals the Deputy mentioned from the first book, I believe there was a switch in the 1980s to performance related pay and that that is really what drove this activity by the banks - the desire to maximise earnings.  It was always about beating the previous year's profits and bankers being set higher targets to meet goals, not just by their own institutions but also by the market.  They wanted to see the share price go in one particular way.  That should have alerted either the regulatory authorities or government authorities to understand what was going on in banking at the time and to take more aggressive action.  </p> <p>  Senator Sean D. Barrett asked how the nature of the regulatory regime had changed in 2003.  The focus was on protecting the consumer, not prudential standards in the banking sector.</p></speech>

Is it Mr. Carswell's view that this nexus of public representatives and land speculation deals would have had a decisive influence in allowing laxity in regulation and the type of legislation that might have been put through Parliament?  Would such decisions be influenced by this type of relationship?</p></speech>

There is a skewed relationship if a person close to a politician is involved in the property industry and if those trying to buy their first home do not have access to the same people.

In some instances and some financial institutions the paperwork was done afterwards, at the same time the money was given.  All of the verification checks to make sure the customer was good for it were made as the loan was given.  Again, it goes back to the very close relationship between some of the banks and the borrowers.  The banks knew them so well that it was felt there was no issue and no worry about getting the paperwork done.  The key was getting the money out as quickly as possible.  Many rival developers were bidding for the same land and each developer may have been backed by a different bank.  It was the competitive race to buy the land which drove this process.</p></speech>

They became players in the deals.  Anglo Irish Bank had a wealth management division where many people had money on deposit, many of whom would also have been borrowers at the bank.  When there were opportunities to do deals for the wealth management division, the bank used the pot of money already in the bank to help to buy these deals.  Irish Nationwide was actually a shareholder in some developments with one of its biggest customers.</p></speech>

In some instances, the actual supposed equity or cash that was used in these deals would itself be borrowed so that in some transactions there would be debt on debt on debt and very little cash in the transaction.  Again it comes back to the fact that the banks were competing with each other with their customers to buy very valuable land.</p></speech>

Most of the banks would offer share incentive schemes to their executives.  In particular, in Anglo Irish Bank, the senior management team would have significant amounts of shares, proportionately more than one would see at AIB or Bank of Ireland.  In terms of getting money out, they bought in but they did not cash out those shares because it would have been perceived as a weakness if the executives were cashing from their own bank.  I am not sure, I do not get how the Senator is saying they take money out.</p></speech>

Perhaps I can give an example.  In some instances the banks would approach the borrower asking if he was interested in the land and, if so, the bank would help the borrower to buy it.  The developer might be on the radar but may not have been interested until the bank raised the issue.  Certain developers aligned themselves with certain banks so that competing race to buy land was very frenetic as the property market was rising.  Clearly, at particular points in time, as Anglo's business model was doing so well, the other banks starting coming in.  In the period from 2004-07 in particular, there was a marked increase in competition between the banks and the foreign lenders were very actively becoming involved in the property development.</p></speech>

In the case of Irish Nationwide there would have been some very quick turnarounds.  Anecdotally, one heard stories all the time during the boom that one bank would take much longer than another and some were aggressive lenders.  They could agree the deal there and then in principle over breakfast or on the building site as they were showing the bankers around the site they wanted to buy.</p></speech>

In a speech given in Dublin City Library in 2012, he said:<blockquote><br /><br />You hear talk now about Trichet, Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, threatening Ireland and some say the fear was that they would withdraw the funding from the Irish banks.  I'm not sure they could have done that but what they could have done is put pressure on the Government by increasing the charge and increasing the interest rate on that.</blockquote>Why did Mr. Carswell say this about the threat of the ECB to withdraw funding?  Why would or could it not have done it?</p></speech>

I was speaking somewhat blind about the content of those letters.  My understanding was that the threat at the time if the Government did not accept a bailout of the country - the fear within Government - was less about the money being withdrawn because it had been already been lent by the national Central Bank.  The ECB's way of cranking up the pressure on the Irish Government was it could increase the borrowing cost of that money.  If you go back again to what was the trigger for the bailout, it was the exposure of the national Central Bank and the European Central Bank borrowing to the Irish banks and how quickly that went up.</p></speech>

There is a difference.  Practically I do not think they could have done it.  You cannot withdraw funding if it is already lent.  They could certainly put pressure on to increase the cost of it.  That was the lever they could have pulled to put pressure on the Government.  It came under ELA, exceptional liquidity assistance funding.  It jumped so quickly  because the money was borrowed by all of the banks but in particular by Anglo Irish Bank through the ELA facility at the national Central Bank.  It had to be approved by the European Central Bank and required two thirds of the governing council to vote on it.  The "could" I mentioned in that statement that I made - what is the date I gave the speech?</p></speech>

It was certainly played out.  When people want to apply pressure in this kind of very official correspondence, they do not say, "If you do not go into a bailout I am going to pull your money or I am going to start increasing your costs".  Obviously, the Government gets the correspondence and looks at it and says, "What can he do here?  How can he increase the pressure on the Government to accept the terms of an EU-IMF bailout?"</p></speech>

If you go back and look at what was on the table at that point, there was money - I cannot recall the exact figures - senior bonds were due by Anglo Irish Bank.  Because it was a defunct lender, obviously in the world of capitalism it should follow that those people should not be repaid because the bank is bust.  When the attempt was made to apply losses on senior bondholders it was like, "You cannot do that.  There  will be this contagion effect and all of your banks will be affected".  The ability to raise bonds and money as a result of that decision would be damaged.</p></speech>

He had a special position at the time of the crisis because he was a journalist and was able to see people speaking and acting publicly as well as speaking to them privately.  He was able to see things like briefings behind the scenes or lobbying activities and was probably made aware of them.  Was there a concern during the run-up to the crisis either personally within himself or in the profession about the extent and types of those relationships?  In Mr. Carswell's opening statement he talks about cosy relationships.</p></speech>

Much like the debate around whether it was a liquidity or solvency crisis, the focus - I started in <i>The Irish Times</i>reporting day-to-day on the banks in September 2007.  It was all about liquidity at that point.  My focus in particular was how exactly banks were funding themselves, how this international crisis was affecting their funding.  In the latter part of 2007 and early 2008, did the banks have sub-prime assets on their books?  That was the real warning sign - if we saw some of those sub-prime assets on the books of the banks they could potentially be in serious trouble.  The crisis evolved and became more about domestic deposits through mid-point in 2008 and as we know with September 2008.  The concern about the relationships I speak about in the opening statement did not really figure in my coverage at that point because the focus was very much liquidity.  Certainly the questions started being asked.  As I mentioned before, in the report in May 2008 the level of interest roll-up, which is a sign of distress - borrowers cannot pay their interest so it rolls up - indicated that it was a risk to the banks.  In the middle of 2008 we started wondering how exactly these banks were being affected.  Then the liquidity crisis reached a peak with the guarantee and thereafter, in the following two years right up to the present, it is about solvency and the quality of the loans in these institutions.</p></speech>

I was surprised at the pace at which the crisis was developing, how quickly it happened.  I did not necessarily jump to what access do people have at this time.  We were following it as a day-to-day crisis, it was panic stations for a lot of these financial institutions in the second half of 2008.  We now know that Anglo was &euro;0.5 billion a day, up to &euro;1 billion a day.  The money was draining out of the bank.

I think there was a sense that some institutions felt they were not as weak as another institution or that such an institution was much weaker than they were.  Again, the concern during that week was with the blanket guarantee, that it was not differentiating between the weakest and the strongest.  We now know that most of the institutions - given what they had on their loan books but which had not come through at that stage - were in dire straits, certainly from a liquidity point of view but some banks had solvency issues.  The market had not fallen to the extent that it did later which exposed those solvency issues.</p></speech>

There was a sense of out-and-out panic.  People were trying to figure out what was going on.  From the point of view of a journalist it was a fertile time to be reporting on it because one was able to find out a lot more.  People across the spectrum were speaking to me and other journalists to try to find out what I had heard.  It was a frenzy of trying to find out information about what was going on.</p></speech>

I do not know.  My focus was very much on the financial banking side.  I would say that the coalition partners were up to speed with each other on what was going on.  There is a incorporeal Cabinet meeting to agree the guarantee, as we know, so they were all contacted.  My understanding is that yes, there was certainly a concerted effort by members of the junior party in the coalition to find out exactly what was going on.  I do not think that anyone was kept in the dark.</p></speech>

In his response to the Chairman's first question, Mr. Carswell mentioned briefly the role of auditors.  Are the rules regarding how auditors audit the accounts of financial institutions post-crisis, effective?  Will the changes that have been made be effective into the future?  Several witnesses have pointed to a potential conflict, at least, in terms of how auditors are appointed by financial institutions versus their role in auditing the accounts of those institutions.  Does Mr. Carswell have any views or comments as to the method by which auditors are appointed?</p></speech>

I think the crisis showed that banks needed to put aside rainy day money so that should things go bad they would have enough general provisions.  There was an attempt, very late in the day, to apply general provisions.  After the guarantee period, the banks were saying that the loans had not gone bad but they had put aside a pot of &euro;500 million in case they do.  That should have been going on for years, even during the good times but because the credit markets were doing so well, the problems with loans were covered by a rising market.  That is what really shrouded all of the problems that occurred in the accountancy profession.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's question on how auditors should be appointed, I certainly think there should be a rotation of auditors much more frequently than there had been.  I think that would apply a fresh set of eyes to a set of accounts or financial statements.  With the nature of auditing, they may need to bring in some future forecasting as well.  That might require auditors to hire economists, mathematicians or people who can look ahead and foresee potential problem when one has 50% of the loan book in a particular sector that if the following ten things should happen there could be problems.  Auditors will say it is all about looking backwards, but I think there needs to be a focus on forecasting, but as I have said, I do not know if the changes cover that.</p></speech>

Mr. Carswell referred in his opening statement to cosy relationships, which Deputy Murphy mentioned.

An announcement was made that the Government was reviewing all the tax reliefs, be it for the multistorey carparks over the shop, accommodation and so on.  I think there was period of frenetic lobbying around that time.  It was widely known and reported at the time.  I do not know what influence that had but the policies - - - - -</p></speech>

There were several references throughout <i>Anglo Republic: Inside the Bank that Broke Ireland</i>of the bonus structure.  Will he give examples of the differences that existed between institutions and also between different bonus levels for senior and lower management levels?  Does he believe the bonus structure was a component of the ultimate collapse?</p></speech>

It was not just builders and property developers who were getting rich.  If profits were met as well as certain targets being met by bankers, they would get substantial share options and if memory serves me, bonus were paid over three years at Anglo Irish Bank.  If one is looking at bonus structures now, the changes to be made is to put it over a much longer period and that would certainly make bankers more prudent in terms of having their decisions on loans being viewed over a longer period, so that if a loan goes south the person may not be paid the bonus that was agreed at the time he or she had agreed the loan.</p></speech>

I will begin with his previous book <i>Something Rotten: Irish Banking Scandals</i>.  I have referenced it before in the inquiry.  He deals with the DIRT scandal on page 151 and he says, &quot;The controversy revealed that in 1980s and 1990s Ireland there existed a culture of State and bank sponsored tax evasion.&quot;  Could he speak to this for the committee and outline what he means in relation to that culture of State and bank sponsored tax evasion?</p></speech>

They knew that they were not non-resident.  They knew that they were resident so they were therefore bogus.  People recognised that there was a problem, Revenue Commissioners, senior Government departmental officials and the Central Bank.  Again, I mentioned it earlier, throughout the scandals the flight of capital was a big fear.  If we moved aggressively against these accounts, and it was estimated that there were substantial funds in these accounts, would that scare off the actual non-resident depositors in the Irish banks.  There was consideration given to how to find out if they were non-resident or not and the proposal at the time from the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition in 1983 was to get them to swear an affidavit.  The view was to ask every non-resident to swear an affidavit that the account and the money in that account belongs to them and they are not living in the Republic.  The view was that that would scare them off and they would just take their money elsewhere.  I think the flight of capital risk was completely overplayed in this period.  To me it was sometimes a convenient excuse when I looked at the scandals in that period.  Particularly in the 1970s and 1980s when the country was on its knees financially, it was totally overplayed and there should have been much more aggressive action.  There is a whole other inquiry which looked into all of this and the findings were that absolutely all of those players that I mentioned should have taken the action.</p></speech>

We do not know exactly the contacts that were made and I made reference to quasi-social occasions in my opening statement.  We do not know exactly the interactions that take place but we know they are close.  As a journalist I was always interested in this and I tried to get into Fianna F&aacute;il's Galway tent, for example, and I got in one time and I saw it.  I saw the close contact between the people they had invited or donors, whoever they were, and various Government Ministers.  What struck me at the time was, "I wonder what they are talking about."  We do not know.  That is the problem.  The lobbying that we do know is often found out through freedom of information requests to Government Departments.  The media, and certainly I, as a reporter trying to find out more, would be constantly hitting walls trying to find out exactly the relationships between these people and what it means in terms of forming policy on certain issues and it is not at all transparent.</p></speech>

We know, and the three banking reports have gone into this, that the tax incentives that were there for the property market certainly fuelled the boom, not just in buying land but in lending.  If a person could get their property sold quickly and could get a tax incentive to do so, to make it cheaper to borrow money or to buy land, then the banks would be encouraged to lend to that person, absolutely.</p></speech>

It is a different view than that put forward by Dr. Nyberg who was of the opinion in his report that, "The nature of systemic banking crises rarely allows blame and responsibility to be confidently allocated."  Mr. Carswell has purposely challenged this view by saying that there were a limited number of people involved in key decision-making.  When we talk about the limited number of people are we talking about single numbers, double numbers, or a couple of dozen?  What is Mr. Carswell's thinking in relation to the number of people that could be held accountable?</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, if one of those groups, like a bank, one bank, very openly said, "I am not going to go down there, I am not going down this route," I think that would have had an effect.  Would it have stopped the crisis totally?  I do not believe so.  It is very difficult to put a specific number but I think it could be brought down to dozens.</p></speech>

I think the communications of civil servants should be open to the public even with the passage of time.  I know there is the 30-year rule for State papers for example and obviously there are certain issues which require Cabinet confidentiality but as I said in my opening statement, I think sunlight is good medicine.  I think transparency is very important.  To get an understanding of what actually happened I think it is important to have contemporaneous access to decisions that are made by Government.  When I try to find out information on things that are going on at a particular point in time it is very difficult and freedom of information provides an opportunity or channel to get it, but this is a question I raised about a particular institution, a bank, that there is no transparency.  We do not know the process around, "Well, what about that line or this line?"  What is the process around why I have been denied access to that information?  I think the fact that we do not know makes it even more difficult.  I think those concerns that it leads to people not taking notes have been overplayed.</p></speech>

He also mentions a presentation that took place on 7 February 2008 at the Department of Finance at which he suggests legislation was drafted empowering the Minister for Finance to introduce guarantees for banks and to nationalise financial institutions.  This is in February of 2008.  Could Mr. Carswell expand upon what actually happened there and what he recorded or what he uncovered?</p></speech>

I cannot remember which one.  It explored the need to have something in our back pocket in case something happens.</p><p>That was all part of the crisis management preparations that went on.  There was a similar piece of legislation, but much broader, introduced in the UK called the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, which was effectively providing a regulator a toolkit to fix a broken bank or to take it out or decommission it.  It was very much of the time that governments were looking at that, in that the crisis was so bad and we had seen five or six months previously what had happened with Northern Rock, so we needed to be prepared.  That is where that came from.</p></speech>

People get paid a lot of money to hold them, in the teens in terms of percentage interest on what they would get on those.  I was surprised by how broad it was when it was announced the following day.  I was certainly surprised that there did not seem to be a very clear explanation as to why that debt was included.  It is not quite clear exactly who decided on the night to include it.  Somebody asked earlier about gaps in what we know.  That is a big gap, in my view, in finding out exactly why dated subordinated debt was included.</p></speech>

I think they were qualifying.  I think there was alarm in Frankfurt at the rate of increase.  The rate of increase arose because of the end of the two-year period of the guarantee.  One thing that surprised me was that the ECB did not see that coming.  We knew it was a two-year guarantee from September 2008, so there was always going to be a funding cliff at a particular point.  I was surprised that the ECB was shocked that, suddenly, there was this huge increase in ELA borrowing.</p></speech>

That was the problem in Frankfurt.  The European Central Bank's view was that it had taken on a credit risk with Ireland and it was exposed to Ireland because the State had stood behind the banks.  Therefore, it was the State effectively.  ELA is not for that purpose, and that is why there was alarm in Frankfurt and that is why there was that pressure that Senator MacSharry and I spoke about earlier.</p></speech>

As I said in my opening statement, I think the fact that we are a small country and there is potential for more people - different people - to meet more often means that there is a requirement to have a very thorough register of lobbying, for example.  I think that it should be as detailed as possible, within reason of course.  I used the word "onerous".  I think it is important that we know who has access to Government decisions.  It is not a bad thing.  We just need to know so that we can figure out if decisions are made because there is certain undue influence brought to bear on a politician.  The transparency, I think, will improve the process by which citizens make representations to their elected representatives.</p></speech>

Hypothetically, if we improve regulation, do we run the risk that one of our American experts presented to us of an AIG, a body that is not regulated but has so many connections with the bodies that one is trying to regulate and save that AIG must be included as well?  Arising from that, is it possible to have a utility bank that would just look after people's savings and make the rest a casino, or are they inextricably linked, when we try to design a regulatory system for this sector in the future to make sure that none of this happens again?</p></speech>

As the Senator will know, the financial services industry is very innovative.  It will find new ways to make money, so it is a challenge for regulators to stay ahead of that.   If one improves the rules generally and improves the action and interaction of the regulator with the banking sector, it will help more than if one sets up a utility bank and leaves the other banks to it.  That just makes things difficult in the market.</p></speech>

This is the fourth action plan.  Members will be aware of the backdrop to this, which was to try to achieve a cross-government focus on employment.  This is the central challenge we all face.  The model has been successful for a number of reasons.  It has motivated people across government to focus on employment and it has been monitored from the Taoiseach's office, which on a quarterly basis, gives additional impetus.  It is an annual process and every year we have the opportunity to discuss with both industry partners and a wider base of stakeholders what needs to be done.  That has always ensured fresh thinking in the plan.</p> <p>  The plan has made an impact.  It had two simple objectives in the early period, the most significant one being the return of 100,000 people to work by 2016 and, second, as the Taoiseach has often reiterated, to become the best small country in which to do business by 2016.  We have made substantial progress on both fronts.  The latest numbers suggest 90,000 additional people are back at work and, significantly, in the context previous queries by members when I have appeared before them, they will be heartened that over the past two years, all these new jobs have been full time.  The number of new part-time jobs has declined over the same period.</p> <p>  We are improving steadily in the competitiveness rankings, which reflects the effort to improve the business environment that we took on.  Initially, the focus was on export oriented firms and in the first three years, the plan was entirely driven by export growth through the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and tourism but, over the past 12 months, while exports remain strong, our agencies supported 35,000 gross new jobs leading to 15,000 net new jobs.  Exports remain a big driver when one considers that for every exporting job, typically another job is generated elsewhere in the economy.  However, we are experiencing a welcome return to growth across other sectors.</p> <p>  This year, like other years, we conducted an open consultation to take on the best ideas and we have focused on a number of four core issues.  We have instituted regional enterprise strategies for the first time and this is being driven by my Secretary General.  We intend to roll out these strategies within every region by July.  We see it as a good opportunity not only to focus on the agencies, which I have done in delivering at regional level through local enterprise offices, LEOs, EI and the IDA but also to engage and, hopefully, elicit new responses to the challenge within the regions.  To that end, we have made competitiveness funds available through EI and we have also decided that in six regions outside Dublin and Cork specific commitments will be made by the IDA to advance facilities and other property-based solutions will be a major core objective.  That has been a significant issue.</p> <p>  The second concern is to focus on startups.  Two thirds of all jobs in an economy are generated in the first five years of a company's existence.  In the difficult years between 2006 and 2011, approximately 93,000 jobs were created by such companies.</p><p>I believe it is realistic to double the target for the number of people we will employ in start-ups over a five-year period which would involve increasing start-ups by 25%.  It would also improve their survival rate by 25% and would seem more growth to scale.  The target is deliverable and is a big focus for this year.  We will have a start-up gathering later in the year that will put additional focus on implementation in that area.</p><p> The third area is the skills challenge.  We have often understood here that there is a war for talent in every country in the world.  A lot of the new sectors which we must build are very high in their need for new skills and we need to ensure we equip people with those skills.  Some of them involve new apprenticeships and is one key part of this year's activity.  The first call for new apprenticeships in many years was made last January.  This also covers other areas such as ICT and improving the skill-base across all areas.  We have clearly signalled that as in other areas referred to, this might be considered as disruptive reform in that it has a huge impact across the board.</p><p> The final area is around the whole business environment, which has been a continuing theme.  There have been many aspects to it this year.  Perhaps the biggest, in terms of impact, has been the introduction of the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland.  It has committed to provide &euro;800 million in additional resources to SMEs which have found life difficult in the banking environment.  The situation is improving but we still need to equip ourselves with more non-bank sources of funding.</p><p> The last matter I shall draw to the attention of the committee is largely a response to the urging of the committee.  This year, for the first time we have put in place a more clear evaluation framework.  We have identified ten areas against which we benchmark everything.  That means every activity is being benchmarked and they are listed on page 19.  It means every action taken is related back to its impact on some of these key indicators.  A lot of people were keen to see to what extent our actions related to objectives that we are trying to achieve.  One is never going to get an equivalency of action and impact, it is never as neat as that.  The initiative creates a discipline around which we organise and interrogate proposals that come forward to us.  </p><p> Seo &iacute; Seachtain na Gaeilge agus t&aacute; orm c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; as Gaeilge faoin bplean gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta le haghaidh An Post.  T&aacute;im l&aacute;n-s&aacute;sta go sroichfear an sprioc 100,000 post nua a chruth&uacute; i mbliana, bliain ioml&aacute;n roimh an spriocdh&aacute;ta.

We have now set ourselves a target of full employment, on a sustainable basis, by 2018.  Ligeann n&aacute;d&uacute;r bliant&uacute;il an phlean d&uacute;inn tosa&iacute;ochta &uacute;ra a chur ar si&uacute;l gach bliain.

Every job we create is a life back on track.  It is extra spending in the local community and more money into the public services and public finances so we have the options of reducing tax burdens or improving the quality of services.  The work we do on employment is absolutely central to the longer-term ambitions we hold as a nation.</p></speech>

The action plan for 2015 includes points raised by the committee over the past 12 months.  These include the need for regional plans and advanced property solutions in the IDA.  I wish to drill down several aspects with the Minister.  In 2014 the labour force fell, which suggests emigration.  We still have a problem with losing our talented people, the very people for whom the Minister seeks to have a recruitment strategy in this year's action plan.  If the plan is as successful as the Minister would lead us to believe, why are people still leaving the country?  Why is the talent we need to fulfil the objectives of the plan still leaving?</p> <p>  With regard to the CSO figures, of the 80,000 jobs the Minister claims to have created, 27,000 are one-person self-employed operations.  They work in self-employment for at least one hour a week.  During the lifetime of the plan will the Minister monitor how many of these 27,000 people manage to give employment to others and how many leave self-employment to move into the employed labour force?  The number of full-time employee positions created is approximately 50% of the jobs being added.  The majority of jobs seem to be part-time or in zero-hour contracts with little security.  What strategy is in place to address these issues?</p> <p>  With regard to commitments on finance and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, I am on record as stating it is a mistake.  We need competition in the banking market.  This does not provide competition in the banking market.  It does not make sense to give more money to the two institutions which work very closely together when we could have a new institution trying to shake things up.  Several weeks ago, the Minister announced an extension of the credit guarantee scheme with regard to allowing companies to use it to buy out their borrowings from banks exiting the market.  Has this come into operation?</p> <p>  Some banks which may not be exiting the market are selling their portfolios none the less, and are forcing small and medium enterprises to sell their loan portfolios to investment funds which will have no regard for the employment at stake.  Can we extend the credit guarantee scheme further to include banks staying in the market but actively selling their loan portfolios?</p> <p>  A total of 80,000 people have been on the live register for three years or more, which is the duration of the Action Plan for Jobs.</p><p>How have they missed out on all this success?  Is specific attention being paid to people who have been on the live register for that long?   Are they part of the 86,000 who are on activation schemes?  Are they churning around various schemes and not being given the chance to access the labour market?</p><p> I welcome the regional plans.  I am sceptical about them but will wait to see them.  What element of co-ordination is underway to ensure the plan we get in the midlands, which will be the first plan, is not replicated in other regions?  Is there co-ordination to ensure the unique selling points of each region are being delivered on and are not been replicated?  There is no point doing the same thing in every region and then the USPs being lost in that process.  Is there a central point for the creation of all the regional plans?  </p><p> Action 52 mentions that there will be a broadband tender in 2015 to get high speed broadband to places where it is not available.  Will the Minister elaborate on that because the national broadband plan published by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, some weeks ago mentioned a deadline of 2020 for a connection to every area which does not have high speed broadband.  I am fully in agreement with the Minister in terms of self-employment and the need for start-ups but we will not have a start-up culture in this country until we get broadband right.  If Romania, which has a very dispersed rural population, can have one of the biggest animation businesses in the world because it got its broadband right, surely we can get ours right also.  </p><p> There is a commitment to cut red tape.  If we are to be the best place in the world to do business in 2016, what specific items of red tape will be cut?  Has agreement been reached on what the Minister defines as red tape and what business might define it as?  Other people or, for the want of a better description, former social partners might define red tape as rights.  What is the position on getting agreement on what constitutes red tape among all sectors because the lack of agreement often stops red tape being removed?</p><p> Bh&iacute; r&oacute;l ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta chun tionscadal idirn&aacute;isi&uacute;nta a thabhairt go dt&iacute; ceantair Ghaeltachta.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.348" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015031000002#H00200"><p>I thank Deputy Calleary for his comprehensive set of questions.  It is true that the labour force fell and that we still have emigration.  However, the latest figure we have is to April of last year and it shows a 30% decline, so a emigration fell from approximately 34,000 to roughly 21,000.  I believe the figure has come down since, and is still on the way down, but we await the figure to bear that out.</p> <p>  The only credible response to emigration is job creation.  If we can continue to grow employment at this pace and with the targets the IDA, the local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland have set, we can deliver full employment over the next four years.  The IDA and Enterprise Ireland targets, combined with a reasonable recovery in those other sectors, will deliver that for us but we must keep a sensible set of policies to deliver it.  That is the response to emigration and I would have the ambition that we would see zero emigration over that four-year period. </p> <p>  In regard to the self-employed, we track how many remain as one-man bands and how many grow.</p><p>We track some of them.  Most of the local enterprises grow to having more than one; typically they are two to three person enterprises.  Equally, we see this with the competitive start funds and HPSUs.  They are tracked and all have the capacity to grow more and, by and large, they deliver this.  Some do not grow as rapidly as we would like, but we are tracking them and intend to become more forensic about it.</p><p> We believe survival and scaling are crucial.  The CSO provides a good analysis of the cohort of start ups each year and how they grow.  Interestingly, in that really tough period half of them perished, but the other half created 93,000 jobs.  We are becoming more forensic and also trying to gear our policies to drive growth through mentoring.  We are reviewing our mentoring strategies and, as part of the regional strategies, very keen to build more enterprise hubs to give start-ups a chance of surviving.  One of the things we will be looking for in the regional bids is that they add value and create an environment in which these enterprises can grow.</p><p> If one looks at the QHNS and the increase in employment in the two years 2013 and 2014, all of the extra employment is full-time.  The figures for part-time work actually declined.  I do not accept, therefore, that the majority of jobs are part-time.  In so far as we have data, they prove that most of the growth is in the level of full-time employment.  Yes, there are 450,000 people working part time, but part-time work has always been a feature as it suits some people.  However, we are growing the level of full-time employment.  That is one of the features.  In the last quarter it is interesting that there was a sharp fall in the numbers working part time.  That is a pattern in a recovery that is picking up.  Businesses might initially only take on people part time which then grows.</p><p> We are looking at zero hour contracts.  The Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, issued a consultancy contract which the University of Limerick won.  It will examine the extent of the problem in Ireland.</p><p> The Deputy is being less than fair to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  It is true that it is working initially through the pillar banks.  In the first quarter it has signed up to deliver &euro;400 million through them.  However, the rest of its 2015 programme is to develop new products and new entrants.  It definitely has a mandate to attract and support new entrant to the market.  As that is a key part of its mandate, it is not just about the flow of money, as it were.  As it is a wholesale bank, in the short term it is putting money through the established network, but its ambition clearly is to move well beyond this.  It has set out its stall.  They are longer term loans of up to ten years.  They will be at a lower coupon rate and have a higher risk appetite.  We will now have an arrangement whereby the credit guarantee can be a part of this, and I hope one can have an enhanced set of offerings.  Obviously, it is working its way through.</p><p> We have a credit scheme.  We are drafting the legislation, but, as I told Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n previously in the House, it has proved more complex than we had hoped.  However, we have got over the problems with it and I expect it to move along quite swiftly.  It will include any exiting bank or new entrant; therefore, we are not confining it to existing banks.  I hope, if there are new vehicles, it can be extended to them also.  Clearly, that is our intention.</p></speech>

Let us take the example of a bank that is in the market and selling a portfolio of loans and a customer who is responsible for a loan and trying to obtain finance from another bank but cannot get it.</p><p>The bank is staying in the market.  It is cleaning up its loans and clearing out underperforming loans but the customer's loan is the kind that seems to be falling between the cracks on this.  The bank is not actually exiting the market but it is selling off its loan book.</p></speech>

It cuts both ways.  Some of these investment funds have bought the loans quite cheaply and on some occasions they are willing to enter into reasonable restructuring arrangements.  We are keen to try to fill the gap in so far as we can.  I will get an official to track down some of the examples the Deputy has mentioned so that we can see whether we can accommodate them.</p> <p>  In regard to being three years or more on the live register, it is a striking feature of the QHNS that in the past two years, some 75% of the people who have left the live register have been long-term unemployed, while 25% have been short-term unemployed.  Therefore, there is an impact on the long-term unemployment rate as reported in the QHNS.  Back in 2012, the Pathways to Work programme specifically targeted long-term unemployed people.  It targets and tracks this cohort and has set a target of getting all of these people back into work.  They are consciously tracked within the programme.  This is one of the areas where the programme is ahead of target, in terms of the progress it is making with that group.  The Deputy is right, we always face the danger of people falling between the cracks when we get a shift in sectors.  There is not an easy fit between the skill base of the old sectors in decline and the new sectors.  This is an area that will require sustained work and we need to refresh the instruments for doing that continually.  The call for apprenticeships this year will, I hope, provide a significant opportunity and we must ensure we help people progress to those opportunities.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's fear that we might have a one-size-fits-all enterprise strategy in the regions, but that is not our intention.  We have a regional manager of Enterprise Ireland or the IDA in charge of each region.  These have a mandate to do the preparatory work in the region, to identify within each region the actions that will come from the education and training boards, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland and to bring in the stakeholders to consider what new actions can be taken.  We will have a competitive call for funding and will look not for replicas of previous ideas but for the best ideas from each region.  We expect them to build off regional strengths.  We are trying to structure the strategy in a way that it is not a replica of previous strategies.  The strategy must from be bottom up if it is to succeed.  From the IDA perspective, there will be some top-down input in that it has to look at the identification of sites for advance facilities.  Essentially, these are identified around magnets, such as institutes of technology or similar.</p> <p>  On the broadband question, I understand the tender is to go out in 2016 and that work is under way so that we can have a tender by the end of the year.  Much of the mapping work has been done.</p> <p>  In regard to red tape, it is not in any way an eroding of people's rights.  We would see the Workplace Relations Commission, where the same delays are no longer being encountered, as providing a saving.  Also, the new companies legislation means that from June of this year, people will be able to set up a company with one director and with no requirement for an AGM.  One document sets out the company.  This is a saving, as is the cutting of the threshold for an audit for such a small business.  These are the sort of savings we are after.  We have identified in the plan interactions between the State and business, where we feel going on line or adopting a new approach will improve effectiveness and reduce compliance cost.  However, this in no way alters the policy objectives underpinning the setting up of a company.</p> <p>  On the role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, it is intimately involved our entrepreneurship roll-out and both through our implementation group and the regional implementation group.  We see the &uacute;dar&aacute;s as a central player and stakeholder.</p><p>Its remit is stronger in certain regions than others, but we see it as a crucial player, so we are integrating it into that process.</p></speech>

We are using the CSO data as the authoritative data.  The CSO has confirmed that the net figure of 90,000 is the relevant one for the period since the first quarter of 2012.  Obviously, the agencies collect other figures.  We publish the figures which are independently audited not by the agencies but by means of an independent survey.  They are consistent.  In the past three years we have seen a net increase of approximately 27,000 in the numbers of full-time and part-time jobs supported by IDA Ireland and a net increase of approximately 17,000 in the numbers of full-time and part-time jobs supported by Enterprise Ireland.  The total figure of approximately 44,000 is consistent with the CSO's target.  Obviously, there is independent tracking also.  For example, Bord F&aacute;ilte tracks the tourism sector.  The different sources of employment numbers are consistent in their patterns.  We have defined full employment as 2.1 million people at work.  I think the latest number is 1.938 million.  It is clear, therefore, that there has been a substantial increase in employment as we aim to deliver on the target.  It is credible that we can do this.  If we are to be consistent in meeting our target, we have to reduce the unemployment level, which has decreased to 10% from 15%, to between 5% and 6%.  We are factoring in a need to reduce the rate of emigration to zero.</p></speech>

Its job is to have an evidence-based system for increasing the minimum wage as the system can absorb it.  Obviously, there is a balance to be struck by it in looking at employment creation on the one side and increasing the minimum wage on the other.  That is the balance that will be struck by the fine group of people who are involved who will look at the evidence.  Having it evidence-based is the correct way to proceed.  As the Deputy knows, the Taoiseach has flagged that an input will be made in July.  If this creates issues or problems for employers, mitigation will be looked at as we move towards the budget.  Obviously, the Government will be keen to implement the independent proposal made to it.  Growth in living standards and employment numbers, both of which we need to see, can go hand in hand.  Much of what we are doing involves trying to improve productivity and facilitate business innovations that allow higher living standards to be achieved.</p> <p>  Before I respond to what the Deputy had to say about younger people, it is worth focusing on the strong evidence on the pay front.  The average salary in IDA Ireland-supported employment is approximately &euro;55,000.  The average salary in Enterprise Ireland-supported employment is approximately &euro;42,000.  A very considerable part of the growth in employment is coming from these companies.  We know the average pay of many of those who have benefited from the employment increase because we actually record these figures.  If one examines the CSO's indications for the sectors that are growing, one will see that employment is growing in many high paying sectors, particularly professional services, information and communications technology and high-end industry.</p><p>Of course there is some growth in employment in sectors that are traditionally lower paid, such as the hospitality sector.</p></speech>

There is a mixture of low and high pay, but that is as one would expect.  It is well beside the point to pretend that this is in somehow an increase in low-paid employment.  Much of it is in very highly paid professional services, such as ICT.  Much of the growth areas are in strong sectors with a good, firm, solid base.  It is worth taking a look at some of the recent announcements.  Since the turn of the year we have had such announcements in Fermoy and Dundalk, as well as Combilift in Monaghan, Lakelands in Cavan, Apple in Athenry, Airbnb in Dublin and Northern Trust in Limerick.  These are all in high-paying, good, solid sectors offering long-term prospects.  It is particularly good to see the strength of companies like Combilift, which are combining with other companies to make a pitch to the new apprenticeship scheme.  We will see such companies using the education and training boards to fuel the next phase of growth.  That is what we need to see and it is something that we are encouraging very much.</p> <p>  I hope something was not lost in translation but I think Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n was concerned about the prospects of people aged under 35.  There is no doubt that emigration has hit that age group most strongly but unemployment levels are falling in those age groups and we are seeing growth there.  There is now solid demand for employment in a lot of new sectors.  We are seeing recovery right across areas, including construction, that were traditionally driving emigration.  It will take time to get emigration down but it has dropped by 30% in the last 12 months.  The data show that and it is a significant and healthy step.</p> <p>  In a small open economy one needs to examine the net emigration figure.  People are leaving and coming, which is a feature of the Irish environment.  We want to ensure that on balance there are more people coming than leaving.  That is the target we are trying to achieve.  Our ambition for full employment is the only credible approach.  The sort of policies that will make that a reality include a focus on enterprise, competitiveness and innovation, particularly in these Irish-based companies.  These are still the drivers we will need to ensure growth and, indeed, tax policy is consistent with that.</p> <p>  The IDA has set targets for a 30% to 40% increase in the number of projects in each region.  The IDA admits it did not hit the target on the last occasion but as we have discussed in this committee on a number of occasions it is steadily growing that.  Back in 2011, it was just 23%, while last year it was up to 37%.  There is traction, therefore, and that continues to be the case, as can be seen from some of the announcements since the turn of the year, particularly the one in Fermoy.  Anyone who has visited Fermoy will know what a great boon that was, as is the Athenry decision.  There is a proven track record given that the IDA is putting nine advance facilities into each of the regions.  It is a proven model whereby the IDA can win projects and it will also enhance its ability to deliver this target.</p> <p>  The employment base in the LEOs is a combination both of the existing county enterprise boards, as they were, and the new local authorities.</p><p>We are continuing to work with each of them to ensure there is a proper complement of staff.  We also have sanction for some recruitment within the LEO network where we will be filling posts and we will have a graduate programme under which we will supplement the LEOs with graduate placement.</p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of clusters.  That is a challenge that is part of the regional strategy.  The IDA ill be seeking to build off the base of the institutes of education and the existing base of companies.  Clearly it will work with the pharma industry, not only in the south but in the south east where there are strong medical devices and ICT in the west in several regions.  As food is increasingly seen as a very strong cluster in certain regions it must be developed and we are seeing engineering particularly connected to agriculture which is a really strong cluster.  The way to build those is by having the apprenticeship schemes and research and to develop support and clustering of those companies.  One of the things we would hope to see emerge from the regional call is that there are serious clusters forming within regions around which a network can be built.  While Enterprise Ireland and the IDA can, to a degree, from their own knowledge of their base identify the clusters, much of this is about getting people to come forward with their own commitments, to work together and to draw down funds on the basis of the quality of proposals that are put together.  This is a way of developing new clusters or new networks or maybe just start up hubs or accelerators.</p><p> There are many things we could see emerge in our regions that would strengthen their capacity.  It may be food hubs or design hubs.  There are different ways in which we could play off the strengths of any one of those regions and their base of companies and their education base.  Waterford Institute of Technology is outstanding.  As it is located in the south east I know it better but there are some very strong technologies there from which one could see a greater regional impact emerge.</p><p> The Deputy raised the issue of online trading.  This is a huge change that is occurring and it is impacting on the high street.  We are putting in place online vouchers.  The former county enterprise boards and now the local enterprise offices are encouraging more people to go online.  The online route is a very successful strategy for many rural based businesses and is doing very well.  I could show members dozens of companies which have transformed their performance and their prospects through very good online trading models.</p><p> I do not deny that we continue to have a problem in rural high streets.  I am aware from people I meet that there is a change in the way people consume literature, music and even boutiques are changing.  There is a huge change and it is posing serious challenges to some of our traditional high street activities.  We have to innovate, there is no way of going back.  One cannot tell consumers to change back to the way they were, we have to offer ways to adapt.  Online trading and the smarter retail compliance portal which we are developing are ways of helping the retail sector to get through this difficult period.  In time, consumer demand recovery will be a big part of this and we are gradually beginning to see that recovery spread.  It is making an impact.  It can be seen in certain areas of retail but, unfortunately, not on all parts at this stage. </p></speech>

There are many other cross-Border initiatives which are not being developed by InterTradeIreland.  In the context of INTERREG, there are infrastructural projects under way.  There are a number of areas in which collaboration continues to take place.  Obviously, both sides have experienced difficulties in the context of funding.  In the light of budgetary considerations, InterTradeIreland has encountered such difficulties.  However, there is goodwill and also very practical support in encouraging companies in the South to trade in the North and <i>vice versa</i>.  There is healthy growth in cross-Border trade, which is the ultimate test in what we are trying to achieve.  There has been progress, but both economies must continue to grow.  The growth figure for the North stands at 1.8%, which is a sign that there is increasing confidence.  The cross-Border surveys we conduct indicate growing confidence and expectations among businesses that they are going to be able to take on additional employees and also increase their levels of spending.</p><p>We are doing all we can to provide support.  Enterprise Ireland already provides placements - for example, under its leadership for growth programme - for Northern companies that want to develop the capabilities of some of their leaders.  There is a great deal of practical collaboration.  We are also taking a joint approach to many of the projects relating to Horizon 2020.  Eight North-South collaborative projects have won funding in the first phase of Horizon 2020.  It is our ambition to win &euro;145 million for such projects overall.  In the context of support for Horizon 2020, Enterprise Ireland has very close connections with its counterpart organisation in the North to ensure the joint approach to which I refer will be successful.  The projects we have put forward jointly have enjoyed better success rates.  There is a great deal of practical work being done and it is having an impact.  It may be low key in nature, but it is extremely practical and delivering results.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015031000002#Q00800"><p>N&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n Gaeilge agam; therefore, I will speak in English.  </p> <p>  The Minister is to be congratulated on the employment figures.  Employment levels have improved hugely and the Companies Act 2014 is going to be of considerable assistance in reducing the difficulties experienced by start-up companies in seeking to commence operations.  There are still problems when it comes to establishing new businesses.  On previous occasions I have referred to the fact that the authorities in New Zealand have made it possible for a new business to establish operations in one day at a cost of less than &euro;100.  In Ireland a person seeking to set up a business must first approach a commissioner for oaths to make the necessary arrangements.  On the second day he or she must go to the Companies Registration Office and, on the third, will be obliged to register for VAT and corporation tax.  On the fourth, he or she will receive his or her company seal.</p><p>I understand it takes six days in total to get a new company opened in Ireland, whereas it can be done much more quickly in other countries.  Singapore is number one for ease of doing business, while Ireland is number 13.</p><p> A disappointing omission from the plan is any reference to the issue of upward-only rent reviews.  There was at least a mention of it last year, but it is not mentioned at all this time, even though it continues to be a huge deterrent to anybody wishing to set up a business.</p><p> The plan does include a reference to crowd funding, which offers a viable alternative to bank funding.  It is possible to do something in this regard, but it will require legislation to ensure people will be confident to invest on this basis.</p><p> I have some concerns about the tradition of leaving old laws and regulations in place rather than automatically getting rid of them.  The Government has a policy of seeking to remove legislation that no longer applies from the Statute Book, but that policy does not seem to have come as far as it should in practice.</p><p> An issue that attracts a lot of attention is that we in Ireland are very poor when it comes to language learning and skills.  There have been several instances where foreign companies have set up here with the intention of taking on hundreds of staff only to discover that Irish people cannot apply because they do not have the required foreign language skills.  That is a problem that remains to be addressed.</p><p> The Minister will not be able to solve all of these problems or solve all of them easily, but one issue he could address without delay is that of business start-up procedures.  It should be possible to do more online rather than requiring people to do four, five or six things.  The Minister has emphasised that increasing the number of business start-ups is a target for him.  Something can be done here to help ensure that target will be met.</p><p> The Minister has heard me speak about the French system under which the same laws do not apply to small companies as are applicable to large companies.  This means that a firm employing fewer than 50 people is not required to meet the same level of regulation as a company on the scale of Google, for instance.  If we are to succeed in making Ireland the best place in which to do business, we must ensure it is easy to start a business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015031000002#R00200"><p>I appreciate the Senator's deep interest in these matters.  If it would be helpful, I will send him the metrics tracked by the Companies Registration Office, CRO.  To be fair to that office, it has cut the number of days involved in the process of setting up a business and increased the percentage of interactions that can be completed online.  The progress in this regard is very impressive.  The Revenue Commissioners, meanwhile, comes out as one of the best, if not the very best, in the world when it comes to ease of complying with the corporate taxation process and so on.  I will ask the new head of the CRO for a report on what more could be done to move the process online.  Between now and June, a major effort is being made to familiarise people with the new company set-up process.  People will have to, over 18 months, opt for one or other of the new company structures.  As a consequence, there will be something of a peak in work as we try to migrate people from the old, more bureaucratic system to the newer, simpler one.  We might have to accept a slight blip in the numbers because of that large body of work, but it will be well worthwhile.  The Senator has been very consistent on this issue and we will seek to come back to him on it.</p> <p>  The consolidation of legislation is a hugely complex process.  We have put through the Bill to establish the Workplace Relations Commission and I thank Deputies and Senators for their patience in working with us on it.  They saw how complex that legislation was and it did not involve a consolidation of labour law, which is a project that remains to be done.  Consolidation is important in the longer term, but it can be very grinding work.  One of our priorities was to have the consumer and competition agencies merged.</p><p>We wanted to have Forf&aacute;s integrated into the Department and create a new dynamo in Shannon to drive the whole region.  We wanted to get our workplace relations scheme up being to world class, with a much more efficient way of doing things.  This has taken priority, if one likes, over the sweeping out of the attic of old laws and regulations.  However, I take the Senator's point and the matter is certainly on my agenda.</p><p> The lack of language skills is a real problem.  We have a competence in languages.  From memory, approximately 38,000 students take languages in their leaving certificate examinations, obviously excluding Irish and English, which is a substantial part of the total cohort.  While we have a significant number who have language competence, they do not appear to be able to fill some of the positions for which one needs a language.  They do not speak the language and this appears to be a problem in meeting many of the language requirements of businesses.  Where people have a reasonable competence to speak German, French or Spanish, with sales or technical capability, we are definitely setting targets to improve in this regard.  Acquiring language skills is a longer term project and probably is within the education system.  The aforementioned figure of 38,000 is not a bad number and it is probably a question of increasing the competence level of those 38,000 people to a level at which they could do more with the language.</p><p> As for small company exemptions, obviously they will be introduced this year with the Companies Act on the audit side, while the accountancy directive will have measures on the audit side.  However, if we were to dilute labour rights for companies below a certain size, the Government would rightly be excoriated for so doing by Deputies Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, John Lyons and others.  There are some rights one cannot reduce by virtue of a company being small.  It is difficult to identify measures if they are related to a company's size - audit being a good example - but if there are practical examples from the French, I would certainly be open to considering them.  There is a limited amount of crowdfunding, an issue on which a group from the Departments of Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation - the SME State bodies group - is working.  I must obtain a report for the Senator on the progress it has made.  Nothing made it this year into the legislative programme and while some would like to see tax advantages, they did not make the cut.  However, it is certainly an idea to which we can be open.  In other countries it is a small but interesting area.  While it is not massive, it is one we definitely must keep in mind.</p><p> The question of upward-only rent reviews comes down to constitutional change.  Were one to cut the rent paid to people who might themselves have debts, it is clear one would have to compensate them.  With all of the other obligations taxpayers are trying to meet, taking up the slack for high rents simply has not been affordable.  The Government has looked to the market to adjust and while I accept that it has not always adjusted, there has also been a good deal of progress in this regard.  </p><p> I believe those are the issues which were raised.</p></speech>

Everybody has talked about the recent development by Apple, but we must also examine the role of the county council through the county development plan.  My colleague from Athenry, Councillor Peter Feeney, very much led the concept of the Athenry-Oranmore economic corridor which he pushed as part of the county development plan.  It is a region that is well served by motorway infrastructure, including the M6 to Dublin and the planned Cork to Tuam motorway which is under construction and will be very important in terms of job creation and future investment.  The area is also well served by a 220 kV power line.  It should be acknowledged that the county council was to the fore in pushing the concept of the strategic corridor.  Not everything comes from the Government and the local authorities have a very important role to play.</p><p> Broadband has been mentioned and is part of the plan to be put out to tender.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, has laid out the plan which must be pushed to ensure it will happen.  We have had so many launches of broadband strategies in recent years by successive Governments that there is an element of disbelief that this will happen.  The previous national broadband plan did not work.  While it looked good on paper and we debated it at county council level, it did not deliver proper broadband infrastructure to the most rural regions.  The new plan must deliver; it must be rolled out, must be real and ensure rural areas receive a proper service.  The Government must obtain permission from the Commission regarding EU state aid rules and the plan needs to be pushed to ensure it will happen quickly.</p><p> Does the Minister envisage any role for credit unions or will the strategic bank be sufficient in providing funding for SMEs?  This issue has been debated here previously.  Will he consider extra competition from the credit unions?  There was a pilot project in Kilkenny.  We have moved from over-reliance on the construction sector to a situation where we need to encourage house building.  We have a very comprehensive Government plan on social housing and acknowledge the creation of more than 7,000 construction sector jobs in 2014 and the plans the Minister is preparing on the reduction of the social and affordable housing requirement to 10%, with the stipulation that the houses will actually have to be provided and that there will be no cash buy-out in lieu of responsibilities.  Given that lending to developers is not an easy or popular concept, how will they obtain finance?  Not everybody can decide in the morning to become a developer.  Not everybody has the wherewithal, capability, knowledge and confidence to apply for planning permission and build 30 to 100 houses.  Previously, developers would have funded new developments from the proceeds of the sale of existing developments and by borrowing.  Does the Minister envisage any issue regarding having enough builders interested in building and being able to secure finance to fund projects?</p><p> I have consulted senior people in Galway regarding software engineers and there seems to be a worldwide shortage and an inability on the part of universities to provide places and produce graduates.  Perhaps the standard of mathematics is too high.  This issue must be examined.  People may need to be directed, pushed, advised or incentivised to move into the area.</p><p>I look forward to the regional plans.  An area like mine obviously has both strengths and weaknesses.  The Government has targeted tourism in Connemara through the Wild Atlantic Way and the greenways, and the cuts to the travel tax and VAT have incentivised tourism development more widely.  In Galway city and its outskirts, we have been fortunate to attract foreign direct investment which has been hugely beneficial this year and in previous years.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA have helped Galway to attract investment but it is also clearly a popular destination because it has the infrastructure and critical mass of population.  We have also seen the beneficial impact of clustering on the region.  I commend the Minister, his Department and the relevant statutory bodies for their work in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015031000002#U00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the support he has shown for the regional strategy.  He correctly noted that bigger infrastructural players are also important to the development of the regions.  We see the regional enterprise strategy as an annual strategy which drives enterprise capabilities but also offers opportunities to incorporate regional strategies into longer term infrastructural planning on the part of councils.  We want to ensure enterprise priorities are part of the regional thinking of local authorities and the system of regional governance when it comes to infrastructure planning.  In the short term we are working with what we have but in the longer term we will be able to make an input into deciding what infrastructure might be usefully developed.  I recognise the work that the council has done in respect of the strategic corridor.  One of the lessons of the Athenry example is that by working with the IDA and giving some thought to infrastructure, property and other types of solutions, we can strengthen the capacity of our regions.  We want to see more people working to the same set of objectives in order to deliver wins in the regions.  I was surprised at the disconnect that had developed in some cases between agencies and other stakeholders in the regions.  This will bring the stakeholders together in a very tangible way, while also oiling the relationship with funds which they can jointly compete to deliver.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the challenge and importance of broadband.  In terms of providing the last 30% with decent bandwidth, we are looking at covering 96% of the land area of the island to reach that 30%.  The first 4% got 70% and the remaining 96% gets the other 30%.  That is indicative of the scale of the challenge of delivering the network but it is crucial none the less.</p> <p>  We envisage that credit unions can be players in the loan guarantee scheme.  Other issues of a regulatory nature have curtailed them at times, however.  I understand that last week the Department of Finance attempted to introduce a matchmaker arrangement between developers, equity providers and bankers.  It is some mixture of mezzanine finance, lending and equity.  Developers probably got used to the model of 100% lending, which is gone forever.  This matchmaking reflects an attempt to develop new models.  I have not heard a report on the success or otherwise of the initiative.</p><p>There are players in this field, but we must match them with the sites that can be developed.  It is regarded as a high priority and I hope it will prove to be a successful model.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has introduced other instruments via the planning Acts, for example, applying flexibility in development charges to existing as well as new permissions.</p><p> There is a worldwide shortage of software engineers.  We have set a target in this year's plan to increase the output of ICT graduates by 60% by 2018.  This is one of the areas in which industry, universities and other institutes of education have collaborated well.  They have good Springboard and graduate programmes in place and there has been good work experience and cross-fertilisation in the sector via the education network.  However, even this ambition is not enough.  In 2011, 45% of needs were met domestically.  By 2018, we plan for this figure to be 75%.  We are pushing up the percentage, but we are chasing a moving target that is growing larger.</p><p> The Deputy is right, in that more work is necessary on the choices people make in their careers.  The extra points for mathematics led to a 70% increase in the number opting to take honours maths.  We should start considering whether we could include other incentives, financial or otherwise, to encourage people to take courses that would undoubtedly fuel a great deal of growth in new sectors.  Some work is being done on the impact of the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  I am looking forward to meeting the team working on that project and gaining an understanding of the constraints on the HEA.  Moving from one type of education to another quickly is difficult, but we must find ways to meet skill needs.  I agree with the Deputy in that respect.</p></speech>

There is an inherent problem in terms of attitudes towards foreign direct investment and indigenous industry.  We have had considerable success in developing indigenous industry, creating jobs and so on and it should be made clear to the rest of the world that this is as important as encouraging foreign direct investment.  Since the 1950s, it has been the "sexy" bit.</p> <p>  We must encourage more entrepreneurs.  We know from studies that early stage businesses create the most jobs.  There is some scepticism in Departments in that they do not trust entrepreneurs.  I do not want present company to take this personally, but when it comes to social welfare, maternity leave and so on, the employer or self-employed person has stricter rules applied to him or her as if he or she is up to something in claiming maternity benefit.  As such, there is a major job to be done in the social welfare system.  The fact that starting a business or being self-employed is a demanding way of life is ignored.  Businesses cannot survive otherwise; it is not a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job.  A string of penalties are applied to the self-employed but not to their employees.</p><p>We have to sort that out fast and get the message out that we want more business start-ups.  We are doing the rapporteur study, the Chair has initiated the study on women entrepreneurs from this committee.  It will highlight these points as we go along.  The big, sexy companies like Glanbia are brilliant when they are expanding but they all started out small.  I would like to see the Minister saying via megaphone that it is important to Ireland to develop our own indigenous companies, although we are delighted to have foreign direct investment and the 12.5% corporation tax rate is brilliant.  We are standing on our heads to get them to come. </p><p> Regarding the self-employed, the Minister knows as well as I do that there are brakes on people from a social welfare point of view.  The taxation system should be there to encourage more entrepreneurs.  I must repeat that there is a negative attitude towards self-employed people in the Department.  I am not being personal, there are very good people here, but others definitely feel the self-employed are up to something and do not trust them.  It is a cultural thing and we have to get over it.  When I was a teenager, to go into business or trade was seen as the pits, God almighty.  It took us a good while to cop on that we needed it.  It is still very much the attitude within the bureaucracy that they are up to something.  </p><p> What can we say about indigenous industry?  We want more Irish people whom we believe in and trust.  How do we encourage them from a tax point of view?  It is an even greater problem now, as the economy is turning, that people want to go and get good jobs in Google, Facebook and the likes.  I was discussing it with my colleague, Connie Doody, who set up Lir Chocolates with me.  She was wondering how involved in our society people working big jobs on big salaries in multi-nationals are.  Are they so well paid and looked after?  From my observation here in Leinster House, the management of people in the public sector does not seem to take account of the person.  If someone goes into Google or something like that, management is going to be training them for the job, watching them develop.  They need employees to do that.  What is happening with the human person who comes in the door into the public sector?  Are they encouraged to develop their career?  Are they put into the job where they have the appropriate skill?  We cannot afford to have a square peg in a round hole in private business.  There is great potential for entrepreneurship in the public sector as well.  We have had numerous examples of that and need more.  </p><p> I congratulate the Minister on what he has done, although he dodged the emigration question a bit.  I have been on to the Central Statistics Office trying to get the exact figures and we only have them up to April 2014.  There are 1,600 people emigrating per week, 800 Irish and 800 non-Irish.  Very few of them are coming back.  The Taoiseach said last week that emigration has a devastating impact on our economy as we lose the input of people of talent and energy.</p><p>Finally, I will turn to the sidekick of the TILDA study in Trinity, in which the ESRI is looking at the effect of emigration on older parents and particularly the mothers, who see their children going off.  It affects older people in particular to see their children going off and not wanting to come back.  It affects their mental health and their happiness.  Given all the ambition they had and sacrifices they made to send their children to university and to third level colleges, that must hurt.  As the report says, it affects people's mental health and this leads to physical decline.  We talk about the ones who emigrate, but what about the ones who are left at home, whose children have gone off?  I presume emigration has decreased somewhat, but the official figures are still 1,600 a week.</p></speech>

The gross increase considerably exceeds that of the IDA.  We are seeing a new pattern evolve in what the Germans would call Mittelstand companies.  Enterprise Ireland has played a significant role in that, developing the leadership for growth programme, which the Senator knows about.

They are globally ambitious now.  Combilift is a good case.  It recently committed to a greenfield site and will increase its numbers by 200.  We are seeing more and more of those companies.  That is part of it.  The other part of it, as the Senator rightly says, is start-ups.  To be fair to my Department, 70% of our money goes to Irish businesses and 30% to foreign ones, so far and away the majority of our money goes to small start-ups, growth phasing, and scaling.  To listen to the announcements, one might not think that was the ratio, but much of what we have done in the last while is aimed at start-ups.  The tax relief available to start-ups has now been extended to all sectors.  We are unique in Ireland in having competitive feasibility, competitive start, high-potential start-ups and equity investment from the State.  One will not find that anywhere in Europe.  We have 26 incubators in every institute of technology; we have the local enterprise network in 31 counties; we are reviewing the mentoring programmes; we have stripped out company law to make it much easier to set up a company, so that those start-ups have a much cleaner ability to form companies; and they have tax concessions for the first three years.  Much has been done between microfinance and the young entrepreneurs competition last year, which received a staggering 1,100 responses.  There is a great deal happening and people are seeing that Ireland is a good place to start a business but maybe it is too well-kept a secret and we should be promoting it more within-----</p></speech>

It is an educational process.  It is about letting people see that to try and to fail is not the end of the world and getting more serial entrepreneurs.  We also want to see more people supporting entrepreneurship in their own communities.  I do not think official Ireland has some downer on the self-employed or small employers, but I take the Senator's point that we need to make that interaction, while absolutely legitimate, easier to do.</p><p>Our interactions, including the time it takes to get a work permit, the time it takes to get an employment case heard and the time it takes to form a company, are improving all the time.  Within my Department I have set the expectation that we will continually improve those metrics because they are the key to the interface with small companies or those that might be forming.</p><p> I believe the Senator is looking at the gross figure for emigration and she needs to look at the net figure.  There are always people who come and go, but the net figure, which hit a high of 35,000, is on the way down now; it was 21,000 at the last time it was recorded.  The net flows are moderating, which is in accordance with us creating employment.  The figures were at their peak when there was zero or negative jobs growth.  Now as we see employment grow, they are coming down.  The only way to get them down to zero is to have better employment growth and more opportunities at home.</p><p> The Senator raised a much bigger issue of developing talent in the public service.  I would say the Secretary General would be better equipped to answer that.  It has certainly been a difficult time in the public service.  There have not been promotion opportunities and it has been very bottled up, which has an impact.  However, to be fair there has been an extraordinary entrepreneurial spirit, if one wants to call it that, in being willing to change systems.  That is happening throughout.  I see it in my Department, with all the agencies we have merged.  We have changed working relationships across the board.  It is there in both the public and private sector.  It perhaps is not acknowledged as much as it should be in the public service.</p><p> Today, on the day that is in it, we should acknowledge the success of Pfizer, which has undergone an extraordinary adjustment.  I know the unions, SIPTU and TEEU, have been very influential in getting a deal across the line that has allowed those jobs to be secured in Cork.  It is a fantastic indication that people with their backs to the wall have been flexible, whether they have been in the public or private sector.  That has been one of the success stories of this very difficult time, indicating that people have had the ingenuity to solve difficult problems.</p><p> I am reminded of the former Senator, Mr. Joe Lee.  I am not sure if members have read his book.  He used to say all we wanted was a safe job in the public service, a bit of land or a job in the bank and that was the height of our expectations or ambition.  We now have a very different generation who regard entrepreneurship as natural.  They have the self-confidence that goes with that.  I hope the policies we are putting in place will build on that.</p></speech>

Has a date been set for the launch of the midlands one, in which I am obviously very interested?</p> <p>  On the talent bank and the national skills strategy, Senator White referred to the report on women in entrepreneurship.  She gave me credit for initiating it, but in fact she initiated it and I supported her in it.  A witness who appeared before the committee talked about the importance of salesmanship in everything that is happening here at the moment.  She was very clear that it is not necessary to be the expert in order to get a company up and running.  Someone with the skills and talent to get the company going can bring in what is needed.  She made the point about salesmanship.  The Minister referred to sales and language.  I ask him to comment on whether we should focus more on it.</p> <p>  I attended the launch of the Startup Gathering last week.  It is a tremendous initiative and I hope it will be very successful.  What outcomes does the Minister expect from that through the Action Plan for Jobs?</p> <p>  Regarding what Senator White was saying about the Enterprise Ireland funding, is it possible for us to get details on the amount of investment in companies on a county-by-county basis?  I recently came across a document indicating that more than 400 jobs had been created in County Offaly, which I represent, through Enterprise Ireland investment.  I thought that was a fantastic figure but nobody is really talking about it, whereas if there was an FDI announcement of 30 jobs, it would be all over the newspapers.</p><p>Sometimes we do not recognise our own talent.  These are the people who are working on the ground and developing, over decades perhaps, outstanding companies and who are aided and abetted by the State agencies and the Departments.  From that perspective, it would be good for us to come up with some idea of, first, how we can get the word out about the outstanding indigenous companies we already have across the country and, second, how to reach out to others which might need a little more support.  The Government has already done this in a way through the website<i>actionplanforjobs.ie</i>.  This is a great idea as it brings together all the supports available to start-ups.  <br/><br/>I have also heard comment on local employment offices, LEOs, and whether a consistent approach across the country is being applied or whether they are being left to their own devices with different budgets and emphases in different areas.  It might be possible to clarify that.  Finally, there is a question about the CEDRA report and how this fits in.  There are some great recommendations in the report such as on rural economic development zones.  Some counties have already been proactive on this.  How will that report feed in so that we can see results very quickly?  Marrying the regional strategy and the CEDRA report may be the blueprint for getting action into the regions very quickly. </p></speech>

It is at the front of the queue.  However, we want it to be the best it can be.  We are therefore not rushing it out too quickly.  We want to ensure whatever we have learnt is applied.  The national talent drive is crucial.  With the establishment of the education and training boards, a big priority for this year is the engagement of both them and the higher education institutes with enterprise, and to improve their interplay.  The jury is out on how successful this is.  We had the apprenticeship call.  I hope it is successful.  We need to see more engagement by enterprise with our education system.  There probably has been faults on both sides.  The education and training system may have got a little detached and employers probably could not afford to maintain traineeships and apprenticeships.  This bridge needs to be rebuilt.  Rebuilding this bridge is a big issue and the Minister of State, Deputy English, is committed to it.</p> <p>  On salesmanship, Mr. Fitzgerald tells me that we have a call out for Springboard courses to help firms sell internationally and to develop related skills.  This would be in the second quarter of this year.  I agree that we are great at marketing but not at selling.  Ultimately, people have to sell our products.  We have undervalued this skill.  We may look to go back to the well again next year in this area because it is probably underdeveloped.  </p> <p> The Start-up Gathering, at this stage, is modelled somewhat on the tourism initiative, The Gathering, except it is sectorally driven.  Five sectors and five cities have been identified as well as the sort of programmes to be run.  The initiative has a call out.  The KPI, key performance indicator, if one wishes to call it that will depend on the quality of the call.  Eoin Costello is very enthusiastic and he has a very good committee.  We have put some money in and he has good sponsors behind him.  It is something we should be doing to get the message out, not only internationally but at home, that start-ups are a part of what we are.  It should be part of our DNA.  The initiative, which dovetails with our implementation of the enterprise strategy, will have an impact.  We discussed at our ministerial board how we can get more recognition for this kind of Irish based initiative.  We are looking at how we could do it and we will revert to the committee on that.</p><p>I wish to thank members of the committee for their support for <i>actionplanforjobs.ie</i>.  At every meeting I attend, I am struck by the small percentage of people who really understand what is out there for them.  Some 90% have said they do not fully understand what is available and they want more information, so we are trying to make that easier. <br/><br/>We want to make local enterprise offices more consistent and every one of them will have to submit a plan that will be vetted by the centre of excellence in Enterprise Ireland.  They are under a service level agreement and we will be seeking a consistency of approach.  We also want to promote some innovation so we will be having a competitive call.  In that way, those with good ideas who are showing ambition and innovation in partnering in their county, will win more resources.  We hope the combination of consistency plus some incentive to do new things will be a successful approach.  <br/><br/>The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, will shortly be making an announcement on the Leader programme which is an element of it, as are the rural enterprise development zones.  Members of the committee should therefore direct such questions to her Department, rather than mine.  I hope that what we are doing at regional level will dovetail with some of these initiatives, even though we have a stricter focus on building enterprise start-ups.</p></speech>

This is the beginning of a very important process.  We have given ourselves a significant and important task, to set up an electoral commission in Ireland.</p><p>I will be brief in my opening remarks because I would be better off hearing from the members of the committee and starting the process of engagement.  That would create more value from the time we have.</p><p> On 27 January last, I stood with the Chairman of this committee on the steps of Leinster House to announce the publication of the consultation paper on the establishment of an electoral commission in Ireland.  I said then, and have repeated many times since this is an issue of the highest priority.  I feel passionately about it because the establishment of such a commission is long overdue.  I am here to listen to the views of committee members as parliamentarians and as practitioners with expertise in how the current system works.  To be frank and to be fair, there is not necessarily a right and wrong answer to many of the issues here.  It is about fermenting the collective view of all of us about how we should proceed, what we should proceed with and exactly what we are defining.  We have to leave our political affiliations outside the door on this issue.  This is about democracy and about elections, which are the ultimate tool of democracy.  It makes sense to work together to bring about the reforms we all desire and need.  There is a good and practical reason for the approach we are talking about today.</p><p> A key lesson from international experience is that significant changes in electoral governance ideally need to command broad political and public support.  Quite frankly, there would be no point in the Government driving home an electoral commission.  It would be a waste of time.  Broad political and public support is needed from across the body politic.  The people have to come with us.  We have to see measured improvements in what we are doing.  That is why everyone has to be involved in this.  For those reasons, consultation is not just desirable - it is absolutely necessary.  There is a fermenting process here.  Over a good period of time, we will constantly return to issues and re-evaluate positions.  We will need to do that.  The role of this committee is absolutely central to this process.  That is why we have gone down this route.  It is important that we build and maintain momentum in developing and implementing the necessary legislation.  Therefore, I welcome the priority the committee has given to this consultation paper.</p><p> I was in the Seanad last week to debate a Private Members' motion on the establishment of an electoral commission.  I found our good exchange of ideas and views most helpful.  Some of the Members of the Seanad who were present for that debate are here now.  I hope they will get a chance today to elaborate further on their views.  I hope those who did not get a chance to speak last week will get a chance to do so today.  It is important to hear from all members of the committee if time allows.  The consultation paper sets out 11 questions.  As the members of the committee have seen them, I do not need to read them out again.  I will summarise the significant issues that members are being asked to examine.  First, they will need to consider what functions should be assigned to an electoral commission.  Some or all of the responsibilities assigned to various bodies and office holders in the current system could be assigned to the planned new structure.  We need to learn from the good models that are in operation elsewhere and are examined in the consultation paper.</p><p> The paper also reviews earlier proposals from Oireachtas committees, political parties, research reports and a myriad of other sources.  There is a wide range of opinion on what exactly such a body should do and how it should work.  It is clear that improving the electoral register is an important driving force underpinning the desire to establish an electoral commission in Ireland.  I am sure colleagues will want to discuss this.  The register of electors is probably the single topic that is most frequently debated and is most prominent in all the reports and recommendations we have.  Most proposals see some form of centralised system of registration being managed by the new electoral commission.  For example, it could assume responsibilities from the local authorities.  One option envisages the new commission overseeing the work of local authorities, which could continue to have a role.</p><p> Most of the proposals made by other bodies to date involve the transfer of the operational responsibilities of my Department in respect of elections to the electoral commission.  I would like the committee's views on that.  I am fairly open to this.  The role that is likely to be played by the current D&aacute;il returning officers in a new configuration has been considered to a lesser extent.  What do we need to do there?  What role will there be?</p><p>We need to consider whether the electoral commission will take on the responsibilities currently performed by the Standards in Public Office Commission under the electoral Acts.  The review of electoral boundaries and the role currently performed by the Constituency Commission are also identified as potential responsibilities.  We need to do a great deal of deep thinking on this issue as the analysis shows that changes in population are going to cause issues continuously.  It may be time we looked at this in a different way.  Voter education appears commonly and prominently as a possible role.  Another issue is whether the electoral commission would have an advisory role in respect of the Minister.  I am open on this one, although I am not sure about it.  The role would need to be defined, but is there a role at all?  That is something we will have to debate.  It is not self-evident what functions should be assigned to an electoral commission or how it should work.  These are questions that we will have to answer.</p><p> Another issue is the cost of an electoral commission.  A key reason for the creation of new public bodies lies in the scope to improve cost-effectiveness and efficiency in the use of public money.  The costs associated with different aspects of the current system are set out in section 3 of the consultation paper.  I ask members to examine them in their deliberations and consider them when they come to make recommendations.  It cannot simply be assumed that economies will be achieved in setting up a new body.  This is an important point.  It cannot be assumed that just because we set up an electoral commission savings will be generated.  We do not need to look 1 million miles back into history to know this.  It is possible that net savings may not be achieved, especially if new and additional work is to be assigned to the electoral commission.  Given the scale of expenditure in administering the electoral system and the cost of setting up a new body, financial considerations must be part of the debate.  However, they are not the only part of it, but where do we draw the line?  Is it about efficiency, democracy, or economies of scale?  Of course, it is about democracy, but at what point do we say financial considerations and a more costly structure must be taken into account?</p><p> The next issue is the membership of an electoral commission.  As the consultation paper shows, electoral management bodies internationally vary in their numbers of members.  It has been observed, however, that those with large memberships are usually less effective.  Different options are considered in the consultation paper.  We could have a membership comprising various independent office holders or nominees, as we have currently with the Standards in Public Office Commission and the Constituency Commission.  We could use a different model.  A key issue is whether the commission should include members from a political background such as former Members of the Houses.  There are very different opinions on this issue and they are set out in the consultation paper.  I would really like to get the views of committee members on this point, on which I have a mixed view.  I can see why one would use former politicians and practitioners, but I can also see why people might not want them on the commission.  Whoever the members of the commission are, we need to ensure they will be selected or appointed in a manner that will seek to guarantee their independence as absolute.</p><p> Accountability, performance and audit are key and need to be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the independence of the electoral commission.  The experience in other countries points to both the desirability and necessity of having accountability mechanisms linked with democratic institutions.  These include, for example, formal reporting arrangements to a designated parliamentary committee; the identification of a specific Minister as a liaison with the electoral commission; independent audit arrangements, and the publication of documents against which performance can be assessed, including a statement of strategy, budget plan and an annual report.  Do we want to replicate similar arrangements here or do we want to do something different?</p><p> I made it clear when launching the consultation paper that the task involved a significant job of work.  From a timescale point of view, we need to do it as efficiently as possible, as well as doing it right.  That is paramount.  The establishment of an electoral commission will not take place before the next general election.  It will take a number of years to establish it.  The development of legislation is a necessary first step which we are now taking.  Before the end of this D&aacute;il, I intend to have the legislation in place.  That is what I want to commit to.  When the committee reverts with its views, I will proceed with the preparation of the heads of an electoral commission Bill and will not be found wanting in driving this work forward.  I would like to discuss timescales with the Chairman here or off-site at some point.</p><p>I will be guided by the members regarding the timescale for reverting to me.</p><p> The lessons from other countries are worth heeding.  Significant change takes time and requires planning.  It took almost four years to amalgamate the current functions of the New Zealand Electoral Commission into one body.  This was done on a phased basis between 2008 and 2012.  The transfer of the electoral register was handled as a specific phase.  Establishing the National Register of Electors in Canada took almost four years from commencement in 1993 to full implementation in 1997.  It took a further three years after implementation for the changes to bed down, and there were teething problems.</p><p> In 2008, the preliminary study on the establishment of an electoral commission, prepared by the Geary Institute in UCD on behalf of my Department, considered the phasing of the task.  It envisaged a two-stage process.  The principle of adopting a phased approach in establishing our electoral commission is consistent with practice that has worked elsewhere.  Do we need to do it here?  Is our system less complicated, more complicated or suited to phasing?  We need to make decisions on which functions are to be prioritised for inclusion within the electoral commission structure from the outset.</p><p> Having regard to the complexities involved in changing the system of voter registration, there may be a case for addressing this as a stand-alone project.  It is a question of determining whether the system of voter registration requires a separate body of work.  We will have to consider whether we need a three-phase approach rather than a two-phase approach.</p><p> There are many issues for the committee to consider and many choices to make.  This is an open process.  I must state quite clearly to all members present that it is a very open process for me.  It is not about a Government approach but about one that encompasses all views across the political sphere and, eventually, the public sphere to ensure we can put in place a process for an electoral commission is a sustainable way, setting out clear functions from the beginning.</p><p> I look forward to questions and the two-way conversation we are to have.  At some point, either today or at another time with the Vice Chairman and the Chairman, we will talk about the timeline for the committee to revert to us with its deliberations.</p></speech>

This is not about the Government driving something forward or having a defined view.  We need a general view and consensus of many of the issues we are discussion in this regard.  How we run elections into the future is fundamental to our democracy, so we need to get consensus and general agreement on all of these issues.</p></speech>

I believe the setting up of an independent commission is a great idea.  Sinn F&eacute;in would certainly support it and has been calling for such a body for a long time.  The Minister is right that this initiative is of such importance that it requires support across the political spectrum and that we need to build consensus.  It is not in anybody's interest that any shoddy or outdated practices in regard to how we run elections or referenda continue.  The independence of the body is important, but  it must be seen to be independent.  Therefore, how members are appointed to it is a crucial issue.</p> <p>  I am inclined to agree with the Minister in regard to the size of the body.  The international research referred to shows that if a committee is too big and unwieldy, it does not work.  At the same time, it is important to ensure a balance of the necessary level of expertise.</p> <p>  I have raised the issue of the register of electors many times, particularly with the Minister's predecessor.  We have huge concerns about the register. We sought reform of the register in the North and at the time, the Establishment and media raised stories about impersonation and the like.  The register was reformed and there is now a better system in place.  This was great for Sinn F&eacute;in, because reform stopped impersonation by other parties and our share of the vote rose immediately in the following election.  This was a good outcome for Sinn F&eacute;in, but also a good outcome for democracy.  Currently, we have people register twice or thrice, which is not right.  Other people are missing from the register.  I know it is up to each citizen to ensure he or she is registered.  The current register of electors will only work if all citizens over 18 are convinced they should be actively involved and should check the register every November to ensure they are on the draft register for the coming year.  If they notice a duplication of their name on the register, they should notify the local authority.  We must move away from the current approach.</p> <p>  In the past, I have suggested the use of PPS numbers for registration, but I am aware there are issues in that regard because there are more PPS numbers than people.  The Minister's predecessor told me one day that we had close to 7 million PPS numbers, far in excess of the number of people living in the State.  The huge number of PPS numbers can be accounted for by emigration, immigrants returning to their countries and various other reasons.  We need to look at other models and to take a new approach.</p><p> Regardless of what we do about an electoral commission, the register of electors is something that has bugged me over the last number of years.  I used to get very annoyed when people who have been on the register for a number of years and are getting on in years and who, when an election was called and they went to vote, found that they were not on the register for whatever reason, even though they had not moved house.  I have seen people going through that experience.  Tying it to an address does not work.  We must tie it to the person.  The entitlement to vote must be tied to every person when they reach the age of 18 years, and we must find a mechanism to do that.  I am not convinced as to how we can do it at this point, but our party is open to finding a better way of doing it.</p><p> That brings me to the timeline.  We must separate the different tasks.  The register of electors is the most important issue to be addressed.  It is very hard to get it right.  Consider the fact that there are far fewer councillors now.  Whether we like it or not, councillors played a role in ensuring that the register of electors was correct.  That was particularly so with town councils, where there is a great deal of mobility with people moving about.  Town councillors would make it their business to know who was registered in a street, or if somebody in the street was registered twice they would not be long in bringing it to the attention of the local authority officials.  There were scandalous incidents.  In a recent election, 28 people in one house were registered.  There was terrible things like that happening.</p><p> This is of great importance.  At best, I reckon the register is 80% accurate.  That 80% accuracy must be seen in the context of court cases having been held over one vote.  We have seen that.  In my county, County Laois, there was a court case over one vote.  It involved a Labour Party candidate and a Fine Gael candidate.  I believe the Fine Gael candidate ended up with the vote and the late Larry Kavanagh lost out.  That is too important to be left as it is.  It is something we should have started working on last year.</p><p> With regard to the Seanad, the Government lost the referendum on its abolition.  My party would have abolished it in its current form, but we want to have a reformed Seanad.  Obviously, how people get there and what their task will be when they get there are of crucial importance, but how to get there is the big issue.  The election system for the Seanad is archaic and must be dealt with.  The panels bear no resemblance to the Ireland of today.  I am not saying there should not be sectoral panels, as they serve a purpose, but we must examine the ones we have and how people are nominated onto them.</p><p> I will conclude on the boundaries and the boundary commission.  Yes, they possibly could be amalgamated.  The Minister's house is now in the Offaly constituency, or very near it.  If not, the constituency is getting close to his back yard.</p></speech>

It was separated into two three-seat constituencies.  I know the reason is the 30,000 limit and so forth.  County Laois now has a part of south Kildare with it.  There are now two three-seat constituencies.  We should try to have similar sized constituencies throughout the State, in so far as we can do that.  It is very arbitrary that a constituency should suddenly go from five seats to three seats.  There is also the situation with the Sligo-Leitrim-Cavan-and wherever else constituency.  There are four counties included in that constituency.</p><p>That does not sit right.</p><p> There is also the issue of how the local authority boundaries link in with D&aacute;il constituencies.  It may not always be possible to tie the two together and to base D&aacute;il constituency boundaries on local authority ones but we should try to do so as much as possible.  People elected to the new constituency covering Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Donegal will have to deal with four joint policing committees, four county managers, four sets of lobby groups at local authority level and four sets of local councillors.  Unless they fly around by helicopter, it will be very difficult for them to represent that constituency properly.  In so far as we can, we should try to watch the county boundaries, although it will not always be possible, and local authority electoral areas.</p><p> We should try to have similar sized constituencies and have five seat or six seat constituencies.  The Minister would not argue with that the next time around because it would suit his party and it would probably suit us.  I would not mind about Fine Gael, it would have three seat constituencies if it had its way.</p></speech>

It is imperative the Government honours its commitment to set up an electoral commission to safeguard electoral integrity and to provide an independent, well-structured and staffed office to oversee certain aspects of election functions.  As the previous speaker said, Ireland's electoral register is patently incapable of being updated and maintained within the existing structure.  It comes into focus at election time when we see the number of errors.  In one election, there was somewhere in the region of 8,000 errors in the electoral register.  That needs to be addressed to bring greater integrity to the quality of the register.</p> <p>  Setting up an independent electoral commission is urgent.  It was promised in the past but was never delivered.  There is need for a single body, similar to that in Northern Ireland which Deputy Stanley mentioned, to foster public confidence in the whole democratic process.</p> <p>  We all remember what happened with the e-voting machines in 2004.  Approximately &euro;54 million was squandered and 7,500 machines became obsolete.  We do not want that to happen again.</p><p>I hope it will not happen. </p></speech>

I presume the commission will be totally independent of Departments, etc., and will have its own staff independent of Government as well.</p> <p>  The local authorities located throughout the country have done their best to maintain the register but its care is not within their remit.  The task has placed an undue burden on resources and staff, particularly in smaller local authorities and where the rate base is very low as in counties Leitrim and Longford.  Local authorities do not have the staff to compile the register.  This matter should be looked at on a roll-on basis rather than having a new register every year.  I hope that will be a function of the new commission.</p> <p>  The register has been woefully neglected.  Has the Minister looked at the electoral system used in Northern Ireland?  It was introduced 30 years ago and has proved successful.  In that jurisdiction there is an onus on people to register and for young people to register a year before they are due to vote.  There has been an uptake of between 80% and 90% in Northern Ireland.  A cost may be involved.  Does the Minister know how much it would cost to set up an electoral office in the Republic?  I would like to know how much this whole exercise will cost.  </p> <p>  E-voting was very contentious in this country and was introduced by the previous Government.  Is there a proposal to return to e-voting?  The initiative has worked successfully in Australia and other countries in the southern hemisphere.  Have we looked at their systems and at how they work?  I have been told that Australia is leading the way as a model of good practice for an e-voting system.  Will compulsory voting be introduced in this country at some future date?  It has been introduced in some parts of the world.  It is important, going forward, that we foster integrity and public confidence in a new system.  </p> <p>  I have outlined a few issues.  I am sure everyone will have an opportunity to make a submission on the establishment of an electoral commission.  For a long time I have felt that we needed a single body to improve the current electoral system.  I hope that when the new system is introduced it will comprise a rolling register because it makes no sense to start the register from scratch every year.  The reason people who have been on a register for 50 or 60 years have often found themselves omitted from voting when they arrive at a polling booth is because the current system starts from scratch each year. </p> <p>  Does the Minister envisage that the electoral commission will take over control of electoral expenditure from the Standards in Public Office Commission?  Will the new electoral commission take over the function?  There is a body in place to do such work at present.  Will the electoral commission be given responsibility for such a task?  Will it be given responsibility to examine electoral spending issues?  Such matters are currently addressed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015031000002#K00100"><p>Does the Minister agree that a meaningful reform programme relating to the electoral system and the Oireachtas should go hand in hand with the evolution of the electoral commission?  It is clear that they must interact and most people agree that we do not have a reform programme currently.  As a Senator, I was bewildered that the only idea, which I did not consider to be meaningful, that the Government had was a referendum to abolish one of the Houses of Parliament.  That came as a surprise to many people given, at the same time, the D&aacute;il virtually remained unchanged.  The list of what are cited as reforms is minimalist and we have to go back to the drawing board again.  Many areas need to considered for radical reform.</p> <p>  The electoral process is the responsibility of several Departments and agencies and 31 local authorities and it is clear that it is not fit for purpose.  This major issue needs to be examined.  I fully agree with the Minister's comment that reform should be based on a consensus among all political parties because of the very nature of what is involved and because of how fragile the democratic process can be at times.  The electoral registers that existed years ago were based on information provided by rate collectors and they missed very few people back then.  We were happy with the electoral register but nowadays the names of people who left the country years ago and so on are to be found on it and, therefore, we have a messy registration system.  That plays into the results at elections and there is an urgency about this matter.</p> <p>  The Minister invited the committee to make recommendations.  How broad will the consultative process be and how far will it go?  A timetable is vital for this.  There is a feeling that kicking this to touch is the way go, and this has applied to all governments, but that is wrong.  We have to be serious about a definite timetable as to how this will be done.  Constituencies and counties have been cannibalised.  One only has to go to the local pub and speak to someone to realise how confused people have become.  Deputy Stanley had to check, for instance, where Offaly starts and Tipperary ends.  That is the case throughout the country.  I do not question the Constituency Commission because it had exceptionally good people on it but its recommendations have not appealed to people on the ground.  They build up loyalty to their counties and constituencies but when out of the blue, the commission proposes changes, the county loyalty is gone.  I do not have answers to this but a root and branch examination of how these decisions come about how they fit in with the democratic process is needed.</p><p>Perhaps answers are immediately available, but the man and woman in the street certainly require definite answers as to why this is happening.</p><p> It is important to look at how business is conducted, which is why I state reform and the idea of an electrical commission must go hand in hand.  Nobody in the Oireachtas feels happy with the amount of material which must be examined and digested to ensure it leads to what is best for the democratic system.  This may be an internal issue within the Civil Service or the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Anybody looking at it for the first time would certainly feel it needs to be examined to see whether it is working.  In my younger days I worked in a county council, and I remember experts being brought in to measure output.  They monitored the work to the level of measuring how long it took to walk between a desk and a filing cabinet.  The same happened with the workers on the roads; their work was measured and a bonus scheme was provided.  This was done in a fundamental way at that level of administration.  Here, at the pinnacle of government responsibility, it needs to be examined also.  The Minister gently shook his head when I suggested there was not really any great reform taking place.  We should measure this reform and outline it.</p><p> To return to consultation, the people with whom we must consult include those who have the vote.  If we do not get the timetable right there will be no electoral commission and we will continue with multifaceted involvement in the electoral process from Departments, agencies and local authorities.</p><p> Nobody is fully certain that the manner in which the count system takes place is above question.  It needs to be examined.  We have seen cases where questions have been asked.  If the issue exists now it existed 20 or 30 years ago also.  I do not recommend this, but rather than pushing it to the backburner again would it be possible to take a piecemeal approach?  Could the question of the register be looked at immediately?  Could the accounting system and the transfer of votes be examined immediately?  Could defining the constituencies be revisited without waiting?  Does the Minister feel this is a five, ten or 15 year process?  He will not see it in the life of the present Oireachtas, but does he envisage it definitely happening in the life of the next Oireachtas?</p></speech>

On average, 40% of those on the electoral register, four out of ten people, do not exercise their democratic right.</p><p>In fact, the figure has gone above four out of ten in recent years.  This is an issue that must be addressed.  I am aware of families where neither parent has ever exercised his or her vote.  We should consider putting in place a mechanism, as some other countries have, for removing persons from the electoral register who do not avail of their vote on two or three occasions.  It is wrong not to exercise one's right to vote.  On the other hand, there are cases where people who have left home to live abroad and rear their families, in the United State, London, Glasgow and many other places, but opt to remain on the electoral register.  When I questioned one such family about it, the reason I was given was that they come home on holiday for two or three weeks every year and if that holiday coincides with an election, they wish to be able to vote.  That is not right.</p><p> Other speakers referred to the importance of maintaining proper voting records.  When one presents at a polling station, one's name is crossed out on the register and, at the end of the day, it is possible to tot up the number of registered persons who actually voted.  An electronic record should be kept of the names of those who exercise their vote.  On one occasion I attended a hearing on applications to be included on the supplementary register and I happened to ask the official whether one particular applicant was a tall, curly-haired man.  When this was confirmed, it became clear that the same man was on different registers in the one town and was voting at polling stations across the road from each other on the same day.  Deputy Bannon referred to the situation in Northern Ireland.  I overheard a conversation in a club six or seven years ago which revealed that the same individual to whom I just referred had voted 11 times at polling stations across the Border.  I assure colleagues that he was not voting for Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  It seems he went around all day, from Newry to Ballymena, casting his 11 votes and taking pride in doing so.  The system is not right on the other side of the Border, no more than it is here.  People must take responsibility in this matter, but it is also paramount that we eliminate possible abuses, whether by way of PPS numbers or some other means.  That must be given serious consideration.  If such abuses have gone on in the past, they will continue into the future.</p><p> Having listened to the Minister speaking in the Seanad, it is clear he is passionate about reform.  I wish him well in the task and hope it will not take four years to complete the process.</p></speech>

I take the point as to whether we should be seeking evolution or revolution.  It is true that one may achieve revolution by doing things by degrees and producing a revolutionary change over time.  That is possibly the way it will go in practical terms.  An electoral commission will be an important part of political and institutional reform.  We would all start with the electoral register because it is so much the obvious place to start.  When domestic rates were in place, there was a direct relationship with voters, with calls being made to their doors on a regular basis.  There was a rationale at that time for keeping the register up to date and it was known who was living in all the houses in a particular area.  That relationship no longer exists and I doubt it will exist for any service in the future because so much is now done online.</p><p>Positioning it with the local authorities might not necessarily lead to the greatest of results.  It is the obvious place to put it, particularly in the context of where people are located.  Perhaps it might be possible to analyse what happens on a daily basis or in the context of the review of the electoral register.  There are different practices in different places.  For example, the county in which I live has a very high transient rate because Maynooth College is located there.  This might not be the case in other places, which may have more stable populations.  Different circumstances may obtain at various locations.  I am of the view that a rolling register is absolutely the way to go.</p><p> People tend to miss cut-off dates.  In that context, there could be a great deal more engagement in the context of allowing people to register online.  I accept that there is a need to authenticate any information which is provided online but an auditing process could be put in place to facilitate that to which I refer.  People now do a great deal more of their business online and I am of the view that real possibilities exist in this regard.  I take the point to the effect that it is not necessarily about saving money but rather about doing things differently and achieving better outcomes.</p><p> If that which is proposed is going to represent an evolution and if it is going to be done in a sequential way, it would be useful to map out the range it should cover.  There is a tendency to tick boxes and to state that something has been done when only 50% of the work has been completed and when there is a need to go significantly further.  One of the absolute basic principles of any electoral commission is that it should be independent.  Regardless of how it is done, putting in place a rolling register will very much depend on the mechanisms that will be available.  Norway has been working on its system for the past 20 years and people there are able to do a great deal online.  The collaborative approach taken in Norway has given rise to massive administrative savings.  I suspect that we could work towards adopting such a model here.  People in Ireland can already access Revenue's online service, which is very good.  There are serious possibilities in terms of the online option.</p><p> An issue of concern is that which relates to the Standards in Public Office Commission and the fact that it does not always have the ability to carry out particular functions in the way it would like.  We know, for example, that there are spending limits which apply at election time.  I am aware of a number of people who have exceeded those limits - sometimes by quite a distance - at every election since they were introduced.  We all exceed the limits and it is quite difficult for the powers that be to monitor what goes on at election time.  There is no point in setting standards if people can bypass them without any real sanction being applied.  It is necessary for audits to be carried out in order for behaviour such as that to which I refer to be detected.  The people who are more likely to carry out such audits - or who have the ability to carry them out - are those who are already busy during election campaigns.  Perhaps audits should be performed during elections but people must have the wherewithal to carry them out in circumstances where valid complaints are made.  It should not be down to, for example, an opposing candidate to make a complaint.</p><p> The limits to which I refer were put in place for a very good reason.  They are generous and a great deal of money is wasted during election campaigns.  As a result, there should not be any necessity for people to exceed them.  If they are exceeded, then we must ask from where the money involved is coming, consider the question of influence, etc.  These are the very matters with which the Minister is trying to deal.</p><p>I would like some thought put into that element and how the Minister would fund it.  I may well make a submission on it.</p><p> In regard to electoral funding spending, the Leaders' allowance, now the parliamentary standard allowance for Independents has been included in the remit of the Standards in Public Office Commission, an issue on which I had argued on many occasions.  All of that funding should be properly scrutinised and the electoral funding should be part of it.  For example, 17% of the current D&aacute;il is made up of Independents.  If there were no Independents, the electoral funding pot would be the same.  However, it is not reduced by 17% by virtue of the fact that the D&aacute;il is made up of 17% Independents.  It may well be that money could be better used.  When people talk about turnout at elections, part of that has to do with people seeing a relationship between voting and outcomes.  There is a role for independent education, so to speak.  It is fine in secondary school but when people actually get the vote it is of more value to them.  I would like to see some funding made available to an independent body for the purpose of public engagement on the value of voting.  I do not think I have ever come out of an election campaign where people have not asked if they have used their vote correctly.  That is the kind of thing people say.</p><p> The single transferable vote is very easy to use but people tend to think it is more complicated because it is complicated to count.  We all know this.  Even in this there is a role for an independent body to have an ongoing programme of education in place.  There are obvious issues such as the referenda and how to administer them.  Sometimes there can be criticism of, say, the McKenna judgment where it is felt there is an imbalance in terms of the strength of public opinion.  There may well be merit in looking at this.  An independent commission would have a level of authority by virtue of the fact that it is independent.  I definitely think we are all on the one page in regard to actual register about the roll programme.  That is the obvious first step.  It would be useful to agree on what other elements should be examined so that it is not something that is concluded and the view is that the work is done.  There is much more to be done and it needs to quite ambitious.  The point I am making is that it is for the next Government to pick up where this one leaves off.  </p><p> There are some very serious academics on the stakeholder paper.  We probably underuse some of the academics in developing policy.  Every one of those is serious in his or her own right.  I would hope we would continue to look at best practice in other countries to see whether we can evolve into a political system where people will come and look at us, rather than us going to look at them.  That is possible but it has to be ambitious.</p></speech>

Surely that is the first thing we should try to address, as well as the quesstion of scrutiny.  This is a big effort, yet we still have not achieved it.</p><p> People who may be away on polling day want to vote but cannot do so.  Where are we going in this regard?  We must be grounded in reality and if we could achieve that, maybe we could talk about the pros and cons of how and where we can extend the franchise to people who have connections with this State.  </p><p> In this era, we could be accused of taking democracy for granted.  Senator Brennan referred to voter apathy and low turnout.  When one drills down and examines the anomalies in the electoral register, however, one can see the numbers going out to vote.  While it may be different for general or local elections, the figures are still not where one would like to see them. </p><p> People talk about the confusion surrounding referendums, including the children's rights referendum, and we must listen to what they are saying.  This country had been plagued by scandals affecting the care of children and many cases were cited where the law was too restrictive.  It was said that we needed a referendum to change the law and firm it up to ensure that children are protected.  The turnout at public meetings on that referendum was low, however, so the vote did not surprise me at all.  In fact, that vote took place on a Saturday to accommodate young people.  I visited as many polling stations as I could that day just to touch base, but many presiding officers remarked on the low turnout of young people.  I think therefore that something more fundamental is wrong.  </p><p> Protests and civil disobedience that cross the line into criminal behaviour are a serious attack on law and order, which is the very basis of our democracy.  We will not have these freedoms, including the right to walk down the street, unless we all observe the law.  Whether or not we like the law, it has to be obeyed.  There are democratic ways to change laws which entail a respect for differences. </p><p> We have seen the shocking situation of what happened to the T&aacute;naiste in Jobstown.  Could the people who detained her for several hours accept that she has as deeply held a conviction about the decision she was making, as they have?  One does not achieve anything in a democratic fashion by intimidation.  We should all take stock of our democracy, but are we taking it for granted?  We should look at countries where democracy is not operating and where people do not have civil liberties.  There can be chaos where a few people take control for their own betterment, and in many cases the west is supporting them.  We have an awful lot going for us here, but if we lose sight of that we will be in a terrible quandary.</p><p> As regards our democratic electoral system, people may ask: "Why can't you just do this?"  We are not an autocracy, but democracy is laborious and most of the time it is not glamorous.  It is about conversation, whether at public meetings or with those coming into a constituency office.  We listen to things with which we may not agree, but we are all citizens and it is about discussing matters.</p><p> We are examining the situation to make the electoral system more interesting to young people, but is it interesting for them?  We need to look at what it means to be an Irish citizen.  Citizenship ceremonies were introduced under the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  They are a good idea because citizenship in a republic has value, rights and responsibilities.  It seems, however, that we cannot talk about responsibilities in this country because we feel we have been so oppressed as a nation that it now has to be about people's rights, but there is a balance to be struck here.</p><p> We need to begin a conversation with bright, young people who have availed of significant educational opportunities and achieved many of the freedoms our forefathers sought for the nation.  However, many of the citizenship programmes I have seen in schools seem to be only for those who choose to do them.  I believe the Minister's job, whether we have an electoral commission or not and despite the pros or cons for it, is to ensure a more systematic approach to this issue.  People must be helped to understand the power of a vote.  They must understand their power, that one man or one woman equates to one vote, no matter who or what the person is.  However, people feel so disenfranchised that they believe their vote is not worth anything.  It is worth exactly the same as my vote or the President's vote.  We need to bring that civic pride in the country back to the people.  We have a democracy which is not perfect, but we strive towards excellence.  We need to have these conversations, which go to the heart as opposed to the appearance of democracy and how we do things.  Everybody needs to vote, no matter what.  This does not mean they know the perfect vote to make or the perfect person to vote for, but that they try their best, just as politicians try their best.</p><p> We talk about electoral reform, democratic revolution and so on, but sometimes people forget that the people who have been elected pretty much represent the people who elected them and that there are all sorts of politicians and all sorts of people.  Therefore, to suggest there can be a general consensus on how politicians in our democracy should operate is not entirely honest.  It has been very attractive in the period we have experienced in recent times, when we have been on an unprecedented economic roller coaster and have seen a flux in terms of politics, to think that we can decide instantly that we can bang on the table and have things the way we want them.  That seems to be what many protests have been about.  I fully accept people's right to protest, but we need to take stock of what is being sacrificed.</p><p> Whatever way we approach these issues, we need to get to the heart of the participation of citizens in the democratic process.</p></speech>

Much of what I intended to say has already been said and will be dealt with by the commission.  In the context of boundaries, I come from a county where while one of my local councillors is a member of Meath County Council, when it comes to a general election, her constituents vote in the Louth area.  I do not agree with this division.  If someone is part of a particular county council, they should be part of the same area for a general election.  This is an issue any commission should examine.</p> <p>  The register of electors is another issue.  I often wonder why people are not automatically added to the register when they turn 18.  Getting young people to register is a matter of getting them interacting with what is going on around them.  I spend much of my time in secondary schools discussing with transition year and fifth and sixth year students the importance of voting.  I try to help them understand the importance of voting and encourage interest in what happens here and how what we do relates to what they do and makes a difference.  Education is a key issue and an electoral commission should focus on it.</p> <p>  The membership and independence of the commission is important.  The Department and the Minister must take on responsibility for oversight of the commission, but the commission must maintain independence.  I have read that in three out of four countries which have appointed members to a commission, they were not appointed by politicians.  Who appoints them in such a case?  Is the appointment made by a judge?  How should we go about the process of appointment and what approach is the Minister leaning towards?  What timeframe does the Minister envisage for the establishment of a commission?  I know he has said he wants to push this forward as quickly as possible, but does he think it will take four years or longer or will it take a shorter time?  I would welcome a commission, but it is important all the different factions come together under it.</p> <p>  There is also a question about the cost of establishing a commission.</p><p>Many different Departments, at local and national levels, play their part and a lot of the cost has been absorbed which we do not know about.  Therefore, it is important we carry out a proper cost analysis of the initiative.  I look forward to participating in the continuing discussion of this matter.  </p></speech>

I am sure the Minister took notes of what everybody said on that occasion when he asked us to do a job.  I presume he came here today to hear what we have come up with.</p> <p>  In 2008 this Oireachtas committee published a report entitled The Future of the Electoral Register in Ireland and Related Matters.  Therefore, we do not have to reinvent the wheel and the findings of the report should be taken into consideration in the first instance.  However, people's views change over time so public consultation would be good.  As the Government's report indicated, Ireland is behind the curve because two thirds of jurisdictions worldwide have such a system.</p> <p>  Of everything that has been mentioned today, boundaries are a huge issue.  If one looks at the boundary situation in this country one will discover that the Garda use different boundaries from health boards and health boards use different boundaries from local authorities.  As Deputy McEntee has said, there are different electoral boundaries for D&aacute;il elections, etc.  I must state that it is difficult to get D&aacute;il and local authority boundaries right in terms of population but boundaries should be synchronised more, particularly to aid the work of public bodies. </p> <p>  Voter registration should be included in the electoral commission.  In terms of election spending and donations, we have seen recent newspapers reports on funding from the USA, for example, going into the North of Ireland and then making  its way into the Republic.  Therefore, we must outline rules and procedures that stipulate whether such funding can take place.  If such funding is being availed of by one organisation then there should be rules and regulations to stipulate how such funding is raised and we must ensure there is transparency all the way through the process.  </p> <p>  Senator Brennan mentioned the old slogan of "vote early and vote often" but it is obvious that some people are voting more than once.  The recent recommendations made by the Geary Institute recommended that PPS numbers be used which is the situation that prevails in the UK.  I do not see anything wrong with such a provision.  There was an outcry when we tried to introduce the use of PPS numbers for water services and people rejected the suggestion.  Other countries use PPS numbers and I do not know why the idea is so opposed in Ireland.  </p> <p>  At present the management of the electoral system is spread between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, 31 local authorities, a clutch of agencies, including the Standards in Public Office Commission, the registrar of parties, the constituency commissions, the referendum commission and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  I would like to see an evaluation of the cost involved to carry out this work by all these bodies.  We would save money if we put it in one little hoop.  Making a saving is not the prime aim and objective, we must get it right.  When the Government looks at funding I suggest every aspect is taken into consideration and we marry these.  </p> <p>  The Geary Institute also recommended that public bodies share data information.  I agree that should happen and suggest it be written into statute law somewhere.  As far as I know, voting by post is allowed in the UK.  The residents of the UK can vote before they go on holidays.  If they can do it then why can we not do so here?  One could not have a system that did not use PPS numbers because it would be wide open to fraud.</p> <p>  I will not comment on political engagement because it has been spoken about enough.  On electronic voting, I will not talk about going into a booth to press a button because everybody loves to use a peann luaidhe to vote but I must ask the following question.  If Irish people can bank online then why do we not trust online voting?  Members of the Oireachtas are bad at trusting cloud computing and we really do not avail of the option.  Online voting is something that could be considered.</p> <p>   When we discussed the electoral commission in the Seanad I mentioned surplus votes.  I do not know whether anybody has mentioned the subject here today.  I would like the Boundary Commission to ban posters.  I never erected posters for my first election but I never had the courage to leave them down after that occasion.  We have moved on since then and now live in an electronic age.  A rule should be introduced to ban posters because they litter the place, in addition to which CO2 emissions have increased due to all of the corry board signs used.</p></speech>

Is an alliance of like-minded people who agree a common policy on nine issues but not on a tenth a political party or is it a group of Independents working on every issue bar one?  As political parties have changed, I would like to see a definition of what "independent" and "alliance" mean.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, the issues of funding and so on must be examined.</p></speech>

There are no right or wrong answers to some of the questions asked.  It is matter of coming to a consensus on many of the issues raised, drilling down to gather as much information as possible and making decisions on that basis.  There is no such thing as best practice; there is just practice and there are circumstances.  One can take the Kilmeaden cheese approach in that one can take the best and get rid of the rest.  That is my attitude.  With regard to elections, many things happen in different jurisdictions which could not and should not be replicated here.  We need to adopt elements of what is done elsewhere, but the entire suite could not be replicated here because circumstances are different.</p> <p>  We have had a lengthy discussion about voter registration and the maintenance of the electoral register.  The local authorities do it at one level, while others do it at another.  Reference was made to door to door checking and different practices, but what would be acceptable?  The Australian Electoral Commission reports that 91.4% of eligible voters are registered and that its target is 95%.  Will we ever exceed a figure of 90% or 95%?  In England the registration rate is 91.8%, while in Northern Ireland where there was an improvement following the introduction of a new system, the rate has regressed substantially to 88%.  The registration rate for the Scottish referendum was one of the highest ever, at 97.8%.  We need to dig into a phenomenal number of issues in this regard to ascertain what is the best thing to do.</p> <p>  We have to come to a consensus on what we are trying to achieve, which is to define the functions of an electoral commission.  If all of the questions set out in the document are boiled down, we must establish what the functions should be.  I would like this to be as ambitious as possible and concur with the member who said what it should be.  I would also like it to incorporate as much as possible and that is my starting point.  I would like it to incorporate everything we have discussed, but I am not sure it can because there are so many layers to each issue.</p> <p>  We need advice from the committee on how to do this.  We will set out the functions and what we want.  If we are ambitious, should we do this in two or three stages or should we take out the electoral register and address it as a separate project?  That might be the right way to proceed because it is a technical and specific issue.</p> <p>  The independence of the commission, how its members are selected and its relationship with the Government or the Minister of the day must be defined.  These issues need to be addressed in the 11 questions posed.</p><p>The independence of the body is paramount and it must be transparent.  Those included in it must have experience and we need to examine the appointments process.  </p><p> To give the committee my thoughts, we will probably have to go down the route of using PPS numbers, despite the problems in doing this because we cannot continue in the way we are going.  There are issues with PPS numbers, given the number issued compared to the number of people living here, but we need a system.  In my previous life I built databases and a unique identification code is required to tag items or people in this scenario.  Using PPS numbers seems to be the obvious solution.  We have all heard stories about multiple voting.  One's name can be on the register 400 times, 11 times or twice, but this does not mean that one must vote 400 times, 11 times or twice.  Anyone who does so is breaking one of the most fundamental laws of the State.</p><p> Constituency boundaries are a bugbear of mine.  We may have to consider constitutional change in tandem with this as we cannot go on much longer with how constituency boundaries are managed.  I am open to debate on this issue.  The draw towards conurbation in Dublin and the population pull means the limitations on the population per seat figure cannot continue.  It will cause additional issues in breaking up counties.  I agree with the many Deputies and Senators who have stated people who are elected must deal with multiple local authorities, HSE zones and administrative districts for various services, which is difficult.  What is also very difficult is that the people of Coolbawn, from where my grandmother comes, now vote in County Offaly, even though they do not want to do so.  People in other areas the Vice Chairman knows such as Terryglass and Borrisokane also vote in County Offaly.  I canvassed in Shinrone during the last election and the people there did not want to vote in County Tipperary.  We had a debate about the position in Moneygall because it is half and half.</p><p> Scale issues arise with regard to local electoral areas.  A local electoral area in south Kerry extends from Ballinskelligs to Dingle.  It is enormous.  The continuous breaking of county boundaries for D&aacute;il constituencies will cause more and more problems because of how the administration of local authority areas has been dealt with.  We will have to examine how we should deal with this issue.  Do we need a larger number of seats in constituencies?  We possibly do in some cases, if we do not make other changes.  Like the Vice Chairman, I am from County Tipperary where the local authorities have been merged and other bodies have also been amalgamated.  Then part of the county was included in a constituency in County Offaly.  It is not consistent.</p><p> I agree with e-voting and the use of technology but in a completely different way from how it was done previously.  I am open to it on the basis of maintaining the democratic process and explaining how votes are transferred.  None of us wants to get away from the thrill we get at the count centre.  We will have to embrace technology, but how we do so is the issue.</p><p> The concept of compulsory voting was tried in Australia and thrown out.  Given the psyche of the Irish people, forcing them to do something in any way, shape or form would not be a very good idea.  If we try to force people to vote, they will not do so.</p><p>I think Deputy Catherine Murphy referred to the electoral spend.  Those points have been well made.</p><p> The committee should consult far and wide.  There are many good people who have much knowledge of this space.  Is it evolution versus revolution?  It is revolution through evolution.  I do not think we can do all of this in one go.  We will have to do it in stages but it is revolutionary and it should not take a long time.  I will return to the time issue in a minute.</p><p> We have the postal vote.  Deputy Mulherin made a very good point in that we propose to give votes to people outside the jurisdiction when people living in it, who are temporarily out of the country, may not be able to vote.</p><p> I refer to voter knowledge and education which is a bugbear of mine.  Everyone of us will have had the following experience when canvassing in a referendum.  People will say they do not understand the issue and know nothing about it but there will be two or three pieces of literature and  advertisements from the Referendum Commission on the different points in the referendum.  There is something more fundamental there, namely, the value of one's vote.</p><p> There has been quite an amount of movement in terms of education over the past number of decades but people are still disengaging.  It is not that they are not listening to the radio, watching television or getting literature through their letter boxes; it is that they are choosing to disengage.  That is the real issue we must address.</p><p> The last issue raised was limits on postering.  There are limits on postering and I favour limiting them even more.  We need to be very careful in regard to the different types of postering used.  Use of electronic road signage must be banned because it has the potential to cause hazards.  We need to take a fresh look that, which I will do.</p><p> We talked a bit about timelines.  There is a myrid of issues - we could talk about this topic for a long time - in regard to the 11 questions and the different sections.  In regard to timelines, I would like to be able to bring in the heads of the Bill by the end of the summer, which would mean that within three to four months, the committee's recommendations would be back to me.  My preference would be three months.  There is a huge amount of work in this and much consultation is required.  We have presented a huge document which needs to be digested.  All the issues raised here are in that document.  I would be surprised if anything raised here was not in it, except the issue of postering.  </p><p> It is my ambition to have this legislation drafted before I leave office with a view to the next administration implementing it.  On that basis, I would like the committee to come back to me within three to four months when we can begin work on the heads of the Bill and look at drafting the legislation by late this year or early next year at the latest.  That is my commitment to the committee.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be back again this week, ahead of the General Affairs Council which is due to take place on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day and will discuss the European semester 2015.  The March General Affairs Council will prepare for the meeting of the European Council which is due to take place on 19 and 20 March.  The European Council will have three agenda items: energy union; the European semester, which discussion will include a broad exchange of views on the economic situation in the European Union; and external relations.  The external relations component will focus on relations with Russia and the conflict in Ukraine, as well as the forthcoming Eastern Partnership summit in Riga, Latvia, and the deteriorating situation in Libya.  In addition to preparing for the European Council, the General Affairs Council will consider the 2015 European semester and inter-institutional issues.</p> <p>  Before I look ahead to next week&rsquo;s meeting, please allow me to update members briefly on the outcome of the February meeting of the General Affairs Council.  The Latvian Presidency presented the outline of its priorities for the semester, highlighting a focus on boosting investment, energy union, trade, the digital agenda and the Eastern Partnership.  The Council also engaged in a comprehensive discussion on counter-terrorism.  The renewed focus on this issue followed, of course, the tragic attacks in Paris in January.  The Council took stock of various measures advanced within the European Union to combat terrorism, ahead of a joint statement by EU Heads of State and Government later that week.  </p> <p>  The Presidency presented the state of play on a proposed technical amendment to the Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, regulation.</p><p>The Council also noted the annotated agenda for the March European Council and had a brief exchange of views.  Ministers present had a working lunch with Commission First Vice President, Frans Timmermans, during which a broad range of issues relating to the Commission&rsquo;s work programme for 2015 were debated, including better regulation and inter-institutional relations.</p><p> I will now turn to the March General Affairs Council.  The meeting will focus primarily on preparations for the European Council.  The first issue to be discussed is energy union.  Geopolitical events, worldwide energy competition and the impact of climate change have all prompted a focus on securing the Union&rsquo;s energy future.</p><p> The Council discussion will be shaped by the recent communication from the Commission on a framework strategy for a resilient energy union with a forward-looking climate change policy.  Ireland very much welcomes this communication, which sets out a roadmap for assuring secure, affordable and climate-friendly energy across all member states.  Among a number of initiatives, the Commission has set out plans to enhance regional co-operation, introduce new legislation to ensure supply of electricity and gas, increase EU funding for energy efficiency, and report annually on the state of the energy union.</p><p> It is anticipated that the European Council deliberations will focus on two key aspects of the energy union project, namely, enhancing energy security and reaping the benefits of the internal energy market.  Given the centrality of energy policy to achieving our climate change ambitions, there will also be an exchange on how best to co-ordinate our diplomatic action in order to increase the Union&rsquo;s leverage and effectiveness ahead of the critical climate conference in Paris next December.  It is important that we act effectively to ensure that other states match the ambitious goals agreed last year by the Union.</p><p> Enhancing Europe&rsquo;s energy security is essential for peripheral, poorly connected member states, of which we are one.  Diversifying the routes and sources of our energy, and putting in place adequate infrastructure to support this diversification, will be necessary to meet our energy challenges of the future.</p><p> Developing indigenous resources, particularly in the area of renewable energy, will be also very important for increasing security of supply.  The energy union strategy will seek to ensure that Europe retains its leading global role in renewable energy.  Ireland has one of the best offshore renewable energy resources in the world, particularly wave energy, and Irish researchers and entrepreneurs are at the forefront of technological developments in this sector, particularly in the marine centre in Ringaskiddy in Cork.  I recently witnessed this first hand with my French counterpart, Harlem D&eacute;sir, to when we visited Ringaskiddy, UCC and the Irish Maritime and Energy Resource Cluster.  The visit exemplified the energy union in action.  We also explored opportunities for co-operation between Ireland and France in the area of renewable energy, and discussed a possible submarine electricity interconnector between Ireland and France.  Both countries of course have very large coastlines and have marine resources in that regard.</p><p> There are currently three external relations items scheduled for discussion at the European Council.  These are relations with Russia and the situation in Ukraine; the Eastern Partnership; and developments in Libya.  Developments on the ground in Ukraine will shape the European Council discussions both on Ukraine itself and on broader EU relations with Russia.  In particular, progress on implementation of the 12 February Minsk agreement will be reviewed.  After a troubled beginning, the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine appears to have taken hold.  Prisoner exchanges have taken place and both sides have begun withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line.</p><p>This is welcome.  However, the situation remains tense and fragile.  It is crucial that the OSCE monitoring mission is given full and unhindered access to all areas of the conflict zone, so that it is in a position to definitively verify that weapons have been withdrawn, and confirm the locations to which they have been taken. </p><p> The question of further economic sanctions is likely to be a feature of the European Council discussions.  Following consultations with EU member states and a subsequent video conference with France, Germany, Italy, UK and US, President Tusk stated on 3 March that leaders had underlined the close linkage between sanctions and the full implementation of the Minsk agreements, making it clear that the EU was ready to take further measures if the agreements were further violated.  Ireland has consistently favoured the dual-track approach adopted by the EU, involving both political dialogue and robust sanctions, with a view to bringing an end to the conflict that has claimed over 6,000 lives and caused untold hardship.  I will have an opportunity to hear the Ukrainian perspective directly when, together with EU colleagues, I will meet with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Klimkin in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council next week.</p><p> The European Council will hold an orientation debate ahead of the Eastern Partnership summit, which will be held in Riga on 21 and 22 May.  The Eastern Partnership aims to enhance the EU&rsquo;s relationships with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. The summit will allow the EU and its eastern partners to take stock of developments in the Eastern Partnership since the last summit in Vilnius in 2013, and to consider the path ahead.  The summit will offer the opportunity, in particular, to assess initial progress by Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in the implementation of their EU association agreements, with assistance provided by the EU.  The D&aacute;il approved the terms of the agreements on 28 January, after a debate and consideration of the agreements by the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This paves the way for their ratification by Ireland, which will be completed before the Riga summit. </p><p> The European Council will also discuss the situation in Europe&rsquo;s southern neighbourhood, specifically in Libya, and consider the implications for the security of the EU, in terms of illegal migration and terrorist threats.  Recent months have witnessed a number of factions competing for political legitimacy and seeking control of Libya&rsquo;s cities and its infrastructure.  The vacuum of effective state control has been exploited by terrorist groups such as ISIS with devastating results.  The conflict is also creating a growing humanitarian crisis in much of the country.  A UN-facilitated talks process is now seeking an inclusive political agreement which would lead to the formation of a government of national unity, a ceasefire and the finalisation of a new constitution for Libya.  The EU is fully supportive of these efforts.</p><p> The European Council will discuss the economic situation in the EU and conclude the first phase of the 2015 European semester.  While economic developments were disappointing for most of last year, we are now seeing some signs of a more positive economic outlook for Europe.  The year 2015 is the first since the onset of the crisis in which all member state economies are expected to record economic growth.  Importantly, this more positive economic outlook is also beginning to feed through to Europe&rsquo;s labour markets.  The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in the Union was 9.8% in January, the second consecutive month that it was back in single figures.  We do, however, need to bear in mind that this figure masks significant regional variations &ndash; and that youth unemployment, in particular, remains a formidable challenge.  </p><p> The committee asked me to provide a brief update on the situation in Greece.  On 20 February, agreement was reached among the Finance Ministers of the euro area to extend the Greek programme by up to four months.</p><p>This is a welcome development, which demonstrates Europe&rsquo;s solidarity in supporting Greece until it has regained full market access.  The purpose of the extension is to allow a successful conclusion of the fifth review of the Greek programme, the disbursement of the associated funds and discussions on a possible follow-up arrangement.  As part of the agreement, the Greek Government has presented its proposals for reform measures.  These measures will now need to be further specified and then agreed with the institutions by the end of April.  Yesterday, the Eurogroup discussed procedural issues relating to the negotiations.  It was confirmed that technical negotiations between the Greek authorities and the institutions would commence tomorrow in Brussels.  Ireland, together with other euro area member states, understands and empathises with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people.  This is why there has been a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new Government, while also respecting existing commitments.</p><p> I will return shortly to consider the European semester, but first allow me to finish on the General Affairs Council agenda.  Over lunch, Ministers will discuss how the Council might contribute to a revision of the 2003 inter-institutional agreement on better law making, on which the Commission is expected to issue a proposal later this year.  The objective of such a revision would be to update and enhance existing arrangements for inter-institutional cooperation, in order to improve the legislative process and, ultimately, deliver better outcomes for our citizens.  While no decision will be taken at this juncture, I look forward to a productive discussion which will advance our goals of strengthening inter-institutional co-operation and delivering better regulation.</p><p> I will now focus the remainder of my statement on the European semester for 2015.  The March European Council will conclude the first phase of the European semester by providing guidance to member states for submission in April of their stability programme updates, under the Stability and Growth Pact, and national reform programmes.  I expect that there will be strong political reinforcement of the key priorities set out by the new Commission in the annual growth survey it presented in November &ndash; that is, a boost to investment; a renewed commitment to both national and EU-level structural reforms; and continued fiscal responsibility.</p><p> The Commission is also due to present proposals this year for an improved and updated Europe 2020 strategy.  This means making sure we have the right post-crisis arrangements in place for supporting growth and jobs across Europe.  The Commission&rsquo;s preparations in this regard will of course be informed by the public consultation to which the present committee made a contribution in November, as was reviewed when I attended the Seanad last week.</p><p> The Commission&rsquo;s proposals for a renewed Europe 2020 process have been deferred until later in the year, keeping the political focus before the June European Council on getting the new "Juncker investment plan", as it is known, up and running.  Progress in establishing the European fund for strategic investments remains firmly on track.  Indeed, finance Ministers are due to agree today a general approach on the draft regulation, allowing negotiations to open with the European Parliament.  </p><p> On 26 February, the Commission presented a comprehensive assessment for each member state, under the 2015 cycle of the European semester.  There is now a window of more than two months before draft proposals for the next round of country-specific recommendations are produced by the Commission on 19 May, for adoption subject to amendment by the Council.  This is a significant procedural improvement introduced for this year&rsquo;s process that is designed to support stronger national-level engagement with the Commission&rsquo;s assessment, including by key stakeholders and national parliaments and committees.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the assessment in the new country report is a broadly positive one, reflecting the strength of the economic recovery under way, supporting in turn a gradual unwinding of the deep imbalances developed during the crisis period.</p><p> It is worth recalling that we are only one of five member states whose budgets were found by the Commission last November to be fully compliant with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The country report strongly commends the progress we have made in recent years, noting that Ireland was the fastest growing economy in the EU in 2014, with that growth expected to continue in the coming years.  It notes in particular that recovery has been jobs rich and recognises that public sector indebtedness declined in 2014, public debt is on a downward trajectory, financial sector challenges are diminishing, external accounts have strengthened considerably and the labour market situation has improved.</p><p> The purpose of the report, while recognising progress, is to identify where further work is needed or weaknesses or imbalances remain.  The Commission does this in respect of every member state.  Among the areas for further work, the Commission includes the need to continue to pay attention to unemployment, especially long-term unemployment.  As the committee is aware, this is a key priority for the Government.  The Commission also points to the need to ensure that small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, can access the finance they need.  In this regard, the Government has recently put in place the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p><p> The report assesses progress implementing our 2014 country-specific recommendations, CSRs.  As committee members will be aware, Ireland received seven CSRs last year.  These covered public finances, health care spending, active labour market policies, social inclusion, access to finance, non-performing loans in the financial sector and legal services.  Progress is broadly on track and consistent with policy directions already firmly established at national level.</p><p> Preparation of Ireland's national reform programme, NRP, for 2015 is under way.  It will formally report on the progress in implementing our CSRs as well as progress towards our Europe 2020 targets in the areas of employment, research and development, climate change and energy, education and social inclusion.  The NRP will also set out the macroeconomic context, which is further elaborated on in our stability programme update, which is due for presentation to the Commission in April.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the views of the committee on the semester process and the key priorities and challenges that might be reflected in this year's NRP.  Similarly, views are being sought from a wide range of civil society stakeholders.  It is important that engagement with the European semester be supported and national ownership be encouraged.  Last year, my predecessor, the then Minister of State, Deputy Donohoe, presented a draft of the NRP to the committee for discussion and consideration before submission to the Commission.  If the Chairman is agreeable, I would be delighted to return to the committee to discuss our draft of the NRP in the coming weeks or April.  I thank members for their attention during what was a reasonably long speech and look forward to whatever comments or questions they may have.</p></speech>

Today, we will limit contributions to three minutes per person because of the time constraints.  I will try to keep mine to that.</p> <p>  I wish to raise two subjects, namely, Greece and Macedonia.  Regarding Greece, many believe that the four-month programme agreed in February is starting to unwind.  My understanding is that, of the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, of &euro;2 billion that was requested, &euro;500 million was given and has more or less been spent and Athens is just a few days away from running out of money.  The finance Minister, speaking in today's press, stated, "I can only say that we have money to pay salaries and pensions of public employees.  For the rest we will see."  The situation seems to be worsening and the language appears to be heating up.  For example, Mr. Jeroen Dijsselbloem appeared to reject the reform proposals in Brussels yesterday.  He stated, "We have to stop wasting time and really start talks seriously."</p> <p>  That is one side of the argument.  On the other side in Greece, the defence Minister, Mr. Panos Kammenos, spoke about the possibility of Europe forcing Greece, which we have said we will not do.</p><p>He stated: <blockquote><br /><br />If Europe leaves us in the crisis, we will flood it with migrants, and it will be even worse for Berlin if in that wave of millions of economic migrants there will be some jihadists of the Islamic State too ... If they strike us, we will strike them.</blockquote></p></speech>

I am concerned that we are seeing an increase in the temperature of the argument and ask the Minister of State whether he thinks the different positions are reconcilable.</p> <p>  In regard to the situation in Macedonia, we have previously discussed issues relating to the Balkans.  We are concerned about the political situation in Macedonia where the government has jailed several journalists and the leader of the opposition who was making charges of wrongdoing against it, including eavesdropping of citizens, electoral fraud and interfering with the judiciary.  The Prime Minister promised an inquiry, but concerns have been expressed that it will not be independent.  When the General Affairs Council debates issues pertaining to the Balkans, I ask the Minister of State to raise these concerns.  I will ensure the details are sent to his office in advance of the Council.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015031000002#G00400"><p>We have a lengthy agenda and, while I would love to discuss the issue of Greece, I will focus on the eastern partnership arrangement with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia which we ratified as Irish Parliamentarians.  Given that Europe was a contributor to the unsettling events that occurred in Kiev, Donetsk, Luhansk and elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, I ask the Minister of State for his assurance that he will speak in the best interests of these countries in order that the European Union does not repeat the mistakes it made in the past.  I am conscious that Russia is viewed with differing degrees of intensity by those countries that were formerly part of the Soviet Union.  Estonia and Latvia, for example, view Russia as an occupier rather than as a liberator.  They also have a more intense antipathy to the Russians than those of us who never witnessed occupation, other than by the British.  The key issue is to understand President Putin and the Russian Federation's attitude to what the European Union is doing in regard to these association agreements.  </p> <p>  Will the Minister of State assure me that he will set out a distinctively Irish position on the need for dialogue with a view to understanding the fears felt throughout the Russian Federation?  I am sure he is conscious that the European Union now realises, rather late in the day, that it is losing the propaganda war among, for example, Russian speakers in various countries which were formerly occupied, including, in particular, Ukraine.  I understand the summit may address the issue of developing a counter-propaganda machine on behalf of the West.  Perhaps the Minister of State might elaborate on how he thinks this propaganda machine would work.  I ask him to convey to his counterparts in Europe that the propagation of the right-wing elements in Ukraine, including fascists, neo-fascists and ultra-nationalists, only fosters the same propaganda in Russian media that we are trying to prevent.</p><p>Therefore, it is the EU's prerogative, in trying to react to Russia's negative propaganda, to show that they are not our allies and we do not support them.  In the formation of the present Government, one of the first disastrous moves it attempted was to outlaw Russian as Ukraine's second language.</p><p> We are moving into very sensitive territory.  We are approaching 2017, a very important period in Russia's history.  More important, I have lost friends in eastern Ukraine as a result of this debacle, and I do not want to lose friends in Moldova.  Members will remember the results of the election in Moldova and how sensitive these matters are.  The biggest political party is called a socialist party which is more pro-Putin and communist Russia than the official communist party.  There is a very delicate balance.  The people of the region must be understood if we are to keep them on the pro-European path.  I appeal to the Minister to use the well-established political dialogue process which we are very good at to keep the temperature down so that we are not seen to ally ourselves with those who give propaganda to Mr. Putin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015031000002#H00200"><p>I subscribe to Deputy Eric Byrne's views on Ukraine.  In the D&aacute;il, I have spoken in depth on Ukraine.  Much of Europe was sleepwalking regarding the corrupt Ukraine regime and did not consider how Russians were being treated in Crimea and in the eastern border areas.  Over the years, many of us have been raising the issue of large Russian-speaking populations being denied the right to speak their language and have it recognised and to join the police force, army and civil service.  This has allowed a disenfranchised group of people to seek solace where they originally came from, namely, Russia.  While I have no sympathy with Mr. Putin, I have sympathy with many of the Russian-speaking people.  It has been belatedly acknowledged across Europe that many in Ukraine were completely corrupt.  Some acknowledged their support for Hitler and his policies, while we sat by idly, year after year, knowing that whole groups of people, particularly the Russian speakers, were being treated badly and an outcome was inevitable.  Although we have to do something, it is probably a little late for Europe to intervene now.  There was no acknowledgement across Europe of the part Ukraine played in the debacle between Russia and Ukraine.  While I do not agree with Mr. Putin and his tactics, I sympathise with many Russians, whom I have spoken to and met, across different European countries such as Latvia regarding how they feel they are being treated by various governments.</p><p>I read an article in <i>Time</i>magazine in America which reported a comment by one of the top economists that what the troika had done was completely unrealistic and asking Greece to do what they were doing was nearly impossible.  The Greek debt stands at approximately &euro;317 billion, or 170% of GDP.  It is unpayable and impractical.  The Greeks cannot do it.  James Galbraith, who is recognised as a pretty good, reasonable economist, has said the conditions set for Greece are &quot;not recuperative, but punitive in character&quot;.  We all accept that because of the major unemployment and deprivation in Greece, there are social consequences that must be dealt with.  There are tax consequences where tax was not being collected.  Greece needs to create jobs in order to build the economy.</p><p>Basically, I imagine they are the three main cornerstones on which Greece will survive, that is, dealing with the social issues, tax and unemployment.  I seek the views of the Minister of State in respect of this unpayable debt.  If one thinks about this debt, it is 170% of GDP and while paying back what the troika and the European Union is asking of them would take 50 years, they still would be living in poverty.</p></speech>

While three minutes does not give members time to do justice to the issues involved, I have a couple of questions.  Does the Minister of State agree it is important, at this sensitive time in particular, that further arming of any side in Ukraine is not considered?  Britain has announced it intends to send military personnel to the region in the form of approximately 75 troops in the coming weeks.  The United States has announced it will send a battalion of soldiers to train Ukrainian battalions.  Does the Minister of State agree such steps towards greater militarisation are not helpful and that one should seek a demilitarisation of the process?  If one learns lessons from Ireland, that was one of the successes in that regard.  Will the General Affairs Council discuss this matter?  While all members condemn Russia's military involvement in support of the rebels, what precisely is Ireland's position?  Will Ireland seek more sanctions or what unique message will Ireland be sending to people in that region in this regard?</p> <p>  I have been asked to inquire of the Minister of State whether the COSAC contribution will be reflected in the updated 2020 strategy.  While I would like to think the remarks regarding Greece and migration were perhaps not very sensible throwaway comments, there is a lot of anger and frustration in Greece.</p></speech>

As for the talks themselves, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has stated there is a lack of detail on the Greek side and I am told the Eurogroup meeting was fairly short.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is quoted as saying that future negotiations on reforms will be based out of the office of the Greek Deputy Prime Minister, which again suggests the Finance Minister of Greece now is being shunted aside.  However, I have read material online in which he has stated this was not the case.  He was blaming this on bad journalism but it also appears to be following a narrative coming out of Ireland to the effect that there is no detail and nothing substantial is coming from the Greeks.  We appear to be the only ones coming out with that line, certainly in public, and I am interested in finding out what precisely is happening in this regard.</p> <p>  I refer to the statement by Jean-Claude Juncker that our future as Europeans will one day involve a European army.  Further statements in this regard have been made, such as when the head of NATO talked about looking forward to the day Ireland joins NATO and so on.  Will the Irish Government be saying anything in respect of Mr. Juncker's wishes?  Will Ireland raise its opposition to joining any European Union army in particular during this discussion on Russia?  Again, I am coming from the angle that I wish to see greater demilitarisation, not militarisation and this pushes people further into corners.  I apologise to the Chairman for going on.</p></speech>

Part of the function of the Minsk agreement was to encourage Ukraine to introduce further reforms.  Ireland's approach is to seek a broader strategy in respect of relations with Russia, rather than looking only through the prism of Ukraine.  In regard to the Irish view on sanctions, our position is that we want the terms of the Minsk agreements to be upheld.  We welcome, for example, recent prisoner exchanges and de-escalation, and we have always said that sanctions should be scalable.  Therefore, our urging would be to encourage further de-escalation, which would lead, as a consequence, to reductions in sanctions.  We are not of the view that a military solution is in existence for the problems in eastern Ukraine.  That has consistently been the Irish position.</p><p> The Chairman had a question about the Republic of Macedonia.  The situation there is not on the agenda for the forthcoming General Affairs Council, but I would be happy to raise the issue on his behalf and accept his helpful suggestion that a note be sent to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Certainly, the situation in the Republic of Macedonia is very worrying.  I understand Commissioner Hahn recently visited there.  I will be glad to raise the matter on behalf of the committee.</p><p> I have read some of the commentary by the Greek defence Minister but it was not part of our discussions.  I have not seen the full text and cannot comment on his possible motivation other than to note that the broader migration issue is a concern, particularly for southern European countries.  Europe's migration policy will be discussed by the EU later this year and we hope it will be done in a measured manner, taking all valid concerns into account.</p><p> In regard to developments in Greece, the issue of specific detail is being discussed today.  It is not accurate to say that questions around detail are only being asked by Ireland.  The Chairman remarked on the comments yesterday by the Greek finance Minister, Mr. Dijsselbloem.  There is no denying that the situation in Greece is very challenging, with immediate concerns which need to be addressed in the coming months.  We must see progress in the coming days.  Financing is required this month to meet IMF repayments, interest payments and other financial obligations.  To say there is no time to lose is an accurate assessment of where we are at.  Much of the negotiations are of a very technical nature.  They are ongoing today and tomorrow and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is in attendance.  We will have more detail in the coming days and it is to be hoped there will be progress and success for all concerned.</p><p> Have I covered all the points that were raised, Chairman?</p></speech>

It was disappointing that all parties did not support what was proposed.  A process is ongoing in respect of the matter to which the Deputy refers.  While we wish to see progress in many areas in accession and applicant countries, there is no doubt that propaganda is emanating from Russia.  That is why moving towards a normalisation of relations between the EU and Russia is extremely important, not just in the context of Ukraine - particularly the eastern part of the country - but also with regard to a large group of countries which share the very worthwhile ambition to move towards obtaining the democratic freedoms enjoyed by those who live in member states of the European Union.  Ireland will seek to support all such countries in whatever way possible.  As the committee will be aware, further discussions involving the Eastern Partnership are due to take place in Riga on 21 May and these will place greater focus and emphasis on all of the relevant matters.</p></speech>

As members know, this committee is holding a series of meetings to examine the impact on Ireland should the UK decide to withdraw from the EU.  A referendum on this question has been promised by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, MP, if he is returned to power following the general election in May.  This committee took the decision to examine this matter at this time in view of the potential impact it could have on Ireland.</p><p>Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence associated with today's proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I expect that Sir Bill Cash has something similar in the House of Commons that he has to say at the beginning of every meeting.</p></speech>

I am very glad to meet the committee.  We greatly value the personal and political relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The Chairman and I have known one another for some time.</p> <p>  Speaking for myself, my own personal family relationship has Irish origins.  My grandmother was a Collins from County Cork.  John Bright, who was a great defender of Ireland during the 19th century, was my great grandfather's cousin.  He was a great friend of Daniel O'Connell on whom I am giving a talk in the Irish Embassy in London towards the end of this year.</p><p>Frederick Lucas was a Member of Parliament for County Meath, which is not very far from the Chairman's constituency of Meath East.  For practical purposes I feel very strongly about the Irish involvement.  At the more immediate and practical level, I think I was the first to recommend that we should make that &pound;1 billion loan to Ireland at the time of its financial troubles a few years ago.  I was greatly heartened to hear what the Minister of State said just now regarding the improvement in the Stability and Growth Pact.  I wish the country well because that is the way I feel about Ireland. </p><p> I would like to say also, because everything is not always sweetness and light, I recognise there are differences of opinion about the general question of the relationship of member states to the European Union and the need for change in that relationship.  It is well known that I strongly believe we need a fundamental change in the relationship as far as the United Kingdom is concerned because otherwise we will be greatly disadvantaged.  I will go into the reasons for that shortly.  The population in the United Kingdom is getting on towards 70 million, which puts us in a very different category from many other EC countries, other than countries such as Germany and France.</p><p> As far as I am concerned the heart of the issue is the question of democratic accountability and, as has been a constant theme of COSAC for a number of years, of which both your Chairman and I are members, also a question of democratic legitimacy.  The issue of the national parliaments in relation to the EU institutions, which we debated yesterday in the House of Common and which they are debating again today, is a critical factor because the obligations of member states to accept and comply with EU obligations is an evolving and ever integrating process, compounded by the majority voting system in the Council of Ministers, particularly as reformed since 1 November 2014.  By virtue of this reform Germany and France with two smaller states have a blocking minority and so forth.  There is the over-riding question of the role of the European Court of Justice.</p><p> In 2014, after taking extensive evidence, my committee, an all party committee, unanimously went so far, rightly in my opinion, having regard to the nature of the impact that the European Union is having on our democratic system as to propose that we should be able unilaterally to repeal legislation where it was necessary to our national interest and also to veto issues in the pipeline, both of which were implicit in the original entry to the EC.  The European Communities Act 1972 was a voluntary enactment by the United Kingdom Parliament in respect of which I would simply make one point, which is that the United Kingdom is the only member state which does not have a written constitution and therefore from that point of view we are in a different position from some others.  Our engagement in the European Union is therefore voluntary, as Lord Bridge made clear in the famous definitive case of Factortame some years ago. </p><p> I do not believe it is possible to have two governments and two parliaments covering the same issues because of the inconsistency and the contradictions that emerge and the tensions generated simply mean that the European Union, as I believe has become evident, simply cannot work on the current footing.  There is a democratic inconsistency between decisions which are taken by voters in general elections and ongoing decisions which are taken under the general rubric of the treaties themselves, and actual decisions that are taken by the Council of Ministers, often without a vote as such and done by consensus.  What the electors subsequently discover has been proposed and-or implemented, through the European institutions, for example by virtue of regulations, over which they  have little control or say, short of a referendum.</p><p>To this I would add the way in which COREPER functions and I would refer the committee, if it has not heard of it or come across it, to VoteWatch, a very distinguished body, headed up by Professor Simon Hix, which illustrates the fact that of the order of 90% of all European Commission proposals go through.  There may be some adjustments and there may be one or two things that get lost but basically it is around 90%.  That, I think, indicates the sheer tsunami of legislation that is coming through and raises serious questions in my judgment about the degree of democratic accountability.  It is also, perhaps, worth noting that <i>The Observer  </i>newspaper on 22 February, in relation to the question of a referendum, indicated in an opinion poll that 51% would leave.  I would go further and say from the evidence I have from a series of polls over many years that if a new relationship was negotiated on the basis of the United Kingdom returning to a structural change in the architecture of the Union as trade and political co-operation with the democratic sovereignty fundamentally being in Westminster that the figure would go up to around 70%, which is pretty significant.  <br/><br/>The European Union, in my judgment, is in a state of democratic and economic crisis and there seems to be no appetite for examining the reasons this is so, particularly in terms of the need for structural change in the architecture of the European Union to return ultimate decision making, while insisting on trade and co-operation, back to those who are elected in general elections to their national parliaments.  There is much talk of subsidiarity but little or none in practice.  I would add that President Barroso, at the time when he was President of the Commission, stated that the European Parliament - and only the European Parliament - is the parliament for the European Union.  That does not bode very well for the national parliaments.  That was post Lisbon, when we were supposed to have further and additional powers.  We discussed much of this in COSAC.<br/><br/>There is also the problem of the over domination of one country - Germany - over the economic and political position of the European Union, not only within the eurozone but by consequence also within the EU as a whole.  What was referred to earlier about the question of Greece and the very dramatic crisis which emerged yesterday is a very good indication of that degree of disorder.  I would also like, subject to the committee's views, to remind ourselves that there was substantial pressure - some would even say bullying - which took place at the moment when Ireland was in crisis a few years ago.  If I am right in what I can recall, the troika arrived in Dublin without even so much as the formal consent of the Irish Government, let alone the Irish Parliament.  The attitude of the troika was graphically described by Deputy Eric Byrne just now and I think the Chairman referred to it indirectly in terms of the situation which is currently under discussion among the Finance Ministers.  This is yet another indication of the attitude, as I said to the Prime Minister in the House of Commons last week.  I challenged him on the language that Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble has been using.</p><p>It is very unhelpful when one is talking in terms of crises within individual countries which are under intense pressure.  We need to be very realistic about what is going on.  The late Brian Lenihan was under very considerable pressure at that time.  Members will know more about that than I do, but I was watching it pretty closely and I got a very nasty feeling that there was something going on which was both pressurising and very unhelpful to resolving the difficulties Ireland faced.<br/><br/>I believe there was at one stage a rule of no bailouts.  We can park that one because we now know the whole European Union functions on bailouts.  In fact, it goes even further than that; it actually prints the money to pay for the bailouts on a scale which is simply unbelievable.  However, that is an economic argument into which I will not go but I am very worried about it because one earns money by taxing proper enterprise and not just by printing it in the printing presses.<br/><br/>The EU is not merely sleepwalking but is accelerating into disorder which is reflected in what I said I thought would happen when I wrote a book in 1990 called <i>Against a Federal Europe- The Battle for Britain</i>.  I hope I do not sound presumptuous when I say that in that book, I said the European Union and European government - this led me to lead the rebellion against Maastricht treaty all those years ago - would be accompanied sooner or later by the internal contradictions of all the kinds I have described and the economic pressures creating a problem of protests, riots, massive unemployment and the rise of extremism.  There are not many people who would seriously dispute that has actually happened as well as the lack of jobs for young people.  If one looks at Podemos and Syriza and at where the pressure is coming from and asks where all this is leading, I would have said there is a very strong case for everybody to take a step back, to have a really good look at the landscape without prejudice to the existing treaties and to ask what all this is for and if we want to have peace and security, which were what the original intentions of the European Community, now the European Union, were meant to be.  <br/><br/>Although many people have received huge sums of money and they have a defence commitment that goes with Article 5, because of the interconnection, none the less the intrinsic internal implosion, which is now virtually unstoppable, is the moment when we should pause to ask what kind of European Union we want, not to mention the imbalance in terms of trade between Germany and most of the other member states.  As far as the United Kingdom is concerned, we run a deficit with the other 27 member states of more than &euro;50 billion per year while Germany runs a surplus with the same 27 member states of more than &euro;50 billion year.  We would regard that as pretty indicative of the state of play for the United Kingdom.  We have a surplus selling the same goods and services to the rest of the world because we have these enormous opportunities in regard to the Anglo sphere, with our commercial ties, the language advantage we have and so forth . <br/><br/>We are confronted by a political union which is being presented more forcefully by Angela Merkel, as Chancellor Kohl did before her.  This is not a new issue.  National parliaments are being dumbed down and the element of trust is gone.  More than 60% in many countries in Europe have lost trust, according to the euro barometer poll.  The turnout in the European Parliament elections was barely 43% and that 43% only held up because quite a lot of older people voted.  The level of turnout among younger people in the European elections was derisory.  We are confronted by an unbalanced Union, which we see in regard to Greece, for example, but potentially other member states, such as Spain.</p><p>Furthermore, it is clear that subject to a referendum in the United Kingdom, the issue of Britain's role outside the eurozone, because we are certainly not going back in, and therefore being confined to the second tier of a two-tier European Union, is that the UK has a permanently decreasing role of influence.  I believe this cannot be remedied by the mantra that the UK has influence merely by being at a table, where the influence is diminished by the voting system and institutional arrangements defined by the <i>acquis</i>, not to mention the role of the Court of Justice which, under sections 2 and 3 of our European Communities Act 1972, overrides our Supreme Court and our Parliament.  This <i>acquis</i>, which can only be changed by unanimity and treaty change, is a real problem.  None of the answers to the problem is remotely on offer from the other member states.  Everybody is locked into the belief that one cannot change any of this.  Personally, I believe this is political suicide.  The European Union is creating a very serious problem for itself.<br/><br/>Hence the growing case for exit by the UK, bearing in mind that we have these external Anglosphere opportunities and a very substantial surplus with the rest of the world.  In any event, we would continue to be in a mutual trading relationship and political co-operation with the other member states, even if we were outside the EU.  I strongly believe it would not be in German interests, for example, if it were to knock out the approximately &euro;20 billion worth of cars and trucks that come into the UK, nor would Germany contemplate allowing it to happen.  At the same time, the EU as a whole is becoming less competitive in the big league table.  Then there is also the problem for us of the City of London, where we have lost five or six of the last seven court challenges.  In respect of over-regulation for business in general, as I am sure Ireland is discovering as well, even according to Peter Mandelson, when he was the Trade Commissioner over-regulation was costing the European Union 4% of GDP.  It is not a good story.<br/><br/>Many member states have made it clear that they wish the United Kingdom to remain in the EU.  I had a one-to-one meeting with the Norwegian Foreign Minister a week ago and he said that too.  However, this ultimately must be decided by the UK, and this must be through a referendum in the relatively near future.  The UK will hold the EU Presidency in 2017 and I do not believe it is practical to have a referendum then.  We must have it soon and I hope it will be in 2016.<br/><br/>This is the ultimate test.  If there is a paramount need in individual member states that the UK remain part of a European relationship, and I refer to Ireland in this context but other countries share that view, in light of our contribution to European matters over the last 100 years and more and also the fact, if I can put it in simple terms, that we saved Europe twice from tyranny, and with Irish help in the trenches, the issue must be decided by us.  If the UK remaining part of a European relationship is to be sustained and if this is so overwhelming an interest for the other member states, then in the national interests of other member states and in the European interest as a whole, bearing in mind our historic role, does this not lead to an essential question of restructuring the EU for this purpose?  If we are so integral, and if everybody says we must stay in, is there not a point where action becomes part of the dialogue to ensure that we get what is needed to preserve the integrity of Westminster as a national parliament?  In my view, this is not special pleading.  It is based on fundamental principles of democracy, freedom and common interests, which we all share.  The stakes are very high, but the principles of democracy are not negotiable and are fundamental in our national interest, and the preservation of our national parliament lies at the centre of this concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015031000002#S00100"><p>I thank Sir Bill Cash.  I have two questions for him.  His script states, &quot;In any event it would continue to be in the mutual interests of the member states of the EU and the UK to continue to trade and to achieve political co-operation, even if we were outside the EU&quot;.  In the event of an exit, some would say the <i>quid pro quo</i>relationship would not be possible.  The model would be more akin to the Swiss and Norwegian models, whereby the UK, in order to gain access to the Single Market, would have to make a contribution to the EU budget and adopt certain rules, regulations and legislation enacted in the Union.  What is Sir Bill Cash&rsquo;s view on that?  He referred to the imbalance in trade and stated it is in the interest of the Union to continue to trade.  He alluded to the United Kingdom having a population of 70 million and to a market of potentially 430 million to 440 million people.  Is he convinced there could be a relationship of equals?</p><p>My second question is on the motivation for an exit from the EU.  A remarkable aspect of Sir Bill Cash&rsquo;s contribution, on which I could be wrong, is that I did not hear the word &ldquo;immigration&rdquo; mentioned once.  The Irish audience often hears that the United Kingdom&rsquo;s motivation is based on immigration.  Members of the committee visited the United Kingdom recently to discuss this issue with political colleagues and organisations there.  It was put to us clearly that there are two groups interested in pushing the issue of renegotiation or Brexit.  One is concerned with the sovereignty issue, and that is very much what Sir Bill Cash has been discussing this afternoon.  The other concerns immigration and what is perceived to be a large number of additional immigrants entering the country over recent years.</p><p>I have a question on how the latter issue affects us in Ireland.  As Sir Bill Cash knows, we had the common travel area before the European Union was founded.  Ireland, along with the United Kingdom, has opted out of the Schengen agreement.  One motive behind an exit would be the desire to control the amount of immigration into the United Kingdom.  I include immigrants from countries within the European Union.  One could expect to see some restrictions placed on the entry of French citizens, for instance, yet those citizens could fly directly to Dublin from Paris and get a train to Belfast, thus entering the United Kingdom without having to show any passport.  Alternatively, they could drive through the open borders.  A French citizen who decides to visit or work illegally in the United Kingdom could fly to Ireland and make his way across the Border.  Ireland is probably the only country from which this could be achieved.  If French citizens entered the United Kingdom via the English Channel, they would have to show some sort of identification or ticket to do so.  How would this work? How could those who are concerned about the level of immigration into the United Kingdom be convinced that suitable structures would be put in place at the Irish end to prevent people using Ireland as a back door into the Untied Kingdom?</p><p>I invite Senator Kathryn Reilly to ask her questions, and she is to be followed by Deputy Eric Byrne.</p></speech>

He commented on democratic accountability and "structural change in the architecture of the EU to return ultimate decision making" to national parliaments.  He referred also to the over-domination of one country, an imbalanced Union, the decreasing role of influence, the voting system and institutional arrangements.  He spoke about the fundamental change in the relationship and, perhaps, a return to a structure of trade and political co-operation whereby democratic accountability, sovereignty and ultimate decision-making would be returned to Westminster.</p><p>In an ideal world, what kind of concrete changes or fundamental restructuring would the witness like to see?  He has referred to the integrity of Westminster as the national Parliament and bringing decision-making back, but what changes would he like to see in concrete terms?  He might outline one or two.</p><p> Sir Bill Cash also referred to the preservation of the national parliament as the centre of concern.  Are there any potential negative repercussions of exit?  Domestically where people considered there were negative economic consequences, could there be a backlash?  Finally, I pick up on something the Chairman was saying on the personal and political relationships between Ireland and Britain.  Aside from trading relationships, how does the witness see any exit affecting relations?  Specifcally, how would he propose to deal with North-South arrangements here and in the North of Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-10a.550" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Sir William Cash" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015031000002#T00200"><p>Very simply, the model I would go for would not be the EEA, with which there are serious problems in relation to free movement.  That raises the question of immigration also.  The Swiss model, which is EFTA plus, would be the direction in which I would go, with us regaining our place in the WTO.  In other words, we would re-establish relationships on that footing.  At the same time, I recognise the question of the North-South Irish dimension.  All I can say, as I said at the beginning, is that we have very strong personal relations and, I think, political relations which have been getting better and better in relation to both North and South.  The improvements, with some difficulties, which are embedded as a result of the Good Friday Agreement and other developments and the goodwill that has been generated are such that we would overcome any issues.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to a backlash, but I do not see one.  While there are risks on the economic front and we trade with the European Union on a very substantial footing, it is only approximately 40% of our trade.  I will not bore the committee with all the economic arguments, but I assure the members that very strong arguments have been put forward by distinguished economists to demonstrate why we would not be disadvantaged economically and that the myth that 3 million jobs are at risk is a nonsense.  Nevertheless, that is still put forward as an accusation by some of the organisations that disagree with the kind of analysis I have on the subject from, for example, Roger Bootle.  We have some very powerful economists on our side of the equation.  When the person from the Institute of Fiscal Studies was quoted to the effect that 3 million jobs were at risk, he said immediately that it was Goebbels-like propaganda which he had never issued.  Nevertheless, it is still part of common parlance.</p> <p>  Our small and medium size businesses are heavily over-regulated.  Many people want a new relationship.  Irrespective of whether they want specifically to get out, they want a new and fundamental change in the relationship.  All of these things indicate that the good common sense of the British people is coming through.  They are being realistic and there is a real opportunity for our relationship with other countries in Europe to continue while extending our relationship with the rest of the world.  I do not see it as a backlash, to put it as simply as that.  We have a very good opportunity to act here.</p><p>With regard to the role of the City of London, we have multinationals, Goldman Sachs and other big companies making statements regularly.  Does anybody really think that the British people as a whole will be influenced by international bankers when they come to a decision like this?  I do not think so.</p></speech>

For example, we are an international trading country with a small population and an open economy.  So we are somewhat different from many other European countries.  With our bailout, we had to do things quickly because there was huge erosion in terms of confidence and capital flight that could not be tolerated.</p> <p>  Sir Bill Cash mentioned quantitative easing, which incidentally has been practised by Britain.</p></speech>

Harking back to that era will raise some difficulties that have not yet been foreseen.  Sir Bill Cash mentioned the financial services in the City of London.  A number of economists and international experts in that regard have appeared before the committee.  They do not hold his view on the willingness of the City of London to embrace exit from the Union with his enthusiasm.</p></speech>

Surely the European Union represented a coming together of national parliaments, a sharing of sovereignty, a sharing of democracy.  That has been proven by the European Union to date in that it has succeeded in achieving the greatest single period in European history of peace, co-operation and economic development.  Does Sir Bill Cash agree that the European Union has developed immeasurably economically in the past 60 years in a way that it had not done before?  In a way, Europe was set back by internal, what we would call and Sir Bill Cash might call civil wars-----</p></speech>

In the United States there was no union in the beginning, but there was a civil war that was fought on the basis of a union or otherwise - there were other issues as well.  However, it produced a union that has grown and stuck together.  Unlike the European Union, the United States has a single currency, from which Europe shied away, much to its detriment.  I believe that unless and until a single currency prevails across Europe, there cannot be economic or political cohesion to the extent that would be naturally beneficial to the Union.  The people of Europe will not be able to access the benefits of that huge 450 million people Single Market.</p> <p>  Sir Bill Cash mentioned the need to protect the democratic system of his national parliament.  We would all like to think the same thing.  We would like to think that we have protected it to a fairly considerable extent.  I imagine the French believe they have managed to protect the democratic system.  How does Sir Bill Cash suppose that 28 member states can each protect the system, as they know it, and the tradition of their particular parliamentary system, some of which have had varying degrees of democracy over the years?  Is it possible in a union?</p><p>Does Britain contribute to the concept of that union?  Has Britain immersed itself in the concept of the European Union since the beginning?  Or, as would appear from what Sir William has told us, has Britain looked at it from the outside?  We have a number of people in this country who look at it from the outside as well and as yet do not recognise that the European currency is our currency on which we depend.  There is a possibility that Britain has looked at the EU from the outside and a "them and us" situation has developed.</p><p> I put it to Sir William that it is not in the interests of the EU or of Britain to separate.  I predict that in the event of that happening, Europe will find itself at loggerheads with itself in the very near future.  This has happened before, with the full knowledge of all concerned, when all were watching what took place without saying anything and each in turn decided to seize the opportunity for their own particular gain.  My view is that it does not work that way and we have moved ahead from that.  If we retrench and go back on our word to our fellow Europeans we will be setting an unwelcome and hugely destructive standard.</p><p> Mr. Barroso was quoted as saying that the only EU Parliament was the Parliament of the European Union.  He was right, of course.  We cannot have 28 member state parliaments all claiming to be parliaments of the European Union.  They are parliaments within the EU and constituent bodies of the EU and the parliamentary system.  National parliaments influence the European Parliament and European thinking.  </p><p> Over recent years, we have heard about the Swiss, Swedish and Finnish models.  All kinds of models have been brought before us in their economic and historical contexts.  In the case of Britain it is somewhat different.  Although Britain is a much bigger country than Ireland with a much bigger population and much more economic clout, it is now a little like Ireland.  Things have moved on from the time of the Commonwealth, which was much more powerful and influential 60 years ago.  Now, Britain is much more dependent on the European Union and trade with the EU.  Does Sir William believe that an exit from the Union, which he believes the British people will choose as is their right, will benefit the UK economy in any way?  Britain will have to make the same contributions to the EU as it does now if it intends to trade with it.  </p></speech>

This is about the sixth meeting we have had dealing with the issue of a British exit and he is the sole witness we have heard speak on behalf of the proposition.  This is in contrast to our huge team of academics, economists, specialists in international law and people who understand the function and role of the city of London and international bankers.  We will send Sir William a copy of the final report.  To a man and a woman, and not from an Irish nationalistic perspective, it has been argued here that an exit would be disastrous for both Ireland and England.  Sir William is aware that we in Ireland are very supportive of the European relationship.  He is also aware that we have a divided island, and his traditional allies are the Northern Unionists who sit in his Parliament.</p><p>It would be interesting to know what position they might take post an election.</p><p> Unfortunately, our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues have left.

He might answer my next proposition.  It is the United Kingdom, comprising three and a bit parts, the bit being Northern Ireland, with England, Scotland and Wales.  We know the political divisions that exist and that Scotland would be pro Europe.  Would it not be ironic if the flag bearer of the campaign, UKIP, which terrorised the Conservative Party, succeeded in breaking up the UK's Union, albeit inadvertently and without ill intent?</p> <p>  If the Conservative Party gets an overall majority, there will be a proposition to hold a referendum.  What would the party put to the people?  Which treaty elements would it want to renegotiate?  Is it the party's intention to put to the people a simple question: "Yes", membership of Europe, or "No", leave Europe?  Given the fact that even delving into the issue of what elements of the treaties the UK wanted to keep would take years of negotiation, what question would the Conservative Party put to the British people?  Would it be more complicated than "Yes" or "No"?</p></speech>

One made the comment that, currently, the UK has the best of both worlds.  It has the Common Market and all of the benefits derived from same while it has its own currency, central bank and so on.</p> <p>  Deputy Byrne touched on the question of the impact on the Union.  If Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were to vote "No", which is possible, while England voted "Yes" to exit and the overall vote was "Yes", what would the implications be?  The SNP has taken some soundings in Scotland along these lines.  Would such a scenario hasten the break-up of the Union?</p> <p>  In light of our meetings last week, three issues keep arising: loss of sovereignty, on which Sir William has a strong view; immigration and the free movement of people, which I believe he mentioned; and bureaucracy, red tape and so on.  Various facets of Sir William's party have different problems with these issues.  Some are more easily solved than others, with bureaucracy and red tape probably the easiest.</p><p>A number of countries would share Sir William's concerns in that regard.  Some countries might find common ground on the issue of immigration and free movement, while sovereignty is a bigger picture.  Is there scope for some of these issues to be solved in order to persuade members of Sir William's party to support continued membership of the Union?  If the UK leaves, we have a vested interest in terms of our common border with Northern Ireland.  How does he envisage the operation of a land border with a country that is not in the European Union?  After all that has happened, passport controls would certainly not be desirable.  Ireland might be viewed as an easy way for EU migrants to enter the UK.</p><p> The party appears to be becoming more anti-EU at the grassroots level.  Where does Sir William see scope for former pro-Europeans?  If Michael Heseltine or Kenneth Clarke came along today as young aspiring MPs, would they even get through the selection process to stand for Parliament?  They were capable individuals with strong voices, even if Sir William might have disagreed with them on European issues.</p></speech>

Deputy Kyne and the Chairman raised the issue of immigration.  The fact is that we are actually a small island.  We debated this very issue in the House of Commons yesterday because I had to force the Government to accept an amendment on the question of the Commission's work programme.  For more than a year, it had refused to hold a debate on free movement.  My committee had recommended that we should have a debate on the floor of the House of Commons on benefits migration and benefits tourism.  It resolutely refused such a debate but it would not tell us why other than that it was a matter of collective responsibility.  As Deputy Kyne indicated, it is a very controversial subject.  The reason it is controversial is not because people do not like immigrants, although some elements clearly take that view, but because of practical questions about size, scale, social housing and education.  Many people take a realistic and common sense view of immigration.  A large number of people who come from other countries to do things in the fields for the agriculture sector, and in London generally, are playing an important part in the British economy.  Incidentally, one can hardly be surprised that they want to come to the United Kingdom given that we have a very good economy thanks to this government, or at least matters are certainly improving a great deal.  There is a natural magnetism towards the United Kingdom.  I do not want to present an entirely negative picture of immigration but practical questions arise.</p> <p>  I believe we will resolve the specific issues of the North and South of the Border because of the common purpose we would have if Ireland recognised that, in an effort to tighten the relationship, we would be out of Schengen, just as we are now.</p><p>I do not see a practical problem because it is between us and Ireland, and our arrangements regarding voting and common travel have been embedded for a very long time.  Our historical ties are such that I do not see a problem.  Any problems that did exist would be ironed out.  I do not see it as a problem for Ireland.</p><p> I cannot say whether we will enter an EFTA type arrangement, given that I am offering only my personal views based on having been on the committee for 30 years, having studied it carefully and being chairman, although I am not speaking as chairman.  However, while I do not want to sound presumptuous, if we were to enter an EFTA type arrangement, we would have a very good opportunity for other countries to join us in the new EFTA arrangements.  Although this would not be the view of Deputy Durkan or, perhaps, anybody else in the room, I believe, given the extent to which Ireland is connected to our economy, that there are other countries which, if there were a structural change in the relationship, could look to their electorates.  Given that these countries want to have European co-operation and trade, they could consider all the advantages in terms of the implosion that is happening with protests, riots and unemployment.  Given that the UK has this dynamic within it which is extremely valuable to us as a country - I refer to Ireland - a new relationship could include Ireland in its framework as well as some other countries in an EFTA type arrangement.  We could have the advantages of co-operation and - if I may say to Deputy Durkan - the UK's strength, history and tradition, mixed as it might be thought to be.</p><p> I do not buy the argument that the EU has created peace since 1945.  Bluntly, NATO and the Cold War did that.  The EU is moving in the direction I predicted in 1990, towards implosion.  It is time, as I said earlier, that people stood back and asked whether there could be a new relationship between all the countries.  I must address the question Deputy Durkan raised on the extent to which we are examining the European issue from the outside.  No.  I would say the opposite.  We are very much examining it realistically from the inside, and those who agree with me do not like what we see as it has evolved, although I voted "Yes" in 1975.  I also voted for the Single European Act in 1986.  However, I proposed an amendment, which I was not allowed to debate then although I could now, specifying that we should preserve our sovereignty within that framework.  I believe there is far too much ideological nonsense about the fact that one cannot come up with a new concept of a European co-operative association, such as EFTA plus, in which everybody could benefit from trading co-operation without being bullied and forced into doing things by a majority vote when they do not want to.  Such bullying creates more internal resentment and democratic and economic protest, which we are seeing throughout Europe with the exception of Germany and one or two other countries.  There is another model.  The single currency has proved to be a straitjacket which has caused immense problems for many countries.  I see Deputy Durkan shaking his head.  There are countries that regard it as a straitjacket.  One cannot devalue within it.</p></speech>

For practical purposes, Europe already is at loggerheads with itself and this is evident.  It may not be that there have been riots and protests in Ireland but go to Italy, Spain, Greece or other countries, Portugal also has had its dose, and there are really serious problems that could be avoided by having a more flexible arrangement.  The idea of having vetoes does not mean to say one would use them the whole time.  As for the way one could achieve co-operation, which I would have thought is what subsidiarity ultimately is all about, one would achieve that degree of agreement whereby, if it was clear there was a vital national interest a particular country could not stomach, one would not go down that route.  If I may, I will refer to the White Paper of 1971 when we joined.  That might seem a long time ago but it is only 40-odd years.  The structure of the 1972 Act with which we still live, and which is quite clear - it is a very short Act - effectively rules out the idea of our being able now, as a result of subsequent treaties, to exercise a veto.  However, at the time the aforementioned White Paper went through, it included a very important statement that when entering the European Community, we would do so on the basis that in our vital national interest, we would retain the veto.  Moreover, there was an interesting further sentence that went on to state that to do otherwise would endanger the very fabric of the European Community itself.  This was because people recognised that if one tries to push everybody into a compression chamber and they do not want it, one will get the lack of trust that now has developed to the level of up to 60% to which I referred.  In addition, one will have a low turnout of approximately 40% of the whole of the European Union.  Moreover, as I believe some countries have compulsory voting, this means the turnout was very low indeed.  This is not good evidence that everything is hunky-dory and it is very important for us to step back.</p> <p>  If I may, I will refer briefly and finally to the question of what will happen within the respective parts of the United Kingdom.  I think Deputy Kyne is right and that in Scotland, there is a very different perception as reflected by the SNP.  The SNP had a meteoric rise around the time of the referendum and is embedding itself.  I think I was the first to identify this point and will give the joint committee a book I wrote about John Bright afterwards, which has a chapter on the entire question of Britain and Ireland in the mid-19th century in respect of the issue of home rule, but at the 1922 Committee a few weeks ago, I stated that I thought Alex Salmond would be like Parnell.  I said that what will happen is he will come down and some even think the SNP might get 40 to 45 seats from Labour.  I agree with the Deputy that they are very different in their attitudes to the European Union, but in the event of a referendum, David Cameron, in reply to a question I put to him, has ruled out the possibility that Nicola Sturgeon was putting forward, which is that Scotland would have its own separate referendum regarding the European Union or would be able to disaggregate the votes that were taken in the referendum.  I can only state that they will strive for that, as they will strive for the disintegration of the United Kingdom because like Parnell's objective, that is absolute for them, and will create massive disruption in the House of Commons.  This is why I was in favour of English laws and presented my paper to Chequers for that purpose when David Cameron invited us there.</p><p>I think there is a real problem with the SNP.  By the way, I do not think the SNP will enter into a formal coalition with the Labour Party because that would be a Trojan horse for the Labour Party for sure.  There is a lot of debate about this.  Alex Salmond is a very accomplished political performer and, more than that, practitioner.  He will create havoc if he has a lot of seats and holds the balance of power.  On the European issue, I remind the committee that the preponderance of the United Kingdom population is in England.  We could be presented with some very difficult questions if the SNP comes down and really disrupts the House of Commons on the basis that it wants to achieve independence for Scotland.  I do not disagree with the Deputy that the SNP has a different view on the EU, although I have heard it is not as consistent as some people think.  There are people in Scotland who recognise that being part of the United Kingdom has great advantages.  It should not be forgotten that we won the vote on that by ten percentage points.</p></speech>

I know it is a long time ago, but this is what he said:<blockquote><br /><br />We know that we have made no discoveries, and we think that no discoveries are to be made in morality, nor many in the great principles of government, nor in the ideas of liberty, which were understood long before we were born ....
