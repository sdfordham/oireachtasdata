Doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 19th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  As these committees proceed, the cold shadow of the banking and financial crisis can still be felt and seen in every corner of Ireland, yet we do not have a full picture of the events leading up to and during and after the crisis, and gaps still remain in our knowledge of that time.  It is this committee's responsibility to unearth those missing pieces and to put them together.  In commencing the Nexus Phase of the inquiry, I want to welcome members of the public watching our proceedings live this morning.  You will have the opportunity to hear, at first-hand, from those who were involved in one of the major events in the history of our country.  You will be able to see and hear from them as they are questioned and give their evidence to this committee.  This inquiry has been set up to serve you, the Irish people, to get the answers and questions about the crisis and to ensure that a crisis of this nature is never revisited upon the Irish people again.  As a committee we intend to fulfil that duty for you.</p> <p>  The Context Phase of the inquiry, which has just completed, served a purpose.  It set out the background of the crisis and has prepared the ground for the Nexus Phase of public hearings, which start today.  During this phase, the committee will engage with institutions and individuals who had central roles during the crisis period.  This represents a significant step-up in activity and responsibility for all, both the committee and the banking inquiry team, which is working behind the scenes.  It will focus upon three broad elements: banking systems and practices; regulatory and supervisory systems and practices; and crisis management systems and policy responses, and how these three elements interacted with each other.  It will identify and analyse all evidence and produce a final report in November.</p> <p>  We know we are facing into a huge task with over 64 public hearings ahead of us and we will be hearing from over 50 witnesses during that time, along with receiving witness statements.  The inquiry has sought and received nearly 40,000 documents to date, amounting to hundreds of thousands of pages.  This is the first time that all of the key documents over this period have been collated and examined in one place at one time.  The real strength of the inquiry is its ability not to look at one document in isolation but to draw together the various strands and various sources along with the key public testimony to get a better picture of what happened to put in place the pieces of that jigsaw.</p><p>While public hearings with witnesses are televised and webcast live, these are only part of the process.  Much of the joint committee's work is less visible to the public.  A parliamentary inquiry is a complex project, requiring significant behind the scenes work to support the public hearings leading to the final report, and in this regard I would like to thank the secretariat and investigators for their work they have done to date and will continue to do so on behalf of this inquiry.<br/><br/>Now I just want to address a number of matters to the media who are very, very welcome to our hearings and proceedings this morning.  We recognise and appreciate the important role you've played and continue to play in these proceedings and coverage and reporting of these proceedings is of confidential information which can impair the working inquiry, and in that regard I just want to explain a number of matters.  As part of our hearings and to facilitate them, you will be afforded with an opportunity to see some of the documentation displayed in this room which will be up on the monitors as the proceeding is actually taking place.  The also, these ... it should be recognised though that this is to facilitate the reporting and these documents are not being published by the committee at this stage and are not for publication in that regard, so I just want to draw your attention to the restrictions and constraints on reporting under section 41 of the new Act, which creates an offence of publishing confidential documents or their content regardless of how the documents are acquired but in facilitating the proceedings this morning these documents will be displayed.  I'm sure that you share our desire that the integrity of the inquiry is maintained and that it is successful in addressing the reasons Ireland experienced the banking crisis and that this will be reflected in your own reporting of proceedings today.<br/><br/>Finally I'd like to thank, take this opportunity to thank all the committee members for their hard work and commitment in getting to this stage.  The fact we completed the context phase and are now starting the nexus phase on schedule reflects the co-operative and positive response and approach that the committee has adopted in how we set about our work and how we have worked as a team.  A responsibility now rests on the shoulders of the members of this committee.  It is the first committee to carry out its work under the new legislation, and has been entrusted to examine one of the major events in the history of the State, and a crisis which has impacted upon every household in Ireland.  Only by having a complete picture of what happened can we learn lessons and apply these lessons into the future; only then can we move on as a nation when confident that a crisis like this will never be revisited upon us all again. <br/><br/>So with that said, our witnesses today are Mr. Frank Daly, chairman, and Mr. Brendan McDonagh, CEO of NAMA. Mr.  Frank Daly was appointed as chairman of the National Asset Management Agency by the Minister for Finance in December 2009.  He also currently chairs the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee, and previous to his NAMA appointment has served as a public interest director of the Irish ... of Anglo Irish Bank under the banks guarantee scheme and chairman of the commission of taxation which was established to review the structure and efficiency of the Irish taxation system.  From 1963 to 2008 he worked in The Revenue Commissioners, becoming a commissioner in 1996 and then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, appointed to the position on 5 May 2009 by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan. From 1994 to 2009 he worked with the National Treasury Management Agency where he was financial controller and later director of finance, technology and risk.  Previously he worked for a number of years with the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland, ESB, in a number of areas.  Mr.Daly and Mr. McDonagh you're very welcome in front of the inquiry this morning. <br/><br/>Now to commence with some of the formal proceedings and, in doing so, I would like to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you're directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter and time frame of this inquiry; and I will then, on that basis, advise the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings which I spoke about.<br/><br/>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens, as I have mentioned here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the gallery those documents will be displayed on the screen to your left.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not be published ... they should not be publishing any of the documents so displayed.  The witnesses have been directed to attend this meeting of the joint inquiry into the banking crisis, and you will be furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee which will be relied upon now in questioning and form part of the evidence of the final inquiry itself.</p><p> I will ask the Clerk to administer the oath or affirmation to you, Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh.</p></speech>

In this brief opening statement you have asked me to address five topics in particular: the acquisition process of eligible assets from participating institutions; the quality of documentation underlying collateral of acquired assets; the governance models in place in respect of loan and asset acquisition and management; the asset valuation methodologies utilised by the participating institutions prior to acquisition as compared to that used by NAMA; and the extent of commercial diligence conducted by borrowers.</p> <p>  Before addressing these points directly, I wish to emphasise that my comments are informed largely by NAMA's experience of acquiring a management portfolio of loans with a face value of &euro;74 billion acquired from the participating institutions in 2010 and 2011 for a consideration of &euro;31.8 billion.  Regarding some of the points on which you have asked me to comment, I do not and could not have the level of detailed knowledge or insight that would be available to senior lending managers or to the credit committees of the financial institutions, or to staff of the Financial Regulator or the Central Bank. </p> <p>  By the time of NAMA's establishment, the property lending crisis and the losses created by poor lending decisions were already irreversible, and while in this statement I may draw certain inferences about the causes of these losses based on what we found when we acquired the loans, I do not claim to have access to the full picture.  In particular, as I was outside the banking system, I do not have an insight into the motivation behind the poor lending decisions of the financial institutions or indeed the borrowing decisions of the debtors in the years up to the end of 2008.  I trust Chairman and committee members, you will accept my comments in that spirit.</p> <p>  The acquisition process has been described in detail in the Comptroller and Auditor General's first special report on NAMA acquisition of bank assets, which was published in 2010.  The key elements of the process are outlined below.  The institutions were required to identify assets which were eligible for transfer by reference to criteria in the NAMA Act 2009 and in regulations made by the Minister of Finance in December 2009, and subsequently in March 2010.  They were also requested to provide detailed information on their eligible loans, including legal due diligence reports and up to date valuations of the property and other assets which were placed as collateral for these loans.  The reference date for the market valuation of property was 30 November 2009.</p> <p>  NAMA then went through a process of validating key information provided by the financial institutions.  Legal due diligence reports submitted by the institutions were reviewed by NAMA's external legal panel.  The reviews were required to highlight any issues which gave rise to legal difficulties for NAMA in managing the loans or engaging in enforcement actions in respect of them.  Particular attention was paid to enforceability of security, any deficiencies in title to property and the implications of such deficiencies.</p> <p>  The valuation process also covered property valuations supplied by the institutions.  A key element in the valuation of each loan was the current market value of the property or other collateral securing the loan.  The valuation was, in the first place, provided by a professional property valuer commissioned by the financial institution but also owing a duty of care to NAMA.  Each property valuation submitted by the financial institution was referred by NAMA to its own property valuation panel which reviewed it and provided an opinion as to whether it considered it to be correct or not.  If the NAMA property panel disagreed with the valuation it was referred to an independent property valuer for adjudication.  This third party property valuation was accepted by NAMA and used as part of the loan valuation.</p> <p>  The valuation methodology used to value bank assets, usually loans, but also including derivatives, had to receive the formal approval of the European Commission because there was an element of state aid incorporated into the transfer price.  Bank assets were acquired at an acquisition value which is determined in line Part 5 of the NAMA Act and the valuation regulations made by the Minister and published in March 2010.</p><p>The acquisition value of each bank asset was its long-term economic value.  Various factors were taken into account in the calculation of the long-term economic value, including the current market value of the security, typically property but also including non-property assets, such as shares, etc., and in the case of property, its long-term economic value.  The valuation regulations required that NAMA apply an uplift adjustment factor ranging from 0% to 25% to the current market value of property to reflect its long-term economic value.</p><p> Following completion of the property and legal due diligence processes, a loan-by-loan valuation was carried out by one of five loan valuation firms employed by NAMA.  The loan valuation process was independently audited by KPMG, which acted as audit co-ordinator.  The audit co-ordinator provided audit certification to the European Commission on the valuations ... that the valuations were in line with the methodology approved by them.  By 2014, the Commission had confirmed its approval of the transfer of all nine loan tranches.  Ultimately, of the &euro;31.8 billion NAMA paid as consideration for the acquired loans, &euro;5.6 billion was considered to be State aid, i.e. NAMA paid the financial institutions &euro;5.6 billion more than the private sector market would have paid them at the time of acquisition.</p><p> I understand that one of the earlier contributors to this inquiry made a comment to the effect that NAMA acquired loans at rock bottom prices.  This suggestion, frankly, does not bear much scrutiny.  I have mentioned already the overpayment of the State aid element of &euro;5.6 billion in acquisition price.  In addition, NAMA&rsquo;s acquired loans were valued by reference to a property collateral date of 30 November 2009 and, as a result, NAMA had to absorb losses from the impact of a 25% to 30% decline in Irish property values which took place subsequently right up to the end of 2013.  No private investor would have transacted on this basis, i.e. a private investor would have paid only on the basis of the market price at close to the actual dates of the loan transfers in 2010 and 2011; thus if the participating institutions had to sell to private investors, I estimate that the acquisition price would probably be reduced by another &euro;4.5 billion.  Essentially, therefore, the institutions would have been paid about &euro;22 billion by the market rather than the &euro;32 billion that NAMA did pay for the loans.</p><p> Incidentally, I gather that the same contributor expressed the opinion that NAMA was acting more like a debt collection agency than as a property value maximising entity, and apparently questioning our ethos in that respect.  I think this reflects a poorly informed view of NAMA although I understand that the contributor indicated that it was only an impression that he had.  Of course NAMA collects debts, as would any similar entity.  We collect on the loans due to us, indeed this is due to the taxpayers, but our role has been much broader and much more positive than that. </p><p> To give you a sense of the scale of NAMA&rsquo;s role in the market since the end March 2010.  NAMA has acted to stimulate market activity by disposing of close to &euro;6 billion in Irish property since inception, involving over 20,000 individual property transactions.  We have worked hard to bring foreign investors to the Irish market.  We have injected &euro;1 billion in capital to support the development of viable Irish projects which will continue to enhance the value of the underlying assets.  We provided a vendor finance programme for commercial property lending at a time when the banks had stopped lending on Irish property.  We set up a price protection scheme which addressed the concern about falling prices on the part of purchasers; the scheme involved a deferral of 20% of the cost of a residential purchase for five years.  A further &euro;3 billion is available in development funding, some of which will help fund the initiatives in the Dublin residential property market and also the docklands SDZ.  We have worked assiduously to enhance planning permissions and to remove other obstacles to the development of assets so as to enhance their value and to ensure that they are shovel ready as soon as possible.  By end 2015 we expect to have made 2,000 residential units available for social housing and we have supported businesses whose debt we acquired to employ about 15,000 people.</p><p> All of this work requires an intensive commitment by us in terms of time and resources involving experienced staff brought together from a wide range of disciplines for this unique asset management challenge.  All in all, Chairman, I would suggest that well informed commentators would not regard these activities as those of an agency solely concerned with debt collection. </p><p> The legal due diligence process involved the submission by the participating institutions of comprehensive legal due diligence reports which included the disclosure of any matter which could materially affect the value of either the loan or the underlying security for the loan.  NAMA retained the panel of legal advisers to review legal due diligence reports and report on the disclosures made and other matters not disclosed.  In particular, their expertise was focused on highlighting any issues which would give rise to legal difficulties for NAMA in managing the loans or in engaging in enforcement actions in respect to them.  As part as the acquisition process, the participating institutions provide the certificate and warranty to NAMA that, save as disclosed in the legal due diligence reports, the loan and security documentation are legal, valid and binding against the obligor, represents the entire agreement between the institution and the obligor and is fully enforceable against them.</p><p> Since the acquisition of loans commenced in 2010, NAMA has reviewed legal documentation of its acquired loans for the purposes of restructuring, sales, enforcement and providing new finance.</p><p>Each participating institution had different operating practices concerning its legal documentation which included the use of standard form facilities and security documents and general terms and conditions, the use of bespoke loan security documents drafted by their external lawyers and a combination of both standard and bespoke documents.  Recurring issues which NAMA encountered with legal documentation included items of security not actually taken, guarantees not confirmed on the granting of a new facility and development loans with no security over work in progress or step-in rights.Other issues included defective Land Registry dealings and in a few cases missing original documents, such as title.Where a documentation issue was identified following acquisition, it was generally capable of remediation and remediation was carried out by NAMA.  Where remediation was not possible, NAMA sought to revisit the acquisition<b></b>value<b></b>of the loan in question and to claw back any amounts that may have been overpaid.<br/><br/>As regards the governance model in place in respect of loan and asset acquisition, NAMA dedicates substantial resources towards ensuring that the loan valuation and acquisition process was managed to highest professional standards.  This was important not least to ensure that the process and the valuations which emerged received the approval of the European Commission.I have provided an outline earlier in the statement of the comprehensive rigorous approach that we adopted, particularly as regards the valuation of property collateral and the due legal diligence, both of which were key towards safeguarding the integrity of the whole process. <br/><br/>As regards the governance model in place in respect of post-acquisition loan management, the C&amp;amp;AG's second special report in NAMA -  NAMA Management Loans since 2012 - provides a detailed account of the approach that we adopted to management loans and debtor relationships.  NAMA decided that it would engage directly with its largest debtor connections, initially 189 NAMA-managed debtor connections with debt of &euro;61 billion, that it would delegate the day to day relationship management of another 583 debtor connections with &euro;13 billion in par debt within tight and specific delegated authority limits to the participant institutions, known as PI managed connections.We put in place a process to oversee the institutions and the performance of credit and operation of functions on our behalf.<br/><br/>As part of our initial engagement with debtors, we asked them to prepare business plans which set out how they propose to repay their liabilities.Following review of each connection's draft business plan, we adopted strategies which involved one or other of the following - debtor support, earlier asset disposal or enforcement.  In return for support from NAMA, including funding of commercially viable development projects, debtors were expected to agree a number of conditions, including asset sales disposals, reversing asset transfers to third parties, ceding unencumbered assets to NAMA as additional security, giving NAMA control over rental income from investments assets and agreeing to cuts in overhead costs.  NAMA retained control of credit decisions to a cascading system of credit limits and delegated authority ranging from the NAMA board down successively to the credit committee to NAMA senior management and to NAMA units in the participating institutions.<br/><br/>As regard the loans acquired by NAMA from the participating institutions, banks would not have been required to measure them at fair value while they were still on their books.An asset valuation would only be carried out on a loan portfolio if it was mooted for sale or transfer.  The participating institutions would have measured their loan books in accordance with the International Financial Reports and Standards, IFRS, specifically IAS 39.This accounting mechanism requires loans originally arranged in advance of them to be measured on an amortised cost basis.This was done on an assumption that the loans remain on the financial institutions books until maturity.  At least once a year, banks would have had to perform an impairment exercise in respect in accordance with contra rules of IAS 39.This requires the banks to recognise an impairment provision against the book value loans where there is a reduction in the amount likely to be received or a change in the timing of future loan cash flows, commonly referred to as objective evidence of impairment.IAS 39 uses an incurred loss basis as opposed to an expected loss basis.Under IAS 39, banks cannot provide for expected future credit losses.  As the impairment methodology operates on an incurred loss model, there can often be a time delay until those losses are identified, known as &quot;the emergence period&quot;.During the duration of such emergence periods, it may be some time before the losses and loan portfolio are actually identified and have to be recognised as losses by the financial institutions.  Following the banking crisis in 2008 and 2009, it was widely accepted among accounting practitioners that IAS 39 impairment methodology did not appropriately reflect potential losses in a loan portfolio or did not do so on a timely basis.  As a result, the International Accounting Standards Board has redrafted IAS 39 and the new standard IFRS 9, which will be implemented later in this decade changed impairment methodology to allow for future expected credit losses to be reported on a more timely basis.  In summary there were significant differences between the valuation methodology used by NAMA and that used by the banks give the latter did not have to apply fair value methods to their loan portfolios.</p><p>Because they originated loans, they could deal with them on a non-amortised basis.  NAMA by contrast did not originate the loans and had to value them at acquisition at fair value basis in accordance with IAS 39 rules i.e. recognising on NAMA's balance sheet on day one that &euro;31.8 billion was the fair value of the loans, not &euro;74 billion.</p><p> I should point out that the valuation methodology used by the Irish financial institutions was no different to that used internationally and that they were in no way departing from conventional accounting standards in the approach they adopted.  If anything the accounting standard lagged the market reality whenever IFRS was used.  One of the misguided comments directed at NAMA in the early days was that it crystallised a massive loss in the banking system through an overly stringent valuation approach.  It acquired loan balances of &euro;74 billion for &euro;31.8 billion, equivalent to a discount of 57%.  By contrast, it was argued the banks, left to their own devices, would eventually have recovered much of the &euro;74 billion par debt.  I strongly disagree with this contention and would suggest that much of the &euro;74 billion was never going to be seen again.</p><p> The NAMA acquisition process forced institutions to recognise their losses earlier than their own IAS 39 accounting valuation methodology would have required of them.  In the absence of NAMA, you would have probably seen a phased unveiling of losses over a three, four, five, or perhaps even more years, with a consequent drip-drip effect in terms of the needs for capital replenishment and the corrosive impact of the creditworthiness of the sovereign.  The NAMA process enabled the Irish banking system to recognise and address up-front the loan loss difficulties that it had created for itself long before NAMA was ever conceived.  The fact that the asset management company model is now being copied in other countries suggests that, belatedly, it is recognised that the impaired banking systems do not tend to rectify themselves.  An external body is needed to bring a fresh independent approach to resolution.</p><p> I do not have direct knowledge of the extent of commercial due diligence conducted by borrowers or, indeed, conducted by the institutions at the time the loans were advanced.  However, based on our own experience of the loans which we acquired and which we have since sought to manage, I am in a position to make some observations on the lending environment which prevailed prior to 2007.  In that context I would like to draw the committee's attention to table 1 below which in my view provides an eloquent summary into the insight of some of the issues which are the subject of your inquiry.  The table presents a distribution of NAMA's acquired portfolio by size of the debtor connection aggregate of loans acquired from five participating institutions.</p><p> In summary, we acquired the loans of 772 debtor connections who borrowed &euro;74 billion from the institutions.  This excludes any additional amounts borrowed by these same debtors from institutions not covered by NAMA.  I do not know how much additional borrowing from non-NAMA banks was involved, but I conservatively estimate it to be at least &euro;10 billion.  There are 12 debtor connections with debt in excess of &euro;1 billion each, aggregating to a par debt of &euro;22.2 billion, an average of &euro;1.85 billion per connection.  Another 133 debtor connections have debt between &euro;100 million and &euro;999 million, aggregating to &euro;35.7 billion par debt, an average of &euro;269 million per connection.  And finally, there are 627 so-called smaller debtor connections with a debt of less than &euro;100 million, aggregated to &euro;16 billion debt, an average of &euro;26 million per connection.  As mentioned the table does not include lending advanced by institutions such as Ulster Bank, Bank of Scotland Ireland and a number of institutions which were aside of the NAMA process.  It does not include loans advanced by AIB and Bank of Ireland to borrowers whose aggregate borrowing was less than &euro;20 million and it also excludes property loans which remained with the participating institutions on the basis that they were not eligible for transfer to us.</p><p> NAMA observations and concentration risk: You will note from table 1 above that some &euro;34 billion par debt has been advanced to the largest 29 debtor connections.  Lending on this scale to a relatively few debtors suggests that the banks consider property lending to be almost a one way bet, not withstanding the well established cyclical behaviour of property markets and the steep rise in prices from 2002 onwards.  It is clear that financial institutions and debtors shared a groupthink view that prices would remain on an upward trajectory and that there was limited downside associated with property lending.  The view was presumably supported by favourable medium-term economic and demographic projections produced by economists and commentators and by the expectations that any setback in the property market would be temporary and minor, in line with an expected soft landing of the Irish economy.  There was an obvious mismatch that few economists or commentators called into question when, on the one hand, lending was growing at over 30% on average per annum in institutions, and, on the other, the economy was growing at rates at between 6% and 9% over the period 2003 to 2007.</p><p>The impact of greater competition amongst lenders was to increase risky and imprudent lending.  In particular, lending on the basis of it providing very high levels of project funding, sometimes at 100%, appears to have been quite common.  The equity pledged by the debtor, when required, often took the form of unrealised paper equity from other transactions.  Few, if any, financial institutions wanted to be left out of what was seen as a profitable business due to the larger lender margins and the relatively low operating costs.  In normal market conditions, a finite number of viable development projects would be able to secure finance from a finite pool of the bank funding available for property development.  In perverse conditions, which held sway in the Irish market up to 2007, there was far too much bank funding available and, ultimately, it found its way not only to a finite number of development projects which were viable, but also to many other projects which could be viable only on very heroic and often mistaken assumptions.  The sheer weight of debt funding that was available caused an overflow effect into riskier projects which could not have been entertained in normal market conditions.</p><p> It was difficult to avoid the impression that the institutions perceived lending as a sales activity and that, in the rush to expand bank balance sheets, a rigorous focus on lending quality was lost.  Some bank balance sheets doubled between 2003 and 2008.  In one case, the size of the bank balance sheet quadrupled.  Based on our experience of managing acquired loans, it is difficult to fathom a robust rationale for a significant portion of the property lending and, at the very least, it raises the question of whether lenders' remuneration was based on lending volume rather than on the quality of such lending.  It is unclear to what extent there was analysis by bank strategists, by the Financial Regulator or by economists of the relationship between the volume of lending, by region or by sector, and the projected demand for property assets, by region and by sector.  Nor is it clear to what extent did the institutions subject their lending to vigorous stress testing or, indeed, were required to do so by the Financial Regulator.</p><p> Net worth: In advancing additional funding during the years up to 2007, the lending institutions appear to have relied heavily on assessments of debtors' perceived net worth &ndash; the difference between a debtor's valuation of his assets and liabilities.  Statements of affairs &ndash; a list of assets, liabilities and value &ndash; were relied upon to provide comfort that a debtor's financial position could support new lending and that he could service his liabilities.  However, these documents were not always audited and were often self-certified with asset values assessed by the debtors themselves.</p><p> Compounding the weakness was the fact that, for most debtors, assets comprised mainly or exclusively property assets so that when the market collapsed, the value of the asset side of balance sheets plummeted and the net worth evaporated rapidly.  As market prices rose in the years up to 2007, so the self-assessed net worth of debtors also appeared to rise, thereby giving rise to ... giving the lending institutions a sense of false comfort over additional security that did not exist.</p><p> Land and development assets: This issue was particularly acute in cases where a debtor's property portfolio had significant exposure to land and development assets.  A fall ... A rise or fall in market prices has a multiplier effect on the value ... on the price of land indeed for residential or commercial development.  The price of development land is a residual value after costs and developer's profit margin are deducted from projected sales proceeds.  If projected sales proceeds based on market prices fall significantly, there may be little or no residual value.  The land goes back to agricultural value or less.  This is illustrated in table 2 below.  This would explain the steep fall, in some cases of up to 90%, in the value of development land in the years after 2007.  Much of the land had been bought speculatively.  That is also why NAMA acquired some loans for only 10% or less of their face value.  The fact that a substantial proportion of lending was secured by riskier land and development assets also explains why bank balance sheets suffered such extensive damage to their solvency.  Unlike investment assets, there was no income flow associated with land and development assets and, in the absence of demand and liquidity, there was nothing to arrest the fall in prices as it gathered downward momentum.</p><p> Liquidity in the land market dried up completely.  There were no buyers because residential prices had fallen to such a level that the construction of new houses was unprofitable.  This point should be borne in mind whenever you hear the contention that NAMA or, indeed, any other market participant should have been funding the construction of houses in 2010 and 2011.  It simply would have not made commercial sense by reference to market prices then prevailing and neither debt or equity providers would have made a compelling case for funding speculative development at that stage.</p><p> Smaller debtor connections: While the concentration of lending among the larger debtor connections was clearly excessive, our experience has been that the quality of such lending tended to be better quality than the lending to some of the smaller debtor connections.  As set out in table 1 above, a total of &euro;16 billion was advanced to 627 borrowers who had aggregate debts of less than &euro;100 million each.  Generally speaking, the initial discounts on these smaller debtor connection loans were higher and NAMA has to take even higher impairment provisions on them in the interim.</p><p>While some of the lending was to professional, well-managed entities, much of it was to individuals or syndicates whose primary business was not property developments, or who became involved in property developments relatively late in the cycle.  Much of the lending related to potential development projects in or near towns, or in rural areas, rather than main urban centres.  In some cases, one can see how an individual project may have made commercial sense to a bank, if assessed in isolation.  The problem was that similar projects were receiving funding from other financial institutions and clearly not all those projects could have ever been simultaneously viable.  </p><p> Corporate infrastructure:  some of the debtor connections who received this funding did not have adequate support in corporate infrastructure.  In particular, some of the property businesses which built up ... quickly built up balance sheets of &euro;1 billion or more, did not have the financial expertise required to manage bank balance sheets of that size and it does not appear that the institutions made much of an effort to push for improved governance of the debtor's businesses.  By contrast with our situation, property lending in the UK is largely advanced to publically quoted companies, which are suitably resourced to manage their bank balance sheets and the risks; for instance, British Land, a listed UK development company, which has debt levels comparable to some of NAMA's larger debtors, have more than 200 employees.  As the crisis emerged in 2008, 2009, UK property plcs accessed the equity marked and used that funding to pay down debt. That option was not available here, given the majority of debtors were, in effect, sole traders and they were totally reliant on bank debt.  A debtor's track record and reputation appear to be paramount consideration for the lenders.  There appeared to be a highly accommodating attitude among financial institutions towards the more prominent debtors and a concern that, if that institution was not particularly amenable, the debtor would look elsewhere for the funding of future projects.  Clearly debtors were not slow to exploit the unusual lending market.  Some of the more professional debtor connections tended to focus on particular sectors in which they had developed a particular expertise.  This is particularly the case for debtor connections whose main asset base was outside of Ireland.  However, one of the more notable features of the acquired loan portfolio by NAMA was that many debtor connections had borrowed against a diverse range of assets.  It was not unusual to find, when all the loan information was collated, that a connection had exposure to a number of jurisdictions and to a number of sectors, including office, retail, residential, in addition to ownership of one or more hotels, as well as undeveloped land.  After NAMA acquired the loans, it was not always apparent to us what the debtor's strategy might have been in assembling such a range of assets which was so diverse, by reference to a sector and location.  The obvious conclusion, in some cases, was that the compulsion to purchase more and more uncorrelated assets was entirely related to the almost unlimited availability of debt funding.  Many of these asset sectors require specialist business skills which do not appear to have been available to some of the debtor connections involved.  The fact that many of them had only small supporting teams means they could have found it difficult to devote the requisite skill sets to the range and scale of projects covered by their borrowings.  A debtor who was a successful house builder will not necessarily have the expertise to manage a group of hotels, or run a shopping centre, but this does not appear to have inhibited the lenders involved.</p><p> I hope that these comments are helpful in terms of assisting the committee to obtain a fuller understanding of some of the issues which you have been asked to address.  Following the Chairman's statement, I will be happy to respond to any particular questions you may wish to raise.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#J00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to address you today.  I need to say at the start that we're here, of course representing an agency that was a key part of the response to the banking crisis, rather than as a contributor to that crisis.  You've asked me to deal with five lines of inquiry, and I will take them each in turn.  The first one was the commercial real estate development model that existed before the crisis and that model was ultimately, of course, very costly for this State in terms of fixing the financial institutions that funded it and, as a consequence, an inordinate and painful burden has been placed on citizens as the necessary steps are taken to restore normality to our economy.  Volumes have been, and I'm sure will be, written about the confluence of factors that made that model inherently high risk, vulnerable and unsustainable.  Contributing factors, such as zoning and planning policy; tax incentives; irresponsible developer funding; consumer mortgage lending; absence of market analysis, and others, have been well documented and no doubt will be explained to you by experts in these areas.  The most effective way that I can contribute is to give you comment, informed largely by NAMA's experience over the past five years in dealing with the consequences of the banking crisis and our role in fixing it.  As NAMA was established to acquire the loans of the largest real estate developers, I will focus on the structure of lending to these developers.</p><p>NAMA having bought these loans is now for such developers the successor to the banks.</p><p> Let me talk first about debt funding dependence.  From that vantage point what jumps out most of all is a commercial real estate model with an almost complete dependence on debt funding.  This had the effect of placing all of the risk with the banks, and as it transpired, ultimately with the State and its citizens.  By way of background, traditionally in lending equity is provided by the borrower to mitigate a bank's risk.  Equity, in effect, puts the borrower, not the bank, in the riskiest capital position.  In the event of default the borrower is the first to lose.  New rules in mortgage lending, for example, require that a person buying a home now has to come up with a 20% deposit as equity.  However, based on NAMA's experience that fundamental precondition of bank funding was rarely observed in the pre-crash commercial real estate model.</p><p> While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that loan-to-value ratios were typically less than 100% when the loan was drawn, the reality in many cases was that a developer's equity contribution was in the form of a rolling up of unrealised paper profit from other developments.  This was presented as an equity position.  Rarely, if ever, was it in the form of cash.  On the face of it then, developers had some skin in the game, but in reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions, levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions.  This meant that the banks were taking high equity grade risk for low debt grade returns, and in fact even those low debt returns were often not realised, but rather accrued as rolled-up interest booked as income in bank financial statements.  These were, and continue to be, the accounting rules under IFRS, not just in Ireland but wherever IFRS is adopted.</p><p> In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It's safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash the banks stood to take 100% of the losses, and that's what happened.  Those losses, as we now know to our cost, have had to be funded by Irish citizens to the tune of &euro;64 billion.  It would be no thanks to many of those who were the cause of this if, ultimately, that cost turns out to be less than the &euro;64 billion.</p><p> There was a relaxed approach to project feasibility.  The recycling of unrealised equity positions from project to project meant that the model could only keep working as long as prices kept rising and the banks kept lending, and few questioned those assumptions.  Many decisions seemed to be based on a view, shared by bankers and developers, that property prices could continue to defy the fundamental law of any market that when prices rise unsustainably, there is always going to be a day of reckoning, and the steeper the price, the more painful the reckoning.</p><p> This was compounded by the fact that the model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility.  It's much easier to take an optimistic view of a project when you are not being asked to put your own hard-earned capital at risk.  Based on the loans that NAMA took over, feasibility analyses in respect of projects either didn&rsquo;t exist or were incomplete or were based on flawed, overly optimistic, assumptions about the future.  In the residential development sector, for instance, feasibility workings seem to have been based on aspirational exit sales values in an already frenzied peak market.  Very little, if any, consideration was given to the inherent cyclical nature of the property markets.  The attitude appears to have been that the only way was up, that somehow the forces of gravity were suspended as far as the Irish market was concerned and that the long established pattern of property market cycles was no longer relevant to Ireland.  In this model the banks were taking the type of risk normally the preserve of private equity or hedge fund providers without demanding the same level of rigorous analysis that those providers would have made a condition of funding in the first place.</p><p> Mr. McDonagh has talked in some detail about another facet of the model: the dearth of professionally run developer platforms.  The banks were quite clearly lending to individuals and companies that, notwithstanding the massive sums involved, had little or no supporting corporate infrastructure, had poor governance and had inadequate financial controls and this applied to companies of all sizes.  The banks failed to ensure that Irish property companies, to whom they advanced billions of euros in lending, operated to the same corporate governance standards as their peers in other jurisdictions or, indeed, similar sized entities in other sectors of the Irish economy.</p><p>There was over production of residential accommodation in the economy and this, and a range of other factors at play, cumulatively resulted in the situation where development and construction output totally overshot what would have been considered the normal level of production in an economy of our size.  This is best illustrated by the construction of 90,000 new houses and apartments in Ireland in 2006 - 90,000 new houses in one year for a population that was then 4.2 million.  The output was more than five times the European average at the time.  In the same year in Britain, to meet demand from a population which was 14 times the size of Ireland's, just 190,000 new residential properties were built.  The Irish development model, fuelled by a combination of the poor lending practices that I have just described, a scattergun approach to tax incentives, poor zoning and planning decisions and a complete absence of rigorous, independent analysis of population and market trends, appears to have been relying blindly on the belief that if you build it, they will come, and no matter what price, they will buy.  I should say, lest I give the wrong impression, that this problem was not peculiar to the residential sector.  All segments of the market were affected by varying degrees of over-supply.  You could be forgiven, indeed, for describing the sentiment that informed this over-supply as hubris, and perhaps in some of the more spectacular lendings as trophy chasing.  Part of the Irish landscape still bears the scars of that approach in the form of unfinished and half-finished housing estates, some of which have been inherited by NAMA and which NAMA is now funding to completion.  </p><p> And the final point I would like to mention relates to the quality of construction, and, in some cases, the absence of much quality at all.  NAMA has incurred multi-million euro costs in remediating building defects such as non-compliance with regulatory standards, including fire safety standards, as we prepare assets for sale or for occupation.  Many of these defects stem from a lack of oversight and attention to detail from both the builder, developer and the building control divisions of the local authorities.  This was compounded by the sheer volume of development which reduced the due diligence carried out.  Hopefully, these issues have been fully addressed with the recently enacted Building Control (Amendment) Regulations Act of 2014.  Chairman, that gives you a picture of what the model was like before the crash based, again I emphasise, on NAMA's experience of the aftermath.  </p><p> So, what would a sustainable model look like? To finish off this segment could I suggest learning from NAMA's experience that a sustainable model for the future would, at a minimum, include all of the following features: In the funding area there would be a sustainable financing model that includes both debt and equity finance.  There would be proper banking supervision, robust but not stifling.  There would be macro prudential measures to flatten peaks and troughs.  There would be adequate bonding for customers and there would be pertinent audit standards such indeed as IFRS 9 which is coming down the tracks and they would be implemented rigorously.  In the development sector there would be properly resourced and governed development and construction companies, including publicly quoted companies.  There would be active and skilled boards of directors with proper oversight.  There would be prudent management of balance sheet exposures, especially debt arrangements, and there would be adequate building regulations and appropriate oversight in relation to building standards.  </p><p> And then in the planning and market area in general there would be a holistic, centralised approach to zoning, planning and infrastructure provision.  There would be long-term social housing planning and there would be publicly available information of population projections, demand projections and the likely supply outlook.  In regard to the latter, NAMA has, with the Irish bank and payments federation, taken an initiative to fund research by the ESRI into the residential housing market, specifically into the likely pattern of emerging demand and the potential supply constraints that may influence future market activity.  That research, and similar research from other sources, will be important in terms of guiding future development investment plans in Ireland.  What the initial findings, by the way, of that ESRI research tell us is that the vast majority of future housing demand will be in Dublin, the surrounding commuter belt and other major urban centres.  Sadly, it is also clear from the research that some of the housing supply built at the height of the boom will never be occupied because it is located in areas where there is no demand.</p><p>The second and third lines of inquiry which you asked me to deal with, Chairman, are the duty to ... NAMA's duty to obtain the best financial return and its contribution to property market activity, and if you agree, I will take both of those together.  <br/><br/>NAMA's mandate derives from the NAMA Act and section 10 of that Act defines the purposes of NAMA.  It requires NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State, to deal expeditiously with the assets acquired by it and to protect or otherwise enhance the value of those assets.  That is the core of NAMA's mandate and it is clearly a commercial one.  Our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, therefore, is to get the best financial return from the assets in our portfolio and, crucially, to do so expeditiously.  It is not an option for us to adopt what might be termed a &quot;long-term holding strategy&quot; to await some optimum price level at some indeterminate point in the future before disposing of the assets.  We have to do our business expeditiously, which means responding pragmatically to market conditions by taking advantages of opportunities to sell assets where demand and price are favourable.  It's also the case, though, that the phrase, &quot;achieving the best financial return for the State&quot;, has implications beyond simply getting the highest price for an asset, which, of course, we always seek to do.  <br/><br/>NAMA paid for the loans it acquired from the banks with senior debt of &euro;30.2 billion guaranteed by the State.  Central to the best financial return for the State is repaying that senior debt and repaying it quickly.  It is a contingent burden that should be removed from citizens as soon as practicable, not just because of the amount, not just because of the interest payable, not just because of the impact on the banks' balance sheets but because of the wider implications for the sovereign. <br/><br/>It became very clear very quickly from early engagement with the troika that they would have had serious concerns if NAMA had signalled or adopted any type of extended senior debt redemption schedule.  They regarded repayment of the NAMA debt as one of the key recovery factors for this country and one of the key deliverables in exiting the bailout.  I would contend that if NAMA had not reduced its debt as expeditiously as it has, Ireland could have been in a second bailout, as market concerns about the contingent liability would have been very real.  The troika closely monitored the progress that we were making in meeting our first major senior debt redemption target - that was &euro;7.5 billion by the end of 2013.  To the troika, but also to the capital markets and the rating agencies, the signal effect of reducing the State's contingent liability was very important.  It was recognised that in so far as NAMA could make significant progress on redeeming its senior debt, there would be collateral benefits in terms of the creditworthiness of the sovereign and, by extension, in terms of Ireland's borrowing costs.  This has been recognised in Ireland's ratings upgrades and it is an obvious contributory factor to the very favourable position of Ireland right now in the bond and money markets and, indeed, it has been recognised as such.<br/><br/>I might also mention that, for the second year in succession, we have been in a position to pay a coupon on our subordinated debt.  This has had a positive impact on the balance sheets of AIB and Bank of Ireland, manifested in the significant upward revision in the valuation of their holdings of our subordinated debt on their balance sheets.  It is a simple fact that debt redemption needs cash generation and cash generation needs asset sales.  <br/><br/>We have been able to repay our senior debt well ahead of schedule because of our strong cash performance - nearly &euro;20 billion to date through asset and loan sales and &euro;5 billion in non-disposal, mainly rental, income, &euro;25 billion in total.  Thoughtful, well aligned asset sales in the Irish and UK markets in particular have been key to this very strong cash generation. <br/><br/>NAMA actively instigated a programme of asset sales by its debtors in Britain in the period 2010 to 2012 when conditions were strong in that market and, likewise, we responded actively when conditions in the Irish market improved significantly in 2013 and 2014.  That approach accords fully with two key principles underpinning NAMA's strategy: no fire sales and no hoarding.  In each of our main markets our approach has been to release assets for sale in a phased and orderly manner that's consistent with the level of demand, the availability of credit, and the absorption capacity of the market.As a result, London and the UK accounted for almost 80% of all disposals between 2010 and 2012.</p><p>Ireland in contrast accounted for just 12% of disposals during that period and that approach enabled NAMA not only to achieve the best possible return during it's early deleveraging phase, but it also allowed the Irish market time to reach its trough and to begin its recovery.  A fire sale in the Irish market at that time would have been...would have had the effect of intensifying and prolonging the market's downturn, and would have been contrary to both NAMA's overriding commercial objective of achieving the best possible return for the State and its ancillary objective of contributing to a sustainable level of activity in the Irish property market. It could also have crystalised a loss on the NAMA portfolio, which because of the State guarantee would have created additional losses for taxpayers on top of the losses that they have already had to fund in recapitalising the various financial institutions.</p><p> We were not, however Chairman, during that time sitting on our hands...on our hands in Ireland in that 2010 to 2012 period. During that time NAMA placed a major emphasis on asset management to enhance the future value...disposal value of the collateral securing its loans, most notably by working with debtors and receivers to complete unfinished projects, to fund new viable commercial and residential development and to enhance planning permissions and remove other obstacles to development.  During that period when there was little other activity in the Irish market we invested over &euro;600 million in the sector and during that crucial period we also placed a major emphasis on stimulating the market's recovery and fostering the sense that the market was open for business despite perceptions to the contrary.  One initiative was a vendor finance fund of two billion, and there is detail in the statement of how that was deployed, Chairman, but in the interest of brevity I won't read out the details.  But that vendor finance fund played an important part in generating activity in the early days of recovery when the banks had stopped lending for commercial property and investors were still wary of committing funds to Ireland.  These early transactions signalled to international and domestic investors that the Irish market was open for business and played a vital role in attracting finance and activity, particularly from overseas investors where previously there was little or none.</p><p> There is now an active Irish market and NAMA is now taking advantage of that.  The major improvements in the market over the past 18 months have enabled us to shift our disposal focus more to the Irish market.  Reflecting this, in 2014 disposals in Ireland accounted for 46% of all disposals, while London and the rest of the UK accounted for 33%.  In addition to the opportunity to accelerate disposals through existing channels, we have also been taking advantage of new opportunities as they emerge, such as packaging assets for sale to satisfy demand, providing regular flows to the market or providing greater clarity to potential investors, allowing those with limited capacity to bid on a greater number of transactions, thus widening the number of potential bidders and increasing the potential return to the State.</p><p> In the light of the positive shift in the Irish property market and its outlook, the board of NAMA undertook a review of strategy in early 2014, and following that review we moved to take further advantage of strong investor appetite and to accelerate disposals with a view to redeeming 80% of senior debt by the end of 2016, a full two years ahead of the original schedule, and completing the deleveraging process in 2017-18. </p><p> In the context of the clear supply shortages evident in the Dublin residential and office markets, NAMA is also facilitating and funding the delivery of 4,500 new homes in Dublin and the greater Dublin area, and is also facilitating the provision of 3.84 million square feet of prime office space in the Dublin Docklands SDZ, to ensure adequate office supply to meet growing demand. </p><p> In summary Chairman, as the committee has specifically asked the question, I would say that NAMA has played an important part in stimulating activity in the market. Our interventions were at all times strategic, helping to lift the market off the floor and to stimulate activity levels that are more sustainable in the long run.  For quite a while, indeed, we were almost alone in doing this. </p><p> The fourth line of inquiry, Chairman, you asked me to deal with is the contribution to the social and economic development of the State.  In the context of the overriding commercial mandate that we have just discussed, we seek to manage our portfolio in Ireland in a manner that compliments the objectives of other public bodies, including Government departments, State agencies and local authorities.  One way that NAMA gives practical effect to this is by giving public bodies first option on the purchase at current assessed market valuations of property securing NAMA loans.  In line with that commitment we have facilitated the sale of land and property for a range of public uses including schools and healthcare facilities.  An aspect of that work that is very important to NAMA is the delivery of houses and apartments for social purposes...social housing.  Where we can make properties available for social housing in a way that is consistent with section 10, it is a win-win for everybody involved.  And we have identified more than 6,000 properties as being available and potentially suitable for local housing.  Local authorities have confirmed demand for about 2,000 of theses, and while I am a little disappointed that take-up hasn't been higher, I do understand that local authorities and the Housing Agency are obliged to comply with their own policies on the location of social housing. But we are working hard to deliver on the properties for which demand has been confirmed, and at the end of 2014 more than 1,000 had been delivered and today that figure is very near 1,200, and by the end of the year we would hope to achieve the delivery of all of the remaining properties up to the 2,000 for which the local authorities have indicated demand.  It is important to say, by the way, that it is not just a question of handing over the keys to the local authorities.  In most cases significant investment is required to complete the property and to carry out a State-wide works.  In this way, indeed, the beneficiaries of NAMA's social housing extend beyond the residents of the new properties.  For existing residents, empty houses become inhabited and outstanding works are completed and capital expenditure in excess of &euro;20 million, has been incurred to date in carrying out such work. </p><p> We also, Chairman, facilitate commercial transactions and that is another important part of work...of NAMA's work in the Irish property market that might not otherwise take place.  A good example of this is NAMA's ongoing work in identifying suitable properties for companies looking to establish or expand existing business operations in Ireland and facilitating engagement between those companies and NAMA debtors and receivers.  NAMA's work in this area is very closely aligned with that of IDA Ireland and other State agencies, whose core responsibility is to attract and expand foreign direct investment activity and employment in Ireland and there are similar examples of that, Chairman, in the written statement but I won't read them out. </p><p> NAMA makes a wider contribution also in its rent abatement initiative to help retailers that are struggling to meet their contracted rent obligations.  The aggregate annual value of abatements agreed to date is in excess of &euro;23 million. In addition to this, NAMA has agreed long-term rent reductions worth over &euro;40 million.  This does mean that NAMA has agreed to forego rent due to it, but the corollary is that we are safeguarding jobs and activity and businesses in the wider economy. </p><p> We also work hard, including through our interaction with public representatives such as yourselves, to facilitate the letting and saleing of land to local community and sporting organizations and to accommodate other local requests where we can.  And often these may not be particularly high profile initiatives but they are important locally. And a very recent illustration is our capacity to accommodate a request from the Blarney Community Association for the provision of temporary car parking facilities for the community's St. Patrick's Day festival. I just give it as an example of things we do like that.  It is totally coincidental, Chairman, that it is in Cork.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#N00300"><p>The overall point I would make, is that while NAMA is guided by its commercial objective, it doesn't operate in a vacuum.  We are conscious of the impact of our work on the wider Irish economy and on communities, and we work hard to ensure that our impact is a positive one.</p> <p>  The final line of inquiry you asked me to deal with Chairman, was the establishment of performance metrics by the board of NAMA.  The key measure of NAMA is our capacity to repay our &euro;31.8 billion debt. Progress we are making can be seen by the fact that we have already exceeded the cumulate...excuse me, 50% senior debt redemption target originally set for the end of 2016. We have done that two years ahead of schedule. </p> <p>  Last month we redeemed another billion of our senior bonds, bringing to &euro;17.6 billion the amount of senior debt that is redeemed to date.  That is 58% of the senior debt originally issued in 2010-2011.</p><p>We're able to repay our debt ahead of schedule because of the strong cash performance, the &euro;25 billion that I talked about earlier.  NAMA, while we're not a publicly limited company is an organisation that operates at the highest end of the public interest and governance spectrum.  The fact alone that NAMA must publish quarterly financial statements that are prepared in accordance with IFRS shows that NAMA also operates at the highest end of the transparency spectrum.  NAMA has adopted the best practices of corporate governance including financial and management reporting practices, board composition, and structure and risk management.  NAMA has designed and implemented a robust management information system, and has clearly defined key performance indicators in place, which form the bases of its internal reporting and monitoring framework whereby the NAMA board and sub-committees are regularly kept informed of the organisation's commercial and operational progress.  The board of NAMA also recently reviewed a C&amp;AG recommendation to the effect that it should set an expected or target rate of return to measure its overall performance, and that it should also measure its performance by reference to targets for the return on disposals, and on property held by debtors and insolvency practitioners.  In line with this, the board has approved a number of rate of return measures, which it considers appropriate for its business, and we propose to report on these additional measures in our 2014 annual report, which we expect to publish at the end of May.  </p><p>  In conclusion, Chairman, I would simply emphasise again the point I made at the outset that NAMA is here and is a key contributor to dealing with the fallout from the banking crisis and not a contributor to its cause.  I know you have asked NAMA to attend this committee in the context of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the domestic policy responses, and it is for others, including yourselves, to ultimately take a view on whether NAMA has indeed been such an appropriate and effective response.  However, I would say, in finishing up, that any assessment of this should take account of the following points: that NAMA has delivered in respect of each aspect of our mandate as laid down in the Act; we quickly and effectively acquire the eligible assets from the banks and the acquisition and evaluation of those assets has been cleared without qualification by the C&amp;AG and the EU Commission.  As the CEO has said this enabled the Irish banking system to recognise and address upfront the loan loss difficulties it had created for itself.  We have generated &euro;25 billion cash in the past five years; we have paid our own way; and we have generated profits of more than &euro;200 million in each of the last four years despite the constraints of a challenged property backed up for much of that period.</p><p> We have actively intervened in the property market in Ireland and contributed to the recovery now taking place.  That intervention was strategically timed to minimise further damage, stimulate the market at the right time, and take advantage of growing investor interest.  I do believe we called it right.  We have advanced over &euro;1 billion into construction projects in Ireland in the past five years, and we plan and have the capacity to invest another &euro;3 billion if required.  And we have, to date, funded the construction of more than 1,900 new homes in Dublin.  In fact, NAMA funded the construction of 40% of all new homes delivered in Dublin in 2014, a statistic, I think, which is telling in itself.</p><p> We have made significant progress in facilitating the timely delivery of grade A office space, retail, leisure and residential accommodation in the Dublin docklands SDZ and wider central business district, and we have the capacity to invest &euro;3 billion in this and other capital projects all over Ireland.  We have facilitated the delivery of 1,200 properties for social housing, and we will have delivered 2,000 by the end of the year.  We are supporting 15,000 jobs and trading businesses directly re-linked to our loans.</p><p> However, most important, and I'll finish on this, we have made excellent progress on debt repayment.  We are already two years ahead of target in repaying our senior debt; we're committed to repaying 80% by the end of next year; we're committed to repaying 100% by 2017-18, and we are committed to full repayment of our subordinated date.  Finally, should conditions in the economy and in the property market continue to remain favourable, we are hopeful, based on our current projections, that NAMA may realise a surplus of up to &euro;1 billion for the taxpayer by the time we complete our work.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Thank you, Mr. McDonagh.  I know that the proceedings are scheduled to run until close to 6 p.m. today, so members will have a number of opportunities to come in.  I am very conscious, though, that we need to manage this both in terms of breaks and getting through our programme as well.  We have four lead questioners this morning.  Just before I bring in our first lead, which is Senator O'Keeffe, very briefly, Mr. Daly, can I ... just going over your opening statement, and I just need to get this substantiated before I just give you one question.  Are you stating that during the crisis period borrowers were given 100% of funding to their development projects without actually having to make any cash contribution to those projects themselves while at the same times the banks were actually taking 100% exposure in terms of risk to those loans?</p></speech>

I'm not saying that that happened in every single case, Chairman, but I am saying that in terms of what we saw when we took across the loans and when we looked at the paperwork, that happened in very many cases.</p></speech>

Can you just explain briefly, just in layman's terms because the general public will be looking in at these proceedings, as to how a bank would go about valuing its assets and loan book and so forth in terms of how projected losses or profits might be incurred, and how NAMA went about its valuation of those assets when they acquired it and if there was a difference in approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#O01100"><p>I think its pretty much dealt with in Mr. McDonagh's statement.  The NAMA one is quite clear; we were required to value all of the loans as ... in terms of their valuation in November 2009, so that was a fair value event at that time.  And we went through that in a very rigorous way, which I think again is explained in Mr. McDonagh's statement and I won't repeat it.  In relation to the banks, again it's the area of they were dealing on their IFRS, they were dealing under IAS 39, which means they were the originators of the loans.</p></speech>

So if there was a slight decline they would margin in that decline to continue adding some sort of aggregated or average into the future where ... in ... when NAMA loan books were put in place were you forward looking in terms of these were the losses to be expected or where you saying well there'll still be a gradual job?</p></speech>

I mean we looked at what was the actual valuation in November '09, but we would also, every year we'd carry out a bottom-up impairment ... or exercise, which forms the basis of our impairment figure.</p></speech>

In a bank in doing its impairment exercise, it would only look at, as I say, has anything changed that I'm aware of at this point in time, 31 December, if their accounting year end was 31 December, that would cause me to say that something happened that actually would result in the cash flows, I expect then the loan not to occur.  So you can have what is called this time lag effect that while you expect maybe prices to fall in the future or the economy is going into downturn that hasn't actually happened at that point in time.  So you had this, I suppose, it's best illustrated by the following is that, you know, NAMA started acquiring the loans from institutions on 31 March 2010, but the first time the banks really recognised the scale of the losses they had was at the end of 2010 once NAMA had reported the loans, you know.  They weren't obliged to recognise those losses at 31 December 2009 because under IFRS effectively the NAMA event had not yet happened.  It was something that was going to happen after 31 December, and that is the fatal flaw in IAS 39.  And IFRS, 9, the new regulatory context coming effective 1 January 2018, actually says if you're aware that something is likely to happen then you have to take account of that of that when you do----</p></speech>

Good morning gentlemen.  I'd like if I might open by asking you to cast your minds back to the days and weeks when you first saw what those bad loans were that you'd taken on, because obviously as time passes you sort of create a new ... a new sense of them.  But if you can cast your minds back, you were if you like the citizens tasked with looking at these.  You had a huge responsibility, I think you've made that clear yourselves.  And so while others of my colleagues will, will ask for specific questions in relation to roll-ups and hair cuts, I just want to know what, what went through your minds when you saw the bad loans in those banks.  What did you think then, as opposed to what do you think about it now?</p></speech>

The European Commission didn't approve the whole validation methodology until February 2010, the end of February 2010, and we took the first loans across from the institutions, which was known as tranche one, at the end of March 2010, and, as the loan valuations were coming through during the month of March, and you know really hectic time for everybody because the Government wanted us to get on, the Central Bank wanted us to get on in terms of taking the loans across, you could see that the losses coming through were, you know, much higher than what probably anybody in the system expected.  And it almost became an event, you know, NAMA are you doing this process correctly?  You know these losses aren't expected ... you know, you know this has huge consequences for the capital of the banks and I suppose we had to ... we spent a lot of time as an executive but also at the board, looking at the valuations and saying, "Jesus they're much worse than anyone expected but we have a job to do and our job is to value the loans in accordance with the methodology approved by the European Commission and being able to stand over it" and that we did.  And I think you know thinking back to the first tranche one transfers, which happened at the end of March 2010, myself and the chairman here did a press conference, I think there was complete shock in the country and also I suppose within the system probably leading up to that day in terms of the losses that were emerging, and obviously the losses got much higher as you went  down through the portfolio.  And I suppose it came to, I suppose a head really in September 2010 when the Government instructed NAMA to acquire the residual amount of the loans in bulk form and estimate the discount to what they would eventually be.  And we estimated discounts and the discounts turned out to be, you know, 99% accurate-----</p></speech>

I came probably slightly later to this because Mr. McDonagh had been there since kind of mid-May 2009 at the preliminary stage and the board was appointed in December, so our visibility on this came around kind of December, January.  My overwhelming impression looking back on it is the ... I'm trying to find the right word but, what ... where was the business logic in a lot of this lending?  And it would be really I suppose, maybe, back to the that table we provided to the committee about the distribution of NAMA debtors.  The massive amount of lending to a very small number of people at the top, and then a lot of the what I would call  lending on hope value to people at the bottom.  A lot of that was related to land which wasn't even zoned, which had hope value more than anything else.  And then it was also I think I remember one of our surprises would have been that the banks seemed to have been acting sort of almost in isolation.  They didn't really have much interest in what a particular client's exposure was to another bank across the system.  There was no doubt, I think, in terms particularly of those to whom most had been lent on an individual basis, there was an emphasis on a kind of relationship lending as much as lending for particular projects that actually seemed feasible.</p></speech>

I don't think, by the way, I'm not ascribing any bad faith to the banks or anything here.  I'm just saying they fell into this sort of comfort zone of saying, "Ah, that's lender ... that's my client, they've a great track record, they have ... they're producing projects for lending.  That seems very, very good.  Sure, the country is on the up, everything is going grand, there's going to be a demand for all of this.  And I think a lot of that was based on a relationship or a view of the standing of the debtor, which really should have been much more objective and should have ... there should have been much more rigorous analysis and independent analysis of proposals that debtors were putting forward.</p></speech>

I mean in a population of 4.2 million, that's sort of extraordinary really.  And they warrant plcs like you'll see operating in the ... like I'm an accountant and, obviously boring in that respect, but I'd look at the UK market and see there that the plcs all there and they'd be probably the size of, you know, &euro;4 billion, &euro;5 billion, &euro;6 billion as a plc and they have access to equity and then you see individuals with you know, sole traders, not to say that they don't have skills, because they do, but it's just the fact that they really didn't have the corporate infrastructure and they might have borrowed &euro;2 billion or &euro;2.5 billion and you just find that ... I personally from coming outside the system found that extraordinary that anyone could borrow that amount of money but that's what happened and, you know, they borrowed from ... and, as the chairman said, this whole issue is that you had borrowed from my institution but the borrower had also gone down the street and borrowed from another institution then gone further down the street and found a third institution, and, by the end of the process, they had borrowed from the five institutions.  So-----</p></speech>

And that wasn't happening and that was the issue.</p></speech>

Can you just draw that out or elaborate for us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.68" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#P01900"><p>Yes, well maybe if I give sort of an example of this might be the best way to show it to you ... on day one the bank did lend 70% loan-to-value, they all seemed to ... in response to questions I put to them during 2009, all the institutions basically came back and said they were limited to a maximum 70% loan-to-value.  There was one of the institutions admitted it was lending close to a 100% loan-to-value but that was an outlier.</p><p>So, on day 1, an institution might have lent somebody &euro;70 million for a &euro;100 million project.  That would be a 70% loan to value.  Typically, what happened as property prices begin to rise, the debtor went in and said:<blockquote><br /><br />Listen, I have seen another building I want to buy.  It's &euro;100 million.  Will you lend that to me?  The reason you can lend that to me is that the original building which you lent me on which was 70% loan to value, valued at &euro;100 million, is now worth &euro;120 million.</blockquote>The bank, it seems to me, then says, &quot;Okay yes we will give you the full &euro;100 million to buy the second building so, when you look at it, we have assets worth &euro;220 million and you only have &euro;170 million worth of borrowing so that's 77% loan to value.&quot;  So it still looks very prudent to anyone who comes in to look at the paper files to say the banks are still within their limits of lending.  Of course, the issue is that, when property prices start falling, that equity which was there from &euro;100 million to &euro;120 million disappears and also the new building that you bought which was effectively 100% lending at &euro;100 million has probably dropped in value as well, so your loan valuations shoot through the roof.  So, you can say that it looked to be clever lending, it looked to be good lending at the time but effectively the debtor was not putting up any additional equity for the second asset that he bought.  He was using the increase in value of the existing building to get the money for the next thing.  We've seen examples of that in the portfolio.</p></speech>

A senior person from an institution which is not in NAMA came in to talk to me and he was talking about the lending processes.  He said to me that, at one stage, a debtor came in and said to him, "I want to borrow &euro;200 million for a project".  He said, "I asked him for a statement of his net worth."  He said he took it out of his pocket.  He said to me, "You can look at that for two minutes and then I'm taking it back off you, and he put it back in his pocket."  He said he could not wait until he left the room to write down what net worth he had.  I said "Did you lend him the money"?  He said, "Yes I lent him the money to my shame."  Effectively, somebody was perceived to be very rich and perceived to be very successful and things like this.  I am not saying that this can happen all over the place but I am only saying in terms of one example of one person who said this to me.  I think the practices got lax.  The banks were seen to be very profitable, property lending was seen to be the clever thing to do, the economy was growing very strongly.  As I said in my opening statement, there was a fundamental disconnect between property lending of the banks' balance sheets that somebody in the regulator just did not pick up on and say, "Bank lending has grown by, on average, over 30% per annum and the economy has grown between 6% and 9% per annum."  There was a complete disconnect.</p></speech>

There was an apparatus both internally and externally.  Yet you are able to say at this point that the practices were lax.  So how, what, where did that disconnect?</p></speech>

I think it didn't take somebody like myself or my colleagues or the chairman and the board to arrive in and to see this after a month or two of looking at it or looking at the data to figure out there's something fundamentally structurally wrong here, how this was not seen.  I mean, it is for others to answer about why they did not see it and, like all things, you can look to have the appearance of all the correct structures, but whether they are doing the right thing is it.  Sometimes, you know, I'm a great believer in what people call the maverick.  Somebody who asks you the questions you never thought of or not the groupthink question and saying well, "What about this, what about that."  Just to think about things in an alternative way and I think there have been other contributors here from across the spectrum to this inquiry to date.  Effectively, everybody thought there was going to be a soft landing.  Everybody thought it was a temporary slow down and that the economy would get up and running again and that it would not be as bad as it was.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be much worse than it was because I think it's key from the figures when anyone looks at them, they are publicly available if you take any of the reports from any of the banks from 2003 to 2008.  The two main banks' balance sheets were &euro;100 billion in 2003 each.  They were &euro;200 billion in 2008.  Anglo Irish Bank was &euro;25 billion in 2003, &euro;100 billion in 2008.  I mean, that was an explosive level of growth.  Where was most of that lending going?  Most of that lending was going to, effectively, the biggest component of the banks' books was commercial property lending.</p></speech>

The scale of lending in Ireland in the overall sense into property is another thing that struck me when I first came across this.  It was extraordinary.  I am talking about the period of 2006, you had &euro;160 billion loans in regard to property - land and development &euro;60 billion and commercial &euro;100 billion.  You also had on top of that &euro;140 billion lending in mortgages and another &euro;100 billion in other areas such as agriculture or industrial.  So you had &euro;400 billion being lent into the property sector at a time when the GNP for Ireland was about &euro;160 billion.  That is the overall impression I got of the extraordinary level of lending that was going into that whole property sector.</p></speech>

I am not saying all of it is not valid.  Obviously it is and there would be lending in there to agriculture and industry and retail and mortgage lending, which is obviously, in many cases, quite valid.  But &euro;400 billion into an economy where the GNP was &euro;160 billion seems to me extraordinary.</p> <p>  You asked about impressions.  The other impression, I suppose, two points.  One was the way, the extent to which interest was being rolled up by the banks.  The extent in fact, to which, in some cases, new loans were being created to take account of the rolled up interest.  That, it seemed to me, was quite unusual.  Then, I suppose, the other aspect of it was - this may have come later but certainly we became aware of it fairly quickly, the extent to which banks were not really attempting to collect income that was coming to debtors.  Rental income in particular is a case in point.  One of the things we did in NAMA when we took across the loans and when we engaged with the debtors was to say, "Well you have a loan on an asset, and that asset is earning a rental income.  Why do you think it should be going into your pocket now and not coming into NAMA"?  We set about capturing all of that rental income.  I am not sure that the banks were taking any great steps to do that in the years up to the crash.</p></speech>

I found this personally extraordinary that 80% of income could be just diverted away and nobody seemed to be following up on it.</p><p>A lot of debtors just stopped paying when the crisis happened in the case on the day, so whatever they were using that income for, they might be trying to save their businesses, put it in their business to keep going to get through this temporary crisis as was the case on the day, or some of them might be ... might try to maintain a lifestyle that they had before the crash.  So one of the first things we decided and really on day 1, once we saw this, we will say, we want that income coming to NAMA so we want that income diverted to us and we have financial monitors on trading businesses to make sure that there is not unnecessary overheads being taken out.  So, one of the key successes of NAMA is when I talked to credit rate agencies as was the case on the day, is NAMA's collected &euro;25 billion to date in five years.  We have got &euro;20 billion collected from asset sales.  We have got &euro;5 billion collected from income on the assets.  That &euro;5 billion has been crucial.  If we did not collect that income and left it with the debtor, the debtor would have probably kept it and spent it or whatever in the case on the day.  We have collected that.  That is a huge sum in terms of the amount of cash flow for any businesses and our view is that that has to go to servicing your debt or amortising down your debt or whatever the case is and you know, we controlled ... we kept income in and we controlled the amount that we give back out to allow businesses and people to run their businesses which is appropriate.</p></speech>

How did NAMA manage the process in instances where a large development was being backed by a combination of loans from participating and non-NAMA participating banks?</p></speech>

Syndicated lending is very common in other markets that effectively no banks takes a total 100% exposure to projects.  They usually try to get other banks to come in to share the risks, but in the Irish market, there was only about five syndicated loans that came to NAMA.  But it did mean that a debtor might have borrowed, say, &euro;500 million from the NAMA banks and he might have borrowed another &euro;250 million from a non-NAMA bank which was operating in the market but they were completely separate.  Usually in that situation, we ask the debtors when they submitted their business plans to tell us have you money borrowed from other banks and what is the arrangement for them.  Sometimes it is like a juggling act, that money was moving between assets which were funded by NAMA banks and assets which were funded by non-NAMA banks, by the debtor because he was trying to keep the balls in the air in terms of trying to keep everybody satisfied.   When we came in we said listen, this is our money, you have to deal with your other bank separately.  In cases of syndicate arrangements, there was a code of practice which was required as part of European Commission approval where effectively we had to work with those institutions to effectively.... we would operate together in a fair practice with each other to try and make sure both parties were not disadvantaged at ... against each other.  That was where the lending was in a common project but there was very few lending to common projects.</p></speech>

I do not think any hedge fund or equity partner would go in and partner with some of the developers and particularly in some of the large scale lending without doing an absolute, deep dive into the financial situation of the developer, into the project feasibility, into the valuation of assets because there is certainly ... One of the things that did surprise me is that in many cases, the valuation of assets which the banks took was actually provided by the debtor.  There is nothing sort of fundamentally wrong with that provided you do actually verify it and test it independently.  I do not think a hedge fund would actually have gone in without that type of analysis.  I think the other thing that a hedge fund or an equity partner will do is they will probably have rights to step in along the way.  They will have rights to actually keep intruding into the project or into what the money is being used for and how it is being spent and they would be all over you, to put it that way.</p></speech>

I mean it's very hard for us because we weren't there at the time, to see what type of relationship it is but I think in one of the questions that you asked which forms part of the booklet, you would see that the top 29 debtors, in table 6 of the supplementary booklet, borrowed &euro;34 billion and while it was spread around by banks, there was certainly a concentration of lending around one institution.  So I think the issue really comes down to the fact that, and this has been said by people in the banks before, and certainly by others, is that relationship lending was a big part of it.  You know it's almost like in terms of a horse race where you're backing the jockey rather than the horse.  It's the horse that has to win the race for you, that has to run the race for you.</p></speech>

If I can just start, I suppose, standing back from the detail, Mr. McDonagh in particular, one of the issues that we are tasked with examining is to assess the appropriateness and the effectiveness of the policy responses to the crisis and the establishment of NAMA was a key part of that and on page 9 of your opening statement I think you seek to address that, Mr. McDonagh.  We know the direct consequence of establishing NAMA.  NAMA bought loans with a par value of &euro;74 billion, paid &euro;31.8 billion, so it resulted in losses of &euro;42 billion hitting the accounts of the participating financial institutions.  The obvious alternative could have been to leave the loans relating to the property and development sector on the books of the banks and work them out over time.  You seem to come to the view that the establishment of NAMA was the correct course of action.  You say it is recognised that impaired banking systems do not tend to rectify themselves so what's your basis for saying that and your basis for believing that the establishment of NAMA, and how things worked out subsequently, was a better outcome?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#T00700"><p>Well I suppose, even though I said it, I wasn't just basing it on my own view, Deputy.</p><p>I mean, we have met other countries who have had difficulties in their banking system.  They have come to talk to us about the model pursued by NAMA and, you know ... and the type of approach, and they have followed it.  It has been endorsed both by the IMF and the ECB as being the right thing to do.  And I suppose I would, you know, in a very, I suppose, local way look at the way, I suppose, you know, we took the assets - these problem assets - out of the banking system, brought them into NAMA and had to deal with them.  And it's a very expensive consequence for the taxpayer, who's had to recapitalise on the back of that, but I think when you look at the assets which remain within the banking system, the banking system has been quite slow to deal with their existing assets.  And, whereas, you know ... in terms of NAMA, like, we're five years in, we've collected &euro;25 billion in cash and we were originally designed to maybe ... that everybody expected we'd have a ten-year life, and now we're sort of saying we'll probably be finished in eight years.  So I think, you know, we are doing what it says on the tin.  It says ... the Act says, deal with the assets expeditiously, and we're getting on and doing that.</p><p> As the chairman says in his own remarks, it'll be for others to judge whether we did a good or bad job at the end, but, you know, we believe that we're, you know, to date that we're doing everything that we are expected to do and trying to deal with the situation and the hand that we're dealt with.</p></speech>

That hole then had to be plugged by way of taxpayer recapitalisation.  In terms of the overall performance of NAMA, what you're saying is that you will pay back your &euro;31.8 billion of debt, you'll cover your operating costs and potentially have a surplus then of about &euro;1 billion.  Do you think that that is a better outturn than might've been achieved if the property and development loans were left on the books of the banks and the banks to work them out over a period of time and perhaps benefit from an uplift in property values?</p></speech>

I mean, there was this contingent liability hanging around that, you know, there'd be a black hole in NAMA and, therefore, the Government would have to cover those losses.  We're saying that's not on the ... that's on the horizon.  In fact, we're turning a surplus.</p> <p>  I mean, the issue is that the world financial markets had made the decision in ... first of all reflected in the share prices of the banks that collapsed around 2008, but also in 2010 when Ireland had to go into bailout, that the banking system really had brought ... you know, had huge consequences for the sovereign, put ... resulted in us getting a bailout from the troika.  And, I think the ... maybe if somebody wanted to do the sort of experiment of leaving these problem loans with the banks, really wasn't an option.  It wasn't an option from, I suppose, the troika in terms of this, that they decided they wanted these assets removed.</p> <p>  So, you know, other countries did different things.  Like, in the UK, they did an asset protection scheme where effectively they insured the assets of Royal Bank of Scotland, about &euro;280 billion.  And, you know ... but I suppose the big difference in terms of the UK and here was the UK probably had the firepower to be able to deal with that.  But also in terms of Ireland, once Ireland had done the bailout in September 2008, doing an asset protection scheme really wasn't an option.  It was certainly looked at by Dr. Bacon as one of the options, and it just really ... I think he concluded, which I think was a fair conclusion, that it really wasn't an option to do an asset protection scheme after doing a bank guarantee.</p></speech>

In the general sense, Deputy, I think the ECB analysis in their financial stability review of 2013, which was kind of an analysis of why a NAMA-type operation as opposed to other, is useful for ... would be useful for the committee if ... I'm sure you have it already.</p> <p>  I think there's two other points, though, as to why breaking the links with the banks was important.  First of all, the other alternative .. well, you've three possibilities.  You've nationalisation, which we're not discussing; you have leaving them with the banks.  I think the big question mark there is ... the banks have been struggling since the crash.  They're still struggling.  They're getting better.  They're improving, but they're still struggling, for example, with mortgage arrears, so they're still struggling with other property loans that are on their books.  So, you can only imagine what state they would be in if they had another &euro;74 billion on top of that.</p> <p>  I think the other point is that ... and we've discussed relationship banking earlier.  Removing the loans out into NAMA, it broke the link decisively between the originator of the loan and the borrower.  And I think that has been hugely important.  I'm not saying we don't have a relationship with our debtors &ndash; of course we do &ndash; but it's a far different relationship to the type that some of the banks have had.</p> <p>  And I think, then, there is the actual practical stuff of just concentrating all of that &euro;74 billion in one agency with one focus.  We have ... we're not distracted by anything like mortgages or anything like that.  We have one focus, which is the &euro;74 billion, the repayment of the debt.  So, there's a concentration of skills and efficiencies and costs and scale and flexibility that you could actually bring to that.  And we're able to do that when we're going to the market with asset sales or loans sales, because we're not just one bank trying to work out its own piece of the action.  We have everything.  We can look across it.  We can amalgamate portfolios.  I think it's a very-----</p></speech>

Can I raise the issue of interest roll-up?  Because a figure of &euro;9 billion is quoted in the core documents volume 1, question 7, which you ... which was returned.  That's quite a staggering figure - &euro;9 billion of interest roll-ups.  Can you explain to us in practice how that occurred?  Does it mean that many loans were not being repaid at all by debtors to the banks prior to NAMA coming on the scene?  And how could such a huge amount of interest be rolled up on those loans, or are many of those loans with no repayments being made still being regarded as performing loans in accordance with the loan agreement?</p></speech>

Mr. Daly said earlier, when you looked at the balance sheets of the banks at the end of 2008, of the &euro;160 billion that was lent in land and development lending, &euro;60 billion of that &euro;160 billion was to pure land and development lending.  Typically, land and development ... when you're involved in that type of lending, there really ... there's no income coming on the assets until the assets are built out, either rent at that stage or sold.  So, typically, in that type of lending, the banks roll up the interest.  There's interest accruing each year.

That type of lending is probably okay for an income producing asset.</p></speech>

Can I move on to the issue of the enforceability of security because issues arose around that and were identified during the legal review and it made it necessary to impose legal discounts of &euro;477 million, which is broken down on table 3, page 5 of volume 2 of the book that we have.  Can you give us an indication of the type of issues that would have arisen which necessitated writing down the value, as such, by almost a &euro;0.5 billion because of unenforceability of security?</p></speech>

I think other banks, who were not in NAMA, found the same sort of types of issues.</p></speech>

No, we've spent the last five years going through each of the loans, preparing them for sale, or preparing for enforcement, and most of that arose really in the ... probably the 18 to 24 months after acquisition, once we were getting into further detail of managing the portfolios and finding out what the...you know, checking the security further as we wanted to take asset management actions to deal with the assets.</p></speech>

I think it was by the nature, is that there's probably ... you had the big names, who are probably household names, who were involved in the big projects, and they borrowed a huge amount, as set out in the table that I mentioned in my opening remarks, in table 1, but I think you had to follow on effective people who were probably in the .. maybe some of them were in the building ... I'd say in the top 100 debtors, or the top 180 debtors in NAMA, they had some involvement previously in the construction industry and they were involved in some scale development; they might have been house builders and then they branched out into building offices or, you know, building a hotel or whatever the case is, but I think, in the ... certainly in ... after the top 180 debtors, a lot of the debtors there were ... the next, you know, 600 or so debtors, they really had ... very few of them seemed to have any expertise in construction.</p></speech>

And then we have the sub-debt, and the first repayment date on the sub-debt is 1 March 2020 and, you know, as we've said, we are very confident as of today of where we stand.

Final question.  During the course of your work you identified a lot of assets which were essentially put beyond the reach of NAMA, and you successfully reversed many of those transactions and brought them within the ambit of NAMA.  Can you characterise the nature of some of those transactions and give us any information you have on the scale of such transactions which you've managed to have successfully reversed?</p></speech>

Well, I suppose there's two types in terms of that.  We've got about &euro;800 million of additional security from debtors, in terms of ... as quite a, you know ... this is additional assets that they had.  Probably about &euro;300 million of that additional security debtors decided that they would transfer them to third parties, friends, relatives, rather than hand them over to the banks or NAMA, and they probably had about &euro;500 million worth of additional assets which were effectively unencumbered additional assets that they have that they had never given up the security.  So when we went through the business plan with debtors we said to them, "Give us a list of your asset transfers in the last five years, and tell us what level of unencumbered assets you were."  And, I suppose, everybody was thinking that all these people had a huge amount of assets outside the system, the case in the day.  And when you look at it, that these same people had borrowed &euro;74 billion, but all they had was &euro;800 million worth of assets effectively outside the system, so it really ... they hadn't put that much aside in terms of the amount of money that they had borrowed, so we said to debtors, "If you want to work with NAMA and to prevent us taking enforcement action against you, or to prevent us taking actions under the NAMA Act, and with a very powerful section, under 2(11) of the NAMA Act, where we can pursue reversal of asset transfers, you bring those assets back in and give them to NAMA as additional security."  And the majority of people did do that as part of their co-operation with NAMA.</p></speech>

Thanks, gentlemen.  If I could reprise very briefly the issue that was raised at the beginning of the meeting in relation to the type of securities or non-security that the banks required for large loans.  Just very briefly to quote Mr. Daly.  You said, &quot;The developer's equity contribution was a form of a rolling-up of unrealised paper profit from other developments.&quot;  You said, &quot;In reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions.&quot;  You said:<blockquote><br /><br />The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  In the event of a crash the banks stood to take 100% of the losses.  That is what happened.</blockquote>You said, &quot;The model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility.&quot;  And finally, Mr. Daly, you said:<blockquote>Very little, if any, consideration was given to the inherent cyclical nature of the property markets.  The attitude appears to have been that the only way was up, that somehow the forces of gravity were suspended as far as the Irish market was concerned, and the long established pattern of property market cycles was no longer relevant.</blockquote>Now, Mr. Daly, when the Chair asked you, you weren't prepared to say, or you couldn't say, because you hadn't direct knowledge, that the relationship that was the subject of this, these actions, was as a result of a deferential relationship between a borrower and a lender.  I can understand why you would say that.  But would you say, objectively speaking, what you found showed a reckless behaviour by the banks?</p></speech>

It just seemed to me, in the context of what we found, that there was more that could have been done.

Now, tragically in some cases it happens with people who are disturbed or are on psychedelic drugs.  Now, presumably, that didn't apply to the banks when they were dealing with the developers.  But, really, the list that you have outlined here - could I put it to you like this: that perhaps an ordinary citizen out there, or a taxpayer who is paying the price for all this, would say that what you have put here is a damning indictment of the practice by some, at least, if not all banks?</p></speech>

Were you driven too much by competition with other banks?"  Because there was, and it's been said before this committee before now, a sort of a follow the crowd, a kind of a herd instinct.  How much were they influenced by the talking up of property, right across the Irish sort of spectrum, about the very favourable economic backdrop that was there up to 2008?  We'd great growth, we'd great growth predictions, we'd the fastest growing economy in Europe, remember.</p><p>How much were they influenced by all of that as opposed to how much were they looking at the individual application for a loan for this project, for this amount of money, with, as my colleague has said, particularly in land and development where you will not expect a stream of income for ... I would also look, by the way, at the make up of who was actually borrowing at that time because that changed, and I know one of your previous contributors has indicated the way in which syndicates became a particular feature of the property market in the period preceding the crash.  If I were in a bank I would certainly be looking beyond that syndicate and I would be looking at who's in it, where's the expertise and how much did they know about the property market.</p></speech>

Now, banks presumably are hard-nosed business enterprises who shouldn't be influenced by loose talk.  I mean if a scientist is sitting in a pub and everybody around him is saying there is no such thing as gravity ... I mean there is a lot going on but he won't believe it, or she won't believe it, but apparently the banks did.  How can that be?</p></speech>

You also had it, by the way, in the people who were actually borrowing.  It is interesting you should mention pub talk.  When you look at the lower tranche of people who borrowed, the 627 in the 16 billion category, a lot of those were in property syndicates.  A lot of that was based, I think, on what has been described in the past as sort of golf club talk - that property is the place to be, if you're not in property you're not really in the game at all.  So I think right across the spectrum there was a lack of rigour in wondering what we were getting into and I think you would have to ask the banks the extent to which they actually subscribe to that view or not.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh, you present us with a table on page ten of your introduction showing &euro;34 billion was lent to 29 individual borrowers.  You said 12 individuals of these accounted for &euro;22.2 billion, including three total loans greater than &euro;2 billion, nine total loans between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion.  Then on page 11 you said lending on this scale suggests that banks considered property lending a one away bet.  Could I put it to you, if what you have said this morning and what Mr. Daly said this morning ... and these figures, do they or not amount to a damning indictment of what the banks were doing during the bubble period?</p></speech>

I have often asked myself how did nobody pick up on this? How did a regulator not pick up on this? Because while the banks might be justified that they were lending what they thought to be ... what they thought were good borrowers and good projects, it does not seem to me that anybody looked and said listen, are these same names turning up in institution a,b, c, d, e and f.  And I think when you ... if you looked at it which we did when we got the data together and we got through ... and it was very quickly obvious that this level and concentration of lending was done, I don't think you'll find that level of lending anywhere.</p></speech>

But I don't think any of their shareholders, whether they be the individual that has a few shares in the bank or an institutional shareholder who as a pension fund might have a large percentage sharehold in the bank, was in any way aware that the concentration of lending was like this.  I just think that is highly unusual.</p></speech>

I'll move on briefly now.  Deputy McGrath dealt with the &euro;9 billion in rolled-up interest.  I won't ask you to repeat that, but just to comment on the distribution by the individual institutions of that &euro;9 billion in terms of the ... in terms of the actual interest charged to individual institutions.  Could you do that briefly please?</p></speech>

We estimated that that &euro;9 billion was broken down as follows; AIB about just over &euro;3 billion, Allied Irish Bank &euro;3 billion, Bank of Ireland &euro;1.8 billion, INBS &euro;1 billion and EBS &euro;0.1 billion.</p></speech>

If I might move on then to an issue that has also been dealt with in the sense of the type of security, or not security, that was given by borrowers, that the banks did or did not demand.  That has been dealt with quite comprehensively but can I just ask you finally on that, were there variances by scale of debtor in regard to this practice?  You refer to somebody taking paper out of their pocket and showing it to a banker and this was accepted as good coin.  Did the ... how ... did acceptance of that relate to the scale or the wealth of the person seeking loans?</p></speech>

That is one of the fundamental principals of banking, but I think that there was so much lending, at such a volume of lending at the time that up until 2010, until it was outlawed by the Law Society, banks probably relied on third party solicitors more to take security for them, and relied on that.  There has been a number of cases where banks have sued solicitors where the form of security was defective.  I just think there was such a volume and scale of activity that it was all about more and more lending as opposed to concentrating and doing the sort of nitty gritty, ensuring that you had correct security over it.  I mean, if you think about it Deputy, we almost ... we knocked about &euro;500 million off the price we paid the banks at acquisition in terms of insufficient security, and we knocked over &euro;300 million subsequently, that's about &euro;800 million.  That's about 1% of the loans, just over 1% of the loans that actually ... that came to NAMA, &euro;74 billion.  I think it was expensive for them.  It cost them &euro;800 million in terms of lost money that they didn't need to lose but I certainly think that it is not on the scale that would indicate a systemic problem, it just indicated a bit of a ... it was probably a lot of it down to the volume of activity and not enough dotting the i's and crossing the t's.</p></speech>

Mr Daly, on page 16 of your introduction you say  "NAMA may realise a surplus of up to &euro;1 billion for the Irish taxpayer by the time it completes its work."  Do you mean by this that the projection you make is that when NAMA is wound up you will have paid to the banks the &euro;31.8 billion that was agreed in September 2009 for the loans that you took - you'll have paid that from the properties you sold or from income like rent for the properties before you sold them - that you'll also have paid the same banks' interest in the interim on those loans, covered your own running costs and there will be &euro;1 billion surplus? Is that in a nutshell what you mean?</p></speech>

Now, can I ask you there, Mr. Daly ... no, I understand the elements are, as I've ... in general as I've outlined, but can I ask you this: is it fair, from the viewpoint of the Irish people, to call this a surplus or a profit?  Now, let me just explain.  The chief executive told us, on page 3, "NAMA paid the [banks] &euro;5.6 billion more than the private sector market would have paid them at the time of acquisition."  In fact, the EU said this was state aid.  Not only that but the valuation was set at 30 September, I think, 2009.</p></speech>

And then Mr. McDonagh, chief executive, said, "NAMA had to absorb losses arising from the impact of the 25%-30% decline in Irish property values ... right up to the end of 2013."  Mr. McDonagh continues, "Essentially, therefore, the institutions [i.e., the banks] would have been paid about &euro;22 billion by the market."  In other words, if the supposed rules of the capitalist markets applied, the banks would have been given &euro;10 billion less for the loans that you bought than you actually gave them.  So, Mr. Daly, rather than a &euro;1 billion surplus to taxpayers, would it be more accurate to say that NAMA was used to give a further &euro;10 billion by way of a bailout to the banks on top of the &euro;40 billion that the taxpayers were forced to put in?  Or could I ask you, to put it another way, instead of your &euro;1 billion, should it ... should you say there was a loss of &euro;49 billion rather than a surplus of &euro;1 billion?  Would that more accurately sum up, or not, the situation?</p></speech>

What we're saying is that on top of everything that NAMA will repay, we will make &euro;1 billion of a surplus.  Now, if NAMA had paid the banks &euro;10 million ... &euro;10 billion less, the reality is that that money would have had to be put into the banks anyway, you know, they would have had to be recapitalised.  So you really ... and that's all coming ... still coming from the taxpayer.</p></speech>

All we're saying is that on our performance on top of that we will not just realise every bit of debt that was incurred, not just cover our own expenses, but return a surplus.  Now, you go back to the ... you go back to the early days of NAMA and the debate about NAMA and all of the talk about NAMA being another big black hole and they would never actually repay anything like the senior debt or the subordinated debt and they would make a massive loss, we're saying no, that's not the case, that will be reversed and we will make a-----</p></speech>

We had an extraordinary economic situation at that time.  The whole credibility of this country was at stake.  Fundamental to that credibility issue was what was going on in the banks, what was on the balance sheet of the banks.  The whole ... to quote somebody, I think from Sweden, a hole in the balance sheets of the banks is a hole in the balance sheets of the banks.  Don't let's fudge it.  You had various options, which were open to Government, and I'm not going to get into a political debate.  The asset management agency approach was taken, given the scale of what was involved in Ireland, and that is what ... that is the mandate, that's where NAMA started from.</p></speech>

That's what I'm ... just the last theme, Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh, because time is ... now, both of you will say and you indicated that NAMA has been essentially a very socially progressive influence in relation to how it has operated and the outcome.  Can I just put a quote to you, which is from the chief executive of Blackstone, which is a major fund that NAMA has sold a lot of property to?  And this person says, a few years ago, "As we look at the current situation in Europe, we are basically waiting to see how beaten up people's psyches get, and where they're willing to sell assets ... You want to wait until there's really blood in the streets."  Now, Mr. Daly, with that type of philosophy, you have sold substantial assets in this country to funds like this.  Some would say vulture funds; I won't comment.  How can it possibly be in the interests of the Irish people ... and just to say, Mr. David McWilliams, whom you're familiar with-----</p></speech>

I'll be very brief.  The dynamic, says Mr. McWilliams :<blockquote><br /><br />The dynamic of foreign funds buying up Irish property at deep, deep discounts, only to sell the same assets on in a few years at a significant profit, is the Hibernian piece in a global jigsaw which is seeing the very rich get even richer.  To misquote Dr. Spock, &quot;It's capitalism, Jim, but not as we know it.&quot;  </blockquote>He goes on to say that ... in other words, that it's deeply, and will be deeply damaging, that this type of speculation is now taking place in the wake of what NAMA has done as supposed rescue of the situation, that, in fact, it's deeply negative.  And, lastly, that ... are there apartment owners or people who have mortgages-----</p></speech>

I'm not going to comment on it but I think it does actually point to the fact that if they were coming to Ireland in the years after NAMA was established expecting that they were going to pick up cheap assets, they didn't, because we didn't put them on the market.  There were plenty that came in.  They kicked the tyres.  They offered us derisory prices and we said:<blockquote><br /><br />Go away.  Cop yourselves on.  Go off.  We're not under pressure to sell here.</blockquote>And we weren't under pressure to sell because we had the UK market being actually good to us, which is the point I made in my statement.  So we didn't sell at fire sale prices.</p><p>As to whether they are all vulture funds or whatever, you know they are investing in Ireland now.  And whether you like it or not, we actually do believe for a functioning property market, we do actually need investors coming in.  I would love to see more Irish investors buying Irish assets and I am glad to say that is beginning to happen, you have investors coming from all over the world.  But you know, in some cases these are ... I know the white tailed eagle in your own home county, Deputy, may not be totally accepted, but in some cases these investors coming into Ireland are actually good for the country.  The main point is that we have not been selling cheaply, we have not been fire selling, and, in fact, we are at the situation now where it is impossible really to forecast when a market will peak or what is the optimum day that you sell your assets.</p><p> But I think we have called it right in relation to that.  So, if you go back to that quote from Blackstone ... I think you went and you asked any of the funds that have been dealing with us over the last four or five years how they found NAMA to deal with, the one word that would come through is "tough" and "difficult.", and looking always for the best price.</p></speech>

But most of the money that these private equity buyers have is secured ... is institutional money.  And is typically from US endowment funds and college funds and things of the day.  And you know, like the teacher's fund and Calpers and things like this.  And ... and ... they give the money to these private equity funds to invest it for them and to earn a return.  And those people when they are giving their money to these funds insist on a certain level of governance and things like that.  Whether the issue of about ... whether it is regulated in each end of the market they are operating in, you know, I am not an expert in that either.  But ... but they do have to observe the laws in each particular jurisdiction.</p></speech>

And part of the problem that was in the property market here over the years has been the almost total reliance on bank ... bank debt.  So I think in future if you have a mixture of that, of equity and debt funding, you are getting away from a vulnerable model and you are getting in some of these investors, the type of ones that Mr. McDonagh has talked about, that they have a longer-term horizon.  So you get a more stable involvement and, crucially, when they buy properties they invest in them and they develop them out and they refurbish them.  And that is creating activity in the construction sector as well.</p></speech>

And this is a presentation you made, Mr. McDonagh to the Public Accounts Committee on the 13 January 2011, "The loans transferring to NAMA was actually going to be less than the 30% estimate in the Minister [...] Minister's September announcement."  As it transpired, the real discount that has been applied across all five institutions to date is, as we all now know, an average of 58%.  Could you explain how we moved from a position where it was going to be less than 30%, to an average amount of 58%?</p></speech>

When we were compiling information from the institutions during the summer 2009, which was pre-NAMA - the NAMA Act hadn't been passed at that stage, it was purely an information exchange between the banks and myself and my team - we asked the banks what their loan to values were.  They typically, as I said earlier, came back and said that their loan to value lending was around 70%, except for one institution which said it was lending about 100% loan to value.  And we did an estimation that, based on their returns ... that they ... that their average loan to value lending at origination was around 77%.  Subsequently, when the banks provided the information to us as part - when the NAMA Act was passed, that they were giving us information as part of the loan transfer - and we looked at the valuations of the property and ... then came to our own conclusion was that the loan to value ratios were probably closer to 100%, rather than 77%.  And therefore that would result for the majority of the increase in the discount from 30% towards mid-50s.</p></speech>

It is in the booklet here.  There  is a copy of the questionnaire I sent to the banks.  I asked the banks a number of questions about the type of books that they had, how much loans were performing, what was their loan to value ratios, what was the geographic breakdown?  It was a high level information, initial fact finding exchange that the banks were told to co-operate with me, as the interim managing director of NAMA at that stage, to get high level information from the banks.  They weren't obliged to give any specific information ... they were ... it was up to them to provide information to me and co-operate with me.  That was the direction from the Minister and the Regulator to them.  And subsequently, when we actually got the real information after the NAMA Act was passed, the only reasonable conclusion that myself and my colleagues could draw was that the loan-to-value ratios were not what was represented to us.</p></speech>

Again, once we got the loans and we sat down and started analysing the loans.  At the end of 2010, which was the first reporting period, we were obliged do it ... it turned out to be 23%.</p></speech>

I mean I asked the banks for information, they gave me an estimate that there about 40% of them were income producing when you compiled them with ... across those institutions.  When we actually acquired a loan that turned out to be 23%.  Then all we can look at then once we acquire them is saying, you know, is our definition of performing different maybe to their definition of performing, you know.  So I have to report on the facts as I find them, and I am statutorily bound as a NAMA board is to report on the facts as we find them, and we reported the facts post-acquisition that their performance level was 23%.</p></speech>

I do apologise for this - I just want to go back to the previous point that I was discussing with you in relation to the loan, with your permission please.  In that ... sorry, in the loan amount that was transferred.  When it was said it was less than 30%, but it turned out to be 58%.  In that same Public Accounts Committee meeting, Mr. McDonagh, you said:<blockquote><br /><br />I, [yourself] and my chairman, Mr. Daly, had met with the Garda and have exchanged correspondence with the Financial Regulator's office on this matter.  We made it clear that our legal advice is that the loan to value information was provided at a time before the enactment of the NAMA legislation.  As the NAMA Act did not exist at that time, any examination of the information provided prior to the Act could not be carried out under the NAMA Act or be actionable by NAMA under section 7 or section 203 of the Act.  That of course does not mean that it is not a matter worthy of consideration by other authorities with the relevant powers.  The Financial Regulator, as far as I am aware, is responsible for the conduct of the financial institutions, and is also responsible for ensuring the publicly quoted banks provide correct and timely information to the market.  </blockquote>Have you had any other correspondence with the Financial Regulator in relation to the 30% ... less than 30% figure that was given initially that turned out to be 58% in practice?</p></speech>

I'll get the exact term that he used, I think - "a debt collection agency".  You seemed a little bit piqued at that.  Do you feel that is an unfair characterisation of NAMA?</p></speech>

Personally, I know Peter.  Peter's a good guy, but I just thought, and in fairness to him he did say on the day of the evidence that effectively he didn't have any particular insight into NAMA that was just his opinion.  So, and I suppose what I'm pointing out here is that just to, I suppose from the record from our point of view, we do many other things which is not just a pure remit of a debt collection agency.  We are obliged to collect debts, that's what we're expected to do and we do it, and we do it to the best of our ability, but we do many other things, as I outlined in my statement.</p></speech>

So I suppose that is the question that's being put to you.  Has there been mission creep, or mission drift?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.299" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#AA01000"><p>No, but I think what you have to take into account, Chairman, is Mr. Bacon produced a report, and then that report became the basis of a NAMA Act, which went through a very extensive consultation process - there were something like 400 amendments put during the passage to the Oireachtas.   So I don't think there ... certainly the most important thing for us would be that there is absolutely no mission creep from the Act, because the Act is our ... viable, not any report, and there certainly hasn't been.  But I've reread Dr. Bacon's report recently in the context of this hearing and I would certainly say there has not been any significant mission creep from that.  I think he might have had a general view.  I know he gave evidence to the committee, for example, back in that ... or he didn't give evidence, but I think it was quoted to him by somebody in the committee that in 2010 he had said we should have sold assets quicker, and I think he said this he was maybe being quoted out of context.  So, certainly no mission creep, mission drift.</p></speech>

But if I wanted to say what were the three top ones it would be the irresponsible developer funding, the absence of market analysis and then there would be zoning and planning policy because to a certain extent actually that and market analysis are they're, they are a bit of the same thing.  The tax incentives is one, obviously I have an interest in that from my previous existence, but the reality is that the tax incentives that were there during that period, were probably ... I'm not saying that some of them weren't justified, initially they certainly were, but certainly some of them continued far too long as you know there's hardly any left in that.  I chair the Commission on Taxation, as the Chairman mentioned in his opening remarks, and we just identified three instances where tax incentives might be appropriate, that is, to correct market failure, to attract mobile investment and to offset shortcomings in other policy areas.  I think when some of those incentives were developed, they were definitely fitted into those criteria, the reality is over the years they didn't fit any of them and they were still continued ... so I think that was ... Then consumer mortgage lending ... again, I'm not sure there was any great irresponsible mortgage lending as such but again you were lending into a market where prices were grossly inflated and therefore the value of mortgages were grossly inflated. </p></speech>

Some of that has been presented already and I referenced in my statement, and there are two or three other reports due to come in the next couple of months.

But the banks took a &euro;42 billion loss and that loss had to be covered by recapitalisation of the banks by the taxpayer.  So, you know, everybody talks about the &euro;64 billion that went into the banking system.  Over &euro;40 billion of that was accounted by losses related to NAMA's assets but also another &euro;20 billion was related to losses in relation to loans, loans which never came near NAMA.</p></speech>

We were told &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million; the expectation was NAMA would have a write-down of less than 30%, it was double that.  Did the bank guarantee and then the establishment of NAMA with the crystallisation of the losses to the banks, did that lead to the national bailout in your view, Mr. Daly?</p></speech>

I think NAMA certainly brought great clarity to the property end of it, and the real question would be if NAMA hadn't done that, you would still have had those loans on the books of the banks.  The capital markets would have taken an even more jaundiced view of Ireland and of the banking and financial system in particular.  So what we did was we removed &euro;74 billion, we helped stabilise the banks we helped stabilise their capital adequacy, we gave them bonds which were actually collateral that could be used with the ECB so that, to enable them to get back into some sort of commercial reality or commercial lending.  But NAMA and property was not the only issue around at the time of the guarantee.</p></speech>

The share price had plummeted substantially, I mean the share prices of, say the two main banks, were probably &euro;16 and &euro;20 probably back in January 2007 and in late 08, early 09 their share prices were down to maybe 5 cent to 10 cent.  So the markets had decided that the banks had a big problem and people were just selling their shares in the banks rapidly which drove down the share price.  I think that, you know, markets have no sentimentality, they don't care how much profits you made in previous years, they care about the situation as of now and what they see, and they made the view that the banking system really was in big difficulty and the reality was that the only option to secure the banking system was for the State to rescue it.  By the State rescuing it, it resulted in that the international community was lending to Ireland as a sovereign through the NTMA, was no longer going to lend to Ireland as a sovereign because of the weight of the losses in the banking system which needed to be rescued by the State.  That resulted ultimately in the bailout.</p></speech>

There were lots of discussions going on, including on that Sunday, the day before, which was basically talking about would the NTMA provide additional funding to the banks.  We already had some bank deposits with the banks and things like that, but there was no substantive discussion about the bank guarantee.  The first I heard that they had decided the bank guarantee, had guaranteed the banks, was about 1 o'clock in the morning when we were told and that's the way it was.</p></speech>

So what was the NTMA's view of the guarantee when it was put in place?</p></speech>

The whole issue of the guarantee was going to be announced the following morning, if you recall, when the markets opened, to get ready so that it could be explained to the markets that the Government had entered into a bank guarantee.  Myself and Mr. Whelan's view at the time was that this would weigh heavily on the sovereign and would weigh heavily on the cost of money, the cost at which we could raise money in the markets.</p></speech>

So when you left the building that night was there any further discussion with the Taoiseach, the then Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance officials, was it a case of this is what it is and thank you, good night?  Or did you go into a huddle with them to say this is how it is going to play out?</p></speech>

The Attorney General and Minister Lenihan had left at that stage, which was basically around whether the guarantee applied just as an Irish entity or whether it applied to oversea subsidiaries.  My technical advice was that overseas subsidiaries had also borrowed in their own name, and that it would be very hard to limit the guarantee only to the Irish operations and not to the overseas subsidiaries.  People are linked to AIB as an entity, by and large, not just AIB UK or whatever the case is.  That was the only technical thing.  It lasted about 90 seconds.  I left the room.  Myself and my colleague, Mr. Whelan, left Government Buildings probably about, I do not know what time it was, 3:30 a.m. or 4 a.m. in the morning.  I went off then to prepare for being ready for the opening of the markets at 7 o'clock.</p></speech>

And it is important just to try to patch together, you know, the events of the night.  Can I just return in relation to NAMA.  Mr. Daly, you mentioned that there was an explosion of credit and a huge amount of credit into the Irish economy.  In relation to the &euro;74 billion worth of loans that were transferred to NAMA, how much of them were in the Irish State?  In terms of percentage wise?</p></speech>

In relation to the security that underpinned some of these loans, and you mentioned in volume 2, page 5, table 3 and again volume 1, page 4, table 2, where NAMA wrote down &euro;477 million as a result of not being able to ... inadequate security, and then claimed back &euro;334 million from the banks for the same purposes, which totals &euro;811 million of unenforceable securities.  I assume, and correct me if I am wrong, that that is at the consideration price, that that is not at the par value.</p></speech>

And I am record before, Deputy, in terms of this, that in tranche 1, there were &euro;1 billion worth of loans from one particular institution which did not transfer to us in tranche 1 because when they looked at security, they did not have first rank on security and they had to go to the courts to perfect our security.</p></speech>

So we will say to the debtor, you know, "We need you to sign new loan documentation to remedy the security." Clearly the debtor knows what the issue is.  But I suppose he has to think in terms of this, unlike the banks who have five institutions, and he could say to one institution, "I do not need to deal with you because you know, that is your problem."  Whereas with us, he was aggregated and we had a lot of levers to be able to encourage him to co-operate with us.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly, you mentioned commercial property was basically NAMA is commercial property, the &euro;74 billion, the majority of this is commercial property and you give a good breakdown in relation to where the institutions and the type of property that were held in volume 2, page 7.  We have the consideration amount, the &euro;32.4 billion that was paid and we can see very clearly that, for example, you paid over &euro;3 billion for hotels, &euro;14.9 billion for investment properties which are office blocks and retail I assume, &euro;4.9 billion for residential and development property &euro;1.5 billion and land &euro;7.8 billion.  Do we have a breakdown of the actual par value of this?  What was the ... What I am trying to understand is what was the write down for example in hotels, was it 57%, was it greater or was it less?  You have talked to the committee about up to 90% write down in land.  Do we have any idea in terms of five categories there, what were the individual write downs?</p></speech>

It was very unusual structure of lending.  It was not just lending to hotels.  There was, within the same loan, there was land lending, there was hotel lending, there was office lending, so it was very hard to disaggregate it out in the way that you requested.</p></speech>

The average discounted of that is around 75% so we ended up paying about &euro;10 billion for the land and development loans if you add those two categories together.  And all the other categories which are grouped together, known as investment loans, is about &euro;34 billion par debt and the average discount is around 36% and that is so you would get about &euro;22 billion, so you sorry, &euro;21.8 billion plus &euro;10 billion is &euro;31.8 billion is what we would pay for it.</p></speech>

The picture that you both painted of Irish banking when you went in ... &euro;2.5 billion you found borrowed with no collateral and you've recouped &euro;5 billion which the banks weren't collecting.  Are those numbers correct, for a start?</p></speech>

In fact, just to correct the record - and thank you for the opportunity in relation to Deputy Doherty ... I've just went back through my notes, because there's such a volume of notes ... the value of collateral where we paid nil consideration was &euro;3.5 billion in nominal terms.  It wasn't &euro;2 billion - it was &euro;3.5 billion.  And, yes, we have collected &euro;5 billion of income on the portfolio since the start, yeah.</p></speech>

They seemed to centralise all decisions and that the conservative old-style bank management based in towns around the country which, you know, didn't lose much money was replaced by one which was meant to be better, obviously, but do you think moving discretion and moving local managers caused a gap between the manager and the people who were doing the borrowing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#HH00700"><p>I think there's probably two elements to that, Senator.  There's no doubt that local managers would have been more in touch with what was going on in a particular locality.  And, in terms of what we talked earlier in relation to, I suppose, planning and zoning and hope value, local managers I think would probably have been more on top of that.  On the other hand, it may be that the amount of discretion allowed to local managers was not consistent, let's say, across the banks or even maybe within some banks.  The centralisation of lending certainly probably had the capability to bring a greater discipline to it, and you could expect, in fact, that that's where the greater ... the better analysis of overarching or macro market demand and supply might have been better located.</p> <p>  I suppose the one thing we would say is that, in terms of the documentation that came across to us in relation to the loans, is that I think part of the problem that the banks had in the end was the way in which, in many cases, the actual loan documentation and the detail about the origination of the loans was actually located in the local banks rather than necessarily all centralised in a particular ... one particular IT record or whatever.  And that in itself probably created some difficulties for the banks.  Again, that's in terms of what we saw in the documentation coming across.  So, if you have dispersed lending, if you don't have centralisation of records and if you don't have that sort of centralised oversight, then you do run the risk of not having a full picture of what your lending is.</p></speech>

Because you probably remember the controversy of whether it should be done in the Central Bank or some amalgam or an entirely separate body, as was recommended by the McDowell report.</p></speech>

Indeed, I'm not going to be very definitive about it because I was outside the system and I'm only really somebody looking in from outside.  I think, in terms of the principles that were there in the regulatory system - p-r-i-n-c-i-p-l-e-s as against to p-a-l-s - certainly, I think those principles were by and large pretty okay.  The ... it is, I think, commonly agreed that the difficulty was in the application of those principles and, in particular, the whole concept of a principles-based approach.  I think, going back to my own opening statement ... where we need to get to is one where there is a more rigorous regulatory system, but we do, I would say, need to be sure that we don't fall into the trap of making that so onerous and detailed that it actually stifles the banks in their recovery in their future business.</p></speech>

And again, certainly as a lay person, I'd find it difficult enough - and I'm not an auditor and I'm not an accountant ... the problem seems to have been recognised two to three or maybe more years ago.  It's a puzzle to me as to why it is taking so long to actually ... because it will only kick in in respect of reporting periods after 1 January 2018.  Now, what I have to accept is that IFRS is a worldwide standard and there're a whole lot of countries and a whole lot of individual regulatory bodies to ... who have to buy into that.  It does seem to be me to be an inordinately long time.</p></speech>

Is that dangerous?  I mean, that's what happened the last time.  When do we turn that off lest we precipitate another bubble, which some people fear?</p></speech>

So, if you take that as a starting point ... but if you take it that there is a market that, for a number of years now, has been pretty much dead in terms of activity, in terms of the provision of much needed office space, particularly grade A space in the Dublin central business district, and if you take, in particular, the problem that there is in housing in this country, or particularly in the capital and some of the other urban areas, then there is a case to step in - for NAMA to step in - both because we have the capital wherewithal to do it, but also because a lot of the debtors who are in NAMA, whether you like it or not, are the ones who have the ... possibly the capacity to do some of that activity.</p><p>I mean, housing I think is a particularly interesting one because that supply has fallen to really very, very low levels.  There were just over 11,000 completions in 2014, 3,200 or 3,300 of those were in Dublin.  The telling statistic is that, of those 3,300, NAMA delivered about 40% of them, so there would have been relatively little delivery of housing in Dublin in the last year or so if NAMA had not been active in that market  And that level of completions is well short of what the ESRI is predicting or the housing agency is predicting.  They're all predicting a minimum of something like 70 to 80 or 90-----</p></speech>

Were we prepared for the euro, where wholesale deposits can flow in ... a banking system traditionally based on deposits and not wholesale lending, not knowing what to do with the extra money ... and, I mean, should we, as a nation ... worked out what would happen in the euro currency much better than we actually did?</p></speech>

We were concerned about certain aspects of it.  There'd be a lot of debate about the rate of interest; I think there was little enough debate about whether that would suddenly ... that tap would suddenly be turned off.</p></speech>

I think, when you look at the ... again, at the growth in the balance sheets of the banks between 2003 and 2008 ... the banks were lending, but they were effectively lending to a longer-term asset class, which was property, but they were funded by short-term cheap, wholesale money market deposits.  So, they were borrowing at, you know, one month, three month, six months at around 2% ... a lot of it, you know, German money coming into Ireland, looking for a home.  And, you know, once the crisis happened, all those depositors withdrew, took their money back and the banks were left long on assets but short on cash and, of course, that again precipitates, I suppose, the initial ... and I've looked at this across other banking systems which collapsed - I know some of you have as well - and it's a common feature, you know, the quick liquidity leaves the system first and, you know, and then you've got to try and fiddle that liquidity gap.  So, it's not uncommon that the first signs of a banking crisis is that people think there's a liquidity crisis, and, in fact, it's not a liquidity crisis at all.</p></speech>

I think what was beginning to happen in September 2008 and, you know, my perception of it now, as opposed ... other people have their own perceptions of it, but ... was that the Department of Finance, I think, were becoming understandably concerned maybe about the Central Bank and the regulator and the banking system.  And the way it was put to us was that would we come to a meeting, I remember it was a Saturday morning in ... I think around the second Saturday in September 2008, will we come to a meeting in the Central Bank ... with the Central Bank ... with the Central Bank at the Department of Finance, and just sit there and listen and observe and, you know, advise the Department if there was anything we thought that they mightn't have fully understood.

The NTMA were instructed to engage an adviser, which was Merrill Lynch, I think around 22 September 2008 or 23 September 2008.  Merrill Lynch were on the scene for about a week before the bank guarantee and that's ... and there was sort of work going in, in terms of looking at options.

I mean Merrill Lynch were working ... let's just put it like this: Merrill Lynch were contracted by the NTMA, because that's what the NTMA were instructed to do, but Merrill Lynch were effectively working for, let's just call it "the system", which, I mean, and the central nervous ... or, sorry, you know, the system was really being controlled by the Department of Finance, who had, I suppose, in terms of the central role, in terms of advising Government.</p></speech>

Thank you.  Just now to look back at NAMA then since the beginning of its operation.  One of the questions and one of the things that we've heard through previous testimony is about a possible delay in establishing NAMA.  Was there a delay, from when it was first signalled to the first tranche being completed?</p></speech>

NAMA was announced as a concept in the supplementary budget in April 2009.  Work had to go on to prepare new legislation and that first draft of that legislation was published on 30 July 2009, it was put out for a consultation and it went back into the D&aacute;il in the Second Stage and I think on 16 September 2009; and between 16 September 2009 and, I think, sometime around 21 or 22 November 2009, I think there was 400 amendments proposed to the legislation.  And I think it was finally signed into law by the President towards the end of November 2009 and the board was brought into operation I think on 22 December 2009 and I was appointed chief executive on that day.</p><p>And that was fine in terms of a national piece of legislation, but we had no authority to start taking any loans from the banks until the European Commission gave approval.  And the European Commission did not give approval to NAMA until the end of February 2010, and the first loan transfers started to transfer from the banks one month later, at the end of March 2010.  And the loan transfers then continued on for effectively 18 months, but 95% of the loans were transferred to NAMA by the end of 2010.</p></speech>

I mean, if it was feasible in April 2009 to say we're just taking &euro;70 billion of loans out of the banking system, dropping them on Treasury Buildings and just deal with it like that - but that clearly, with 12,000 loans, 5,000 borrowing entities, 60,000 individual properties, that was never feasible.</p></speech>

I mean, it probably wasn't feasible.  I'm just wondering about what it might have allowed debtors to do with some of their affairs, which have then had to have been pursued by the agency but did it allow the banks, I mean ... or not did it allow the banks? ... Were you aware of the banks treating debtors any differently in that period?  When we look at things like the change in the assumptions about interest roll-up, or in the assumptions about the performance of loans, did the attitude of the banks towards their borrowers change in that period?</p></speech>

Right?  And the debtors were quite happy to stay with the banks.  The banks were quite happy to stick with the debtors and nobody wanted to crystallise the losses.  So, you know, of course when you crystallise losses it effectively, probably, personally life-threatening for some of the executives in the banks, as did happen, as, you know, people left.  But I think the issue was that, you know, if you're saying in terms of behaviour, I can't say that there was any, you know, huge change in behaviour.  I ... the thing that surprised me personally the most, and this is just purely common sense, you don't have to be any way ... have a professional qualification in law or accounting to know this, is that when we acquired the loans from the banks only 20% of the income that was on the portfolio was being mandated to the banks.  It surprised me that the banks didn't move to capture that income earlier.</p></speech>

His view and a few of his colleagues' view was that, you know, that mightn't be enough, because the overseas entities had also borrowed in the money markets and in the euro commercial paper markets.  And he asked me my view from a technical point of view, myself and my colleague, Mr. Whelan.  And we said, "Well, you can't ignore the overseas subsidiaries because they're guaranteed by the parent and, you know, if you'd decided to guarantee, we think that, you know, you can't ignore the overseas subsidiaries."</p></speech>

I was responsible for counter party credit limits at the time, as the NTMA's director of finance I had a discussion with Dr. Somers, chief executive, and we discussed the thing that the financial markets were acting strangely.

Do you have any breakdown as to the extent of that practice within the Irish banks in the period, obviously prior to the establishment of NAMA?</p></speech>

I suppose the point we were making in both our opening statements was that once you begin to rely on personal guarantees then by definition you are relying on the personal wealth of the debtor.  If the process by which that personal wealth is assessed is in any way doubtful - in other words if it is done on the basis of statements of affairs where the valuation of assets is essentially done by the debtor and maybe not rigorously examined or overseen by the banks - then you are getting into a cross-collateralisation right across the loan book and you are getting into it on the basis again of relationship banking, with not a huge amount of oversight.  There is nothing wrong with statements of affairs, but in very many cases they weren't audited, in very many cases some of the asset valuation was actually done by the person presenting the statement of affairs to the bank and in very many cases you would have to say the bank wasn't looking into those.</p></speech>

I simply got a phonecall in December 2009.  I was then a public interest director on the board of Anglo.  I'd been there from earlier that year and I was asked if I would take on the chair.

I asked for a day or two to think about it and I was told, "No, we want a decision today."  So, if you want some colour, I walked D&uacute;n Laoghaire pier and thought about it and then said "Yes".</p> <p>  The actual construction then beyond that ... I mean, at that stage the board ... the membership of the board had by and large been decided and I think ... I'm not sure of this, but I may have been the last piece of the jigsaw being slotted it.  It was an unusual board in the sense that my understanding is that while you couldn't say it was approved across the political spectrum, there was, as I understand it, consultation with all of the political parties about the overall representation and that I think was to ... I think quite usefully to get political buy-in to the whole NAMA scheme but also to get a view across the spectrum that the board was going to be independent.  So that was sort of my involvement on it.  We had our first board meeting, I think in December and ... 23 December, and a lot of work had been done by Mr. McDonagh and a small team and then we began to scale up the organisation to put in place all of the procedures and processes and all of that.</p></speech>

It's 8 February 2010, Simon Carswell, <i>The Irish Times</i>, that the IMF told the late Minister Lenihan in April 2009 that NAMA would not lead to a significant increase in lending by the banks in light of the fact that one of the chief reasons for ... given at the time in the Oireachtas for the establishment of NAMA was that it would lead to an increase.  Were you aware of that advice from the IMF that was quoted in that particular article?</p></speech>

Can you ... can you say if any ... at the time, you know, when you took on the loans and you started examining them and obviously you're familiar with them, can you say if any serving members of the Government or the Oireachtas were involved in any of the so-called debtor connections through syndicates or through companies?</p></speech>

We have never indicated who or, indeed, what category of individuals would be involved in any debtor connections.  There is a ... there is confidentiality in the NAMA Act.  There is banking confidentiality, because when we took on the loans, we also took on the banking confidentiality restrictions around those.  So I don't think it would be appropriate for us to confirm or not that there was anybody because if we begin to confirm it for any particular group or sector, then the next question is was there somebody in some other sector.</p></speech>

But, I mean, if the implication of the question is was NAMA in any way, at any stage, either in its construction or in relation to the way it transferred the loans or the way it's dealt with the loans, influenced by any particular category of individual in our loan book, the answer is absolutely "No".</p></speech>

I suppose the nexus between the political establishment, the bankers and the developers has been much discussed by the public in the last God knows how many years.  That's the whole purpose of this exercise.

We have spoken a lot about personal guarantees, cross-collateralisation, but to what extent was there intense competition from the banks to get the biggest clients, to bankroll or finance the largest developments in the country?  Did you find evidence of that when your agency went in and looked in detail at the loan books and the practices that went on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#NN03600"><p>I think you have to ... when you ... when you look at what came across to us, certainly you had a lot of debtors and some of them debtors of ... with very big exposures, who had exposures across the banks.  So there was ... they were dealing with several banks and I have no doubt at all that the banks were in competition.</p> <p>  I don't want to get into making sort of qualitative, giving qualitative opinions about the banks, but there was certainly a question of, as I said earlier, a wall of money being available to all of the banks and, to a certain extent, the banks just chasing investments for that money. </p> <p>  And it was quite clearly the situation that if you had one particular bank that was being very, very successful at that, then questions were being asked of the other banks by their shareholders as to, "why you are not ... why are you not chasing this?  Why are you not growing at the same rate?  Why is your lending" ... because everybody believed, of course, that in that whole area of property lending that there was no downside. </p> <p>  So, yes, there was competition right across the banks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.669" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#OO00200"><p>I think it played a significant role because it was there ... after the eurozone, there was that wall of money.  The exchange rate risk was removed, so certainly the wholesale markets were quite willing to provide the Irish banks with funding.  The Irish banks were quite willing to accept that because they were getting funding at relatively cheap rates and they had, in their debtors - in property in particular - ready recipients of that money.  So, I have no doubt at all it was a factor.  And I think in so far as, and I mentioned it earlier ... in so far as anybody was concerned about any aspect of that, it would have been keeping an eye on interest rates rather than keeping an eye on whether that particular amount ... money was going to be turned off at some stage, as happened just before the crash.</p></speech>

To what extent did they have a full handle on the overall indebtedness of the people that they were lending to?</p></speech>

I think we saw it from the documentation and when we began to engage with debtors ... and this was particularly so in relation to the non-NAMA banks because we had a ... we had ... we were able to collate a full picture of the lending across the NAMA banks.  But you had the situation where when we looked for business plans, when we began to assess the debtors that came across to us from the NAMA banks, you suddenly discovered this exposure to the non-NAMA institutions.  I don't think that the NAMA banks, or indeed the other ones, had a particular full view right across the spectrum of lending by individual debtors.  And I'm not ... I don't want to make a generalisation; I'm just saying that it was there to a very large extent.  There may have been some cases or some banks where they had a better handle on that than others.  I think it was part of this ... the kind of culture of: "Well let's not dig too deeply here.  We have the money, here's a proposition, it sounds good, it's property related, property is on the up; everybody is saying that there's never going to be real crash, at worst it'll be a soft landing."  So the temptation was there.</p></speech>

To what extent did they have those resources in-house?  You referred in your opening statement to the laws of gravity.  So when the banks were looking at their overall exposure to the property and development sector, did they have in-house expertise in the property area.  And also looking at individual loans that they were making ... to look at the underlying value of the security and the likelihood of that value being maintained or increased over time, is there any evidence that there was a good level of expertise available?</p></speech>

But I ... I think, I mean there was a phrase used at some stage, and I can't remember who used it, that the people in the background who are trying to put a break on the lending ... the people in finance, in audit, in compliance, in the ... the general property experts, that they were kind of boils on the heel of progress of the banks and that lending was the area to be in, and if you were kind of indicating that lending was unwise or that ... I don't think you were listened to very much within the banks.  I think they began to believe their own lenders and didn't pay enough attention to the experts that they would have had in the banks.  I think they had them.   How much of a voice they had within the banks I don't know, but I mean I can only ... we can only comment on that, from what we saw when the loans came across.  You would really have to take that up with the banks themselves.</p></speech>

Can I just round off one thing in regard to what Deputy McGrath was asking you there.  Just by your own assessment, when the loan portfolio started coming over to NAMA - and Deputy McGrath was talking about the ... the exposure that different borrowers may have had to different institutions - did you see any protocols that were in the banks or practices that they were examining maybe the way that personal guarantees might ... the same personal guarantee could be maybe given to a number of banks rather than just one or a situation whereby there was a level of cross-lending that the banks were actually aware of that such a person was so much into one bank or as opposed to one and did the banks actually have protocols to chase this level of risk or exposure?</p></speech>

I mean Mr. McDonagh may have a comment on this, but certainly I don't think there was anything like the structured approach to cross-lending and examination of cross-collateralisation or of personal guarantees in the banks that ... to the standard ... to the extent, for example, that NAMA put in place when we took the loans across, or to the standard or extent that should have been there in the first place.</p></speech>

It states that: "the pursuit of 100% repayment acts counter to NAMA's aims and it economically inefficient.  It is vital to recognise that writing off debts, acknowledging the destruction of economic value caused by the bursting of the construction bubble is an important stepping-stone in re-establishing a viable construction sector."  And then, Mr McDonagh, in 2014 you told a conference that 25% of NAMA debt had been restructured by the end of 2013.  What does restructuring mean in that context and was NAMA policy influenced there by the demands of the Construction Industry Federation in regard to writing off debt?</p></speech>

The whole issue, as far as NAMA's concerned, is that when we restructure a debtor's debt - and we explain this in our 2010 annual report - is that we split the debt into two categories.  One part of the debt is called tranche A, which effectively is what we ... after assessing the business plan what we think the ... what will be recovered on the assets and any additional security the debtor can actually give up.</p><p>And then tranche B is a sort of ... where the debtor still owes tranche B, but unless there was some sort of a super performance in terms of recovery in asset values, only part ... an unlikely the whole amount of tranche B would be repaid, but the debtor would still owe the full amount. </p></speech>

So if a debtor hypothetically had &euro;1 billion worth of debt and somebody came to buy that debtor's debt off NAMA and the assets were only worth &euro;600 million, then these private equity funds or hedge funds, or whatever you want to call them, aren't charities, they'll only pay you what the assets are worth.  They will pay you ... if the market value of the assets is &euro;600 million they will pay you &euro;600 million, they will not pay you &euro;1 billion because that is that, but they acquire the whole &euro;1 billion worth of debt, so as far as the debtor is concerned he's with NAMA today he owes &euro;1 billion worth of debt, he is with hedge ... private equity fund tomorrow, he still owes &euro;1 billion worth of debt.</p></speech>

So whether he wanted to go home, I wasn't in the room, I'm just relating to you as a third party who wasn't in the room what I heard.  Because when I went in to meet the Taoiseach I was surprised the Minister for Finance wasn't there, I probably mentioned in passing I wonder where Minister Lenihan was and it was said, "Oh he's gone because he's to be up early in the morning to do the press conference."  That's all I know Deputy, there's nothing more and nothing less.</p></speech>

You asked me a question so, if you would not mind, I would like to answer it.  On the night when I went into the room, the Minister for Finance wasn't there.  I think coming out of the room I might've said to Mr. Cardiff, I says: "Where's Minister Lenihan" and I think the view was: "Ah, he's either gone home or sent home so that he's up early in the morning for this press conference at quarter to 7".  Did I find that unusual and the fact that he would have to go home to be up early in the morning for quarter to 7?  I certainly didn't.  So that's it.  No more, no less.</p></speech>

I now propose we go for a break but I just want to round up one thing before we go at quarter past.  It's just in regard to lobbying.  And when NAMA were putting in place ... and the whole issue of how the valuation model of NAMA was being put in place was going to reduce and result in a reduction in the valuation of the assets that were coming over to you and this was going to result in haircuts and all the rest.  At any time, were NAMA lobbied on the particular model of valuation and how the haircuts were going to be applied?</p></speech>

They were trying to protect their stakeholders.  But the reality is that the valuation model that was done for the loans was one which we had commissioned HSBC to advise us on.  And ... but that model then went to the European Commission technical people and they basically decided what the final valuation model would be.</p></speech>

Was there a push back from the banks with regard to how the valuation and the haircut was going to be ... the rate at which it was going to be set and how it was going to be applied?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.752" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#QQ01200"><p>I think the banks were very concerned that the valuation model could produce higher losses for them.  They would've seen probably the draft ... they would've seen the early cuts of the valuation model.  And, I suppose, they would have been the person ... people with better knowledge of the loan books than we had at that stage, because we did not have the information.  And, I suppose, the reality is that the discounts did turn out to be much higher than anybody thought and probably the first people maybe to recognise that would have been the banks themselves.</p></speech>

Just one other related matter to that.  After the valuation had been applied and the haircut had been put in place and all the rest of it, there was an intention at the time for the Government to bring in a reform to the upward-only rent review legislation.  There would have been concerns, and for a number of different reasons but one would've been that this could have an impact upon the asset base of properties because of the rental income that was being derived off them.  Did NAMA at any time approach Government - the Department of Finance - and express a concern with regards to reforming the upward only rent review?</p></speech>

Yes, we had a discussion about that.  We had to look at our own asset base and likely impact on our income.  We did express, in general terms, the impact that this could have on the NAMA book.  Obviously, I don't think in the final analysis that that was an influencing factor on Government.  I think the influencing factor in the end was a constitutional issue about interfering with the rents.  But the Government did then ask us to, in respect of debtors - in particular, people in the retail trade - who were in NAMA ... or, sorry, who were tenants of NAMA debtors, where we could have some influence or control ... they did ask us to look at that and to examine that.  I've already put on the record - so I won't not repeat it - what NAMA has been doing in that area.</p></speech>

Right.  In relation ... it's absolutely staggering, the figure of &euro;3.5 billion, for, I'm sure, for the general public there.  In relation to the volume 1, page 35 figure, &euro;2.5 billion ... we look at the property valuation process that NAMA used, and particularly the property uplift adjustments - this is the long-term economic value - that NAMA used and approved by the Commission, and you give us an interesting table there in relation to the five tranches that were transferred to NAMA.  You estimated that Anglo Irish Bank's assets would recover more than any of the other banks' at 9.5%, with the lowest being EBS.  Can I ask you in relation to the uplift that was expected, has NAMA any way of monitoring whether that uplift actually happened, whether it was below expectations or above expectations for the individual institutions?</p></speech>

And Mr. McDonagh, just to finish this point, do you have any sense ... because, obviously, while it would be impossible, as you say, to track them because of they're bundled together, do you have any sense, for example, that NAMA's loans could've outperformed the uplift that was expected, given that they were heavily concentrated in the UK market?

I mean, the portfolio that we acquired was 56% Ireland and 44% outside of Ireland.  The majority - I think around 33% of that 44% - was UK, primarily London.  London has been very good to us in terms of the prices that we achieved but, you know, I suppose we have to look at this on the ground and say, you know, we're not ... like, the situation was that, if somebody had borrowed a loan from, for argument's sake, Bank of Ireland and that produced a surplus, he might have another loan with AIB and that produced a loss.  The surplus wasn't available to AIB because the surplus ... it mightn't even be aware that he has a surplus on his Bank of Ireland loan, whereas we group them all together and we're able to apply the pluses and the minuses.</p></speech>

You mentioned that the NTMA came under pressure in 2007 for liquidity of the banks, to place deposits in a number of the institutions and that you, the NTMA, the institution, made a decision that, if that were to happen, it needed to be on the direction of the Minister for Finance.  Can I ask you where did the pressure come from, and specifically did it come from the Minister for Finance, either formally or informally, or somebody acting on behalf of the Minister for Finance?</p></speech>

On page 6 of the C4b document, we have the discounts and the average was 57%.</p><p>A matter of concern, Chairman, would be that AIB at 56% is only 5% off Anglo and, you know, that compares adversely with Bank of Ireland, which at 43% is 18 points off Anglo.  Does that have implications for this committee?  Does AIB require substantial reform given it got so close to the Anglo in those percentages?</p></speech>

AIB was the second biggest transfer, of about &euro;20 billion of loans.  I think, as I said earlier on, AIB and Bank of Ireland both doubled their balance sheets between 2003 and 2008, and Anglo quadrupled from &euro;25 billion to &euro;100 billion balance sheet.  I think AIB got very aggressive into the property business and they certainly probably had ... the consequence of that has been that the discounts are quite high, and whereas Bank of Ireland transferred &euro;10 billion par debt of loans to NAMA, and at a lower discount, because they were more risk averse didn't mean to say that they were fully risk averse, but they were more risk averse than the other institutions, and that's what the discounts signify.</p></speech>

Have they new people?  The property fixation that you've mentioned, you know, do they know about high tech, aviation, pharma, start-ups, small and medium enterprises?  I mean when NAMA's gone in a few years time will Irish banks be reformed so that they don't need it to be re-established in, say, five years after that?</p></speech>

I suppose the comment I'd make in relation to the areas you mentioned, pharma, and they're now very much into agri, I think they have the expertise, I think they have a greater prudence, level of prudence and caution.  They're obsessed with the property market now, but they're probably obsessed, actually, at the other end of the spectrum, in that they don't really have any great enthusiasm for getting involved in it at all, and that in itself is a, you know, ultimately for the country is something that needs to be ironed out.  I think, in fairness to the banks, they have made great strides.  You know, it's a matter for you to discuss with the banks about the changes in their structures, and the changes in their personnel.  It's well known, without NAMA being the experts in that area, that there have been significant changes in the personnel and structures of the bank.  I think they have a much more risk-based approach now, and I think the boards of the banks, in particular, I would say if there's one thing that has happened over the last number of years as a consequence of all of this, is that directors in the banks are very, very keenly aware of their responsibilities as directors, and what you might want to explore with the banks is the extent to which that was there pre the crash.  So I think they've improved.  Are they perfect?  I'm not going to pronounce on that.</p></speech>

It is important when you are talking about, particularly in the property area, that you don't just finger the five NAMA banks or whatever, that there were others in there who were just as active and in some cases, actually in relation to particular products - I am talking about 100% mortgages and all of that  - who were just as active in that area.  Some of them didn't come into NAMA, and in fact they are pretty much gone from the Irish scene.  So it was wider.  As to what encouraged it - and I am not talking about the IFSC banks which by and large have been better run and better managed than some of the others - I think it was a culture of competitiveness,  it was the easy money that we talked about earlier and it was the sort of hands-off regulatory regime.  It was a combination of all of that.</p></speech>

Yes we do.  We have to be realistic and say that in a lot of cases that is not going to happen.  If that was going to happen, you could really have left all these things with the banks.  Could it happen if NAMA had the luxury of waiting ten or 20 or 30 years, as indeed a lot of our debtors would actually like us to do? Possibly.  But nobody, and I don't think anybody in this room, or anybody in NAMA, or anybody in the banking system can actually indicate what is the one day that the market will peak and dispose of our assets, or hold our assets until then.  Anybody in the business will say that you can't predict that.  For NAMA, with the additional constraints of senior debt, contingent liability for the taxpayer, we have to be active in the market.</p></speech>

We delivered 1,200 and the other 800 will be delivered before the end of the year.  In respect of the other 4,000, once the local authorities or the housing agency said "No, we are not interested", NAMA either disposed of some of those or rented them.  So there is no one of those 4,000 properties which is unoccupied at the moment.</p></speech>

So it was ... I mean, I don't think anybody at any stage said to us, "You have to do this by this date," but it was very obvious that that was the approach that they favoured and that continued after the &euro;7.3 billion ... or, &euro;7.5 billion payment.</p></speech>

If we look at the metrics you have given us, you know you could rank them in terms of the par debt transferred, the percentage discount, the percentage of non-performing loans.  Do you ... has NAMA ranked the banks in those particular ways in terms of the quality of documentation, depending on the different institution?</p></speech>

And we actually had to manage the debtor in aggregate and where there was gaps in security ... for argument's sake, if there was a surplus in one asset and it wasn't cross-capitalised we'd try to move to get that surplus cross-capitalised onto other assets.  So that is something you can do when you're aggregating together, it's not something you can do when you are dealing with a bankable sum.</p></speech>

If it stands up with scrutiny with NAMA, then NAMA will pay you 100% for every euro that you give to keep projects going if it is adding value to the asset".</p></speech>

So, effectively, there was &euro;1 billion they had advanced in that period which we deemed to be eligible that they didn't stand up commercially.  And you can see there by institution how much is eligible in each institution, and some ... you know, every institution suffered a loss in terms of that.  So, you know, their lending practices even post-NAMA probably would have thought ... you'd have thought should have been tight after ... post ... because the loans were coming to NAMA, and obviously this shows that, you know, when we looked at the loans and acquisitions and said ... questioned them, and said, "Show us the commercial rationale of why you issued this money so that we can actually refund you 100% as under the Central Bank letter," they weren't able to justify it and we qualified &euro;1 billion worth of money that they issued between May 2009 and the acquisition during 2010.</p></speech>

So the question I'm asking really is, is that if Anglo and Irish Nationwide were there not there, would there have been a need for NAMA?</p></speech>

I suppose, maybe can I talk two facets of that?  If you go back to the whole crash and the difficulties, if Anglo and Irish Nationwide were not there would the other banks have followed into this lending frenzy in property?  I think it's fairly well accepted that Anglo and Nationwide were the leaders and that the other banks followed, so that's maybe one aspect of it.  If they weren't there at the time who knows what might have happened.</p> <p>  If you get into the situation where there is a problem and you're thinking about an asset management solution and you don't have the Anglo and the INBS one, would the scale of the losses in the other banks still justify a NAMA type approach?  I think we probably would, and I think when you're getting to that stage, because you'd still have had a very considerable par debt lending into property, I still think that the banks would not have been capable of dealing with that themselves, and you would be left of course with the question of well what do you do with all those loans in Anglo and INBS.  Anglo at the time, of course, had been, you know, had been nationalised, but you still have to deal with the loans.  So, do you let them in the nationalised bank for that bank to work them out?  Do you actually push them into the other banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB?  I think that would have been pretty much disastrous, or do you take the view that an assessment management approach is the best way to go?  I'm fairly strong in my view that right across the system, and whether Anglo and INBS were still there or not, that you would still have needed an asset management approach for all of the reasons we discussed this morning about why that approach was appropriate.</p><p>Mr. McDonagh may have-----</p></speech>

They're still substantial figures.  I think the issue boils down to the following: the game was up.  The borrowing had happened, the assets weren't worth what anybody had thought they were worth, the debtors were exploiting the lack of synergy between the banks in terms of knowing how much each was borrowing from each institution ... I still think you would probably have had to have brought them together to actually capture the surpluses of some assets to deal with the deficits in other banks.</p></speech>

The losses would have to be dealt with at some stage.  Once you nationalise them, you brought them onto your State's balance sheet, and you had to deal with them.  If you had a resolution mechanism, which wasn't in Ireland at the time in September 2008, you probably could have just left ... the view has been expressed, maybe would you just put them into liquidation and things like that?  But I think the reality is that that would have been read straight through to Ireland as a sovereign and the other banks, and, you know, would have been a very risky approach.</p></speech>

A final question, then I will pick up on the leads and very very briefly, a quick wrap up. Deputy John Paul Phelan, ten minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.958" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#CCC00400"><p>Briefly Mr. McDonagh,  I want to go back to a question I asked earlier in relation to the rationale that was given by many people at the time of the legislation to establish NAMA, that its establishment would lead to an increase in bank lending.  I want to put a quote to you.  It is a quote from the D&aacute;il of 16 September 2009 during the discussion on the NAMA legislation. The former and late Minister for Finance said and I quote: "The establishment of NAMA and the removal of identified risky assets form the balance sheets should in itself improve credit supply."  You said on the record already that you did not offer that opinion yourself to the Minister.  Do you have a view or any evidence as to where that opinion was coming from?  I was a Member of the Oireachtas myself at the time. A significant amount of the rationale for the establishment of NAMA was that it would lead to an increase in bank lending. Do you have any view to express to the committee as to where that opinion was coming from?</p></speech>

I was not part of the Minister's speech.</p></speech>

I think it is not unreasonable to think that that volume of funding going into the banks should have triggered some possibility of lending, of credit.  As to why it didn't, I think it is a whole other story that maybe is one to explored with the banks.  I do not think it is unreasonable to say that with that volume of effectively cash going into the banks that you could have expected some easement of credit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.961" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#CCC00700"><p>Deputy, if I may just add, there is one thing I am absolutely sure about.  The ECB is very accommodating at present.  It's providing lots of liquidity into the system and it's taking different types of collateral now.  Back in 2008 and 2009, the ECB was not very accommodative.  It did not want land and development loans from Irish banks as collateral to advance money to the Irish banks and system.  The whole rationale for NAMA was to take the land and development loans which the ECB did not want, put them into NAMA, NAMA issued government guaranteed bonds, the banks could bring these government guaranteed bonds to the ECB, and the ECB was happy to give them money on the back of this mechanism.  The banks lost, if you look at the Central Bank figures that have been published on an ongoing basis through the years, the banks lost about &euro;100 billion worth of liquidity during the crisis.  We gave them &euro;30 billion of assets that they could use to replenish that liquidity.  If they still had the land and development assets, they wouldn't have that &euro;30 billion liquidity and the situation would be a whole lot worse, I would suggest.</p></speech>

At the time that the legislation was happening, this was the major element of support for the establishment of NAMA that was expressed in the Oireachtas by different people, not just the late Minister for Finance.  I felt I just needed to put that question. Perhaps it has been a long day and you were a little bit brief in your answer.</p></speech>

Please can we wrap proceedings up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.964" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#CCC01000"><p>We will not wrap them up yet Chairman. A couple of more questions in relation to Mr. Daly. The broader context of NAMA ... you obviously have a responsibility to obtain value for money for the taxpayer.</p><p>There was also a social responsibility element which I can remember being discussed at length in both Houses at the time.  I do not want you to obviously refer to specific examples but how, in the broad context, are those two seemingly and potentially often conflicting objectives balanced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.966" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#DDD00200"><p>Well I think I was making the point in my statement that you have to start with the financial return.  That's our ... that's what's in the Act.  We can't depart from that.  There is a secondary objective in the Act of a social and economic dividend and the way we try to reconcile it ... first of all, by saying that, and I have said this before, is that the best social and economic dividend, I think, that we can get out of all of this is that NAMA is successful then that our senior debt is repaid and if we have a surplus then that in itself is an economic and a social dividend because that billion can go wherever the Government decides to put it.  Side by side with that, it is everything from social housing that we spoke about earlier.  It is the funding of much needed, if I can put it, ordinary housing in Dublin, which we are doing.  We have committed to 4,500 of those by the end of 2016.  We are examining the potential in what would be our asset base to ... for another 20,000 to be delivered over the ensuing five years.  It is the whole docklands SDZ area which we really haven't referred to today, which is economic in the sense that it is going to provide much needed grade A office accommodation for FDI and other local industry.  It is social in the sense that in that mix there will be residential accommodation as well.  It is the ... And then all of the other stuff in relation to the sites that we have engaged with Department of Education in relation to schools, Department of Health and the HSE in relation to primary care centres and all of that.  And then all of the, I do not want to sound pejorative, but all of the local stuff where we have engaged sometimes with representatives like yourselves, where there is a local community group or sporting group or whatever and they are interested in a particular facility or piece of land or building and we do our utmost to actually engage on that.  So it is all of that is the social dividend.  I don't think it conflicts with our commercial objective.  Sometimes it's a balancing act to actually run the two together but I think we try to do our best.</p></speech>

There is evidence that exists of property sold by NAMA that were subsequently resold at significantly increased prices which would seem to contradict the evidence ... or the statement that you made with regard to the absence of a fire sale element within NAMA.  And you particularly referenced a good performance in the UK market.  I will just ask briefly maybe for you to comment on, not specific examples, but on some of those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.968" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#DDD00400"><p>Deputy, when we sell assets we take ... we look at asset sales, we make decisions, we take advice ... appropriate advice, and we openly market them ... the properties and where there's multiple bids on the property, we obviously try and get the best price we can.  We don't have the luxury and we don't have the magic wand of knowing when is the absolute perfect time to sell a particular asset.  There are, of course, individual examples of where some assets were sold and they have been sold on for higher values but that has to be put into the context as well of people risking their capital in the market at the time when nobody was risking their capital in the market and they were coming in to make bids for the assets.  We made a very conscious decision that between 2010 and 2012, we held back on putting assets into the Irish market, despite everybody telling us we should be putting them onto market and accepting much lower prices.  We only sold &euro;1 billion worth of assets.  As of today, we have sold &euro;6 billion worth of assets and most of that ... &euro;4 billion of that mostly came from 2013 onwards as the market improved.  And, you know, there's many other examples of assets where we sold where we got very good prices and people subsequent to them haven't sold them at the price that they bought them from NAMA.</p><p>So, I think you know, even the private equity people who bought some assets in the Irish market have sold on individual examples of assets to people who made profits subsequent to that.  So, that's the market, that's the model that's there and you know, do I wish that I had a magic ... that every single time I sold an asset, that would be the maximum peak of the asset and nobody else would make any profit on it?  Of course I would in terms on behalf of the taxpayer but in terms of the information that we have at the time, we make the best decision we can, and we don't make it lightly, to sell the assets and of course there will be individual examples.  You can't dispose of 60,000 individual units where you are going to find that every single time you have hit the market at the optimal time but there are certainly many more examples which nobody talks about where we have made substantial profits and it was the right time to sell and nobody talks about that.</p></speech>

So, we would say we called it right in relation to that market.</p></speech>

You know, everybody sat back and started withdrawing liquidity and if you are a chief risk officer sitting in New York and you have lent &euro;1 billion of money market deposits to the Irish banking system and you hear that there might be some potential problem in the Irish banking system, you are not going to wait for the clarification, as chief risk officer, of what that problem might be.   You want your &euro;1 billion back.  So the game changer was that everybody started withdrawing liquidity very suddenly very quickly out of the system at the same time and it has been, I think, documented elsewhere or reported that, you know, that was the real like, that what people have a worry-concern that what potentially might happen, was beginning to happen and when it began to happen, it happened very quickly.</p></speech>

I suppose there were some similar moments, I mean, everybody saw the queues in Northern Rock in September 2007 in the case of the day including the office here in Dublin in the case of the day, but that seemed to quieten down and, you know, that seemed to be a once off, the British Government seemed to deal with Northern Rock very quickly, and things like that.

Conversations we had about unpaid debt and the pursuit of people who were not ... you know ... who were still going to owe money.  On foot of Mr. Lenihan's, you know, promise that all ... all the money should be paid back.  Again, for the public, what is it exactly that NAMA can do to pursue the debts that remain unpaid?  I mean, literally, do you pursue them or do you just hope?  You've clarified that some of it won't be paid.</p></speech>

We have about 324 cases in the High Court.  They're reported quite regularly where we're pursuing people for judgments to try and get as much money back as possible, but you have to take a view sometimes that there's, you know ... somebody has sold all their assets and they have no assets left.  Are you going to spend money pursuing judgments just for the sake of pursuing judgments when it's actually going to cost you lots of money legally to do that when effectively there's nothing there to pick up?  So the reality is that everybody wishes that the assets were there to pay back the &euro;74 billion.  I'm saying to you, the value of the assets isn't there to pay back the &euro;74 billion and what we think we'll get back ultimately will be ... pay off the &euro;31.8 billion debt plus a bill in surplus at the-----</p></speech>

All we're saying is that that sustainable model across the four - or the three - areas of funding, development and planning in the market would actually make it much more difficult for the type of crash and the type of speculation and the type of funding that caused, or contributed to, all of that to happen now.  As to whether any of those, or how many of those ... I don't know how many bullet points are there.  There's about ten or 12.  As to how many of them progress has been made on, I think progress has been made on some of them, but I think progress needs to be made on more of them.

In terms of a sustainable model going into the future, would you see any merit in a publicly-owned banking system devoted to the needs of society rather than the private profits of elites and shareholders?</p></speech>

So, it's a big part of the banking system.  I think when, you know ... I've met other countries who've had banking problems as well, and they would've had publicly owned banking systems and private sector banking systems.  And, unfortunately, their public-owned banks also had the same problems as the private sector banks because they all seemed to move in tandem.

Mr. Daly, there is about &euro;3 billion in funds available for development.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1039" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#GGG03300"><p>No, I don't have a breakdown of that.  I think what ... the point we're making is that, in terms of our capacity to actually deploy capital, the overall figure is about &euro;3 billion.  We certainly believe that a very substantial portion of that will be needed to develop out the Dublin docklands SDZ.  We also believe that a proportion of that will be needed to develop the housing that I have talked about.  And those are two mandates that we have been given in recent times following the review of NAMA last year by the Minister for Finance.  So ... but, there is no Dublin-centric approach to this.  It is available elsewhere, but it has to be where there are NAMA assets located because we, you know, we're ... we can't ... we're not ... can't under the Act advance funding or get involved with non-NAMA debtors or assets or land or whatever that is not on our books.</p><p>The reality is that most of those assets, and I think Mr. McDonagh referred to them earlier, the remaining assets are in either the Dublin area or the Dublin conurbation, or in the other major centres, but I mean over the years, and I don't have the figures with me, but certainly they would have appeared in our annual report and I'm sure there'll be reference to them in our upcoming annual report, of areas where we have invested outside Dublin and indeed I didn't read it out in my statement, but if you look at page 12, where we talked about property transactions in Ireland that we have facilitated and that is certainly all of around Dublin, around Cork, around various places like that.  The housing, in relation to input to social housing, input to the remediation of ghost estates, is all over the country.  The investment in land and in development assets straddles everywhere, but it has to be where NAMA happens to have the assets and the reality is that most of those are in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, or around that area.</p></speech>

I'm going to wrap up.  in wrapping up, I might just invite Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh if there's anything further that they would like to add.  I will say the inquiry is not just about the past, it's also about learning lessons into the future and I do know in your opening statements you did give a lot of suggestions with regard to how we ensure that we do not have to recreate another NAMA into the future.  So, just by means of any closing comments, is there anything you'd like to add, Mr. Daly or Mr. McDonagh?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1049" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#HHH01000"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I'll be brief, it's been a long day for everybody.  I want to make three points.  The first is to emphasise again, as I did in my opening statement, that we are attending here as part of the solution.  We were not the cause of the crash.  We are essentially the ambulance, or whatever comes across, coming along afterwards to actually tidy it up.  And then, you know, we're here because you are considering the appropriateness and effectiveness of the domestic policy response and NAMA was an element of that.  I think there's two elements to that then: the appropriateness of it is one we have discussed, as to whether you go down the asset management agency route and we've had a general discussion about that.  I'm not going to repeat it, but it is generally now acknowledged worldwide that where you have a crash of such proportions and where you have such a concentration of lending by financial institutions into a sector like property, that banks don't fix themselves and you have to take it off their books.  I think we've generally discussed that.</p> <p>  There is some material, which I referred to earlier, by the ECB and wherever in relation to that theoretical, what is the correct approach, what is the appropriate approach, and to the extent that the inquiry may not have that, we would be happy to pass it on to you.  So, you consider the theory of the appropriateness of the approach and then you must move on to the effectiveness, did it work?  That was the theory, that was the approach; did it work in practice?  And that's where you get in, I think, to NAMA's performance over the past five years, and to the figures that we have provided to the inquiry today and maybe updated figures that we can provide to the inquiry by November, or whenever you're going to write your report.  We would say, and you won't be surprised, that NAMA has been a very effective response.  I've outlined in the last page of my statement why and I'm not going to repeat it.  I would just like to thank you, Chairman, and members of the committee and the staff for your courtesy.</p></speech>
