Doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 19th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  As these committees proceed, the cold shadow of the banking and financial crisis can still be felt and seen in every corner of Ireland, yet we do not have a full picture of the events leading up to and during and after the crisis, and gaps still remain in our knowledge of that time.  It is this committee's responsibility to unearth those missing pieces and to put them together.  In commencing the Nexus Phase of the inquiry, I want to welcome members of the public watching our proceedings live this morning.  You will have the opportunity to hear, at first-hand, from those who were involved in one of the major events in the history of our country.  You will be able to see and hear from them as they are questioned and give their evidence to this committee.  This inquiry has been set up to serve you, the Irish people, to get the answers and questions about the crisis and to ensure that a crisis of this nature is never revisited upon the Irish people again.  As a committee we intend to fulfil that duty for you.</p> <p>  The Context Phase of the inquiry, which has just completed, served a purpose.  It set out the background of the crisis and has prepared the ground for the Nexus Phase of public hearings, which start today.  During this phase, the committee will engage with institutions and individuals who had central roles during the crisis period.  This represents a significant step-up in activity and responsibility for all, both the committee and the banking inquiry team, which is working behind the scenes.  It will focus upon three broad elements: banking systems and practices; regulatory and supervisory systems and practices; and crisis management systems and policy responses, and how these three elements interacted with each other.  It will identify and analyse all evidence and produce a final report in November.</p> <p>  We know we are facing into a huge task with over 64 public hearings ahead of us and we will be hearing from over 50 witnesses during that time, along with receiving witness statements.  The inquiry has sought and received nearly 40,000 documents to date, amounting to hundreds of thousands of pages.  This is the first time that all of the key documents over this period have been collated and examined in one place at one time.  The real strength of the inquiry is its ability not to look at one document in isolation but to draw together the various strands and various sources along with the key public testimony to get a better picture of what happened to put in place the pieces of that jigsaw.</p><p>While public hearings with witnesses are televised and webcast live, these are only part of the process.  Much of the joint committee's work is less visible to the public.  A parliamentary inquiry is a complex project, requiring significant behind the scenes work to support the public hearings leading to the final report, and in this regard I would like to thank the secretariat and investigators for their work they have done to date and will continue to do so on behalf of this inquiry.<br/><br/>Now I just want to address a number of matters to the media who are very, very welcome to our hearings and proceedings this morning.  We recognise and appreciate the important role you've played and continue to play in these proceedings and coverage and reporting of these proceedings is of confidential information which can impair the working inquiry, and in that regard I just want to explain a number of matters.  As part of our hearings and to facilitate them, you will be afforded with an opportunity to see some of the documentation displayed in this room which will be up on the monitors as the proceeding is actually taking place.  The also, these ... it should be recognised though that this is to facilitate the reporting and these documents are not being published by the committee at this stage and are not for publication in that regard, so I just want to draw your attention to the restrictions and constraints on reporting under section 41 of the new Act, which creates an offence of publishing confidential documents or their content regardless of how the documents are acquired but in facilitating the proceedings this morning these documents will be displayed.  I'm sure that you share our desire that the integrity of the inquiry is maintained and that it is successful in addressing the reasons Ireland experienced the banking crisis and that this will be reflected in your own reporting of proceedings today.<br/><br/>Finally I'd like to thank, take this opportunity to thank all the committee members for their hard work and commitment in getting to this stage.  The fact we completed the context phase and are now starting the nexus phase on schedule reflects the co-operative and positive response and approach that the committee has adopted in how we set about our work and how we have worked as a team.  A responsibility now rests on the shoulders of the members of this committee.  It is the first committee to carry out its work under the new legislation, and has been entrusted to examine one of the major events in the history of the State, and a crisis which has impacted upon every household in Ireland.  Only by having a complete picture of what happened can we learn lessons and apply these lessons into the future; only then can we move on as a nation when confident that a crisis like this will never be revisited upon us all again. <br/><br/>So with that said, our witnesses today are Mr. Frank Daly, chairman, and Mr. Brendan McDonagh, CEO of NAMA. Mr.  Frank Daly was appointed as chairman of the National Asset Management Agency by the Minister for Finance in December 2009.  He also currently chairs the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee, and previous to his NAMA appointment has served as a public interest director of the Irish ... of Anglo Irish Bank under the banks guarantee scheme and chairman of the commission of taxation which was established to review the structure and efficiency of the Irish taxation system.  From 1963 to 2008 he worked in The Revenue Commissioners, becoming a commissioner in 1996 and then chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, appointed to the position on 5 May 2009 by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan. From 1994 to 2009 he worked with the National Treasury Management Agency where he was financial controller and later director of finance, technology and risk.  Previously he worked for a number of years with the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland, ESB, in a number of areas.  Mr.Daly and Mr. McDonagh you're very welcome in front of the inquiry this morning. <br/><br/>Now to commence with some of the formal proceedings and, in doing so, I would like to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you're directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter and time frame of this inquiry; and I will then, on that basis, advise the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings which I spoke about.<br/><br/>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens, as I have mentioned here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the gallery those documents will be displayed on the screen to your left.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not be published ... they should not be publishing any of the documents so displayed.  The witnesses have been directed to attend this meeting of the joint inquiry into the banking crisis, and you will be furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee which will be relied upon now in questioning and form part of the evidence of the final inquiry itself.</p><p> I will ask the Clerk to administer the oath or affirmation to you, Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh.</p></speech>

In this brief opening statement you have asked me to address five topics in particular: the acquisition process of eligible assets from participating institutions; the quality of documentation underlying collateral of acquired assets; the governance models in place in respect of loan and asset acquisition and management; the asset valuation methodologies utilised by the participating institutions prior to acquisition as compared to that used by NAMA; and the extent of commercial diligence conducted by borrowers.</p> <p>  Before addressing these points directly, I wish to emphasise that my comments are informed largely by NAMA's experience of acquiring a management portfolio of loans with a face value of &euro;74 billion acquired from the participating institutions in 2010 and 2011 for a consideration of &euro;31.8 billion.  Regarding some of the points on which you have asked me to comment, I do not and could not have the level of detailed knowledge or insight that would be available to senior lending managers or to the credit committees of the financial institutions, or to staff of the Financial Regulator or the Central Bank. </p> <p>  By the time of NAMA's establishment, the property lending crisis and the losses created by poor lending decisions were already irreversible, and while in this statement I may draw certain inferences about the causes of these losses based on what we found when we acquired the loans, I do not claim to have access to the full picture.  In particular, as I was outside the banking system, I do not have an insight into the motivation behind the poor lending decisions of the financial institutions or indeed the borrowing decisions of the debtors in the years up to the end of 2008.  I trust Chairman and committee members, you will accept my comments in that spirit.</p> <p>  The acquisition process has been described in detail in the Comptroller and Auditor General's first special report on NAMA acquisition of bank assets, which was published in 2010.  The key elements of the process are outlined below.  The institutions were required to identify assets which were eligible for transfer by reference to criteria in the NAMA Act 2009 and in regulations made by the Minister of Finance in December 2009, and subsequently in March 2010.  They were also requested to provide detailed information on their eligible loans, including legal due diligence reports and up to date valuations of the property and other assets which were placed as collateral for these loans.  The reference date for the market valuation of property was 30 November 2009.</p> <p>  NAMA then went through a process of validating key information provided by the financial institutions.  Legal due diligence reports submitted by the institutions were reviewed by NAMA's external legal panel.  The reviews were required to highlight any issues which gave rise to legal difficulties for NAMA in managing the loans or engaging in enforcement actions in respect of them.  Particular attention was paid to enforceability of security, any deficiencies in title to property and the implications of such deficiencies.</p> <p>  The valuation process also covered property valuations supplied by the institutions.  A key element in the valuation of each loan was the current market value of the property or other collateral securing the loan.  The valuation was, in the first place, provided by a professional property valuer commissioned by the financial institution but also owing a duty of care to NAMA.  Each property valuation submitted by the financial institution was referred by NAMA to its own property valuation panel which reviewed it and provided an opinion as to whether it considered it to be correct or not.  If the NAMA property panel disagreed with the valuation it was referred to an independent property valuer for adjudication.  This third party property valuation was accepted by NAMA and used as part of the loan valuation.</p> <p>  The valuation methodology used to value bank assets, usually loans, but also including derivatives, had to receive the formal approval of the European Commission because there was an element of state aid incorporated into the transfer price.  Bank assets were acquired at an acquisition value which is determined in line Part 5 of the NAMA Act and the valuation regulations made by the Minister and published in March 2010.</p><p>The acquisition value of each bank asset was its long-term economic value.  Various factors were taken into account in the calculation of the long-term economic value, including the current market value of the security, typically property but also including non-property assets, such as shares, etc., and in the case of property, its long-term economic value.  The valuation regulations required that NAMA apply an uplift adjustment factor ranging from 0% to 25% to the current market value of property to reflect its long-term economic value.</p><p> Following completion of the property and legal due diligence processes, a loan-by-loan valuation was carried out by one of five loan valuation firms employed by NAMA.  The loan valuation process was independently audited by KPMG, which acted as audit co-ordinator.  The audit co-ordinator provided audit certification to the European Commission on the valuations ... that the valuations were in line with the methodology approved by them.  By 2014, the Commission had confirmed its approval of the transfer of all nine loan tranches.  Ultimately, of the &euro;31.8 billion NAMA paid as consideration for the acquired loans, &euro;5.6 billion was considered to be State aid, i.e. NAMA paid the financial institutions &euro;5.6 billion more than the private sector market would have paid them at the time of acquisition.</p><p> I understand that one of the earlier contributors to this inquiry made a comment to the effect that NAMA acquired loans at rock bottom prices.  This suggestion, frankly, does not bear much scrutiny.  I have mentioned already the overpayment of the State aid element of &euro;5.6 billion in acquisition price.  In addition, NAMA&rsquo;s acquired loans were valued by reference to a property collateral date of 30 November 2009 and, as a result, NAMA had to absorb losses from the impact of a 25% to 30% decline in Irish property values which took place subsequently right up to the end of 2013.  No private investor would have transacted on this basis, i.e. a private investor would have paid only on the basis of the market price at close to the actual dates of the loan transfers in 2010 and 2011; thus if the participating institutions had to sell to private investors, I estimate that the acquisition price would probably be reduced by another &euro;4.5 billion.  Essentially, therefore, the institutions would have been paid about &euro;22 billion by the market rather than the &euro;32 billion that NAMA did pay for the loans.</p><p> Incidentally, I gather that the same contributor expressed the opinion that NAMA was acting more like a debt collection agency than as a property value maximising entity, and apparently questioning our ethos in that respect.  I think this reflects a poorly informed view of NAMA although I understand that the contributor indicated that it was only an impression that he had.  Of course NAMA collects debts, as would any similar entity.  We collect on the loans due to us, indeed this is due to the taxpayers, but our role has been much broader and much more positive than that. </p><p> To give you a sense of the scale of NAMA&rsquo;s role in the market since the end March 2010.  NAMA has acted to stimulate market activity by disposing of close to &euro;6 billion in Irish property since inception, involving over 20,000 individual property transactions.  We have worked hard to bring foreign investors to the Irish market.  We have injected &euro;1 billion in capital to support the development of viable Irish projects which will continue to enhance the value of the underlying assets.  We provided a vendor finance programme for commercial property lending at a time when the banks had stopped lending on Irish property.  We set up a price protection scheme which addressed the concern about falling prices on the part of purchasers; the scheme involved a deferral of 20% of the cost of a residential purchase for five years.  A further &euro;3 billion is available in development funding, some of which will help fund the initiatives in the Dublin residential property market and also the docklands SDZ.  We have worked assiduously to enhance planning permissions and to remove other obstacles to the development of assets so as to enhance their value and to ensure that they are shovel ready as soon as possible.  By end 2015 we expect to have made 2,000 residential units available for social housing and we have supported businesses whose debt we acquired to employ about 15,000 people.</p><p> All of this work requires an intensive commitment by us in terms of time and resources involving experienced staff brought together from a wide range of disciplines for this unique asset management challenge.  All in all, Chairman, I would suggest that well informed commentators would not regard these activities as those of an agency solely concerned with debt collection. </p><p> The legal due diligence process involved the submission by the participating institutions of comprehensive legal due diligence reports which included the disclosure of any matter which could materially affect the value of either the loan or the underlying security for the loan.  NAMA retained the panel of legal advisers to review legal due diligence reports and report on the disclosures made and other matters not disclosed.  In particular, their expertise was focused on highlighting any issues which would give rise to legal difficulties for NAMA in managing the loans or in engaging in enforcement actions in respect to them.  As part as the acquisition process, the participating institutions provide the certificate and warranty to NAMA that, save as disclosed in the legal due diligence reports, the loan and security documentation are legal, valid and binding against the obligor, represents the entire agreement between the institution and the obligor and is fully enforceable against them.</p><p> Since the acquisition of loans commenced in 2010, NAMA has reviewed legal documentation of its acquired loans for the purposes of restructuring, sales, enforcement and providing new finance.</p><p>Each participating institution had different operating practices concerning its legal documentation which included the use of standard form facilities and security documents and general terms and conditions, the use of bespoke loan security documents drafted by their external lawyers and a combination of both standard and bespoke documents.  Recurring issues which NAMA encountered with legal documentation included items of security not actually taken, guarantees not confirmed on the granting of a new facility and development loans with no security over work in progress or step-in rights.Other issues included defective Land Registry dealings and in a few cases missing original documents, such as title.Where a documentation issue was identified following acquisition, it was generally capable of remediation and remediation was carried out by NAMA.  Where remediation was not possible, NAMA sought to revisit the acquisition<b></b>value<b></b>of the loan in question and to claw back any amounts that may have been overpaid.<br/><br/>As regards the governance model in place in respect of loan and asset acquisition, NAMA dedicates substantial resources towards ensuring that the loan valuation and acquisition process was managed to highest professional standards.  This was important not least to ensure that the process and the valuations which emerged received the approval of the European Commission.I have provided an outline earlier in the statement of the comprehensive rigorous approach that we adopted, particularly as regards the valuation of property collateral and the due legal diligence, both of which were key towards safeguarding the integrity of the whole process. <br/><br/>As regards the governance model in place in respect of post-acquisition loan management, the C&amp;amp;AG's second special report in NAMA -  NAMA Management Loans since 2012 - provides a detailed account of the approach that we adopted to management loans and debtor relationships.  NAMA decided that it would engage directly with its largest debtor connections, initially 189 NAMA-managed debtor connections with debt of &euro;61 billion, that it would delegate the day to day relationship management of another 583 debtor connections with &euro;13 billion in par debt within tight and specific delegated authority limits to the participant institutions, known as PI managed connections.We put in place a process to oversee the institutions and the performance of credit and operation of functions on our behalf.<br/><br/>As part of our initial engagement with debtors, we asked them to prepare business plans which set out how they propose to repay their liabilities.Following review of each connection's draft business plan, we adopted strategies which involved one or other of the following - debtor support, earlier asset disposal or enforcement.  In return for support from NAMA, including funding of commercially viable development projects, debtors were expected to agree a number of conditions, including asset sales disposals, reversing asset transfers to third parties, ceding unencumbered assets to NAMA as additional security, giving NAMA control over rental income from investments assets and agreeing to cuts in overhead costs.  NAMA retained control of credit decisions to a cascading system of credit limits and delegated authority ranging from the NAMA board down successively to the credit committee to NAMA senior management and to NAMA units in the participating institutions.<br/><br/>As regard the loans acquired by NAMA from the participating institutions, banks would not have been required to measure them at fair value while they were still on their books.An asset valuation would only be carried out on a loan portfolio if it was mooted for sale or transfer.  The participating institutions would have measured their loan books in accordance with the International Financial Reports and Standards, IFRS, specifically IAS 39.This accounting mechanism requires loans originally arranged in advance of them to be measured on an amortised cost basis.This was done on an assumption that the loans remain on the financial institutions books until maturity.  At least once a year, banks would have had to perform an impairment exercise in respect in accordance with contra rules of IAS 39.This requires the banks to recognise an impairment provision against the book value loans where there is a reduction in the amount likely to be received or a change in the timing of future loan cash flows, commonly referred to as objective evidence of impairment.IAS 39 uses an incurred loss basis as opposed to an expected loss basis.Under IAS 39, banks cannot provide for expected future credit losses.  As the impairment methodology operates on an incurred loss model, there can often be a time delay until those losses are identified, known as &quot;the emergence period&quot;.During the duration of such emergence periods, it may be some time before the losses and loan portfolio are actually identified and have to be recognised as losses by the financial institutions.  Following the banking crisis in 2008 and 2009, it was widely accepted among accounting practitioners that IAS 39 impairment methodology did not appropriately reflect potential losses in a loan portfolio or did not do so on a timely basis.  As a result, the International Accounting Standards Board has redrafted IAS 39 and the new standard IFRS 9, which will be implemented later in this decade changed impairment methodology to allow for future expected credit losses to be reported on a more timely basis.  In summary there were significant differences between the valuation methodology used by NAMA and that used by the banks give the latter did not have to apply fair value methods to their loan portfolios.</p><p>Because they originated loans, they could deal with them on a non-amortised basis.  NAMA by contrast did not originate the loans and had to value them at acquisition at fair value basis in accordance with IAS 39 rules i.e. recognising on NAMA's balance sheet on day one that &euro;31.8 billion was the fair value of the loans, not &euro;74 billion.</p><p> I should point out that the valuation methodology used by the Irish financial institutions was no different to that used internationally and that they were in no way departing from conventional accounting standards in the approach they adopted.  If anything the accounting standard lagged the market reality whenever IFRS was used.  One of the misguided comments directed at NAMA in the early days was that it crystallised a massive loss in the banking system through an overly stringent valuation approach.  It acquired loan balances of &euro;74 billion for &euro;31.8 billion, equivalent to a discount of 57%.  By contrast, it was argued the banks, left to their own devices, would eventually have recovered much of the &euro;74 billion par debt.  I strongly disagree with this contention and would suggest that much of the &euro;74 billion was never going to be seen again.</p><p> The NAMA acquisition process forced institutions to recognise their losses earlier than their own IAS 39 accounting valuation methodology would have required of them.  In the absence of NAMA, you would have probably seen a phased unveiling of losses over a three, four, five, or perhaps even more years, with a consequent drip-drip effect in terms of the needs for capital replenishment and the corrosive impact of the creditworthiness of the sovereign.  The NAMA process enabled the Irish banking system to recognise and address up-front the loan loss difficulties that it had created for itself long before NAMA was ever conceived.  The fact that the asset management company model is now being copied in other countries suggests that, belatedly, it is recognised that the impaired banking systems do not tend to rectify themselves.  An external body is needed to bring a fresh independent approach to resolution.</p><p> I do not have direct knowledge of the extent of commercial due diligence conducted by borrowers or, indeed, conducted by the institutions at the time the loans were advanced.  However, based on our own experience of the loans which we acquired and which we have since sought to manage, I am in a position to make some observations on the lending environment which prevailed prior to 2007.  In that context I would like to draw the committee's attention to table 1 below which in my view provides an eloquent summary into the insight of some of the issues which are the subject of your inquiry.  The table presents a distribution of NAMA's acquired portfolio by size of the debtor connection aggregate of loans acquired from five participating institutions.</p><p> In summary, we acquired the loans of 772 debtor connections who borrowed &euro;74 billion from the institutions.  This excludes any additional amounts borrowed by these same debtors from institutions not covered by NAMA.  I do not know how much additional borrowing from non-NAMA banks was involved, but I conservatively estimate it to be at least &euro;10 billion.  There are 12 debtor connections with debt in excess of &euro;1 billion each, aggregating to a par debt of &euro;22.2 billion, an average of &euro;1.85 billion per connection.  Another 133 debtor connections have debt between &euro;100 million and &euro;999 million, aggregating to &euro;35.7 billion par debt, an average of &euro;269 million per connection.  And finally, there are 627 so-called smaller debtor connections with a debt of less than &euro;100 million, aggregated to &euro;16 billion debt, an average of &euro;26 million per connection.  As mentioned the table does not include lending advanced by institutions such as Ulster Bank, Bank of Scotland Ireland and a number of institutions which were aside of the NAMA process.  It does not include loans advanced by AIB and Bank of Ireland to borrowers whose aggregate borrowing was less than &euro;20 million and it also excludes property loans which remained with the participating institutions on the basis that they were not eligible for transfer to us.</p><p> NAMA observations and concentration risk: You will note from table 1 above that some &euro;34 billion par debt has been advanced to the largest 29 debtor connections.  Lending on this scale to a relatively few debtors suggests that the banks consider property lending to be almost a one way bet, not withstanding the well established cyclical behaviour of property markets and the steep rise in prices from 2002 onwards.  It is clear that financial institutions and debtors shared a groupthink view that prices would remain on an upward trajectory and that there was limited downside associated with property lending.  The view was presumably supported by favourable medium-term economic and demographic projections produced by economists and commentators and by the expectations that any setback in the property market would be temporary and minor, in line with an expected soft landing of the Irish economy.  There was an obvious mismatch that few economists or commentators called into question when, on the one hand, lending was growing at over 30% on average per annum in institutions, and, on the other, the economy was growing at rates at between 6% and 9% over the period 2003 to 2007.</p><p>The impact of greater competition amongst lenders was to increase risky and imprudent lending.  In particular, lending on the basis of it providing very high levels of project funding, sometimes at 100%, appears to have been quite common.  The equity pledged by the debtor, when required, often took the form of unrealised paper equity from other transactions.  Few, if any, financial institutions wanted to be left out of what was seen as a profitable business due to the larger lender margins and the relatively low operating costs.  In normal market conditions, a finite number of viable development projects would be able to secure finance from a finite pool of the bank funding available for property development.  In perverse conditions, which held sway in the Irish market up to 2007, there was far too much bank funding available and, ultimately, it found its way not only to a finite number of development projects which were viable, but also to many other projects which could be viable only on very heroic and often mistaken assumptions.  The sheer weight of debt funding that was available caused an overflow effect into riskier projects which could not have been entertained in normal market conditions.</p><p> It was difficult to avoid the impression that the institutions perceived lending as a sales activity and that, in the rush to expand bank balance sheets, a rigorous focus on lending quality was lost.  Some bank balance sheets doubled between 2003 and 2008.  In one case, the size of the bank balance sheet quadrupled.  Based on our experience of managing acquired loans, it is difficult to fathom a robust rationale for a significant portion of the property lending and, at the very least, it raises the question of whether lenders' remuneration was based on lending volume rather than on the quality of such lending.  It is unclear to what extent there was analysis by bank strategists, by the Financial Regulator or by economists of the relationship between the volume of lending, by region or by sector, and the projected demand for property assets, by region and by sector.  Nor is it clear to what extent did the institutions subject their lending to vigorous stress testing or, indeed, were required to do so by the Financial Regulator.</p><p> Net worth: In advancing additional funding during the years up to 2007, the lending institutions appear to have relied heavily on assessments of debtors' perceived net worth &ndash; the difference between a debtor's valuation of his assets and liabilities.  Statements of affairs &ndash; a list of assets, liabilities and value &ndash; were relied upon to provide comfort that a debtor's financial position could support new lending and that he could service his liabilities.  However, these documents were not always audited and were often self-certified with asset values assessed by the debtors themselves.</p><p> Compounding the weakness was the fact that, for most debtors, assets comprised mainly or exclusively property assets so that when the market collapsed, the value of the asset side of balance sheets plummeted and the net worth evaporated rapidly.  As market prices rose in the years up to 2007, so the self-assessed net worth of debtors also appeared to rise, thereby giving rise to ... giving the lending institutions a sense of false comfort over additional security that did not exist.</p><p> Land and development assets: This issue was particularly acute in cases where a debtor's property portfolio had significant exposure to land and development assets.  A fall ... A rise or fall in market prices has a multiplier effect on the value ... on the price of land indeed for residential or commercial development.  The price of development land is a residual value after costs and developer's profit margin are deducted from projected sales proceeds.  If projected sales proceeds based on market prices fall significantly, there may be little or no residual value.  The land goes back to agricultural value or less.  This is illustrated in table 2 below.  This would explain the steep fall, in some cases of up to 90%, in the value of development land in the years after 2007.  Much of the land had been bought speculatively.  That is also why NAMA acquired some loans for only 10% or less of their face value.  The fact that a substantial proportion of lending was secured by riskier land and development assets also explains why bank balance sheets suffered such extensive damage to their solvency.  Unlike investment assets, there was no income flow associated with land and development assets and, in the absence of demand and liquidity, there was nothing to arrest the fall in prices as it gathered downward momentum.</p><p> Liquidity in the land market dried up completely.  There were no buyers because residential prices had fallen to such a level that the construction of new houses was unprofitable.  This point should be borne in mind whenever you hear the contention that NAMA or, indeed, any other market participant should have been funding the construction of houses in 2010 and 2011.  It simply would have not made commercial sense by reference to market prices then prevailing and neither debt or equity providers would have made a compelling case for funding speculative development at that stage.</p><p> Smaller debtor connections: While the concentration of lending among the larger debtor connections was clearly excessive, our experience has been that the quality of such lending tended to be better quality than the lending to some of the smaller debtor connections.  As set out in table 1 above, a total of &euro;16 billion was advanced to 627 borrowers who had aggregate debts of less than &euro;100 million each.  Generally speaking, the initial discounts on these smaller debtor connection loans were higher and NAMA has to take even higher impairment provisions on them in the interim.</p><p>While some of the lending was to professional, well-managed entities, much of it was to individuals or syndicates whose primary business was not property developments, or who became involved in property developments relatively late in the cycle.  Much of the lending related to potential development projects in or near towns, or in rural areas, rather than main urban centres.  In some cases, one can see how an individual project may have made commercial sense to a bank, if assessed in isolation.  The problem was that similar projects were receiving funding from other financial institutions and clearly not all those projects could have ever been simultaneously viable.  </p><p> Corporate infrastructure:  some of the debtor connections who received this funding did not have adequate support in corporate infrastructure.  In particular, some of the property businesses which built up ... quickly built up balance sheets of &euro;1 billion or more, did not have the financial expertise required to manage bank balance sheets of that size and it does not appear that the institutions made much of an effort to push for improved governance of the debtor's businesses.  By contrast with our situation, property lending in the UK is largely advanced to publically quoted companies, which are suitably resourced to manage their bank balance sheets and the risks; for instance, British Land, a listed UK development company, which has debt levels comparable to some of NAMA's larger debtors, have more than 200 employees.  As the crisis emerged in 2008, 2009, UK property plcs accessed the equity marked and used that funding to pay down debt. That option was not available here, given the majority of debtors were, in effect, sole traders and they were totally reliant on bank debt.  A debtor's track record and reputation appear to be paramount consideration for the lenders.  There appeared to be a highly accommodating attitude among financial institutions towards the more prominent debtors and a concern that, if that institution was not particularly amenable, the debtor would look elsewhere for the funding of future projects.  Clearly debtors were not slow to exploit the unusual lending market.  Some of the more professional debtor connections tended to focus on particular sectors in which they had developed a particular expertise.  This is particularly the case for debtor connections whose main asset base was outside of Ireland.  However, one of the more notable features of the acquired loan portfolio by NAMA was that many debtor connections had borrowed against a diverse range of assets.  It was not unusual to find, when all the loan information was collated, that a connection had exposure to a number of jurisdictions and to a number of sectors, including office, retail, residential, in addition to ownership of one or more hotels, as well as undeveloped land.  After NAMA acquired the loans, it was not always apparent to us what the debtor's strategy might have been in assembling such a range of assets which was so diverse, by reference to a sector and location.  The obvious conclusion, in some cases, was that the compulsion to purchase more and more uncorrelated assets was entirely related to the almost unlimited availability of debt funding.  Many of these asset sectors require specialist business skills which do not appear to have been available to some of the debtor connections involved.  The fact that many of them had only small supporting teams means they could have found it difficult to devote the requisite skill sets to the range and scale of projects covered by their borrowings.  A debtor who was a successful house builder will not necessarily have the expertise to manage a group of hotels, or run a shopping centre, but this does not appear to have inhibited the lenders involved.</p><p> I hope that these comments are helpful in terms of assisting the committee to obtain a fuller understanding of some of the issues which you have been asked to address.  Following the Chairman's statement, I will be happy to respond to any particular questions you may wish to raise.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#J00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to address you today.  I need to say at the start that we're here, of course representing an agency that was a key part of the response to the banking crisis, rather than as a contributor to that crisis.  You've asked me to deal with five lines of inquiry, and I will take them each in turn.  The first one was the commercial real estate development model that existed before the crisis and that model was ultimately, of course, very costly for this State in terms of fixing the financial institutions that funded it and, as a consequence, an inordinate and painful burden has been placed on citizens as the necessary steps are taken to restore normality to our economy.  Volumes have been, and I'm sure will be, written about the confluence of factors that made that model inherently high risk, vulnerable and unsustainable.  Contributing factors, such as zoning and planning policy; tax incentives; irresponsible developer funding; consumer mortgage lending; absence of market analysis, and others, have been well documented and no doubt will be explained to you by experts in these areas.  The most effective way that I can contribute is to give you comment, informed largely by NAMA's experience over the past five years in dealing with the consequences of the banking crisis and our role in fixing it.  As NAMA was established to acquire the loans of the largest real estate developers, I will focus on the structure of lending to these developers.</p><p>NAMA having bought these loans is now for such developers the successor to the banks.</p><p> Let me talk first about debt funding dependence.  From that vantage point what jumps out most of all is a commercial real estate model with an almost complete dependence on debt funding.  This had the effect of placing all of the risk with the banks, and as it transpired, ultimately with the State and its citizens.  By way of background, traditionally in lending equity is provided by the borrower to mitigate a bank's risk.  Equity, in effect, puts the borrower, not the bank, in the riskiest capital position.  In the event of default the borrower is the first to lose.  New rules in mortgage lending, for example, require that a person buying a home now has to come up with a 20% deposit as equity.  However, based on NAMA's experience that fundamental precondition of bank funding was rarely observed in the pre-crash commercial real estate model.</p><p> While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that loan-to-value ratios were typically less than 100% when the loan was drawn, the reality in many cases was that a developer's equity contribution was in the form of a rolling up of unrealised paper profit from other developments.  This was presented as an equity position.  Rarely, if ever, was it in the form of cash.  On the face of it then, developers had some skin in the game, but in reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions, levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions.  This meant that the banks were taking high equity grade risk for low debt grade returns, and in fact even those low debt returns were often not realised, but rather accrued as rolled-up interest booked as income in bank financial statements.  These were, and continue to be, the accounting rules under IFRS, not just in Ireland but wherever IFRS is adopted.</p><p> In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It's safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash the banks stood to take 100% of the losses, and that's what happened.  Those losses, as we now know to our cost, have had to be funded by Irish citizens to the tune of &euro;64 billion.  It would be no thanks to many of those who were the cause of this if, ultimately, that cost turns out to be less than the &euro;64 billion.</p><p> There was a relaxed approach to project feasibility.  The recycling of unrealised equity positions from project to project meant that the model could only keep working as long as prices kept rising and the banks kept lending, and few questioned those assumptions.  Many decisions seemed to be based on a view, shared by bankers and developers, that property prices could continue to defy the fundamental law of any market that when prices rise unsustainably, there is always going to be a day of reckoning, and the steeper the price, the more painful the reckoning.</p><p> This was compounded by the fact that the model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility.  It's much easier to take an optimistic view of a project when you are not being asked to put your own hard-earned capital at risk.  Based on the loans that NAMA took over, feasibility analyses in respect of projects either didn&rsquo;t exist or were incomplete or were based on flawed, overly optimistic, assumptions about the future.  In the residential development sector, for instance, feasibility workings seem to have been based on aspirational exit sales values in an already frenzied peak market.  Very little, if any, consideration was given to the inherent cyclical nature of the property markets.  The attitude appears to have been that the only way was up, that somehow the forces of gravity were suspended as far as the Irish market was concerned and that the long established pattern of property market cycles was no longer relevant to Ireland.  In this model the banks were taking the type of risk normally the preserve of private equity or hedge fund providers without demanding the same level of rigorous analysis that those providers would have made a condition of funding in the first place.</p><p> Mr. McDonagh has talked in some detail about another facet of the model: the dearth of professionally run developer platforms.  The banks were quite clearly lending to individuals and companies that, notwithstanding the massive sums involved, had little or no supporting corporate infrastructure, had poor governance and had inadequate financial controls and this applied to companies of all sizes.  The banks failed to ensure that Irish property companies, to whom they advanced billions of euros in lending, operated to the same corporate governance standards as their peers in other jurisdictions or, indeed, similar sized entities in other sectors of the Irish economy.</p><p>There was over production of residential accommodation in the economy and this, and a range of other factors at play, cumulatively resulted in the situation where development and construction output totally overshot what would have been considered the normal level of production in an economy of our size.  This is best illustrated by the construction of 90,000 new houses and apartments in Ireland in 2006 - 90,000 new houses in one year for a population that was then 4.2 million.  The output was more than five times the European average at the time.  In the same year in Britain, to meet demand from a population which was 14 times the size of Ireland's, just 190,000 new residential properties were built.  The Irish development model, fuelled by a combination of the poor lending practices that I have just described, a scattergun approach to tax incentives, poor zoning and planning decisions and a complete absence of rigorous, independent analysis of population and market trends, appears to have been relying blindly on the belief that if you build it, they will come, and no matter what price, they will buy.  I should say, lest I give the wrong impression, that this problem was not peculiar to the residential sector.  All segments of the market were affected by varying degrees of over-supply.  You could be forgiven, indeed, for describing the sentiment that informed this over-supply as hubris, and perhaps in some of the more spectacular lendings as trophy chasing.  Part of the Irish landscape still bears the scars of that approach in the form of unfinished and half-finished housing estates, some of which have been inherited by NAMA and which NAMA is now funding to completion.  </p><p> And the final point I would like to mention relates to the quality of construction, and, in some cases, the absence of much quality at all.  NAMA has incurred multi-million euro costs in remediating building defects such as non-compliance with regulatory standards, including fire safety standards, as we prepare assets for sale or for occupation.  Many of these defects stem from a lack of oversight and attention to detail from both the builder, developer and the building control divisions of the local authorities.  This was compounded by the sheer volume of development which reduced the due diligence carried out.  Hopefully, these issues have been fully addressed with the recently enacted Building Control (Amendment) Regulations Act of 2014.  Chairman, that gives you a picture of what the model was like before the crash based, again I emphasise, on NAMA's experience of the aftermath.  </p><p> So, what would a sustainable model look like? To finish off this segment could I suggest learning from NAMA's experience that a sustainable model for the future would, at a minimum, include all of the following features: In the funding area there would be a sustainable financing model that includes both debt and equity finance.  There would be proper banking supervision, robust but not stifling.  There would be macro prudential measures to flatten peaks and troughs.  There would be adequate bonding for customers and there would be pertinent audit standards such indeed as IFRS 9 which is coming down the tracks and they would be implemented rigorously.  In the development sector there would be properly resourced and governed development and construction companies, including publicly quoted companies.  There would be active and skilled boards of directors with proper oversight.  There would be prudent management of balance sheet exposures, especially debt arrangements, and there would be adequate building regulations and appropriate oversight in relation to building standards.  </p><p> And then in the planning and market area in general there would be a holistic, centralised approach to zoning, planning and infrastructure provision.  There would be long-term social housing planning and there would be publicly available information of population projections, demand projections and the likely supply outlook.  In regard to the latter, NAMA has, with the Irish bank and payments federation, taken an initiative to fund research by the ESRI into the residential housing market, specifically into the likely pattern of emerging demand and the potential supply constraints that may influence future market activity.  That research, and similar research from other sources, will be important in terms of guiding future development investment plans in Ireland.  What the initial findings, by the way, of that ESRI research tell us is that the vast majority of future housing demand will be in Dublin, the surrounding commuter belt and other major urban centres.  Sadly, it is also clear from the research that some of the housing supply built at the height of the boom will never be occupied because it is located in areas where there is no demand.</p><p>The second and third lines of inquiry which you asked me to deal with, Chairman, are the duty to ... NAMA's duty to obtain the best financial return and its contribution to property market activity, and if you agree, I will take both of those together.  <br/><br/>NAMA's mandate derives from the NAMA Act and section 10 of that Act defines the purposes of NAMA.  It requires NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State, to deal expeditiously with the assets acquired by it and to protect or otherwise enhance the value of those assets.  That is the core of NAMA's mandate and it is clearly a commercial one.  Our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, therefore, is to get the best financial return from the assets in our portfolio and, crucially, to do so expeditiously.  It is not an option for us to adopt what might be termed a &quot;long-term holding strategy&quot; to await some optimum price level at some indeterminate point in the future before disposing of the assets.  We have to do our business expeditiously, which means responding pragmatically to market conditions by taking advantages of opportunities to sell assets where demand and price are favourable.  It's also the case, though, that the phrase, &quot;achieving the best financial return for the State&quot;, has implications beyond simply getting the highest price for an asset, which, of course, we always seek to do.  <br/><br/>NAMA paid for the loans it acquired from the banks with senior debt of &euro;30.2 billion guaranteed by the State.  Central to the best financial return for the State is repaying that senior debt and repaying it quickly.  It is a contingent burden that should be removed from citizens as soon as practicable, not just because of the amount, not just because of the interest payable, not just because of the impact on the banks' balance sheets but because of the wider implications for the sovereign. <br/><br/>It became very clear very quickly from early engagement with the troika that they would have had serious concerns if NAMA had signalled or adopted any type of extended senior debt redemption schedule.  They regarded repayment of the NAMA debt as one of the key recovery factors for this country and one of the key deliverables in exiting the bailout.  I would contend that if NAMA had not reduced its debt as expeditiously as it has, Ireland could have been in a second bailout, as market concerns about the contingent liability would have been very real.  The troika closely monitored the progress that we were making in meeting our first major senior debt redemption target - that was &euro;7.5 billion by the end of 2013.  To the troika, but also to the capital markets and the rating agencies, the signal effect of reducing the State's contingent liability was very important.  It was recognised that in so far as NAMA could make significant progress on redeeming its senior debt, there would be collateral benefits in terms of the creditworthiness of the sovereign and, by extension, in terms of Ireland's borrowing costs.  This has been recognised in Ireland's ratings upgrades and it is an obvious contributory factor to the very favourable position of Ireland right now in the bond and money markets and, indeed, it has been recognised as such.<br/><br/>I might also mention that, for the second year in succession, we have been in a position to pay a coupon on our subordinated debt.  This has had a positive impact on the balance sheets of AIB and Bank of Ireland, manifested in the significant upward revision in the valuation of their holdings of our subordinated debt on their balance sheets.  It is a simple fact that debt redemption needs cash generation and cash generation needs asset sales.  <br/><br/>We have been able to repay our senior debt well ahead of schedule because of our strong cash performance - nearly &euro;20 billion to date through asset and loan sales and &euro;5 billion in non-disposal, mainly rental, income, &euro;25 billion in total.  Thoughtful, well aligned asset sales in the Irish and UK markets in particular have been key to this very strong cash generation. <br/><br/>NAMA actively instigated a programme of asset sales by its debtors in Britain in the period 2010 to 2012 when conditions were strong in that market and, likewise, we responded actively when conditions in the Irish market improved significantly in 2013 and 2014.  That approach accords fully with two key principles underpinning NAMA's strategy: no fire sales and no hoarding.  In each of our main markets our approach has been to release assets for sale in a phased and orderly manner that's consistent with the level of demand, the availability of credit, and the absorption capacity of the market.As a result, London and the UK accounted for almost 80% of all disposals between 2010 and 2012.</p><p>Ireland in contrast accounted for just 12% of disposals during that period and that approach enabled NAMA not only to achieve the best possible return during it's early deleveraging phase, but it also allowed the Irish market time to reach its trough and to begin its recovery.  A fire sale in the Irish market at that time would have been...would have had the effect of intensifying and prolonging the market's downturn, and would have been contrary to both NAMA's overriding commercial objective of achieving the best possible return for the State and its ancillary objective of contributing to a sustainable level of activity in the Irish property market. It could also have crystalised a loss on the NAMA portfolio, which because of the State guarantee would have created additional losses for taxpayers on top of the losses that they have already had to fund in recapitalising the various financial institutions.</p><p> We were not, however Chairman, during that time sitting on our hands...on our hands in Ireland in that 2010 to 2012 period. During that time NAMA placed a major emphasis on asset management to enhance the future value...disposal value of the collateral securing its loans, most notably by working with debtors and receivers to complete unfinished projects, to fund new viable commercial and residential development and to enhance planning permissions and remove other obstacles to development.  During that period when there was little other activity in the Irish market we invested over &euro;600 million in the sector and during that crucial period we also placed a major emphasis on stimulating the market's recovery and fostering the sense that the market was open for business despite perceptions to the contrary.  One initiative was a vendor finance fund of two billion, and there is detail in the statement of how that was deployed, Chairman, but in the interest of brevity I won't read out the details.  But that vendor finance fund played an important part in generating activity in the early days of recovery when the banks had stopped lending for commercial property and investors were still wary of committing funds to Ireland.  These early transactions signalled to international and domestic investors that the Irish market was open for business and played a vital role in attracting finance and activity, particularly from overseas investors where previously there was little or none.</p><p> There is now an active Irish market and NAMA is now taking advantage of that.  The major improvements in the market over the past 18 months have enabled us to shift our disposal focus more to the Irish market.  Reflecting this, in 2014 disposals in Ireland accounted for 46% of all disposals, while London and the rest of the UK accounted for 33%.  In addition to the opportunity to accelerate disposals through existing channels, we have also been taking advantage of new opportunities as they emerge, such as packaging assets for sale to satisfy demand, providing regular flows to the market or providing greater clarity to potential investors, allowing those with limited capacity to bid on a greater number of transactions, thus widening the number of potential bidders and increasing the potential return to the State.</p><p> In the light of the positive shift in the Irish property market and its outlook, the board of NAMA undertook a review of strategy in early 2014, and following that review we moved to take further advantage of strong investor appetite and to accelerate disposals with a view to redeeming 80% of senior debt by the end of 2016, a full two years ahead of the original schedule, and completing the deleveraging process in 2017-18. </p><p> In the context of the clear supply shortages evident in the Dublin residential and office markets, NAMA is also facilitating and funding the delivery of 4,500 new homes in Dublin and the greater Dublin area, and is also facilitating the provision of 3.84 million square feet of prime office space in the Dublin Docklands SDZ, to ensure adequate office supply to meet growing demand. </p><p> In summary Chairman, as the committee has specifically asked the question, I would say that NAMA has played an important part in stimulating activity in the market. Our interventions were at all times strategic, helping to lift the market off the floor and to stimulate activity levels that are more sustainable in the long run.  For quite a while, indeed, we were almost alone in doing this. </p><p> The fourth line of inquiry, Chairman, you asked me to deal with is the contribution to the social and economic development of the State.  In the context of the overriding commercial mandate that we have just discussed, we seek to manage our portfolio in Ireland in a manner that compliments the objectives of other public bodies, including Government departments, State agencies and local authorities.  One way that NAMA gives practical effect to this is by giving public bodies first option on the purchase at current assessed market valuations of property securing NAMA loans.  In line with that commitment we have facilitated the sale of land and property for a range of public uses including schools and healthcare facilities.  An aspect of that work that is very important to NAMA is the delivery of houses and apartments for social purposes...social housing.  Where we can make properties available for social housing in a way that is consistent with section 10, it is a win-win for everybody involved.  And we have identified more than 6,000 properties as being available and potentially suitable for local housing.  Local authorities have confirmed demand for about 2,000 of theses, and while I am a little disappointed that take-up hasn't been higher, I do understand that local authorities and the Housing Agency are obliged to comply with their own policies on the location of social housing. But we are working hard to deliver on the properties for which demand has been confirmed, and at the end of 2014 more than 1,000 had been delivered and today that figure is very near 1,200, and by the end of the year we would hope to achieve the delivery of all of the remaining properties up to the 2,000 for which the local authorities have indicated demand.  It is important to say, by the way, that it is not just a question of handing over the keys to the local authorities.  In most cases significant investment is required to complete the property and to carry out a State-wide works.  In this way, indeed, the beneficiaries of NAMA's social housing extend beyond the residents of the new properties.  For existing residents, empty houses become inhabited and outstanding works are completed and capital expenditure in excess of &euro;20 million, has been incurred to date in carrying out such work. </p><p> We also, Chairman, facilitate commercial transactions and that is another important part of work...of NAMA's work in the Irish property market that might not otherwise take place.  A good example of this is NAMA's ongoing work in identifying suitable properties for companies looking to establish or expand existing business operations in Ireland and facilitating engagement between those companies and NAMA debtors and receivers.  NAMA's work in this area is very closely aligned with that of IDA Ireland and other State agencies, whose core responsibility is to attract and expand foreign direct investment activity and employment in Ireland and there are similar examples of that, Chairman, in the written statement but I won't read them out. </p><p> NAMA makes a wider contribution also in its rent abatement initiative to help retailers that are struggling to meet their contracted rent obligations.  The aggregate annual value of abatements agreed to date is in excess of &euro;23 million. In addition to this, NAMA has agreed long-term rent reductions worth over &euro;40 million.  This does mean that NAMA has agreed to forego rent due to it, but the corollary is that we are safeguarding jobs and activity and businesses in the wider economy. </p><p> We also work hard, including through our interaction with public representatives such as yourselves, to facilitate the letting and saleing of land to local community and sporting organizations and to accommodate other local requests where we can.  And often these may not be particularly high profile initiatives but they are important locally. And a very recent illustration is our capacity to accommodate a request from the Blarney Community Association for the provision of temporary car parking facilities for the community's St. Patrick's Day festival. I just give it as an example of things we do like that.  It is totally coincidental, Chairman, that it is in Cork.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#N00300"><p>The overall point I would make, is that while NAMA is guided by its commercial objective, it doesn't operate in a vacuum.  We are conscious of the impact of our work on the wider Irish economy and on communities, and we work hard to ensure that our impact is a positive one.</p> <p>  The final line of inquiry you asked me to deal with Chairman, was the establishment of performance metrics by the board of NAMA.  The key measure of NAMA is our capacity to repay our &euro;31.8 billion debt. Progress we are making can be seen by the fact that we have already exceeded the cumulate...excuse me, 50% senior debt redemption target originally set for the end of 2016. We have done that two years ahead of schedule. </p> <p>  Last month we redeemed another billion of our senior bonds, bringing to &euro;17.6 billion the amount of senior debt that is redeemed to date.  That is 58% of the senior debt originally issued in 2010-2011.</p><p>We're able to repay our debt ahead of schedule because of the strong cash performance, the &euro;25 billion that I talked about earlier.  NAMA, while we're not a publicly limited company is an organisation that operates at the highest end of the public interest and governance spectrum.  The fact alone that NAMA must publish quarterly financial statements that are prepared in accordance with IFRS shows that NAMA also operates at the highest end of the transparency spectrum.  NAMA has adopted the best practices of corporate governance including financial and management reporting practices, board composition, and structure and risk management.  NAMA has designed and implemented a robust management information system, and has clearly defined key performance indicators in place, which form the bases of its internal reporting and monitoring framework whereby the NAMA board and sub-committees are regularly kept informed of the organisation's commercial and operational progress.  The board of NAMA also recently reviewed a C&amp;AG recommendation to the effect that it should set an expected or target rate of return to measure its overall performance, and that it should also measure its performance by reference to targets for the return on disposals, and on property held by debtors and insolvency practitioners.  In line with this, the board has approved a number of rate of return measures, which it considers appropriate for its business, and we propose to report on these additional measures in our 2014 annual report, which we expect to publish at the end of May.  </p><p>  In conclusion, Chairman, I would simply emphasise again the point I made at the outset that NAMA is here and is a key contributor to dealing with the fallout from the banking crisis and not a contributor to its cause.  I know you have asked NAMA to attend this committee in the context of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the domestic policy responses, and it is for others, including yourselves, to ultimately take a view on whether NAMA has indeed been such an appropriate and effective response.  However, I would say, in finishing up, that any assessment of this should take account of the following points: that NAMA has delivered in respect of each aspect of our mandate as laid down in the Act; we quickly and effectively acquire the eligible assets from the banks and the acquisition and evaluation of those assets has been cleared without qualification by the C&amp;AG and the EU Commission.  As the CEO has said this enabled the Irish banking system to recognise and address upfront the loan loss difficulties it had created for itself.  We have generated &euro;25 billion cash in the past five years; we have paid our own way; and we have generated profits of more than &euro;200 million in each of the last four years despite the constraints of a challenged property backed up for much of that period.</p><p> We have actively intervened in the property market in Ireland and contributed to the recovery now taking place.  That intervention was strategically timed to minimise further damage, stimulate the market at the right time, and take advantage of growing investor interest.  I do believe we called it right.  We have advanced over &euro;1 billion into construction projects in Ireland in the past five years, and we plan and have the capacity to invest another &euro;3 billion if required.  And we have, to date, funded the construction of more than 1,900 new homes in Dublin.  In fact, NAMA funded the construction of 40% of all new homes delivered in Dublin in 2014, a statistic, I think, which is telling in itself.</p><p> We have made significant progress in facilitating the timely delivery of grade A office space, retail, leisure and residential accommodation in the Dublin docklands SDZ and wider central business district, and we have the capacity to invest &euro;3 billion in this and other capital projects all over Ireland.  We have facilitated the delivery of 1,200 properties for social housing, and we will have delivered 2,000 by the end of the year.  We are supporting 15,000 jobs and trading businesses directly re-linked to our loans.</p><p> However, most important, and I'll finish on this, we have made excellent progress on debt repayment.  We are already two years ahead of target in repaying our senior debt; we're committed to repaying 80% by the end of next year; we're committed to repaying 100% by 2017-18, and we are committed to full repayment of our subordinated date.  Finally, should conditions in the economy and in the property market continue to remain favourable, we are hopeful, based on our current projections, that NAMA may realise a surplus of up to &euro;1 billion for the taxpayer by the time we complete our work.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

Thank you, Mr. McDonagh.  I know that the proceedings are scheduled to run until close to 6 p.m. today, so members will have a number of opportunities to come in.  I am very conscious, though, that we need to manage this both in terms of breaks and getting through our programme as well.  We have four lead questioners this morning.  Just before I bring in our first lead, which is Senator O'Keeffe, very briefly, Mr. Daly, can I ... just going over your opening statement, and I just need to get this substantiated before I just give you one question.  Are you stating that during the crisis period borrowers were given 100% of funding to their development projects without actually having to make any cash contribution to those projects themselves while at the same times the banks were actually taking 100% exposure in terms of risk to those loans?</p></speech>

I'm not saying that that happened in every single case, Chairman, but I am saying that in terms of what we saw when we took across the loans and when we looked at the paperwork, that happened in very many cases.</p></speech>

Can you just explain briefly, just in layman's terms because the general public will be looking in at these proceedings, as to how a bank would go about valuing its assets and loan book and so forth in terms of how projected losses or profits might be incurred, and how NAMA went about its valuation of those assets when they acquired it and if there was a difference in approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#O01100"><p>I think its pretty much dealt with in Mr. McDonagh's statement.  The NAMA one is quite clear; we were required to value all of the loans as ... in terms of their valuation in November 2009, so that was a fair value event at that time.  And we went through that in a very rigorous way, which I think again is explained in Mr. McDonagh's statement and I won't repeat it.  In relation to the banks, again it's the area of they were dealing on their IFRS, they were dealing under IAS 39, which means they were the originators of the loans.</p></speech>

So if there was a slight decline they would margin in that decline to continue adding some sort of aggregated or average into the future where ... in ... when NAMA loan books were put in place were you forward looking in terms of these were the losses to be expected or where you saying well there'll still be a gradual job?</p></speech>

I mean we looked at what was the actual valuation in November '09, but we would also, every year we'd carry out a bottom-up impairment ... or exercise, which forms the basis of our impairment figure.</p></speech>

In a bank in doing its impairment exercise, it would only look at, as I say, has anything changed that I'm aware of at this point in time, 31 December, if their accounting year end was 31 December, that would cause me to say that something happened that actually would result in the cash flows, I expect then the loan not to occur.  So you can have what is called this time lag effect that while you expect maybe prices to fall in the future or the economy is going into downturn that hasn't actually happened at that point in time.  So you had this, I suppose, it's best illustrated by the following is that, you know, NAMA started acquiring the loans from institutions on 31 March 2010, but the first time the banks really recognised the scale of the losses they had was at the end of 2010 once NAMA had reported the loans, you know.  They weren't obliged to recognise those losses at 31 December 2009 because under IFRS effectively the NAMA event had not yet happened.  It was something that was going to happen after 31 December, and that is the fatal flaw in IAS 39.  And IFRS, 9, the new regulatory context coming effective 1 January 2018, actually says if you're aware that something is likely to happen then you have to take account of that of that when you do----</p></speech>

Good morning gentlemen.  I'd like if I might open by asking you to cast your minds back to the days and weeks when you first saw what those bad loans were that you'd taken on, because obviously as time passes you sort of create a new ... a new sense of them.  But if you can cast your minds back, you were if you like the citizens tasked with looking at these.  You had a huge responsibility, I think you've made that clear yourselves.  And so while others of my colleagues will, will ask for specific questions in relation to roll-ups and hair cuts, I just want to know what, what went through your minds when you saw the bad loans in those banks.  What did you think then, as opposed to what do you think about it now?</p></speech>

The European Commission didn't approve the whole validation methodology until February 2010, the end of February 2010, and we took the first loans across from the institutions, which was known as tranche one, at the end of March 2010, and, as the loan valuations were coming through during the month of March, and you know really hectic time for everybody because the Government wanted us to get on, the Central Bank wanted us to get on in terms of taking the loans across, you could see that the losses coming through were, you know, much higher than what probably anybody in the system expected.  And it almost became an event, you know, NAMA are you doing this process correctly?  You know these losses aren't expected ... you know, you know this has huge consequences for the capital of the banks and I suppose we had to ... we spent a lot of time as an executive but also at the board, looking at the valuations and saying, "Jesus they're much worse than anyone expected but we have a job to do and our job is to value the loans in accordance with the methodology approved by the European Commission and being able to stand over it" and that we did.  And I think you know thinking back to the first tranche one transfers, which happened at the end of March 2010, myself and the chairman here did a press conference, I think there was complete shock in the country and also I suppose within the system probably leading up to that day in terms of the losses that were emerging, and obviously the losses got much higher as you went  down through the portfolio.  And I suppose it came to, I suppose a head really in September 2010 when the Government instructed NAMA to acquire the residual amount of the loans in bulk form and estimate the discount to what they would eventually be.  And we estimated discounts and the discounts turned out to be, you know, 99% accurate-----</p></speech>

I came probably slightly later to this because Mr. McDonagh had been there since kind of mid-May 2009 at the preliminary stage and the board was appointed in December, so our visibility on this came around kind of December, January.  My overwhelming impression looking back on it is the ... I'm trying to find the right word but, what ... where was the business logic in a lot of this lending?  And it would be really I suppose, maybe, back to the that table we provided to the committee about the distribution of NAMA debtors.  The massive amount of lending to a very small number of people at the top, and then a lot of the what I would call  lending on hope value to people at the bottom.  A lot of that was related to land which wasn't even zoned, which had hope value more than anything else.  And then it was also I think I remember one of our surprises would have been that the banks seemed to have been acting sort of almost in isolation.  They didn't really have much interest in what a particular client's exposure was to another bank across the system.  There was no doubt, I think, in terms particularly of those to whom most had been lent on an individual basis, there was an emphasis on a kind of relationship lending as much as lending for particular projects that actually seemed feasible.</p></speech>

I don't think, by the way, I'm not ascribing any bad faith to the banks or anything here.  I'm just saying they fell into this sort of comfort zone of saying, "Ah, that's lender ... that's my client, they've a great track record, they have ... they're producing projects for lending.  That seems very, very good.  Sure, the country is on the up, everything is going grand, there's going to be a demand for all of this.  And I think a lot of that was based on a relationship or a view of the standing of the debtor, which really should have been much more objective and should have ... there should have been much more rigorous analysis and independent analysis of proposals that debtors were putting forward.</p></speech>

I mean in a population of 4.2 million, that's sort of extraordinary really.  And they warrant plcs like you'll see operating in the ... like I'm an accountant and, obviously boring in that respect, but I'd look at the UK market and see there that the plcs all there and they'd be probably the size of, you know, &euro;4 billion, &euro;5 billion, &euro;6 billion as a plc and they have access to equity and then you see individuals with you know, sole traders, not to say that they don't have skills, because they do, but it's just the fact that they really didn't have the corporate infrastructure and they might have borrowed &euro;2 billion or &euro;2.5 billion and you just find that ... I personally from coming outside the system found that extraordinary that anyone could borrow that amount of money but that's what happened and, you know, they borrowed from ... and, as the chairman said, this whole issue is that you had borrowed from my institution but the borrower had also gone down the street and borrowed from another institution then gone further down the street and found a third institution, and, by the end of the process, they had borrowed from the five institutions.  So-----</p></speech>

And that wasn't happening and that was the issue.</p></speech>

Can you just draw that out or elaborate for us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.68" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#P01900"><p>Yes, well maybe if I give sort of an example of this might be the best way to show it to you ... on day one the bank did lend 70% loan-to-value, they all seemed to ... in response to questions I put to them during 2009, all the institutions basically came back and said they were limited to a maximum 70% loan-to-value.  There was one of the institutions admitted it was lending close to a 100% loan-to-value but that was an outlier.</p><p>So, on day 1, an institution might have lent somebody &euro;70 million for a &euro;100 million project.  That would be a 70% loan to value.  Typically, what happened as property prices begin to rise, the debtor went in and said:<blockquote><br /><br />Listen, I have seen another building I want to buy.  It's &euro;100 million.  Will you lend that to me?  The reason you can lend that to me is that the original building which you lent me on which was 70% loan to value, valued at &euro;100 million, is now worth &euro;120 million.</blockquote>The bank, it seems to me, then says, &quot;Okay yes we will give you the full &euro;100 million to buy the second building so, when you look at it, we have assets worth &euro;220 million and you only have &euro;170 million worth of borrowing so that's 77% loan to value.&quot;  So it still looks very prudent to anyone who comes in to look at the paper files to say the banks are still within their limits of lending.  Of course, the issue is that, when property prices start falling, that equity which was there from &euro;100 million to &euro;120 million disappears and also the new building that you bought which was effectively 100% lending at &euro;100 million has probably dropped in value as well, so your loan valuations shoot through the roof.  So, you can say that it looked to be clever lending, it looked to be good lending at the time but effectively the debtor was not putting up any additional equity for the second asset that he bought.  He was using the increase in value of the existing building to get the money for the next thing.  We've seen examples of that in the portfolio.</p></speech>

A senior person from an institution which is not in NAMA came in to talk to me and he was talking about the lending processes.  He said to me that, at one stage, a debtor came in and said to him, "I want to borrow &euro;200 million for a project".  He said, "I asked him for a statement of his net worth."  He said he took it out of his pocket.  He said to me, "You can look at that for two minutes and then I'm taking it back off you, and he put it back in his pocket."  He said he could not wait until he left the room to write down what net worth he had.  I said "Did you lend him the money"?  He said, "Yes I lent him the money to my shame."  Effectively, somebody was perceived to be very rich and perceived to be very successful and things like this.  I am not saying that this can happen all over the place but I am only saying in terms of one example of one person who said this to me.  I think the practices got lax.  The banks were seen to be very profitable, property lending was seen to be the clever thing to do, the economy was growing very strongly.  As I said in my opening statement, there was a fundamental disconnect between property lending of the banks' balance sheets that somebody in the regulator just did not pick up on and say, "Bank lending has grown by, on average, over 30% per annum and the economy has grown between 6% and 9% per annum."  There was a complete disconnect.</p></speech>

There was an apparatus both internally and externally.  Yet you are able to say at this point that the practices were lax.  So how, what, where did that disconnect?</p></speech>

I think it didn't take somebody like myself or my colleagues or the chairman and the board to arrive in and to see this after a month or two of looking at it or looking at the data to figure out there's something fundamentally structurally wrong here, how this was not seen.  I mean, it is for others to answer about why they did not see it and, like all things, you can look to have the appearance of all the correct structures, but whether they are doing the right thing is it.  Sometimes, you know, I'm a great believer in what people call the maverick.  Somebody who asks you the questions you never thought of or not the groupthink question and saying well, "What about this, what about that."  Just to think about things in an alternative way and I think there have been other contributors here from across the spectrum to this inquiry to date.  Effectively, everybody thought there was going to be a soft landing.  Everybody thought it was a temporary slow down and that the economy would get up and running again and that it would not be as bad as it was.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be much worse than it was because I think it's key from the figures when anyone looks at them, they are publicly available if you take any of the reports from any of the banks from 2003 to 2008.  The two main banks' balance sheets were &euro;100 billion in 2003 each.  They were &euro;200 billion in 2008.  Anglo Irish Bank was &euro;25 billion in 2003, &euro;100 billion in 2008.  I mean, that was an explosive level of growth.  Where was most of that lending going?  Most of that lending was going to, effectively, the biggest component of the banks' books was commercial property lending.</p></speech>

The scale of lending in Ireland in the overall sense into property is another thing that struck me when I first came across this.  It was extraordinary.  I am talking about the period of 2006, you had &euro;160 billion loans in regard to property - land and development &euro;60 billion and commercial &euro;100 billion.  You also had on top of that &euro;140 billion lending in mortgages and another &euro;100 billion in other areas such as agriculture or industrial.  So you had &euro;400 billion being lent into the property sector at a time when the GNP for Ireland was about &euro;160 billion.  That is the overall impression I got of the extraordinary level of lending that was going into that whole property sector.</p></speech>

I am not saying all of it is not valid.  Obviously it is and there would be lending in there to agriculture and industry and retail and mortgage lending, which is obviously, in many cases, quite valid.  But &euro;400 billion into an economy where the GNP was &euro;160 billion seems to me extraordinary.</p> <p>  You asked about impressions.  The other impression, I suppose, two points.  One was the way, the extent to which interest was being rolled up by the banks.  The extent in fact, to which, in some cases, new loans were being created to take account of the rolled up interest.  That, it seemed to me, was quite unusual.  Then, I suppose, the other aspect of it was - this may have come later but certainly we became aware of it fairly quickly, the extent to which banks were not really attempting to collect income that was coming to debtors.  Rental income in particular is a case in point.  One of the things we did in NAMA when we took across the loans and when we engaged with the debtors was to say, "Well you have a loan on an asset, and that asset is earning a rental income.  Why do you think it should be going into your pocket now and not coming into NAMA"?  We set about capturing all of that rental income.  I am not sure that the banks were taking any great steps to do that in the years up to the crash.</p></speech>

I found this personally extraordinary that 80% of income could be just diverted away and nobody seemed to be following up on it.</p><p>A lot of debtors just stopped paying when the crisis happened in the case on the day, so whatever they were using that income for, they might be trying to save their businesses, put it in their business to keep going to get through this temporary crisis as was the case on the day, or some of them might be ... might try to maintain a lifestyle that they had before the crash.  So one of the first things we decided and really on day 1, once we saw this, we will say, we want that income coming to NAMA so we want that income diverted to us and we have financial monitors on trading businesses to make sure that there is not unnecessary overheads being taken out.  So, one of the key successes of NAMA is when I talked to credit rate agencies as was the case on the day, is NAMA's collected &euro;25 billion to date in five years.  We have got &euro;20 billion collected from asset sales.  We have got &euro;5 billion collected from income on the assets.  That &euro;5 billion has been crucial.  If we did not collect that income and left it with the debtor, the debtor would have probably kept it and spent it or whatever in the case on the day.  We have collected that.  That is a huge sum in terms of the amount of cash flow for any businesses and our view is that that has to go to servicing your debt or amortising down your debt or whatever the case is and you know, we controlled ... we kept income in and we controlled the amount that we give back out to allow businesses and people to run their businesses which is appropriate.</p></speech>

How did NAMA manage the process in instances where a large development was being backed by a combination of loans from participating and non-NAMA participating banks?</p></speech>

Syndicated lending is very common in other markets that effectively no banks takes a total 100% exposure to projects.  They usually try to get other banks to come in to share the risks, but in the Irish market, there was only about five syndicated loans that came to NAMA.  But it did mean that a debtor might have borrowed, say, &euro;500 million from the NAMA banks and he might have borrowed another &euro;250 million from a non-NAMA bank which was operating in the market but they were completely separate.  Usually in that situation, we ask the debtors when they submitted their business plans to tell us have you money borrowed from other banks and what is the arrangement for them.  Sometimes it is like a juggling act, that money was moving between assets which were funded by NAMA banks and assets which were funded by non-NAMA banks, by the debtor because he was trying to keep the balls in the air in terms of trying to keep everybody satisfied.   When we came in we said listen, this is our money, you have to deal with your other bank separately.  In cases of syndicate arrangements, there was a code of practice which was required as part of European Commission approval where effectively we had to work with those institutions to effectively.... we would operate together in a fair practice with each other to try and make sure both parties were not disadvantaged at ... against each other.  That was where the lending was in a common project but there was very few lending to common projects.</p></speech>

I do not think any hedge fund or equity partner would go in and partner with some of the developers and particularly in some of the large scale lending without doing an absolute, deep dive into the financial situation of the developer, into the project feasibility, into the valuation of assets because there is certainly ... One of the things that did surprise me is that in many cases, the valuation of assets which the banks took was actually provided by the debtor.  There is nothing sort of fundamentally wrong with that provided you do actually verify it and test it independently.  I do not think a hedge fund would actually have gone in without that type of analysis.  I think the other thing that a hedge fund or an equity partner will do is they will probably have rights to step in along the way.  They will have rights to actually keep intruding into the project or into what the money is being used for and how it is being spent and they would be all over you, to put it that way.</p></speech>

I mean it's very hard for us because we weren't there at the time, to see what type of relationship it is but I think in one of the questions that you asked which forms part of the booklet, you would see that the top 29 debtors, in table 6 of the supplementary booklet, borrowed &euro;34 billion and while it was spread around by banks, there was certainly a concentration of lending around one institution.  So I think the issue really comes down to the fact that, and this has been said by people in the banks before, and certainly by others, is that relationship lending was a big part of it.  You know it's almost like in terms of a horse race where you're backing the jockey rather than the horse.  It's the horse that has to win the race for you, that has to run the race for you.</p></speech>

If I can just start, I suppose, standing back from the detail, Mr. McDonagh in particular, one of the issues that we are tasked with examining is to assess the appropriateness and the effectiveness of the policy responses to the crisis and the establishment of NAMA was a key part of that and on page 9 of your opening statement I think you seek to address that, Mr. McDonagh.  We know the direct consequence of establishing NAMA.  NAMA bought loans with a par value of &euro;74 billion, paid &euro;31.8 billion, so it resulted in losses of &euro;42 billion hitting the accounts of the participating financial institutions.  The obvious alternative could have been to leave the loans relating to the property and development sector on the books of the banks and work them out over time.  You seem to come to the view that the establishment of NAMA was the correct course of action.  You say it is recognised that impaired banking systems do not tend to rectify themselves so what's your basis for saying that and your basis for believing that the establishment of NAMA, and how things worked out subsequently, was a better outcome?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#T00700"><p>Well I suppose, even though I said it, I wasn't just basing it on my own view, Deputy.</p><p>I mean, we have met other countries who have had difficulties in their banking system.  They have come to talk to us about the model pursued by NAMA and, you know ... and the type of approach, and they have followed it.  It has been endorsed both by the IMF and the ECB as being the right thing to do.  And I suppose I would, you know, in a very, I suppose, local way look at the way, I suppose, you know, we took the assets - these problem assets - out of the banking system, brought them into NAMA and had to deal with them.  And it's a very expensive consequence for the taxpayer, who's had to recapitalise on the back of that, but I think when you look at the assets which remain within the banking system, the banking system has been quite slow to deal with their existing assets.  And, whereas, you know ... in terms of NAMA, like, we're five years in, we've collected &euro;25 billion in cash and we were originally designed to maybe ... that everybody expected we'd have a ten-year life, and now we're sort of saying we'll probably be finished in eight years.  So I think, you know, we are doing what it says on the tin.  It says ... the Act says, deal with the assets expeditiously, and we're getting on and doing that.</p><p> As the chairman says in his own remarks, it'll be for others to judge whether we did a good or bad job at the end, but, you know, we believe that we're, you know, to date that we're doing everything that we are expected to do and trying to deal with the situation and the hand that we're dealt with.</p></speech>

That hole then had to be plugged by way of taxpayer recapitalisation.  In terms of the overall performance of NAMA, what you're saying is that you will pay back your &euro;31.8 billion of debt, you'll cover your operating costs and potentially have a surplus then of about &euro;1 billion.  Do you think that that is a better outturn than might've been achieved if the property and development loans were left on the books of the banks and the banks to work them out over a period of time and perhaps benefit from an uplift in property values?</p></speech>

I mean, there was this contingent liability hanging around that, you know, there'd be a black hole in NAMA and, therefore, the Government would have to cover those losses.  We're saying that's not on the ... that's on the horizon.  In fact, we're turning a surplus.</p> <p>  I mean, the issue is that the world financial markets had made the decision in ... first of all reflected in the share prices of the banks that collapsed around 2008, but also in 2010 when Ireland had to go into bailout, that the banking system really had brought ... you know, had huge consequences for the sovereign, put ... resulted in us getting a bailout from the troika.  And, I think the ... maybe if somebody wanted to do the sort of experiment of leaving these problem loans with the banks, really wasn't an option.  It wasn't an option from, I suppose, the troika in terms of this, that they decided they wanted these assets removed.</p> <p>  So, you know, other countries did different things.  Like, in the UK, they did an asset protection scheme where effectively they insured the assets of Royal Bank of Scotland, about &euro;280 billion.  And, you know ... but I suppose the big difference in terms of the UK and here was the UK probably had the firepower to be able to deal with that.  But also in terms of Ireland, once Ireland had done the bailout in September 2008, doing an asset protection scheme really wasn't an option.  It was certainly looked at by Dr. Bacon as one of the options, and it just really ... I think he concluded, which I think was a fair conclusion, that it really wasn't an option to do an asset protection scheme after doing a bank guarantee.</p></speech>

In the general sense, Deputy, I think the ECB analysis in their financial stability review of 2013, which was kind of an analysis of why a NAMA-type operation as opposed to other, is useful for ... would be useful for the committee if ... I'm sure you have it already.</p> <p>  I think there's two other points, though, as to why breaking the links with the banks was important.  First of all, the other alternative .. well, you've three possibilities.  You've nationalisation, which we're not discussing; you have leaving them with the banks.  I think the big question mark there is ... the banks have been struggling since the crash.  They're still struggling.  They're getting better.  They're improving, but they're still struggling, for example, with mortgage arrears, so they're still struggling with other property loans that are on their books.  So, you can only imagine what state they would be in if they had another &euro;74 billion on top of that.</p> <p>  I think the other point is that ... and we've discussed relationship banking earlier.  Removing the loans out into NAMA, it broke the link decisively between the originator of the loan and the borrower.  And I think that has been hugely important.  I'm not saying we don't have a relationship with our debtors &ndash; of course we do &ndash; but it's a far different relationship to the type that some of the banks have had.</p> <p>  And I think, then, there is the actual practical stuff of just concentrating all of that &euro;74 billion in one agency with one focus.  We have ... we're not distracted by anything like mortgages or anything like that.  We have one focus, which is the &euro;74 billion, the repayment of the debt.  So, there's a concentration of skills and efficiencies and costs and scale and flexibility that you could actually bring to that.  And we're able to do that when we're going to the market with asset sales or loans sales, because we're not just one bank trying to work out its own piece of the action.  We have everything.  We can look across it.  We can amalgamate portfolios.  I think it's a very-----</p></speech>

Can I raise the issue of interest roll-up?  Because a figure of &euro;9 billion is quoted in the core documents volume 1, question 7, which you ... which was returned.  That's quite a staggering figure - &euro;9 billion of interest roll-ups.  Can you explain to us in practice how that occurred?  Does it mean that many loans were not being repaid at all by debtors to the banks prior to NAMA coming on the scene?  And how could such a huge amount of interest be rolled up on those loans, or are many of those loans with no repayments being made still being regarded as performing loans in accordance with the loan agreement?</p></speech>

Mr. Daly said earlier, when you looked at the balance sheets of the banks at the end of 2008, of the &euro;160 billion that was lent in land and development lending, &euro;60 billion of that &euro;160 billion was to pure land and development lending.  Typically, land and development ... when you're involved in that type of lending, there really ... there's no income coming on the assets until the assets are built out, either rent at that stage or sold.  So, typically, in that type of lending, the banks roll up the interest.  There's interest accruing each year.

That type of lending is probably okay for an income producing asset.</p></speech>

Can I move on to the issue of the enforceability of security because issues arose around that and were identified during the legal review and it made it necessary to impose legal discounts of &euro;477 million, which is broken down on table 3, page 5 of volume 2 of the book that we have.  Can you give us an indication of the type of issues that would have arisen which necessitated writing down the value, as such, by almost a &euro;0.5 billion because of unenforceability of security?</p></speech>

I think other banks, who were not in NAMA, found the same sort of types of issues.</p></speech>

No, we've spent the last five years going through each of the loans, preparing them for sale, or preparing for enforcement, and most of that arose really in the ... probably the 18 to 24 months after acquisition, once we were getting into further detail of managing the portfolios and finding out what the...you know, checking the security further as we wanted to take asset management actions to deal with the assets.</p></speech>

I think it was by the nature, is that there's probably ... you had the big names, who are probably household names, who were involved in the big projects, and they borrowed a huge amount, as set out in the table that I mentioned in my opening remarks, in table 1, but I think you had to follow on effective people who were probably in the .. maybe some of them were in the building ... I'd say in the top 100 debtors, or the top 180 debtors in NAMA, they had some involvement previously in the construction industry and they were involved in some scale development; they might have been house builders and then they branched out into building offices or, you know, building a hotel or whatever the case is, but I think, in the ... certainly in ... after the top 180 debtors, a lot of the debtors there were ... the next, you know, 600 or so debtors, they really had ... very few of them seemed to have any expertise in construction.</p></speech>

And then we have the sub-debt, and the first repayment date on the sub-debt is 1 March 2020 and, you know, as we've said, we are very confident as of today of where we stand.

Final question.  During the course of your work you identified a lot of assets which were essentially put beyond the reach of NAMA, and you successfully reversed many of those transactions and brought them within the ambit of NAMA.  Can you characterise the nature of some of those transactions and give us any information you have on the scale of such transactions which you've managed to have successfully reversed?</p></speech>

Well, I suppose there's two types in terms of that.  We've got about &euro;800 million of additional security from debtors, in terms of ... as quite a, you know ... this is additional assets that they had.  Probably about &euro;300 million of that additional security debtors decided that they would transfer them to third parties, friends, relatives, rather than hand them over to the banks or NAMA, and they probably had about &euro;500 million worth of additional assets which were effectively unencumbered additional assets that they have that they had never given up the security.  So when we went through the business plan with debtors we said to them, "Give us a list of your asset transfers in the last five years, and tell us what level of unencumbered assets you were."  And, I suppose, everybody was thinking that all these people had a huge amount of assets outside the system, the case in the day.  And when you look at it, that these same people had borrowed &euro;74 billion, but all they had was &euro;800 million worth of assets effectively outside the system, so it really ... they hadn't put that much aside in terms of the amount of money that they had borrowed, so we said to debtors, "If you want to work with NAMA and to prevent us taking enforcement action against you, or to prevent us taking actions under the NAMA Act, and with a very powerful section, under 2(11) of the NAMA Act, where we can pursue reversal of asset transfers, you bring those assets back in and give them to NAMA as additional security."  And the majority of people did do that as part of their co-operation with NAMA.</p></speech>

Thanks, gentlemen.  If I could reprise very briefly the issue that was raised at the beginning of the meeting in relation to the type of securities or non-security that the banks required for large loans.  Just very briefly to quote Mr. Daly.  You said, &quot;The developer's equity contribution was a form of a rolling-up of unrealised paper profit from other developments.&quot;  You said, &quot;In reality that amounted to nothing more than unrealised equity positions levered by the developer to secure funding for new transactions.&quot;  You said:<blockquote><br /><br />The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  In the event of a crash the banks stood to take 100% of the losses.  That is what happened.</blockquote>You said, &quot;The model did not appear to require a stringent approach by borrowers to analysing project feasibility.&quot;  And finally, Mr. Daly, you said:<blockquote>Very little, if any, consideration was given to the inherent cyclical nature of the property markets.  The attitude appears to have been that the only way was up, that somehow the forces of gravity were suspended as far as the Irish market was concerned, and the long established pattern of property market cycles was no longer relevant.</blockquote>Now, Mr. Daly, when the Chair asked you, you weren't prepared to say, or you couldn't say, because you hadn't direct knowledge, that the relationship that was the subject of this, these actions, was as a result of a deferential relationship between a borrower and a lender.  I can understand why you would say that.  But would you say, objectively speaking, what you found showed a reckless behaviour by the banks?</p></speech>

It just seemed to me, in the context of what we found, that there was more that could have been done.

Now, tragically in some cases it happens with people who are disturbed or are on psychedelic drugs.  Now, presumably, that didn't apply to the banks when they were dealing with the developers.  But, really, the list that you have outlined here - could I put it to you like this: that perhaps an ordinary citizen out there, or a taxpayer who is paying the price for all this, would say that what you have put here is a damning indictment of the practice by some, at least, if not all banks?</p></speech>

Were you driven too much by competition with other banks?"  Because there was, and it's been said before this committee before now, a sort of a follow the crowd, a kind of a herd instinct.  How much were they influenced by the talking up of property, right across the Irish sort of spectrum, about the very favourable economic backdrop that was there up to 2008?  We'd great growth, we'd great growth predictions, we'd the fastest growing economy in Europe, remember.</p><p>How much were they influenced by all of that as opposed to how much were they looking at the individual application for a loan for this project, for this amount of money, with, as my colleague has said, particularly in land and development where you will not expect a stream of income for ... I would also look, by the way, at the make up of who was actually borrowing at that time because that changed, and I know one of your previous contributors has indicated the way in which syndicates became a particular feature of the property market in the period preceding the crash.  If I were in a bank I would certainly be looking beyond that syndicate and I would be looking at who's in it, where's the expertise and how much did they know about the property market.</p></speech>

Now, banks presumably are hard-nosed business enterprises who shouldn't be influenced by loose talk.  I mean if a scientist is sitting in a pub and everybody around him is saying there is no such thing as gravity ... I mean there is a lot going on but he won't believe it, or she won't believe it, but apparently the banks did.  How can that be?</p></speech>

You also had it, by the way, in the people who were actually borrowing.  It is interesting you should mention pub talk.  When you look at the lower tranche of people who borrowed, the 627 in the 16 billion category, a lot of those were in property syndicates.  A lot of that was based, I think, on what has been described in the past as sort of golf club talk - that property is the place to be, if you're not in property you're not really in the game at all.  So I think right across the spectrum there was a lack of rigour in wondering what we were getting into and I think you would have to ask the banks the extent to which they actually subscribe to that view or not.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh, you present us with a table on page ten of your introduction showing &euro;34 billion was lent to 29 individual borrowers.  You said 12 individuals of these accounted for &euro;22.2 billion, including three total loans greater than &euro;2 billion, nine total loans between &euro;1 billion and &euro;2 billion.  Then on page 11 you said lending on this scale suggests that banks considered property lending a one away bet.  Could I put it to you, if what you have said this morning and what Mr. Daly said this morning ... and these figures, do they or not amount to a damning indictment of what the banks were doing during the bubble period?</p></speech>

I have often asked myself how did nobody pick up on this? How did a regulator not pick up on this? Because while the banks might be justified that they were lending what they thought to be ... what they thought were good borrowers and good projects, it does not seem to me that anybody looked and said listen, are these same names turning up in institution a,b, c, d, e and f.  And I think when you ... if you looked at it which we did when we got the data together and we got through ... and it was very quickly obvious that this level and concentration of lending was done, I don't think you'll find that level of lending anywhere.</p></speech>

But I don't think any of their shareholders, whether they be the individual that has a few shares in the bank or an institutional shareholder who as a pension fund might have a large percentage sharehold in the bank, was in any way aware that the concentration of lending was like this.  I just think that is highly unusual.</p></speech>

I'll move on briefly now.  Deputy McGrath dealt with the &euro;9 billion in rolled-up interest.  I won't ask you to repeat that, but just to comment on the distribution by the individual institutions of that &euro;9 billion in terms of the ... in terms of the actual interest charged to individual institutions.  Could you do that briefly please?</p></speech>

We estimated that that &euro;9 billion was broken down as follows; AIB about just over &euro;3 billion, Allied Irish Bank &euro;3 billion, Bank of Ireland &euro;1.8 billion, INBS &euro;1 billion and EBS &euro;0.1 billion.</p></speech>

If I might move on then to an issue that has also been dealt with in the sense of the type of security, or not security, that was given by borrowers, that the banks did or did not demand.  That has been dealt with quite comprehensively but can I just ask you finally on that, were there variances by scale of debtor in regard to this practice?  You refer to somebody taking paper out of their pocket and showing it to a banker and this was accepted as good coin.  Did the ... how ... did acceptance of that relate to the scale or the wealth of the person seeking loans?</p></speech>

That is one of the fundamental principals of banking, but I think that there was so much lending, at such a volume of lending at the time that up until 2010, until it was outlawed by the Law Society, banks probably relied on third party solicitors more to take security for them, and relied on that.  There has been a number of cases where banks have sued solicitors where the form of security was defective.  I just think there was such a volume and scale of activity that it was all about more and more lending as opposed to concentrating and doing the sort of nitty gritty, ensuring that you had correct security over it.  I mean, if you think about it Deputy, we almost ... we knocked about &euro;500 million off the price we paid the banks at acquisition in terms of insufficient security, and we knocked over &euro;300 million subsequently, that's about &euro;800 million.  That's about 1% of the loans, just over 1% of the loans that actually ... that came to NAMA, &euro;74 billion.  I think it was expensive for them.  It cost them &euro;800 million in terms of lost money that they didn't need to lose but I certainly think that it is not on the scale that would indicate a systemic problem, it just indicated a bit of a ... it was probably a lot of it down to the volume of activity and not enough dotting the i's and crossing the t's.</p></speech>

Mr Daly, on page 16 of your introduction you say  "NAMA may realise a surplus of up to &euro;1 billion for the Irish taxpayer by the time it completes its work."  Do you mean by this that the projection you make is that when NAMA is wound up you will have paid to the banks the &euro;31.8 billion that was agreed in September 2009 for the loans that you took - you'll have paid that from the properties you sold or from income like rent for the properties before you sold them - that you'll also have paid the same banks' interest in the interim on those loans, covered your own running costs and there will be &euro;1 billion surplus? Is that in a nutshell what you mean?</p></speech>

Now, can I ask you there, Mr. Daly ... no, I understand the elements are, as I've ... in general as I've outlined, but can I ask you this: is it fair, from the viewpoint of the Irish people, to call this a surplus or a profit?  Now, let me just explain.  The chief executive told us, on page 3, "NAMA paid the [banks] &euro;5.6 billion more than the private sector market would have paid them at the time of acquisition."  In fact, the EU said this was state aid.  Not only that but the valuation was set at 30 September, I think, 2009.</p></speech>

And then Mr. McDonagh, chief executive, said, "NAMA had to absorb losses arising from the impact of the 25%-30% decline in Irish property values ... right up to the end of 2013."  Mr. McDonagh continues, "Essentially, therefore, the institutions [i.e., the banks] would have been paid about &euro;22 billion by the market."  In other words, if the supposed rules of the capitalist markets applied, the banks would have been given &euro;10 billion less for the loans that you bought than you actually gave them.  So, Mr. Daly, rather than a &euro;1 billion surplus to taxpayers, would it be more accurate to say that NAMA was used to give a further &euro;10 billion by way of a bailout to the banks on top of the &euro;40 billion that the taxpayers were forced to put in?  Or could I ask you, to put it another way, instead of your &euro;1 billion, should it ... should you say there was a loss of &euro;49 billion rather than a surplus of &euro;1 billion?  Would that more accurately sum up, or not, the situation?</p></speech>

What we're saying is that on top of everything that NAMA will repay, we will make &euro;1 billion of a surplus.  Now, if NAMA had paid the banks &euro;10 million ... &euro;10 billion less, the reality is that that money would have had to be put into the banks anyway, you know, they would have had to be recapitalised.  So you really ... and that's all coming ... still coming from the taxpayer.</p></speech>

All we're saying is that on our performance on top of that we will not just realise every bit of debt that was incurred, not just cover our own expenses, but return a surplus.  Now, you go back to the ... you go back to the early days of NAMA and the debate about NAMA and all of the talk about NAMA being another big black hole and they would never actually repay anything like the senior debt or the subordinated debt and they would make a massive loss, we're saying no, that's not the case, that will be reversed and we will make a-----</p></speech>

We had an extraordinary economic situation at that time.  The whole credibility of this country was at stake.  Fundamental to that credibility issue was what was going on in the banks, what was on the balance sheet of the banks.  The whole ... to quote somebody, I think from Sweden, a hole in the balance sheets of the banks is a hole in the balance sheets of the banks.  Don't let's fudge it.  You had various options, which were open to Government, and I'm not going to get into a political debate.  The asset management agency approach was taken, given the scale of what was involved in Ireland, and that is what ... that is the mandate, that's where NAMA started from.</p></speech>

That's what I'm ... just the last theme, Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh, because time is ... now, both of you will say and you indicated that NAMA has been essentially a very socially progressive influence in relation to how it has operated and the outcome.  Can I just put a quote to you, which is from the chief executive of Blackstone, which is a major fund that NAMA has sold a lot of property to?  And this person says, a few years ago, "As we look at the current situation in Europe, we are basically waiting to see how beaten up people's psyches get, and where they're willing to sell assets ... You want to wait until there's really blood in the streets."  Now, Mr. Daly, with that type of philosophy, you have sold substantial assets in this country to funds like this.  Some would say vulture funds; I won't comment.  How can it possibly be in the interests of the Irish people ... and just to say, Mr. David McWilliams, whom you're familiar with-----</p></speech>

I'll be very brief.  The dynamic, says Mr. McWilliams :<blockquote><br /><br />The dynamic of foreign funds buying up Irish property at deep, deep discounts, only to sell the same assets on in a few years at a significant profit, is the Hibernian piece in a global jigsaw which is seeing the very rich get even richer.  To misquote Dr. Spock, &quot;It's capitalism, Jim, but not as we know it.&quot;  </blockquote>He goes on to say that ... in other words, that it's deeply, and will be deeply damaging, that this type of speculation is now taking place in the wake of what NAMA has done as supposed rescue of the situation, that, in fact, it's deeply negative.  And, lastly, that ... are there apartment owners or people who have mortgages-----</p></speech>

I'm not going to comment on it but I think it does actually point to the fact that if they were coming to Ireland in the years after NAMA was established expecting that they were going to pick up cheap assets, they didn't, because we didn't put them on the market.  There were plenty that came in.  They kicked the tyres.  They offered us derisory prices and we said:<blockquote><br /><br />Go away.  Cop yourselves on.  Go off.  We're not under pressure to sell here.</blockquote>And we weren't under pressure to sell because we had the UK market being actually good to us, which is the point I made in my statement.  So we didn't sell at fire sale prices.</p><p>As to whether they are all vulture funds or whatever, you know they are investing in Ireland now.  And whether you like it or not, we actually do believe for a functioning property market, we do actually need investors coming in.  I would love to see more Irish investors buying Irish assets and I am glad to say that is beginning to happen, you have investors coming from all over the world.  But you know, in some cases these are ... I know the white tailed eagle in your own home county, Deputy, may not be totally accepted, but in some cases these investors coming into Ireland are actually good for the country.  The main point is that we have not been selling cheaply, we have not been fire selling, and, in fact, we are at the situation now where it is impossible really to forecast when a market will peak or what is the optimum day that you sell your assets.</p><p> But I think we have called it right in relation to that.  So, if you go back to that quote from Blackstone ... I think you went and you asked any of the funds that have been dealing with us over the last four or five years how they found NAMA to deal with, the one word that would come through is "tough" and "difficult.", and looking always for the best price.</p></speech>

But most of the money that these private equity buyers have is secured ... is institutional money.  And is typically from US endowment funds and college funds and things of the day.  And you know, like the teacher's fund and Calpers and things like this.  And ... and ... they give the money to these private equity funds to invest it for them and to earn a return.  And those people when they are giving their money to these funds insist on a certain level of governance and things like that.  Whether the issue of about ... whether it is regulated in each end of the market they are operating in, you know, I am not an expert in that either.  But ... but they do have to observe the laws in each particular jurisdiction.</p></speech>

And part of the problem that was in the property market here over the years has been the almost total reliance on bank ... bank debt.  So I think in future if you have a mixture of that, of equity and debt funding, you are getting away from a vulnerable model and you are getting in some of these investors, the type of ones that Mr. McDonagh has talked about, that they have a longer-term horizon.  So you get a more stable involvement and, crucially, when they buy properties they invest in them and they develop them out and they refurbish them.  And that is creating activity in the construction sector as well.</p></speech>

And this is a presentation you made, Mr. McDonagh to the Public Accounts Committee on the 13 January 2011, "The loans transferring to NAMA was actually going to be less than the 30% estimate in the Minister [...] Minister's September announcement."  As it transpired, the real discount that has been applied across all five institutions to date is, as we all now know, an average of 58%.  Could you explain how we moved from a position where it was going to be less than 30%, to an average amount of 58%?</p></speech>

When we were compiling information from the institutions during the summer 2009, which was pre-NAMA - the NAMA Act hadn't been passed at that stage, it was purely an information exchange between the banks and myself and my team - we asked the banks what their loan to values were.  They typically, as I said earlier, came back and said that their loan to value lending was around 70%, except for one institution which said it was lending about 100% loan to value.  And we did an estimation that, based on their returns ... that they ... that their average loan to value lending at origination was around 77%.  Subsequently, when the banks provided the information to us as part - when the NAMA Act was passed, that they were giving us information as part of the loan transfer - and we looked at the valuations of the property and ... then came to our own conclusion was that the loan to value ratios were probably closer to 100%, rather than 77%.  And therefore that would result for the majority of the increase in the discount from 30% towards mid-50s.</p></speech>

It is in the booklet here.  There  is a copy of the questionnaire I sent to the banks.  I asked the banks a number of questions about the type of books that they had, how much loans were performing, what was their loan to value ratios, what was the geographic breakdown?  It was a high level information, initial fact finding exchange that the banks were told to co-operate with me, as the interim managing director of NAMA at that stage, to get high level information from the banks.  They weren't obliged to give any specific information ... they were ... it was up to them to provide information to me and co-operate with me.  That was the direction from the Minister and the Regulator to them.  And subsequently, when we actually got the real information after the NAMA Act was passed, the only reasonable conclusion that myself and my colleagues could draw was that the loan-to-value ratios were not what was represented to us.</p></speech>

Again, once we got the loans and we sat down and started analysing the loans.  At the end of 2010, which was the first reporting period, we were obliged do it ... it turned out to be 23%.</p></speech>

I mean I asked the banks for information, they gave me an estimate that there about 40% of them were income producing when you compiled them with ... across those institutions.  When we actually acquired a loan that turned out to be 23%.  Then all we can look at then once we acquire them is saying, you know, is our definition of performing different maybe to their definition of performing, you know.  So I have to report on the facts as I find them, and I am statutorily bound as a NAMA board is to report on the facts as we find them, and we reported the facts post-acquisition that their performance level was 23%.</p></speech>

I do apologise for this - I just want to go back to the previous point that I was discussing with you in relation to the loan, with your permission please.  In that ... sorry, in the loan amount that was transferred.  When it was said it was less than 30%, but it turned out to be 58%.  In that same Public Accounts Committee meeting, Mr. McDonagh, you said:<blockquote><br /><br />I, [yourself] and my chairman, Mr. Daly, had met with the Garda and have exchanged correspondence with the Financial Regulator's office on this matter.  We made it clear that our legal advice is that the loan to value information was provided at a time before the enactment of the NAMA legislation.  As the NAMA Act did not exist at that time, any examination of the information provided prior to the Act could not be carried out under the NAMA Act or be actionable by NAMA under section 7 or section 203 of the Act.  That of course does not mean that it is not a matter worthy of consideration by other authorities with the relevant powers.  The Financial Regulator, as far as I am aware, is responsible for the conduct of the financial institutions, and is also responsible for ensuring the publicly quoted banks provide correct and timely information to the market.  </blockquote>Have you had any other correspondence with the Financial Regulator in relation to the 30% ... less than 30% figure that was given initially that turned out to be 58% in practice?</p></speech>

I'll get the exact term that he used, I think - "a debt collection agency".  You seemed a little bit piqued at that.  Do you feel that is an unfair characterisation of NAMA?</p></speech>

Personally, I know Peter.  Peter's a good guy, but I just thought, and in fairness to him he did say on the day of the evidence that effectively he didn't have any particular insight into NAMA that was just his opinion.  So, and I suppose what I'm pointing out here is that just to, I suppose from the record from our point of view, we do many other things which is not just a pure remit of a debt collection agency.  We are obliged to collect debts, that's what we're expected to do and we do it, and we do it to the best of our ability, but we do many other things, as I outlined in my statement.</p></speech>

So I suppose that is the question that's being put to you.  Has there been mission creep, or mission drift?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.299" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#AA01000"><p>No, but I think what you have to take into account, Chairman, is Mr. Bacon produced a report, and then that report became the basis of a NAMA Act, which went through a very extensive consultation process - there were something like 400 amendments put during the passage to the Oireachtas.   So I don't think there ... certainly the most important thing for us would be that there is absolutely no mission creep from the Act, because the Act is our ... viable, not any report, and there certainly hasn't been.  But I've reread Dr. Bacon's report recently in the context of this hearing and I would certainly say there has not been any significant mission creep from that.  I think he might have had a general view.  I know he gave evidence to the committee, for example, back in that ... or he didn't give evidence, but I think it was quoted to him by somebody in the committee that in 2010 he had said we should have sold assets quicker, and I think he said this he was maybe being quoted out of context.  So, certainly no mission creep, mission drift.</p></speech>

But if I wanted to say what were the three top ones it would be the irresponsible developer funding, the absence of market analysis and then there would be zoning and planning policy because to a certain extent actually that and market analysis are they're, they are a bit of the same thing.  The tax incentives is one, obviously I have an interest in that from my previous existence, but the reality is that the tax incentives that were there during that period, were probably ... I'm not saying that some of them weren't justified, initially they certainly were, but certainly some of them continued far too long as you know there's hardly any left in that.  I chair the Commission on Taxation, as the Chairman mentioned in his opening remarks, and we just identified three instances where tax incentives might be appropriate, that is, to correct market failure, to attract mobile investment and to offset shortcomings in other policy areas.  I think when some of those incentives were developed, they were definitely fitted into those criteria, the reality is over the years they didn't fit any of them and they were still continued ... so I think that was ... Then consumer mortgage lending ... again, I'm not sure there was any great irresponsible mortgage lending as such but again you were lending into a market where prices were grossly inflated and therefore the value of mortgages were grossly inflated. </p></speech>

Some of that has been presented already and I referenced in my statement, and there are two or three other reports due to come in the next couple of months.

But the banks took a &euro;42 billion loss and that loss had to be covered by recapitalisation of the banks by the taxpayer.  So, you know, everybody talks about the &euro;64 billion that went into the banking system.  Over &euro;40 billion of that was accounted by losses related to NAMA's assets but also another &euro;20 billion was related to losses in relation to loans, loans which never came near NAMA.</p></speech>

We were told &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million; the expectation was NAMA would have a write-down of less than 30%, it was double that.  Did the bank guarantee and then the establishment of NAMA with the crystallisation of the losses to the banks, did that lead to the national bailout in your view, Mr. Daly?</p></speech>

I think NAMA certainly brought great clarity to the property end of it, and the real question would be if NAMA hadn't done that, you would still have had those loans on the books of the banks.  The capital markets would have taken an even more jaundiced view of Ireland and of the banking and financial system in particular.  So what we did was we removed &euro;74 billion, we helped stabilise the banks we helped stabilise their capital adequacy, we gave them bonds which were actually collateral that could be used with the ECB so that, to enable them to get back into some sort of commercial reality or commercial lending.  But NAMA and property was not the only issue around at the time of the guarantee.</p></speech>

The share price had plummeted substantially, I mean the share prices of, say the two main banks, were probably &euro;16 and &euro;20 probably back in January 2007 and in late 08, early 09 their share prices were down to maybe 5 cent to 10 cent.  So the markets had decided that the banks had a big problem and people were just selling their shares in the banks rapidly which drove down the share price.  I think that, you know, markets have no sentimentality, they don't care how much profits you made in previous years, they care about the situation as of now and what they see, and they made the view that the banking system really was in big difficulty and the reality was that the only option to secure the banking system was for the State to rescue it.  By the State rescuing it, it resulted in that the international community was lending to Ireland as a sovereign through the NTMA, was no longer going to lend to Ireland as a sovereign because of the weight of the losses in the banking system which needed to be rescued by the State.  That resulted ultimately in the bailout.</p></speech>

There were lots of discussions going on, including on that Sunday, the day before, which was basically talking about would the NTMA provide additional funding to the banks.  We already had some bank deposits with the banks and things like that, but there was no substantive discussion about the bank guarantee.  The first I heard that they had decided the bank guarantee, had guaranteed the banks, was about 1 o'clock in the morning when we were told and that's the way it was.</p></speech>

So what was the NTMA's view of the guarantee when it was put in place?</p></speech>

The whole issue of the guarantee was going to be announced the following morning, if you recall, when the markets opened, to get ready so that it could be explained to the markets that the Government had entered into a bank guarantee.  Myself and Mr. Whelan's view at the time was that this would weigh heavily on the sovereign and would weigh heavily on the cost of money, the cost at which we could raise money in the markets.</p></speech>

So when you left the building that night was there any further discussion with the Taoiseach, the then Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance officials, was it a case of this is what it is and thank you, good night?  Or did you go into a huddle with them to say this is how it is going to play out?</p></speech>

The Attorney General and Minister Lenihan had left at that stage, which was basically around whether the guarantee applied just as an Irish entity or whether it applied to oversea subsidiaries.  My technical advice was that overseas subsidiaries had also borrowed in their own name, and that it would be very hard to limit the guarantee only to the Irish operations and not to the overseas subsidiaries.  People are linked to AIB as an entity, by and large, not just AIB UK or whatever the case is.  That was the only technical thing.  It lasted about 90 seconds.  I left the room.  Myself and my colleague, Mr. Whelan, left Government Buildings probably about, I do not know what time it was, 3:30 a.m. or 4 a.m. in the morning.  I went off then to prepare for being ready for the opening of the markets at 7 o'clock.</p></speech>

And it is important just to try to patch together, you know, the events of the night.  Can I just return in relation to NAMA.  Mr. Daly, you mentioned that there was an explosion of credit and a huge amount of credit into the Irish economy.  In relation to the &euro;74 billion worth of loans that were transferred to NAMA, how much of them were in the Irish State?  In terms of percentage wise?</p></speech>

In relation to the security that underpinned some of these loans, and you mentioned in volume 2, page 5, table 3 and again volume 1, page 4, table 2, where NAMA wrote down &euro;477 million as a result of not being able to ... inadequate security, and then claimed back &euro;334 million from the banks for the same purposes, which totals &euro;811 million of unenforceable securities.  I assume, and correct me if I am wrong, that that is at the consideration price, that that is not at the par value.</p></speech>

And I am record before, Deputy, in terms of this, that in tranche 1, there were &euro;1 billion worth of loans from one particular institution which did not transfer to us in tranche 1 because when they looked at security, they did not have first rank on security and they had to go to the courts to perfect our security.</p></speech>

So we will say to the debtor, you know, "We need you to sign new loan documentation to remedy the security." Clearly the debtor knows what the issue is.  But I suppose he has to think in terms of this, unlike the banks who have five institutions, and he could say to one institution, "I do not need to deal with you because you know, that is your problem."  Whereas with us, he was aggregated and we had a lot of levers to be able to encourage him to co-operate with us.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly, you mentioned commercial property was basically NAMA is commercial property, the &euro;74 billion, the majority of this is commercial property and you give a good breakdown in relation to where the institutions and the type of property that were held in volume 2, page 7.  We have the consideration amount, the &euro;32.4 billion that was paid and we can see very clearly that, for example, you paid over &euro;3 billion for hotels, &euro;14.9 billion for investment properties which are office blocks and retail I assume, &euro;4.9 billion for residential and development property &euro;1.5 billion and land &euro;7.8 billion.  Do we have a breakdown of the actual par value of this?  What was the ... What I am trying to understand is what was the write down for example in hotels, was it 57%, was it greater or was it less?  You have talked to the committee about up to 90% write down in land.  Do we have any idea in terms of five categories there, what were the individual write downs?</p></speech>

It was very unusual structure of lending.  It was not just lending to hotels.  There was, within the same loan, there was land lending, there was hotel lending, there was office lending, so it was very hard to disaggregate it out in the way that you requested.</p></speech>

The average discounted of that is around 75% so we ended up paying about &euro;10 billion for the land and development loans if you add those two categories together.  And all the other categories which are grouped together, known as investment loans, is about &euro;34 billion par debt and the average discount is around 36% and that is so you would get about &euro;22 billion, so you sorry, &euro;21.8 billion plus &euro;10 billion is &euro;31.8 billion is what we would pay for it.</p></speech>

The picture that you both painted of Irish banking when you went in ... &euro;2.5 billion you found borrowed with no collateral and you've recouped &euro;5 billion which the banks weren't collecting.  Are those numbers correct, for a start?</p></speech>

In fact, just to correct the record - and thank you for the opportunity in relation to Deputy Doherty ... I've just went back through my notes, because there's such a volume of notes ... the value of collateral where we paid nil consideration was &euro;3.5 billion in nominal terms.  It wasn't &euro;2 billion - it was &euro;3.5 billion.  And, yes, we have collected &euro;5 billion of income on the portfolio since the start, yeah.</p></speech>

They seemed to centralise all decisions and that the conservative old-style bank management based in towns around the country which, you know, didn't lose much money was replaced by one which was meant to be better, obviously, but do you think moving discretion and moving local managers caused a gap between the manager and the people who were doing the borrowing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#HH00700"><p>I think there's probably two elements to that, Senator.  There's no doubt that local managers would have been more in touch with what was going on in a particular locality.  And, in terms of what we talked earlier in relation to, I suppose, planning and zoning and hope value, local managers I think would probably have been more on top of that.  On the other hand, it may be that the amount of discretion allowed to local managers was not consistent, let's say, across the banks or even maybe within some banks.  The centralisation of lending certainly probably had the capability to bring a greater discipline to it, and you could expect, in fact, that that's where the greater ... the better analysis of overarching or macro market demand and supply might have been better located.</p> <p>  I suppose the one thing we would say is that, in terms of the documentation that came across to us in relation to the loans, is that I think part of the problem that the banks had in the end was the way in which, in many cases, the actual loan documentation and the detail about the origination of the loans was actually located in the local banks rather than necessarily all centralised in a particular ... one particular IT record or whatever.  And that in itself probably created some difficulties for the banks.  Again, that's in terms of what we saw in the documentation coming across.  So, if you have dispersed lending, if you don't have centralisation of records and if you don't have that sort of centralised oversight, then you do run the risk of not having a full picture of what your lending is.</p></speech>

Because you probably remember the controversy of whether it should be done in the Central Bank or some amalgam or an entirely separate body, as was recommended by the McDowell report.</p></speech>

Indeed, I'm not going to be very definitive about it because I was outside the system and I'm only really somebody looking in from outside.  I think, in terms of the principles that were there in the regulatory system - p-r-i-n-c-i-p-l-e-s as against to p-a-l-s - certainly, I think those principles were by and large pretty okay.  The ... it is, I think, commonly agreed that the difficulty was in the application of those principles and, in particular, the whole concept of a principles-based approach.  I think, going back to my own opening statement ... where we need to get to is one where there is a more rigorous regulatory system, but we do, I would say, need to be sure that we don't fall into the trap of making that so onerous and detailed that it actually stifles the banks in their recovery in their future business.</p></speech>

And again, certainly as a lay person, I'd find it difficult enough - and I'm not an auditor and I'm not an accountant ... the problem seems to have been recognised two to three or maybe more years ago.  It's a puzzle to me as to why it is taking so long to actually ... because it will only kick in in respect of reporting periods after 1 January 2018.  Now, what I have to accept is that IFRS is a worldwide standard and there're a whole lot of countries and a whole lot of individual regulatory bodies to ... who have to buy into that.  It does seem to be me to be an inordinately long time.</p></speech>

Is that dangerous?  I mean, that's what happened the last time.  When do we turn that off lest we precipitate another bubble, which some people fear?</p></speech>

So, if you take that as a starting point ... but if you take it that there is a market that, for a number of years now, has been pretty much dead in terms of activity, in terms of the provision of much needed office space, particularly grade A space in the Dublin central business district, and if you take, in particular, the problem that there is in housing in this country, or particularly in the capital and some of the other urban areas, then there is a case to step in - for NAMA to step in - both because we have the capital wherewithal to do it, but also because a lot of the debtors who are in NAMA, whether you like it or not, are the ones who have the ... possibly the capacity to do some of that activity.</p><p>I mean, housing I think is a particularly interesting one because that supply has fallen to really very, very low levels.  There were just over 11,000 completions in 2014, 3,200 or 3,300 of those were in Dublin.  The telling statistic is that, of those 3,300, NAMA delivered about 40% of them, so there would have been relatively little delivery of housing in Dublin in the last year or so if NAMA had not been active in that market  And that level of completions is well short of what the ESRI is predicting or the housing agency is predicting.  They're all predicting a minimum of something like 70 to 80 or 90-----</p></speech>

Were we prepared for the euro, where wholesale deposits can flow in ... a banking system traditionally based on deposits and not wholesale lending, not knowing what to do with the extra money ... and, I mean, should we, as a nation ... worked out what would happen in the euro currency much better than we actually did?</p></speech>

We were concerned about certain aspects of it.  There'd be a lot of debate about the rate of interest; I think there was little enough debate about whether that would suddenly ... that tap would suddenly be turned off.</p></speech>

I think, when you look at the ... again, at the growth in the balance sheets of the banks between 2003 and 2008 ... the banks were lending, but they were effectively lending to a longer-term asset class, which was property, but they were funded by short-term cheap, wholesale money market deposits.  So, they were borrowing at, you know, one month, three month, six months at around 2% ... a lot of it, you know, German money coming into Ireland, looking for a home.  And, you know, once the crisis happened, all those depositors withdrew, took their money back and the banks were left long on assets but short on cash and, of course, that again precipitates, I suppose, the initial ... and I've looked at this across other banking systems which collapsed - I know some of you have as well - and it's a common feature, you know, the quick liquidity leaves the system first and, you know, and then you've got to try and fiddle that liquidity gap.  So, it's not uncommon that the first signs of a banking crisis is that people think there's a liquidity crisis, and, in fact, it's not a liquidity crisis at all.</p></speech>

I think what was beginning to happen in September 2008 and, you know, my perception of it now, as opposed ... other people have their own perceptions of it, but ... was that the Department of Finance, I think, were becoming understandably concerned maybe about the Central Bank and the regulator and the banking system.  And the way it was put to us was that would we come to a meeting, I remember it was a Saturday morning in ... I think around the second Saturday in September 2008, will we come to a meeting in the Central Bank ... with the Central Bank ... with the Central Bank at the Department of Finance, and just sit there and listen and observe and, you know, advise the Department if there was anything we thought that they mightn't have fully understood.

The NTMA were instructed to engage an adviser, which was Merrill Lynch, I think around 22 September 2008 or 23 September 2008.  Merrill Lynch were on the scene for about a week before the bank guarantee and that's ... and there was sort of work going in, in terms of looking at options.

I mean Merrill Lynch were working ... let's just put it like this: Merrill Lynch were contracted by the NTMA, because that's what the NTMA were instructed to do, but Merrill Lynch were effectively working for, let's just call it "the system", which, I mean, and the central nervous ... or, sorry, you know, the system was really being controlled by the Department of Finance, who had, I suppose, in terms of the central role, in terms of advising Government.</p></speech>

Thank you.  Just now to look back at NAMA then since the beginning of its operation.  One of the questions and one of the things that we've heard through previous testimony is about a possible delay in establishing NAMA.  Was there a delay, from when it was first signalled to the first tranche being completed?</p></speech>

NAMA was announced as a concept in the supplementary budget in April 2009.  Work had to go on to prepare new legislation and that first draft of that legislation was published on 30 July 2009, it was put out for a consultation and it went back into the D&aacute;il in the Second Stage and I think on 16 September 2009; and between 16 September 2009 and, I think, sometime around 21 or 22 November 2009, I think there was 400 amendments proposed to the legislation.  And I think it was finally signed into law by the President towards the end of November 2009 and the board was brought into operation I think on 22 December 2009 and I was appointed chief executive on that day.</p><p>And that was fine in terms of a national piece of legislation, but we had no authority to start taking any loans from the banks until the European Commission gave approval.  And the European Commission did not give approval to NAMA until the end of February 2010, and the first loan transfers started to transfer from the banks one month later, at the end of March 2010.  And the loan transfers then continued on for effectively 18 months, but 95% of the loans were transferred to NAMA by the end of 2010.</p></speech>

I mean, if it was feasible in April 2009 to say we're just taking &euro;70 billion of loans out of the banking system, dropping them on Treasury Buildings and just deal with it like that - but that clearly, with 12,000 loans, 5,000 borrowing entities, 60,000 individual properties, that was never feasible.</p></speech>

I mean, it probably wasn't feasible.  I'm just wondering about what it might have allowed debtors to do with some of their affairs, which have then had to have been pursued by the agency but did it allow the banks, I mean ... or not did it allow the banks? ... Were you aware of the banks treating debtors any differently in that period?  When we look at things like the change in the assumptions about interest roll-up, or in the assumptions about the performance of loans, did the attitude of the banks towards their borrowers change in that period?</p></speech>

Right?  And the debtors were quite happy to stay with the banks.  The banks were quite happy to stick with the debtors and nobody wanted to crystallise the losses.  So, you know, of course when you crystallise losses it effectively, probably, personally life-threatening for some of the executives in the banks, as did happen, as, you know, people left.  But I think the issue was that, you know, if you're saying in terms of behaviour, I can't say that there was any, you know, huge change in behaviour.  I ... the thing that surprised me personally the most, and this is just purely common sense, you don't have to be any way ... have a professional qualification in law or accounting to know this, is that when we acquired the loans from the banks only 20% of the income that was on the portfolio was being mandated to the banks.  It surprised me that the banks didn't move to capture that income earlier.</p></speech>

His view and a few of his colleagues' view was that, you know, that mightn't be enough, because the overseas entities had also borrowed in the money markets and in the euro commercial paper markets.  And he asked me my view from a technical point of view, myself and my colleague, Mr. Whelan.  And we said, "Well, you can't ignore the overseas subsidiaries because they're guaranteed by the parent and, you know, if you'd decided to guarantee, we think that, you know, you can't ignore the overseas subsidiaries."</p></speech>

I was responsible for counter party credit limits at the time, as the NTMA's director of finance I had a discussion with Dr. Somers, chief executive, and we discussed the thing that the financial markets were acting strangely.

Do you have any breakdown as to the extent of that practice within the Irish banks in the period, obviously prior to the establishment of NAMA?</p></speech>

I suppose the point we were making in both our opening statements was that once you begin to rely on personal guarantees then by definition you are relying on the personal wealth of the debtor.  If the process by which that personal wealth is assessed is in any way doubtful - in other words if it is done on the basis of statements of affairs where the valuation of assets is essentially done by the debtor and maybe not rigorously examined or overseen by the banks - then you are getting into a cross-collateralisation right across the loan book and you are getting into it on the basis again of relationship banking, with not a huge amount of oversight.  There is nothing wrong with statements of affairs, but in very many cases they weren't audited, in very many cases some of the asset valuation was actually done by the person presenting the statement of affairs to the bank and in very many cases you would have to say the bank wasn't looking into those.</p></speech>

I simply got a phonecall in December 2009.  I was then a public interest director on the board of Anglo.  I'd been there from earlier that year and I was asked if I would take on the chair.

I asked for a day or two to think about it and I was told, "No, we want a decision today."  So, if you want some colour, I walked D&uacute;n Laoghaire pier and thought about it and then said "Yes".</p> <p>  The actual construction then beyond that ... I mean, at that stage the board ... the membership of the board had by and large been decided and I think ... I'm not sure of this, but I may have been the last piece of the jigsaw being slotted it.  It was an unusual board in the sense that my understanding is that while you couldn't say it was approved across the political spectrum, there was, as I understand it, consultation with all of the political parties about the overall representation and that I think was to ... I think quite usefully to get political buy-in to the whole NAMA scheme but also to get a view across the spectrum that the board was going to be independent.  So that was sort of my involvement on it.  We had our first board meeting, I think in December and ... 23 December, and a lot of work had been done by Mr. McDonagh and a small team and then we began to scale up the organisation to put in place all of the procedures and processes and all of that.</p></speech>

It's 8 February 2010, Simon Carswell, <i>The Irish Times</i>, that the IMF told the late Minister Lenihan in April 2009 that NAMA would not lead to a significant increase in lending by the banks in light of the fact that one of the chief reasons for ... given at the time in the Oireachtas for the establishment of NAMA was that it would lead to an increase.  Were you aware of that advice from the IMF that was quoted in that particular article?</p></speech>

Can you ... can you say if any ... at the time, you know, when you took on the loans and you started examining them and obviously you're familiar with them, can you say if any serving members of the Government or the Oireachtas were involved in any of the so-called debtor connections through syndicates or through companies?</p></speech>

We have never indicated who or, indeed, what category of individuals would be involved in any debtor connections.  There is a ... there is confidentiality in the NAMA Act.  There is banking confidentiality, because when we took on the loans, we also took on the banking confidentiality restrictions around those.  So I don't think it would be appropriate for us to confirm or not that there was anybody because if we begin to confirm it for any particular group or sector, then the next question is was there somebody in some other sector.</p></speech>

But, I mean, if the implication of the question is was NAMA in any way, at any stage, either in its construction or in relation to the way it transferred the loans or the way it's dealt with the loans, influenced by any particular category of individual in our loan book, the answer is absolutely "No".</p></speech>

I suppose the nexus between the political establishment, the bankers and the developers has been much discussed by the public in the last God knows how many years.  That's the whole purpose of this exercise.

We have spoken a lot about personal guarantees, cross-collateralisation, but to what extent was there intense competition from the banks to get the biggest clients, to bankroll or finance the largest developments in the country?  Did you find evidence of that when your agency went in and looked in detail at the loan books and the practices that went on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#NN03600"><p>I think you have to ... when you ... when you look at what came across to us, certainly you had a lot of debtors and some of them debtors of ... with very big exposures, who had exposures across the banks.  So there was ... they were dealing with several banks and I have no doubt at all that the banks were in competition.</p> <p>  I don't want to get into making sort of qualitative, giving qualitative opinions about the banks, but there was certainly a question of, as I said earlier, a wall of money being available to all of the banks and, to a certain extent, the banks just chasing investments for that money. </p> <p>  And it was quite clearly the situation that if you had one particular bank that was being very, very successful at that, then questions were being asked of the other banks by their shareholders as to, "why you are not ... why are you not chasing this?  Why are you not growing at the same rate?  Why is your lending" ... because everybody believed, of course, that in that whole area of property lending that there was no downside. </p> <p>  So, yes, there was competition right across the banks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.669" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#OO00200"><p>I think it played a significant role because it was there ... after the eurozone, there was that wall of money.  The exchange rate risk was removed, so certainly the wholesale markets were quite willing to provide the Irish banks with funding.  The Irish banks were quite willing to accept that because they were getting funding at relatively cheap rates and they had, in their debtors - in property in particular - ready recipients of that money.  So, I have no doubt at all it was a factor.  And I think in so far as, and I mentioned it earlier ... in so far as anybody was concerned about any aspect of that, it would have been keeping an eye on interest rates rather than keeping an eye on whether that particular amount ... money was going to be turned off at some stage, as happened just before the crash.</p></speech>

To what extent did they have a full handle on the overall indebtedness of the people that they were lending to?</p></speech>

I think we saw it from the documentation and when we began to engage with debtors ... and this was particularly so in relation to the non-NAMA banks because we had a ... we had ... we were able to collate a full picture of the lending across the NAMA banks.  But you had the situation where when we looked for business plans, when we began to assess the debtors that came across to us from the NAMA banks, you suddenly discovered this exposure to the non-NAMA institutions.  I don't think that the NAMA banks, or indeed the other ones, had a particular full view right across the spectrum of lending by individual debtors.  And I'm not ... I don't want to make a generalisation; I'm just saying that it was there to a very large extent.  There may have been some cases or some banks where they had a better handle on that than others.  I think it was part of this ... the kind of culture of: "Well let's not dig too deeply here.  We have the money, here's a proposition, it sounds good, it's property related, property is on the up; everybody is saying that there's never going to be real crash, at worst it'll be a soft landing."  So the temptation was there.</p></speech>

To what extent did they have those resources in-house?  You referred in your opening statement to the laws of gravity.  So when the banks were looking at their overall exposure to the property and development sector, did they have in-house expertise in the property area.  And also looking at individual loans that they were making ... to look at the underlying value of the security and the likelihood of that value being maintained or increased over time, is there any evidence that there was a good level of expertise available?</p></speech>

But I ... I think, I mean there was a phrase used at some stage, and I can't remember who used it, that the people in the background who are trying to put a break on the lending ... the people in finance, in audit, in compliance, in the ... the general property experts, that they were kind of boils on the heel of progress of the banks and that lending was the area to be in, and if you were kind of indicating that lending was unwise or that ... I don't think you were listened to very much within the banks.  I think they began to believe their own lenders and didn't pay enough attention to the experts that they would have had in the banks.  I think they had them.   How much of a voice they had within the banks I don't know, but I mean I can only ... we can only comment on that, from what we saw when the loans came across.  You would really have to take that up with the banks themselves.</p></speech>

Can I just round off one thing in regard to what Deputy McGrath was asking you there.  Just by your own assessment, when the loan portfolio started coming over to NAMA - and Deputy McGrath was talking about the ... the exposure that different borrowers may have had to different institutions - did you see any protocols that were in the banks or practices that they were examining maybe the way that personal guarantees might ... the same personal guarantee could be maybe given to a number of banks rather than just one or a situation whereby there was a level of cross-lending that the banks were actually aware of that such a person was so much into one bank or as opposed to one and did the banks actually have protocols to chase this level of risk or exposure?</p></speech>

I mean Mr. McDonagh may have a comment on this, but certainly I don't think there was anything like the structured approach to cross-lending and examination of cross-collateralisation or of personal guarantees in the banks that ... to the standard ... to the extent, for example, that NAMA put in place when we took the loans across, or to the standard or extent that should have been there in the first place.</p></speech>

It states that: "the pursuit of 100% repayment acts counter to NAMA's aims and it economically inefficient.  It is vital to recognise that writing off debts, acknowledging the destruction of economic value caused by the bursting of the construction bubble is an important stepping-stone in re-establishing a viable construction sector."  And then, Mr McDonagh, in 2014 you told a conference that 25% of NAMA debt had been restructured by the end of 2013.  What does restructuring mean in that context and was NAMA policy influenced there by the demands of the Construction Industry Federation in regard to writing off debt?</p></speech>

The whole issue, as far as NAMA's concerned, is that when we restructure a debtor's debt - and we explain this in our 2010 annual report - is that we split the debt into two categories.  One part of the debt is called tranche A, which effectively is what we ... after assessing the business plan what we think the ... what will be recovered on the assets and any additional security the debtor can actually give up.</p><p>And then tranche B is a sort of ... where the debtor still owes tranche B, but unless there was some sort of a super performance in terms of recovery in asset values, only part ... an unlikely the whole amount of tranche B would be repaid, but the debtor would still owe the full amount. </p></speech>

So if a debtor hypothetically had &euro;1 billion worth of debt and somebody came to buy that debtor's debt off NAMA and the assets were only worth &euro;600 million, then these private equity funds or hedge funds, or whatever you want to call them, aren't charities, they'll only pay you what the assets are worth.  They will pay you ... if the market value of the assets is &euro;600 million they will pay you &euro;600 million, they will not pay you &euro;1 billion because that is that, but they acquire the whole &euro;1 billion worth of debt, so as far as the debtor is concerned he's with NAMA today he owes &euro;1 billion worth of debt, he is with hedge ... private equity fund tomorrow, he still owes &euro;1 billion worth of debt.</p></speech>

So whether he wanted to go home, I wasn't in the room, I'm just relating to you as a third party who wasn't in the room what I heard.  Because when I went in to meet the Taoiseach I was surprised the Minister for Finance wasn't there, I probably mentioned in passing I wonder where Minister Lenihan was and it was said, "Oh he's gone because he's to be up early in the morning to do the press conference."  That's all I know Deputy, there's nothing more and nothing less.</p></speech>

You asked me a question so, if you would not mind, I would like to answer it.  On the night when I went into the room, the Minister for Finance wasn't there.  I think coming out of the room I might've said to Mr. Cardiff, I says: "Where's Minister Lenihan" and I think the view was: "Ah, he's either gone home or sent home so that he's up early in the morning for this press conference at quarter to 7".  Did I find that unusual and the fact that he would have to go home to be up early in the morning for quarter to 7?  I certainly didn't.  So that's it.  No more, no less.</p></speech>

I now propose we go for a break but I just want to round up one thing before we go at quarter past.  It's just in regard to lobbying.  And when NAMA were putting in place ... and the whole issue of how the valuation model of NAMA was being put in place was going to reduce and result in a reduction in the valuation of the assets that were coming over to you and this was going to result in haircuts and all the rest.  At any time, were NAMA lobbied on the particular model of valuation and how the haircuts were going to be applied?</p></speech>

They were trying to protect their stakeholders.  But the reality is that the valuation model that was done for the loans was one which we had commissioned HSBC to advise us on.  And ... but that model then went to the European Commission technical people and they basically decided what the final valuation model would be.</p></speech>

Was there a push back from the banks with regard to how the valuation and the haircut was going to be ... the rate at which it was going to be set and how it was going to be applied?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.752" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#QQ01200"><p>I think the banks were very concerned that the valuation model could produce higher losses for them.  They would've seen probably the draft ... they would've seen the early cuts of the valuation model.  And, I suppose, they would have been the person ... people with better knowledge of the loan books than we had at that stage, because we did not have the information.  And, I suppose, the reality is that the discounts did turn out to be much higher than anybody thought and probably the first people maybe to recognise that would have been the banks themselves.</p></speech>

Just one other related matter to that.  After the valuation had been applied and the haircut had been put in place and all the rest of it, there was an intention at the time for the Government to bring in a reform to the upward-only rent review legislation.  There would have been concerns, and for a number of different reasons but one would've been that this could have an impact upon the asset base of properties because of the rental income that was being derived off them.  Did NAMA at any time approach Government - the Department of Finance - and express a concern with regards to reforming the upward only rent review?</p></speech>

Yes, we had a discussion about that.  We had to look at our own asset base and likely impact on our income.  We did express, in general terms, the impact that this could have on the NAMA book.  Obviously, I don't think in the final analysis that that was an influencing factor on Government.  I think the influencing factor in the end was a constitutional issue about interfering with the rents.  But the Government did then ask us to, in respect of debtors - in particular, people in the retail trade - who were in NAMA ... or, sorry, who were tenants of NAMA debtors, where we could have some influence or control ... they did ask us to look at that and to examine that.  I've already put on the record - so I won't not repeat it - what NAMA has been doing in that area.</p></speech>

Right.  In relation ... it's absolutely staggering, the figure of &euro;3.5 billion, for, I'm sure, for the general public there.  In relation to the volume 1, page 35 figure, &euro;2.5 billion ... we look at the property valuation process that NAMA used, and particularly the property uplift adjustments - this is the long-term economic value - that NAMA used and approved by the Commission, and you give us an interesting table there in relation to the five tranches that were transferred to NAMA.  You estimated that Anglo Irish Bank's assets would recover more than any of the other banks' at 9.5%, with the lowest being EBS.  Can I ask you in relation to the uplift that was expected, has NAMA any way of monitoring whether that uplift actually happened, whether it was below expectations or above expectations for the individual institutions?</p></speech>

And Mr. McDonagh, just to finish this point, do you have any sense ... because, obviously, while it would be impossible, as you say, to track them because of they're bundled together, do you have any sense, for example, that NAMA's loans could've outperformed the uplift that was expected, given that they were heavily concentrated in the UK market?

I mean, the portfolio that we acquired was 56% Ireland and 44% outside of Ireland.  The majority - I think around 33% of that 44% - was UK, primarily London.  London has been very good to us in terms of the prices that we achieved but, you know, I suppose we have to look at this on the ground and say, you know, we're not ... like, the situation was that, if somebody had borrowed a loan from, for argument's sake, Bank of Ireland and that produced a surplus, he might have another loan with AIB and that produced a loss.  The surplus wasn't available to AIB because the surplus ... it mightn't even be aware that he has a surplus on his Bank of Ireland loan, whereas we group them all together and we're able to apply the pluses and the minuses.</p></speech>

You mentioned that the NTMA came under pressure in 2007 for liquidity of the banks, to place deposits in a number of the institutions and that you, the NTMA, the institution, made a decision that, if that were to happen, it needed to be on the direction of the Minister for Finance.  Can I ask you where did the pressure come from, and specifically did it come from the Minister for Finance, either formally or informally, or somebody acting on behalf of the Minister for Finance?</p></speech>

On page 6 of the C4b document, we have the discounts and the average was 57%.</p><p>A matter of concern, Chairman, would be that AIB at 56% is only 5% off Anglo and, you know, that compares adversely with Bank of Ireland, which at 43% is 18 points off Anglo.  Does that have implications for this committee?  Does AIB require substantial reform given it got so close to the Anglo in those percentages?</p></speech>

AIB was the second biggest transfer, of about &euro;20 billion of loans.  I think, as I said earlier on, AIB and Bank of Ireland both doubled their balance sheets between 2003 and 2008, and Anglo quadrupled from &euro;25 billion to &euro;100 billion balance sheet.  I think AIB got very aggressive into the property business and they certainly probably had ... the consequence of that has been that the discounts are quite high, and whereas Bank of Ireland transferred &euro;10 billion par debt of loans to NAMA, and at a lower discount, because they were more risk averse didn't mean to say that they were fully risk averse, but they were more risk averse than the other institutions, and that's what the discounts signify.</p></speech>

Have they new people?  The property fixation that you've mentioned, you know, do they know about high tech, aviation, pharma, start-ups, small and medium enterprises?  I mean when NAMA's gone in a few years time will Irish banks be reformed so that they don't need it to be re-established in, say, five years after that?</p></speech>

I suppose the comment I'd make in relation to the areas you mentioned, pharma, and they're now very much into agri, I think they have the expertise, I think they have a greater prudence, level of prudence and caution.  They're obsessed with the property market now, but they're probably obsessed, actually, at the other end of the spectrum, in that they don't really have any great enthusiasm for getting involved in it at all, and that in itself is a, you know, ultimately for the country is something that needs to be ironed out.  I think, in fairness to the banks, they have made great strides.  You know, it's a matter for you to discuss with the banks about the changes in their structures, and the changes in their personnel.  It's well known, without NAMA being the experts in that area, that there have been significant changes in the personnel and structures of the bank.  I think they have a much more risk-based approach now, and I think the boards of the banks, in particular, I would say if there's one thing that has happened over the last number of years as a consequence of all of this, is that directors in the banks are very, very keenly aware of their responsibilities as directors, and what you might want to explore with the banks is the extent to which that was there pre the crash.  So I think they've improved.  Are they perfect?  I'm not going to pronounce on that.</p></speech>

It is important when you are talking about, particularly in the property area, that you don't just finger the five NAMA banks or whatever, that there were others in there who were just as active and in some cases, actually in relation to particular products - I am talking about 100% mortgages and all of that  - who were just as active in that area.  Some of them didn't come into NAMA, and in fact they are pretty much gone from the Irish scene.  So it was wider.  As to what encouraged it - and I am not talking about the IFSC banks which by and large have been better run and better managed than some of the others - I think it was a culture of competitiveness,  it was the easy money that we talked about earlier and it was the sort of hands-off regulatory regime.  It was a combination of all of that.</p></speech>

Yes we do.  We have to be realistic and say that in a lot of cases that is not going to happen.  If that was going to happen, you could really have left all these things with the banks.  Could it happen if NAMA had the luxury of waiting ten or 20 or 30 years, as indeed a lot of our debtors would actually like us to do? Possibly.  But nobody, and I don't think anybody in this room, or anybody in NAMA, or anybody in the banking system can actually indicate what is the one day that the market will peak and dispose of our assets, or hold our assets until then.  Anybody in the business will say that you can't predict that.  For NAMA, with the additional constraints of senior debt, contingent liability for the taxpayer, we have to be active in the market.</p></speech>

We delivered 1,200 and the other 800 will be delivered before the end of the year.  In respect of the other 4,000, once the local authorities or the housing agency said "No, we are not interested", NAMA either disposed of some of those or rented them.  So there is no one of those 4,000 properties which is unoccupied at the moment.</p></speech>

So it was ... I mean, I don't think anybody at any stage said to us, "You have to do this by this date," but it was very obvious that that was the approach that they favoured and that continued after the &euro;7.3 billion ... or, &euro;7.5 billion payment.</p></speech>

If we look at the metrics you have given us, you know you could rank them in terms of the par debt transferred, the percentage discount, the percentage of non-performing loans.  Do you ... has NAMA ranked the banks in those particular ways in terms of the quality of documentation, depending on the different institution?</p></speech>

And we actually had to manage the debtor in aggregate and where there was gaps in security ... for argument's sake, if there was a surplus in one asset and it wasn't cross-capitalised we'd try to move to get that surplus cross-capitalised onto other assets.  So that is something you can do when you're aggregating together, it's not something you can do when you are dealing with a bankable sum.</p></speech>

If it stands up with scrutiny with NAMA, then NAMA will pay you 100% for every euro that you give to keep projects going if it is adding value to the asset".</p></speech>

So, effectively, there was &euro;1 billion they had advanced in that period which we deemed to be eligible that they didn't stand up commercially.  And you can see there by institution how much is eligible in each institution, and some ... you know, every institution suffered a loss in terms of that.  So, you know, their lending practices even post-NAMA probably would have thought ... you'd have thought should have been tight after ... post ... because the loans were coming to NAMA, and obviously this shows that, you know, when we looked at the loans and acquisitions and said ... questioned them, and said, "Show us the commercial rationale of why you issued this money so that we can actually refund you 100% as under the Central Bank letter," they weren't able to justify it and we qualified &euro;1 billion worth of money that they issued between May 2009 and the acquisition during 2010.</p></speech>

So the question I'm asking really is, is that if Anglo and Irish Nationwide were there not there, would there have been a need for NAMA?</p></speech>

I suppose, maybe can I talk two facets of that?  If you go back to the whole crash and the difficulties, if Anglo and Irish Nationwide were not there would the other banks have followed into this lending frenzy in property?  I think it's fairly well accepted that Anglo and Nationwide were the leaders and that the other banks followed, so that's maybe one aspect of it.  If they weren't there at the time who knows what might have happened.</p> <p>  If you get into the situation where there is a problem and you're thinking about an asset management solution and you don't have the Anglo and the INBS one, would the scale of the losses in the other banks still justify a NAMA type approach?  I think we probably would, and I think when you're getting to that stage, because you'd still have had a very considerable par debt lending into property, I still think that the banks would not have been capable of dealing with that themselves, and you would be left of course with the question of well what do you do with all those loans in Anglo and INBS.  Anglo at the time, of course, had been, you know, had been nationalised, but you still have to deal with the loans.  So, do you let them in the nationalised bank for that bank to work them out?  Do you actually push them into the other banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB?  I think that would have been pretty much disastrous, or do you take the view that an assessment management approach is the best way to go?  I'm fairly strong in my view that right across the system, and whether Anglo and INBS were still there or not, that you would still have needed an asset management approach for all of the reasons we discussed this morning about why that approach was appropriate.</p><p>Mr. McDonagh may have-----</p></speech>

They're still substantial figures.  I think the issue boils down to the following: the game was up.  The borrowing had happened, the assets weren't worth what anybody had thought they were worth, the debtors were exploiting the lack of synergy between the banks in terms of knowing how much each was borrowing from each institution ... I still think you would probably have had to have brought them together to actually capture the surpluses of some assets to deal with the deficits in other banks.</p></speech>

The losses would have to be dealt with at some stage.  Once you nationalise them, you brought them onto your State's balance sheet, and you had to deal with them.  If you had a resolution mechanism, which wasn't in Ireland at the time in September 2008, you probably could have just left ... the view has been expressed, maybe would you just put them into liquidation and things like that?  But I think the reality is that that would have been read straight through to Ireland as a sovereign and the other banks, and, you know, would have been a very risky approach.</p></speech>

A final question, then I will pick up on the leads and very very briefly, a quick wrap up. Deputy John Paul Phelan, ten minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.958" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#CCC00400"><p>Briefly Mr. McDonagh,  I want to go back to a question I asked earlier in relation to the rationale that was given by many people at the time of the legislation to establish NAMA, that its establishment would lead to an increase in bank lending.  I want to put a quote to you.  It is a quote from the D&aacute;il of 16 September 2009 during the discussion on the NAMA legislation. The former and late Minister for Finance said and I quote: "The establishment of NAMA and the removal of identified risky assets form the balance sheets should in itself improve credit supply."  You said on the record already that you did not offer that opinion yourself to the Minister.  Do you have a view or any evidence as to where that opinion was coming from?  I was a Member of the Oireachtas myself at the time. A significant amount of the rationale for the establishment of NAMA was that it would lead to an increase in bank lending. Do you have any view to express to the committee as to where that opinion was coming from?</p></speech>

I was not part of the Minister's speech.</p></speech>

I think it is not unreasonable to think that that volume of funding going into the banks should have triggered some possibility of lending, of credit.  As to why it didn't, I think it is a whole other story that maybe is one to explored with the banks.  I do not think it is unreasonable to say that with that volume of effectively cash going into the banks that you could have expected some easement of credit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.961" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#CCC00700"><p>Deputy, if I may just add, there is one thing I am absolutely sure about.  The ECB is very accommodating at present.  It's providing lots of liquidity into the system and it's taking different types of collateral now.  Back in 2008 and 2009, the ECB was not very accommodative.  It did not want land and development loans from Irish banks as collateral to advance money to the Irish banks and system.  The whole rationale for NAMA was to take the land and development loans which the ECB did not want, put them into NAMA, NAMA issued government guaranteed bonds, the banks could bring these government guaranteed bonds to the ECB, and the ECB was happy to give them money on the back of this mechanism.  The banks lost, if you look at the Central Bank figures that have been published on an ongoing basis through the years, the banks lost about &euro;100 billion worth of liquidity during the crisis.  We gave them &euro;30 billion of assets that they could use to replenish that liquidity.  If they still had the land and development assets, they wouldn't have that &euro;30 billion liquidity and the situation would be a whole lot worse, I would suggest.</p></speech>

At the time that the legislation was happening, this was the major element of support for the establishment of NAMA that was expressed in the Oireachtas by different people, not just the late Minister for Finance.  I felt I just needed to put that question. Perhaps it has been a long day and you were a little bit brief in your answer.</p></speech>

Please can we wrap proceedings up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.964" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#CCC01000"><p>We will not wrap them up yet Chairman. A couple of more questions in relation to Mr. Daly. The broader context of NAMA ... you obviously have a responsibility to obtain value for money for the taxpayer.</p><p>There was also a social responsibility element which I can remember being discussed at length in both Houses at the time.  I do not want you to obviously refer to specific examples but how, in the broad context, are those two seemingly and potentially often conflicting objectives balanced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.966" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#DDD00200"><p>Well I think I was making the point in my statement that you have to start with the financial return.  That's our ... that's what's in the Act.  We can't depart from that.  There is a secondary objective in the Act of a social and economic dividend and the way we try to reconcile it ... first of all, by saying that, and I have said this before, is that the best social and economic dividend, I think, that we can get out of all of this is that NAMA is successful then that our senior debt is repaid and if we have a surplus then that in itself is an economic and a social dividend because that billion can go wherever the Government decides to put it.  Side by side with that, it is everything from social housing that we spoke about earlier.  It is the funding of much needed, if I can put it, ordinary housing in Dublin, which we are doing.  We have committed to 4,500 of those by the end of 2016.  We are examining the potential in what would be our asset base to ... for another 20,000 to be delivered over the ensuing five years.  It is the whole docklands SDZ area which we really haven't referred to today, which is economic in the sense that it is going to provide much needed grade A office accommodation for FDI and other local industry.  It is social in the sense that in that mix there will be residential accommodation as well.  It is the ... And then all of the other stuff in relation to the sites that we have engaged with Department of Education in relation to schools, Department of Health and the HSE in relation to primary care centres and all of that.  And then all of the, I do not want to sound pejorative, but all of the local stuff where we have engaged sometimes with representatives like yourselves, where there is a local community group or sporting group or whatever and they are interested in a particular facility or piece of land or building and we do our utmost to actually engage on that.  So it is all of that is the social dividend.  I don't think it conflicts with our commercial objective.  Sometimes it's a balancing act to actually run the two together but I think we try to do our best.</p></speech>

There is evidence that exists of property sold by NAMA that were subsequently resold at significantly increased prices which would seem to contradict the evidence ... or the statement that you made with regard to the absence of a fire sale element within NAMA.  And you particularly referenced a good performance in the UK market.  I will just ask briefly maybe for you to comment on, not specific examples, but on some of those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.968" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#DDD00400"><p>Deputy, when we sell assets we take ... we look at asset sales, we make decisions, we take advice ... appropriate advice, and we openly market them ... the properties and where there's multiple bids on the property, we obviously try and get the best price we can.  We don't have the luxury and we don't have the magic wand of knowing when is the absolute perfect time to sell a particular asset.  There are, of course, individual examples of where some assets were sold and they have been sold on for higher values but that has to be put into the context as well of people risking their capital in the market at the time when nobody was risking their capital in the market and they were coming in to make bids for the assets.  We made a very conscious decision that between 2010 and 2012, we held back on putting assets into the Irish market, despite everybody telling us we should be putting them onto market and accepting much lower prices.  We only sold &euro;1 billion worth of assets.  As of today, we have sold &euro;6 billion worth of assets and most of that ... &euro;4 billion of that mostly came from 2013 onwards as the market improved.  And, you know, there's many other examples of assets where we sold where we got very good prices and people subsequent to them haven't sold them at the price that they bought them from NAMA.</p><p>So, I think you know, even the private equity people who bought some assets in the Irish market have sold on individual examples of assets to people who made profits subsequent to that.  So, that's the market, that's the model that's there and you know, do I wish that I had a magic ... that every single time I sold an asset, that would be the maximum peak of the asset and nobody else would make any profit on it?  Of course I would in terms on behalf of the taxpayer but in terms of the information that we have at the time, we make the best decision we can, and we don't make it lightly, to sell the assets and of course there will be individual examples.  You can't dispose of 60,000 individual units where you are going to find that every single time you have hit the market at the optimal time but there are certainly many more examples which nobody talks about where we have made substantial profits and it was the right time to sell and nobody talks about that.</p></speech>

So, we would say we called it right in relation to that market.</p></speech>

You know, everybody sat back and started withdrawing liquidity and if you are a chief risk officer sitting in New York and you have lent &euro;1 billion of money market deposits to the Irish banking system and you hear that there might be some potential problem in the Irish banking system, you are not going to wait for the clarification, as chief risk officer, of what that problem might be.   You want your &euro;1 billion back.  So the game changer was that everybody started withdrawing liquidity very suddenly very quickly out of the system at the same time and it has been, I think, documented elsewhere or reported that, you know, that was the real like, that what people have a worry-concern that what potentially might happen, was beginning to happen and when it began to happen, it happened very quickly.</p></speech>

I suppose there were some similar moments, I mean, everybody saw the queues in Northern Rock in September 2007 in the case of the day including the office here in Dublin in the case of the day, but that seemed to quieten down and, you know, that seemed to be a once off, the British Government seemed to deal with Northern Rock very quickly, and things like that.

Conversations we had about unpaid debt and the pursuit of people who were not ... you know ... who were still going to owe money.  On foot of Mr. Lenihan's, you know, promise that all ... all the money should be paid back.  Again, for the public, what is it exactly that NAMA can do to pursue the debts that remain unpaid?  I mean, literally, do you pursue them or do you just hope?  You've clarified that some of it won't be paid.</p></speech>

We have about 324 cases in the High Court.  They're reported quite regularly where we're pursuing people for judgments to try and get as much money back as possible, but you have to take a view sometimes that there's, you know ... somebody has sold all their assets and they have no assets left.  Are you going to spend money pursuing judgments just for the sake of pursuing judgments when it's actually going to cost you lots of money legally to do that when effectively there's nothing there to pick up?  So the reality is that everybody wishes that the assets were there to pay back the &euro;74 billion.  I'm saying to you, the value of the assets isn't there to pay back the &euro;74 billion and what we think we'll get back ultimately will be ... pay off the &euro;31.8 billion debt plus a bill in surplus at the-----</p></speech>

All we're saying is that that sustainable model across the four - or the three - areas of funding, development and planning in the market would actually make it much more difficult for the type of crash and the type of speculation and the type of funding that caused, or contributed to, all of that to happen now.  As to whether any of those, or how many of those ... I don't know how many bullet points are there.  There's about ten or 12.  As to how many of them progress has been made on, I think progress has been made on some of them, but I think progress needs to be made on more of them.

In terms of a sustainable model going into the future, would you see any merit in a publicly-owned banking system devoted to the needs of society rather than the private profits of elites and shareholders?</p></speech>

So, it's a big part of the banking system.  I think when, you know ... I've met other countries who've had banking problems as well, and they would've had publicly owned banking systems and private sector banking systems.  And, unfortunately, their public-owned banks also had the same problems as the private sector banks because they all seemed to move in tandem.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1039" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042200002#GGG03300"><p>No, I don't have a breakdown of that.  I think what ... the point we're making is that, in terms of our capacity to actually deploy capital, the overall figure is about &euro;3 billion.  We certainly believe that a very substantial portion of that will be needed to develop out the Dublin docklands SDZ.  We also believe that a proportion of that will be needed to develop the housing that I have talked about.  And those are two mandates that we have been given in recent times following the review of NAMA last year by the Minister for Finance.  So ... but, there is no Dublin-centric approach to this.  It is available elsewhere, but it has to be where there are NAMA assets located because we, you know, we're ... we can't ... we're not ... can't under the Act advance funding or get involved with non-NAMA debtors or assets or land or whatever that is not on our books.</p><p>The reality is that most of those assets, and I think Mr. McDonagh referred to them earlier, the remaining assets are in either the Dublin area or the Dublin conurbation, or in the other major centres, but I mean over the years, and I don't have the figures with me, but certainly they would have appeared in our annual report and I'm sure there'll be reference to them in our upcoming annual report, of areas where we have invested outside Dublin and indeed I didn't read it out in my statement, but if you look at page 12, where we talked about property transactions in Ireland that we have facilitated and that is certainly all of around Dublin, around Cork, around various places like that.  The housing, in relation to input to social housing, input to the remediation of ghost estates, is all over the country.  The investment in land and in development assets straddles everywhere, but it has to be where NAMA happens to have the assets and the reality is that most of those are in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, or around that area.</p></speech>

I'm going to wrap up.  in wrapping up, I might just invite Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh if there's anything further that they would like to add.  I will say the inquiry is not just about the past, it's also about learning lessons into the future and I do know in your opening statements you did give a lot of suggestions with regard to how we ensure that we do not have to recreate another NAMA into the future.  So, just by means of any closing comments, is there anything you'd like to add, Mr. Daly or Mr. McDonagh?</p></speech>

I'll be brief, it's been a long day for everybody.  I want to make three points.  The first is to emphasise again, as I did in my opening statement, that we are attending here as part of the solution.  We were not the cause of the crash.  We are essentially the ambulance, or whatever comes across, coming along afterwards to actually tidy it up.  And then, you know, we're here because you are considering the appropriateness and effectiveness of the domestic policy response and NAMA was an element of that.  I think there's two elements to that then: the appropriateness of it is one we have discussed, as to whether you go down the asset management agency route and we've had a general discussion about that.  I'm not going to repeat it, but it is generally now acknowledged worldwide that where you have a crash of such proportions and where you have such a concentration of lending by financial institutions into a sector like property, that banks don't fix themselves and you have to take it off their books.  I think we've generally discussed that.</p> <p>  There is some material, which I referred to earlier, by the ECB and wherever in relation to that theoretical, what is the correct approach, what is the appropriate approach, and to the extent that the inquiry may not have that, we would be happy to pass it on to you.  So, you consider the theory of the appropriateness of the approach and then you must move on to the effectiveness, did it work?  That was the theory, that was the approach; did it work in practice?  And that's where you get in, I think, to NAMA's performance over the past five years, and to the figures that we have provided to the inquiry today and maybe updated figures that we can provide to the inquiry by November, or whenever you're going to write your report.  We would say, and you won't be surprised, that NAMA has been a very effective response.  I've outlined in the last page of my statement why and I'm not going to repeat it.  I would just like to thank you, Chairman, and members of the committee and the staff for your courtesy.</p></speech>

The group was charged with identifying and considering issues relating to the long-term sustainable funding of higher education in this country, and to identify options for change for consideration by the Minister for Education and Skills.  It has had consultations with relevant stakeholders and interested parties during the course of its work.  The purpose of the meeting is for members of the group to brief us on their work.</p><p>First, I must advise on privilege.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask everyone to turn off their mobile phones completely or put them on safe mode or flight mode.  Otherwise, they interfere with the broadcasting equipment.  Mr. Peter Cassells is accompanied by Ms Laura Casey and Ms Mary Armstrong.  I invite him to make his presentation.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, established an expert group in July 2014.  We were asked to consider the long-term sustainable funding of higher education in this country and to identify funding options for the future.  I was asked to chair the group as an independent chair.  The other members are listed in the appendix to the opening statement that has been provided so I will not go through that information.  As the Chairman indicated, I am joined today by two members of the secretariat, Laura Casey and Mary Armstrong.  No doubt, they will be able to provide help if we get into detailed technical questions.<br/><br/>With the agreement of the Chairman, I will briefly outline the context for the group&rsquo;s establishment, the work programme we are undertaking and the process of consultation and engagement.  It is not only consultation with the universities and institutes of technology, IOTs, but also with parents, students, business and social organisations.  Today we will engage with the political process.  I will then outline the key messages coming through in our work to date and in the consultation paper we published.<br/><br/>The group was established to address the growing pressures on the higher education system, which are well documented.  Student numbers have grown substantially since 2008 and will continue to do so in the coming years, while staff numbers and public funding has reduced.  Of the 210,000 students in universities and institutes of technology, 25,000 have entered since the economic crisis began.  That is due to the increasing number of school leavers but also more adult learners entering the system.  There has been a reduction in staff of approximately 2,000, which is an approximate reduction of 10%.  As a result, the staff to student ratio has decreased and lags behind international norms.  Core expenditure per student has decreased by approximately 10%.  More important, in terms of demographics, enrolments are projected to grow by nearly one third over the next 15 years.  Those twin pressures are resulting in what the Higher Education Authority outlined to the committee in February, namely, &quot;a high and growing level of risk that significant unfunded expansion in numbers participating in higher education will damage the quality of provision&quot; of higher education in Ireland with all the attendant consequences.  I will return to the point.  The main message coming through to date in our work is that the <i>status quo</i>of increasing numbers without increasing resources or a better use of existing resources is not an option.<br/><br/>In looking at the future options, as a group we are very conscious that we are undertaking this work at a time when the country has come through a very deep crisis but is now at a turning point.  We are at the stage where we need to revive development in a way that lays the foundations for balanced future prosperity and greater social cohesion.  In addressing the challenge, our growing young and highly educated population, which is unique in Europe, gives us an enormous advantage and opportunity.  However, availing of that opportunity will require significant investment in education, not just higher education but further education and apprenticeships and an examination of the use of current resources.  The requirement for further investment in education comes at a time when despite the stabilisation of the public finances, public resources and household incomes will continue to be stretched for some time.  We will all be faced with many difficult investment choices.  Committee members do not need me to spell out the competing demands such as health services, housing, jobs and regional development.  It is necessary to evaluate where education fits in among those priorities.  To come to any conclusion on the future funding of higher education and what priority should be given, we need first to achieve a shared understanding of what we are funding and what value higher education and its different contributions offers society and the economy.  That is the main focus of the current phase of work and what I wish to brief the committee on today.<br/><br/>Committee members have the expert group&rsquo;s terms of reference, so I will not go through them except to say that they encompass two or three issues which are of importance to us.  First is the identification of the benefits of higher education not just to the individual but also to the wider economy and society.  We are also focusing on the examination of future demand for higher education.  I mentioned that the projections show an increase of approximately one third in the next 15 years.  We are also currently examining the potential for efficiencies and giving consideration to long-term funding options.  It would be easier if it were just a technical exercise but that is not the case.  We are required to come up with implementable options, for example, to members as public representatives, and to try to seek to build a shared understanding around those options.  As the Chair has indicated, an important aspect of the group&rsquo;s work programme is consultation with the sector itself and with the wide range of stakeholders and interested parties such as parents, students, business and regional groupings.</p><p>This consultation process will be ongoing as part of trying to get a shared understanding of the options.  Today is part of that consultation to brief the committee.</p><p> We are approaching the work programme in three phases about which I want to inform the committee as we will want to revert if we can be given the opportunity in the next phases.  The first phase is the examination of the role, value and future scale of higher education in Ireland.  We have published a consultation paper on that which the committee has received.  I will return to the key points in the paper shortly.  Following the publication of that paper, we have engaged in wide-ranging consultation.  We have had a roundtable discussion with representatives from the sector, including management, students, staff, businesses and employers, people from second level and further education, community and voluntary groups, and Departments and Government agencies.  We have also had targeted forums around these areas.  What that is giving us is a deep insight into what our people's expectations from the higher education system are and what the challenges are going to be to meet those expectations.</p><p> The second phase of our work programme, which we are moving into now, looks at the current operation of the system and its level of efficiency and effectiveness.  This is a very important aspect of our work because before there is any consideration of additional investment, we want to be confident that the current resources are being managed and used to best effect.  We are examining income streams into the universities and institutes of technology, the levels of expenditure, the opportunities for new working methods, including the use of technology, workload management, shared services, and regional collaboration between different institutions, to name a few.  In that context, we will be seeking to benchmark the performance of the Irish system against international comparators.  We expect to publish our second consultation paper which will address those areas in that phase in June and, again, we will have a round of consultation around that area to see the reactions and responses.  The final phase of the work will be the identification and examination of the range of options with the potential to provide a sustainable base for the funding of higher education in the long term.  For this phase, we will draw on international expertise and experience and also engage in significant consultation.  It is not just a matter for the institutions involved as to how this would happen.  It is also a matter for parents, the taxpayer and the committee members as public representatives.</p><p> I return briefly to some of the key elements in the paper we published in January.  It is around the role, value and scale of higher education and its contribution both to the economy and society and the challenges of maintaining and enhancing those contributions.  On the gains, there is no doubt, as members will see from the paper where we have tried to go into it in some detail, that investment in higher education has been a key in enabling both the economy to grow but also the contribution that has been made to the development of society over recent decades.  Our well-educated population remains a central plank of our national economic strategy.  As a member of the board of the IDA, I know how that comes up continually and to a greater extent sometimes than the corporation tax rate among companies with which the IDA has discussions.  Graduates' knowledge and capabilities are crucial to enhancing productivity.  The institutions themselves are central to the whole area of research and knowledge generation, but also as engines of growth regionally and in local economic development.  I will come back to the question of whether they are and how we make that happen.  In overall terms, it is clear that the State and taxpayers benefit significantly from the investment through higher tax contributions and lower calls on welfare .  However, the paper also points out that we should not just look at this in economic terms.  In social and cultural terms, there are also strong gains from having a higher education system.  Higher education informs and nurtures our understanding of our own national identity, those of other cultures and belief systems, enriches our own cultural heritage and raises the whole question not only of our history but also of our culture in other areas.</p><p> A significant number of graduates, in fact the majority, find employment in the public sector.  This is often something people ignore.  Higher education is instrumental in enhancing the quality and the professionalism of a great many services, particularly in education, health and public administration.  In the paper, we set out that we are looking at this as a collective public good, as a collective success for our society and in terms of the individual gains people get from having gone through higher education.  However, there are also significant personal gains.  We have shown that graduates earn more and find employment more easily in Ireland.  An honours degree is linked to earning 100% more than an adult whose highest educational attainment is the leaving certificate or its equivalent.  We have brought together a great deal of information to show the gains in terms of getting employment and the level of incomes that graduates have.</p><p> The paper also looks at the growing demand for higher education.  There is a strong and growing demand for higher education both from the perspective of those who are seeking to enter it, the traditional 18 year olds, and increasingly adult learners.  There is also a growing demand from the labour market for graduate education, and the consultation paper sets out a continuing demand for higher education graduates.  It is projected that nearly half of all job openings by 2025 will be for graduates.  That is a key issue we need to address.  The paper also shows that participation rates in higher education have grown year on year.  In 1980, the participation rate in higher education was 20%.  It is now 56%.  This reflects what we all know in our own family lives, which is the increasing normality of going to higher education for a much broader cohort of students.  In my own case, no one from my family, including me, went to higher education other than subsequently in terms of apprenticeships or what we called night education.  The majority of the next generation have gone to higher education, however, and have an expectation of that continuing to the next generation.  Our current demographic structure will continue to drive higher education demand over the next period.  That is unique in Europe.  We included a graph in the briefing for members to show that the future projected demand includes 30% growth in numbers over the next decade.  That is driven by demographic change alone and takes no account of any change in the participation rate.</p><p> It is important to mention something that we and the committee members as public representatives and policy-makers need to take into account, which is that demand for higher education is influenced by a range of alternatives for school leavers and other potential earners.  For example, we need to look at further education, apprenticeships and post-second level opportunities and to determine how those opportunities or entry points open up for people.  A strategy is being developed for further education and another is being developed around apprenticeships.  In recent years, the trend has been more towards higher education directly because the opportunities that are relevant were not there, and this must be considered in tandem with the work that we are doing.</p><p> We have identified four areas we believe need to be the enduring focus in terms of the quality and contribution of higher education.  The first one is very important.  It is that the quality of the provision and the quality of the graduates is what remains paramount.  It is what higher education, whether at the university or the institute of technology, is about.</p><p>This is the single most important way in which higher education serves students, society, taxpayers and the public good.  We need graduates who can understand our past, engage with the present, imagine the future and engage in critical thinking.  This requires renewed attention not just to what graduates learn but also to how they learn.</p><p> The second area is research, either in the arts and the humanities or the STEM subjects.  We suggest the institutions need to further adapt and respond to the fundamental changes taking place in innovation and how knowledge is generated.  Knowledge is not just generated in the universities or from science, engineering and technology, it happens across a range of spheres, including higher education, business, government and civil society.  It is through their overlap and engagement in all of these areas that other countries have the edge.  Interaction in an open manner in a wider range of disciplines means innovation and knowledge generation are not confined to science, technology and engineering but are extended to the arts and the humanities.  Where they overlap, we have the advantage of being able to operationalise research later.</p><p> Third, we require the system to be more responsive to the changing needs of the economy, society and the public system in the medium and long term.  This raises questions about how to give attention to improving the employability of graduates.  Throughout the consultation process we kept hearing that while the core discipline and qualification were important, the capacity of graduates to engage in team work, communication, accept responsibility and engage in critical thinking and problem solving were equally important.  The issue of quality, informed career guidance and support for students is also crucial and we must consider how we fund this in the future.  In that context, we must also consider regional development and what role the institutions should play in enabling regions to develop economically and socially in co-operation with businesses, Government agencies and civil society.</p><p> The fourth crucial area we identified was that of equitable access to the opportunities offered by higher education.  Access for persons from non-traditional backgrounds needs to be improved.  Our paper sets out the issues in this regard.  From the point of view of funding, we must acknowledge that addressing resource inequities is resource intensive.  While significant progress has been made - we received presentations from the Cork Institute of Technology, DCU, the Institute of Technology Tallaght and others on their programmes - we believe improved access for under-represented groups must be a key part of the social contract in the context of future funding improvements.  We have set this out in our consultation paper.  These are the broad issues on which we have concentrated in our consultations.</p><p> I thank the committee for providing us with this opportunity to give it an overview of the task the group has been given and the approach we are taking to it.  This is not just a technical exercise.  We firmly believe we need to develop a shared understanding of the role and value of higher education and the efficiency of the current system before we consider funding requirements and options for meeting these requirements.  I look forward to the discussion and hearing the committee's views on the issues raised which will be a key part of the advice we are gathering.  I would also welcome an opportunity to return to the committee as our work progresses during the year because it will provide significant options that will require consideration not just by us but also by the committee and the Government.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Cassells give us a general overview of the group's timeline and what it hopes to achieve?  Of what will the remaining stages of its work consist and when will it be completed?  When can we expect to see the final report?</p> <p>  Were reports undertaken before the working committee was commissioned which are feeding into its work?  It is difficult to disagree with any work the group is carrying out as, in many ways, it appears to be engaged in a blue sky exercise.  That leads to a general question as to whether it would have made more sense to put the group to work three or four years ago in order that recommendations would have been ready by now for us to work on.  What reports have fed into the work the group is doing?</p> <p>  Mr. Cassells gave a good outline of many of the dynamics at play in recent times, including the 10% increase in student numbers and the 15% reduction in funding.  Based on the interaction and consultation so far, what is his view on whether this has led to a reduction in quality?  Is this something he believes to be the case?  </p> <p>  On the current position, recently the president of NUIG, Dr. Jim Browne, said he believed the system was at tipping point.  Will Mr. Cassells comment on this?  Does he agree and believe that is the position?  What are the implications of any delay in addressing this issue?</p> <p>  Will Mr. Cassells comment on the group's consultations?  Are there variations in the feedback from universities versus that from institutes of technology?  </p> <p>  In regard to massive online open education courses, MOOCs, what examination or recommendations will the group make?</p> <p>  Mr. Cassells has mentioned the four key areas on which he will report and the importance of good career advice to ensure students are aware of outcomes and job opportunities and in matching students appropriately with what they may do when they finish their education.  I am interested in hearing what, if any, feedback he has received, the current position and whether the issue needs to be addressed.  </p> <p>  On international models, will the group examine what happens in other countries and how it can be applied to Ireland, particularly in terms of funding models?</p> <p>  Will the final report present options or recommendations and will the group make a call on what it believes should happen?  Will it tie down its recommendations as opposed to presenting a menu of options for consideration?</p></speech>

Like Deputy Charlie McConalogue, I would like to know what reports were available before the expert group began its work.  There has been significant repetition, rightly so, in the first phase of its work in dealing with the role, value and scale of higher education.  We already know this and could talk about it until the cows come home.  In what way has the group used what was done before to colour what it is doing?</p><p>I accept that these issues need to be established, but we have established them 1,000 times at this stage.  There has been a great deal of discussion about the philosophy of education and so on, but I want to know when we will get to the meat of the issues.  Phase one really could have been completed in one day.  A postgraduate or doctorate student of education could have given the expert group a document on the philosophy of education, why we needed it and why it was so important for our burgeoning young population.  Why was so much time spent on that aspect of the work?  I realise our demographics are unusual and that there is the context of the downturn and now an apparent semi-boom to consider.  However, much of the work has already been done.</p><p> Mr. Cassells mentioned the reduction in higher education staff numbers during the downturn.  Was that reduction in academic, teaching or administrative staff numbers and how did it feed into the issues about which he is talking about?  It is very interesting to note that one of the greatest contributions of students in each discipline is in the area of the humanities and the arts.  That sector feeds into everything about which Mr. Cassells is talking - creativity, problem solving and team working - all of the great buzzwords.  There has been no mention, however, of what the Government has done at second level, namely, given bonus points in higher mathematics and probably science next year but not, for example, in music and the visual arts.  Most young people are opting for the arts, the humanities and languages at third level because they feed their creativity so much.</p><p> Mr. Cassells referred to graduates earning more than non-graduates.  I know many graduates, however, who are walking the streets looking for work.  Is Mr. Cassells referring to graduates who are working in Ireland?  If so, in which areas are they earning more and what is the percentage difference, or is he talking about graduates who have taken an aeroplane out of the country?</p><p> Will Mr. Cassells indicate his view on apprenticeships?  I am a great believer in apprenticeships and completely opposed to the apartheid system of education that has developed.  Some people are of the view that everybody should go to university, but not everybody wants to do so.  Apprenticeships have a great deal to offer.  How does Mr. Cassells see the role of apprenticeships in the context of the broader higher education sector?</p><p> How does the quality of provision and the quality of graduates correlate with the qualifications of the third level lecturers who teach them?  Is the expert group doing anything on the issue of the qualifications required by those who are moulding young minds, particularly in the liberal arts?</p><p> Why have we not, as other countries have done, identified the gaps, overlaps and creativities in our knowledge generation?</p></speech>

Does Mr. Cassells concur with that view?  I am concerned that the current funding model is corporatising third level education.  In the case of NUI Galway, for example, I am told that the model is having a knock-on effect on equality issues.  Representatives of the Higher Education Authority, when they attended a meeting of the committee recently, indicated that this corporatisation was endemic across the sector.  In a context in which large multinational companies are funding universities to a great extent, we are seeing a type of boys' club growing in the sector, with less of a focus on education and more on training people for jobs.</p> <p>  What recommendations will the expert group be making to eliminate wasteful spending within universities?  We have heard examples of expenditure on taxis in certain third level institutions and other outrageous expense claims.  Does Mr. Cassells have proposals in that regard?</p> <p>  One of the cuts that really irked me in recent years was the removal of supports for postgraduate students.  This has meant that unless one has money in one's pocket, one cannot progress past undergraduate level.  It was a very retrograde step.  Will Mr. Cassells be recommending that this cut be reversed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1069" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042200002#F00500"><p>I welcome the delegates and apologise for missing the start of the meeting.  We had the Minister for Education and Skills in the Seanad and I did not want to miss the opportunity to ask her questions.  </p> <p>  I very much liked Mr. Cassells's summary of the issues, particularly his outlining of four areas on which we should focus into the future.  As other speakers noted, we have heard some of this before, but it is important to build on prior knowledge.</p> <p>  Regarding the apprenticeship model, I welcome the establishment by the Minister of a committee to examine the issue.  Everybody does not learn in the same way and there are very high attrition rates in first year at higher level, especially in the first term.  As I understand it, we are losing up to 30% of students from some courses, made up of 19% in institutes of technology and 11% in universities.  The word "apprenticeship" is anathema to some in the universities.  It seems to be a repulsive concept, with the attitude being that it is not for them.  In other countries, by contrast, PhDs are being offered at apprenticeship level.  When will we see that happen here?  We must have an education system that is for everybody, not just those who have an aptitude for academic learning.  We must open our minds in this regard.  As Mr. Cassells noted, honours degree graduates earn 100% more than those without a degree.  We must ensure there is equality of opportunity.</p> <p>  I concur with Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell on the teaching qualifications of lecturers.  Part of the reason for the high attrition rates is that young people are not being reached by good teaching.  Is there a basic HDip qualification for lecturers?  If there is, I do not know about it.  Does the expert group have plans in that regard?</p> <p>  The next issue I want to raise is a personal bugbear of mine because I have a child in this age group, as have many of my peers.  Among the 17 and 18 year olds starting college each year, there is a wide variation in maturity levels.  Once students turn 18 years, universities and institutes of technology do not give their parents information on how they are doing, even though the parents are paying the bills.  Something must be tweaked in this regard.  Once a student gets past the date of 30 October, fees kick in and if he or she subsequently realises he or she has made the wrong course choice and drops out, as so many do because of poor career guidance, low maturity levels and so on, the parents must pay the fees the following year if the student chooses to take a different course.  We must do something about this.  There must be more streamlined and effective communication between colleges, students and parents.</p> <p>  One of the four areas identified by Mr. Cassells was improving the employability of graduates.  When I take the train or bus to Galway, I am sometimes approached by young people who want to talk about internships.  Participants in JobBridge were paid an additional &euro;50 per week, but a person had to be in receipt of social welfare payments to qualify.  Many of these young people are not actually receiving any social welfare payment.</p></speech>

As Mr. Cassells said, practice opportunities are vital for graduates to build team-working and other skills on top of their qualifications.  However, the internships being offered in many cases are not devised with the young person's development in mind and some of the participants end up feeling used and abused.</p></speech>

I am wondering, in that context, whether we might have guidelines for employers offering internships in order that everybody will believe he or she is benefiting from them.  A good internship is a fantastic experience for those involved.</p> <p> The Chairman might consider my next question to be a little off the point, but it is very relevant in Galway.  NUI Galway has received a great deal of public funding during the years and developed a very fine campus, much of it built along the River Corrib by virtue of its location.  Now, however, there is a bypass proposal for Galway which would see four routes passing through the campus.</p><p>Has Mr. Cassells a view on public money being undone in that way?</p></speech>

He has presented on the first phase and has outlined the work to be done on the other two phases.  I am particularly hungry to get the other parts and would love to be talking about the final report at this stage.  In terms of the current operational level of efficiency Mr. Cassells said the next paper will be available in June.  As, I presume, some work has been done in that area, will he give the committee an early indication of the interim findings in regard to current efficiencies?</p></speech>

I wish to ask about flexibility of delivery.  We have a system whereby free fees are available for full-time undergraduate courses but no maintenance grants, as already mentioned, for postgraduates and part-time courses, so we have a very divided system compared with other countries which have much more flexibility.  The system should be neutral to allow persons complete the undergraduate course by day or night and irrespective of how long it takes to complete it.  If someone with a family is returning to education while working part-time, a course that may take four years full-time to complete could take six years on a more flexible system, but it might be the only way that person can get an undergraduate degree.  The current system precludes that in terms of funding.  Is that issue being looked at?</p></speech>

My wish is that everyone who want to should go to third level.  My other wish is that most people would stay in the school system and complete the junior and leaving certificates before doing anything else.  I am disappointed that Deputy Michael Conaghan has left because he had been very involved in education all through his life, especially where I live.  He was very much the wise eyes and ears in the VEC college in Inchicore.</p> <p>  Many young people who had not gone through secondary school attended the VEC and came out with a great education which gave them stability.  I am looking at my own life and listening to what has been said.  I was an early school leaver.  The reality is that at the time it was all about academics.  It certainly was not about people's ability and capability.  If it had been, I probably would have been an Olympic runner or would have done the long jump or many other things.  I was interested to read the paper because for me an education is all about having a proper social life and fulfilment.  Education gives a person self-esteem, builds them up and makes them the person they did not think it was possible to be.  I know many young people who left school early and have gone back to do projects.  I have doubts about some of the projects being pursued.</p> <p>  Children would have been better off remaining in secondary school and completing the leaving certificate before pursuing some projects.  Education is all about social class.  In the past, the people who came from more affluent families would have gone to college while those from a lower education background did not but, thankfully, that is changing.  I see that change right across my constituency.  As parents have greater expectations for their children to continue in education, the SUSI grant is very important to them.  The more people are educated, the better society is for everyone.  People come out of it more rounded and are better able to cope with life.  I agree with the Senator who said that not everyone who has a third level degree has a brilliant job.  Many have had to leave the country.  I was not here for the Union of Students in Ireland-----</p></speech>

It is not just the difference between options, it is differences in ideological choices.  Will that issue be explored?  If one is in a Scandinavian country versus-----</p></speech>

Will that issue be considered in the report?  The participation rate in third level was properly mapped with the Clancy reports but the last proper report only looked at 2004.  The latest report by the HEA is only partial, it is not anything like the Clancy reports.  They showed in 2004 that after the abolition of third level fees, every group increased its participation rate.  We do not have figures after that period.  The HEA information is not up to scratch as far as I can see.  I am not criticising it but it has not done the job that used to be done and that is needed to get the full picture.  I saw a report in the newspaper of an EU rating.  Apparently it suggested that teaching was losing ground.  Singapore was ranked first in <i>The Sunday Times</i>but there is a new EU rating.  I understand it suggested that in Ireland, teaching was losing ground.</p></speech>

I want to ask about apprenticeships.  One could look at apprenticeship as totally different from third level or as part of the third level system.  It has always been part of, say, the Dublin Institute of Technology.  People can go from apprenticeship into third level and further education.  Therefore it is important.  Ballyfermot has a low participation rate at third level but that may be because Ballyfermot College of Further Education provides some third level qualifications.</p></speech>

I will respond to them as best I can.  I am taking the questions as being the committee's identification of the key issues in terms of advice to us.  This is an ongoing process and we need as much advice as possible from people as to what are the priorities.  That brings me to the first question from Deputy McConalogue.  In terms of the timeline for the final report, it is to be finished by the end of this year.  The first phase was on the role and value of education.  The second phase which will be around the effectiveness and efficiencies and how the current system operates.  We will have a consultation paper towards the end of June and would certainly welcome an opportunity to come back to the committee, as Deputy Brendan Ryan said, to discuss it because it will raise many of the issues that were raised, such as where the reductions have occurred, the balance between lecturing and administration and the balance between teaching and research.</p> <p>  Perhaps I can link that back to the question asked.</p><p>Will there be recommendations or options in the final report?  Implications for the options can depend on what countries one is examining.  We were asked to do it by way of options but as a group we wanted these as implementable options.  In a sense, it would have been easy to do this as a technical exercise and tell Oireachtas Members that these are the options they need to implement.  However, we need to drill down into each of the options as to their advantages, disadvantages and how they might operate in an Irish context.  An option that may be successful abroad may not operate in an Irish context.  For example, Ireland&rsquo;s demographics and growing population have a different implication and set of pressures for funding than in Germany where the population is falling.  We need to drill down into all of that for Oireachtas Members so that when they come to make a decision on this, they have all this information.  It will be as close to recommendations that one could get without our group declaring them to be recommendations.<br/><br/>A range of reports were done by the HEA the Irish Universities Association and others over several years on the sustainability of the system and on demographics.  Unfortunately, none of those reports pulled the whole thing together.  The reason we started with phase 1 on the role, the value and the scale of third level education was to pull all these reports together to say this is the historical evolution of the higher education system, this is what it should be and its values.  We had many discussions and arguments with the various groupings on this.  We were clear that the value is both for a collective societal good and individual gain.  The system has in a sense strayed into individual gain as opposed to society investing in a proper system.<br/><br/>We are now moving into the phase of examining the efficiencies and effectiveness of the system.  This ties into the reduction in funding and the increase in student numbers with the impact on teaching quality.  This will be dealt with it in some detail in the report.  The question of the staff-student ratio, namely the numbers lecturers have to deal with, as well as the capacity for smaller group and one-to-one interaction, is having an impact on teaching quality.  As Senator O&rsquo;Donnell asked, the question that keeps on arising is does one professionalise the teaching aspect.  In Australia, they have professionalised teaching with little involvement in research.  Some groupings have argued for this with us while others have argued it should be teaching and research.  Others argued there should be research-led teaching so that it is up-to-date with the most recent developments in an area.  Others argued that those engaged in key research should be exempted from teaching.  It is interesting that some of the top research people have said they want to teach because that is their whole <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>for being involved.</p></speech>

There is a need for blended learning.  In other words, how does one use the technology as it will never operate on its own in the delivery of and accessing higher education?  It will also require significant investment.  Some submissions argued technology would reduce costs and one would not need funding.  In fact, all the information shows it would require significant investment.  One will never be able to provide it in such a way that there is no blended interaction between teaching and that technology is an enabler that does not take over from what is happening.</p> <p>  We looked at various international models from systems that are wholly publicly funded, as in Norway for example, to systems where it is a contribution from the student and parents to systems where these contributions are underpinned by a loan system such as in Australia and the UK.  We need to examine the advantages and disadvantages of these options but, equally, their applicability in an Irish context.  It is useless if our group gives Oireachtas Members a set of options if they cannot see clearly the impact in an Irish context.</p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised the issue of loans and a graduate tax.  Again, this is an issue which we will be examining but we do not have a view on it yet.  Members would be highly critical of us if we submitted a report that did not consider the advantages and disadvantages of the various options.  All of the options will be examined but I cannot say at this stage how they might float.  For example, the loans issue has much wider implications than what we can say about the repayment or level of those loans.  If the State provides it, then one is into significant borrowing.  That would that be an issue in an Irish context.  Do we add significantly to our national debt to establish such a system?  These are the issues which we must probe and, due to their complexity, is why it has taken us time to come up with implementable options.</p> <p>  The issue of wasteful spending was also raised.  We are looking at the effectiveness of income streams, expenditure, workloads and the regional provision of different programmes in the next phase.  We will also be examining postgraduate grants and part-time education.  I was on the group which came up with the national strategy for higher education.  One of the key elements around that was the flexibility of access and being able to enter the system through any route, whether it was through an apprenticeship and moving up, or further education and moving indirectly, or another stage in life.</p><p>There was also the need to ensure there was equity in terms of how everybody was treated.  I know that from personal experience as I had to access higher education through the part-time route.  In the report we will address both the costs involved and how those costs could be met.  </p><p> On the question of apprenticeships, on one level one could argue that as an expert group on future funding of higher education, we must deal with issues from the viewpoint of funding, but the reason we have raised this issue in the first report is that demographics alone and the young population are driving a 30% increase in the numbers who want to avail of post leaving certificate opportunities, let us call it tertiary education.  One cannot have a situation where the only route, not only from the point of view of funding but from what is right, would be to go straight to university or to an institute of technology.  A strategy and a policy has been and is being developed on apprenticeships and another for further education.  The point being made, which is crucially important, is the traditional view of apprenticeships as being in the crafts area versus apprenticeships in a range of areas across the spectrum of higher apprenticeships and also to industrial degrees, as they are called in Denmark.  In other words that one can take apprenticeship training up to degree level and, as the Senator mentioned, up to PhD level.</p><p> A question was asked about NUIG and the bypass.  I think the Senator will accept that I will bypass that for the moment.  The reason I am responding to it is that we will be looking at the issue of capital expenditure, in other words if one takes the whole question of expenditure on infrastructure in our institutes of technology and universities, where will the expenditure come from, what is needed?  What are the future requirements and how would one source the funding for the future requirements?</p><p> The issue of infrastructure will come up.</p></speech>

A national teaching and learning forum has been established for the first time and I know the HEA probably went through that process with members when they met the committee.  The HEA is developing the whole area of teaching in some detail and supporting the whole teaching area.</p> <p>  I did not mention that during the consultation, people had drawn our attention to the fact that in some countries there is a professionalisation of teaching and qualifications and had indicated that we should look a this.  I am not saying we will be looking at everything because we have to be very careful.  We are looking at the funding and how future funding requirements will be financed but we are using the opportunity of that to see how the funding as it were can influence, incentivise or change the way things are done.  We are approaching it from that direction and managing to stay within our terms of reference.  Obviously if we are saying there should be more money for teaching, the obvious question is to ask for our view on how it is done at present.</p></speech>

I think apprenticeships are third level.  The idea that to be academic one lives in one's head and that is the only way one can judge academia is ridiculous.  The Chairman mentioned ideologies and boundaries, but my general question is whether the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education is to be allowed to stray into the area of apprenticeships and make recommendations?  I would have felt that many of the universities capitulated to the great technology companies, Google, and the banking system of education when they said they would give an additional 25 points to mathematics but would not give it to music.  We will create a hierarchy of subjects.  Does Mr. Cassells see his role as having a place there? </p> <p>  Of the 11 members on the expert group, some 15% come from health and welfare, but none of the medical schools, that is, UCC, UCG, UL, RCSI or Trinity College is represented.</p></speech>

Mr. Cassells spoke about the employability of graduate.  Will he comment on guidelines on internships and the usefulness of them and also on the fact that some young people drop out of college but if there was communication to parents, perhaps fees would not be lost?</p></speech>

No, we are a funding group but the way in which we have raised the issue, highlighted it in the consultation paper and will highlight it in the final report is that we have pulled together all the demographic information we can find.  This shows with the current participation rates in universities and IoTs there would be a 30% increase in the next 15 years.  We think that would be a significant funding requirement, but we should not put it down to the funding requirements for those two sectors as we need to look at the other outlets for people-----</p></speech>

That is the reason we are saying that it should be beyond the traditional apprenticeships.  A working group has reported to the Department on that and a strategy has been developed.  We have not been asked to consider apprenticeships but we are saying that in looking at the funding requirements we need to be able to comment on that.</p> <p>  In terms of the composition of the group, I was asked to chair it and the other members of the group were invited by the Minister and others to participate in it.  I am not commenting on how other groups have approached this, but we are engaged in extensive consultation, as we are here today, with all of the different groupings, including the universities and the medical schools.  For this reason, and it is a point I made previously, we want to develop a shared understanding as to how these things will be funded and happen</p> <p>  We will have to consult with bodies, for example if one has a charge or fees for different programmes and courses, does one grade it depending on the future earnings that might emerge from the particular profession  under consideration?</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, my name is Annie Hoey and I am the vice president for equality and citizenship.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Conor Stitt, who is the vice president for the Border, midlands and western region.</p> <p>  This paper has been in formation for the past two years.  Reform of SUSI and the grant system is a key issue for USI.  It is no secret that there were some teething problems with SUSI in the beginning.  However, since then things have vastly improved and USI has a very good and positive working relationship with SUSI.  However, there are still many flaws and students continue to fall through the cracks.  At last year's annual USI congress the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, challenged USI to formulate papers offering solutions to the issues about which we were concerned.  We did this with our NERI paper on publicly funded education and we are here today with our paper and proposals for reform of the grant scheme legislation.</p> <p>  Access to higher education is a core component of USI's work.  Based on our work on the ground we can say that the present financial support structure is not working optimally.  The student maintenance grant has been cut significantly over the past decade at a time when the cost of living has increased and rental accommodation costs have risen by an average 10% nationally over the past 12 months.  The proposals in this paper seek to rectify some of the inequalities and problems that exist within the current requirements for the student maintenance grant.  What we describe to the committee today, as outlined in our grant reform paper, are issues many members of the committee have come across in their constituency offices.  From studying the replies to parliamentary questions and the minutes of previous meetings here we can see that the issues we outline come up repeatedly and are dealt with on a case by case basis.  We are proposing a structural reform for many of these areas rather than continuing down the arduous road of solving each issue as it comes up.</p> <p>  The issue of main concern to students and the USI is that of the adjacency rate regulations.  To receive the non-adjacent rate applicants must have a home address more than 45 km as the crow flies from their place of study.  This distance was extended from 24 km to 45 km in budget 2011.  The extension of the adjacency rate has had a profound impact on those not living in the greater Dublin area or the east coast of Ireland where incomes are lower and grant dependency is higher.  In rural areas distances as the crow flies rarely equate to a consistent travel experience between locations.</p> <p>  For example, Dungloe in County Donegal falls within the 45 km of Letterkenny as the crow flies but the distance travelled is nearly 80 km.  Those who dwell on islands are not automatically allocated the non-adjacent rate.  For example the Aran Islands are considered adjacent to Galway city even though it requires a ferry journey.</p> <p>  To tackle these issues we propose: a full reinstatement of old 24 km rate; change 45 km to travel distance not geographical distance; entitlement of non-adjacent rate to those living on islands; and reinstatement of the entitlement of mature students to the non-adjacent rate which was also cut in budget 2011.</p> <p>  On the issue of independence and estrangement, currently, a student must have turned 23 years old on 1 January preceding the start of the course to be considered as an independently supported student.  Students must provide evidence of their independence to the satisfaction of the grant authority.  The problem lies with the standard of evidence SUSI requires.  Students applying as estranged from their parents, must evidence it by documentation such as letters and-or reports from the Garda, social workers, the HSE or a court order.  The number of students affected by estrangement is low, but seeking out excessive verifications of this often distressing period in their life can have a profound effect on them and their studies.</p> <p>  At a meeting between with the HEA and USI, SUSI accepted that the standards for approving estrangement are too high.  We propose that the Minister for Education and Skills send out clear guidelines to grant authorities which could give more allowances to applicants trying to evidence estrangement.</p> <p>  Proving independence can be an onerous task, particularly for mature students.  In the current legislation anyone living in the parental home is assessed on his or her parents' income as a dependent student.  This does not take into account a number of issues such as lone parents going through a separation who may move into their parents' home for a short period in order to tide them over during their marital relationship breakdown.  Nor does it take into account that some people live at home as carers.</p> <p>  USI recommends that students over the age of 23 who are classed as mature students should be assessed on their personal income and not that of their parents or have their community welfare officer determine independent living.</p> <p>  Postgraduate fees and supports have already been mentioned at the committee today.  At a time when we are building a knowledge and skills-based economy that can compete internationally, postgraduate qualifications are becoming the norm in many sectors.  Unfortunately the postgraduate maintenance grant was abolished in budget 2012 and the following year postgraduate applications by 15% to 20%.  The reduction was 19% in NUIG and approximately 13% in UCD.  There are different income limits for those in undergraduate study from those pursuing a postgraduate qualification.  USI recommends that these income limits be brought in line with each other and be the same as the undergraduate limit.</p> <p>  Our document outlines further issues regarding social welfare payments and cut-off rates.</p> <p>  The loss of a parent's support through death or marital breakdown can have a significant detrimental impact on a student's ability to continue with studies.  Students who suffer the death of a parent must account for all incomes, including a widow's pension during reassessment.  USI recommends that extra payments and one-off payments such as a widow's pension should not be included in the reassessment of a student.</p> <p>  In one case in my institution, UCC, a student was asked to provide a coroner's report in order to prove the death of her father.  The distress this caused her and her family eventually led to her dropping out of her course.  The only evidence a student should ever be required to produce is a death certificate.  The grant scheme has no guidelines on marital breakdown.  This can be a particularly stressful time for students.  We request that the Minister for Education and Skills should issue guidelines to SUSI on how to evidence separation.</p><p>On assets as a possible route of determining means-based eligibility, USI has cautioned against proceeding with this without first setting up a feasibility group of relevant stakeholders.  Assets should not be assessed if they are the primary source of income for a family.</p><p> What I have outlined here is only a summary of what committee members got in the paper.  It is quite long so I will not continue for much longer.  I wish to thank the Chairperson and other committee members for giving us a chance to talk to them today.  We look forward to answering any questions they may have.</p></speech>

The USI paper was excellent.  Last night, I spoke at the USI student achievement awards and there has been an increasing professionalisation from that organisation over the past year, which is really positive.  It is useful for us, rather than criticising the system, to propose changes that can actually be made.  I have a couple of questions.  Has this presentation gone to the Minister yet?  If so, what kind of feedback, if any, has the USI had?  Has the USI been promised any level of engagement to get a response from the Department on the individual recommendations, and the same with SUSI?</p> <p>  I would like to get more detail on the issue of estrangement.  When SUSI's representatives attended this committee a few months ago, I raised this issue with them.  They acknowledged that the current system has its problems and should be changed.  Perhaps the USI representatives can provide more details on how an alternative system could work.  Obviously it is difficult and there are sensitivities there, particularly if a person does not have relationships.  The whole point of estrangement is that they do not have a relationship with their parents so they may not be able to get co-operation from them in obtaining the type of documentation they need to prove that.  It would be helpful therefore is the USI could give us more details on that matter.</p> <p>  Ms Hoey went through each of the areas in considerable detail, which is helpful.  We can discuss this in private session, but I propose that the committee should forward the USI paper to the Department and seek its formal response on whether it agrees with the recommendations.  </p> <p>  The question of assets is always a sensitive one.  Coming from Dublin, I know there has always been a sense that PAYE workers - the people whose income is entirely transparent - are hard done by and that others have been able to manage assets.  There were revelations of particular examples of that in the book published by the last Minister's special adviser.  An example was given of somebody from a farming background who had considerable assets and how such people are able to work the current system.  Does the USI have any sense that there is a willingness to change that?  What would a fairer system look like?  What would the USI propose in order to treat assets fairly?</p></speech>

I admire them greatly because many people come in here with incantations of awfulness, but do not come up with solutions.  Well done to the USI for coming up with solutions that are reasonable, achievable and well laid out.  They are good examples of what the witnesses are talking about.  I am sure they have many such examples and picked out very relevant ones.</p> <p>  I am interested that the USI representatives did not mention the disgraceful behaviour of the banks on undergraduate and postgraduate grants, which is a bugbear of mine.  Even more disgraceful is that bank interest rates are at one level when undergraduates are studying, but they are increased when students qualify.  Banks now have branches on university campuses all over the country.  At the moment, people are trying to convince the Government to change all kinds of variable rates, so this locks into what the USI representatives are talking about here.  Perhaps they could elaborate on it.  Well done to them.  I think Senator Power's suggestion is a good one which we should pursue.</p></speech>

I was shocked to see that a person would be asked for a coroner's report to state that somebody belonging to them had passed away.  That is shocking.  Like other speakers, I think the USI research is really great and interesting to read.  As a member of the Government side, I cannot always agree with what comes in this format, but the presentation is worth reading.  It is something to chew over when considering reform.  I will be raising it in the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.</p> <p>  It may not be Government policy, but I agree with Ms Hoey that mature students should be assessed on their personal income and not on their parents' income.  I have always believed that.  It is shocking at times that young people are seen as leaning on their parents for everything.  Many young people are independent and want to be seen as such, even though they might live at home.  They should not be assessed on their parents' incomes because every parent is different and cannot be in one category.  </p> <p>  I will certainly read the presentation in more detail, but what I have already looked over is very interesting. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042200002#L00500"><p>I thank Ms Hoey for the detailed presentation.  It is great when people come in here to give such a comprehensive report and come up with practical solutions.  I am wearing two hats because I am listening to the USI as a parent who currently has three children in third-level education.  Hopefully, I will have a fourth in third-level in September.  I concur with what the USI is seeking, which is realistic.  My 23-year-old daughter was judged as being ineligible because she is living at home, yet she does everything independently.  That is the case with many 23-year-olds.  On the one hand we are constantly saying "be as independent as you can", but on the other hand they are not being given the opportunities.</p> <p>  Ms Hoey referred to adjacent rates and said that people who live on islands do not necessarily qualify for NUIG, but that beggars belief.  I am 50 miles from Dublin on the M1 corridor, which is grand.  It is a completely different story, however, for someone in Dungloe or Rannafast in Donegal who is trying to access college education.</p> <p>  Can Ms Hoey elaborate on the add-on years and the repeat years?  Some important points need to be brought out there.  I have received representations from people who have had to repeat one subject but they dropped out due to the financial implications involved.</p> <p>  It is not often that everyone on a committee gives such praise, so Ms Hoey should lap it up.  It does not happen every day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042200002#L00600"><p>I join with the Chairperson and other colleagues in welcoming Ms Hoey and Mr. Stitt.  I thank them for their comprehensive presentation and for identifying what they believe are appropriate solutions.  We should forward it to the Department and seek costings for the various USI proposals.</p> <p>  The issue of independence always jumps out at me.  I have come across a number of such cases with under-23s.  Last year, I remember one case involving a 22 year old man who was living with his partner and two children.  He was being assessed on his parents' income and his own income, but one cannot stand over such things.  There are a number of instances like that every year.  Likewise for the over-23s, difficulties arise every year concerning people's ability to provide evidence of not being domiciled with their parents.  They are falling through the cracks and as a result of that they are excluded.  There is a common problem in that the Department sets the terms of reference for the grant scheme to SUSI.  SUSI implements it rigidly so there is no buffer zone between the Department and SUSI to assess extreme cases.  It is black and white, and as a result many people cannot access the system.</p><p>I thank the delegation for putting the proposal together which we will promote.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042200002#M00200"><p>I concur with other members that the proposal is practical and pragmatic, but I do not agree with all of it.  The setting up of SUSI has possibly made the system more transparent; therefore, we can have more confidence in it, unlike the old one.  Also, the demographics have changed in how grants are awarded, which says something about the system in place prior to the setting up of SUSI.</p><p>USI's view of assets is a fudge.  I have attended briefings by it and believe there is a battle within it.  Those running it favour the <i>status quo,</i>which very much means that the system favours people living in rural areas as opposed to those living in urban areas under the PAYE system and that it also favours the the self-employed.  In this regard, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence and some stories do stack up.  I refer to the children of doctors receivng grants as opposed to somebody who is the child of a bus driver.  Such claims lead to a question mark being placed over the current system.  That is the only difficulty I have with the proposal.  The USI should show leadership in the issue.  It should outline what is the right thing to do and decide whether assets should form part of the picture.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Stitt" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042200002#M00300"><p>I will address the questions as I received them.  </p> <p>  Senator Averil Power asked whether the presentation had been sent to the Minister.  The USI president presented it to her, although they have had only informal discussions up to this point.  However, nothing concrete, in terms of a recommendation or favourable decisions, has yet been fed back to us.  We will have further sit-downs with the Minister, but we just wanted to bring the paper to the committee to obtain feedback.</p> <p>  The issue of estrangement was mentioned.  It is a massive problem but not something with which I would dare to become involved.  There is no formal recognition or certification process in Irish law where someone is estranged from his or her parents.  That is where students fall between the cracks.  SUSI may ask for Garda reports or reports by the HSE or a social worker, but it might be the case that none of them has had dealings with certain people.  The Garda will not issue a letter to the effect that a person is estranged if it has not dealt with the person involved.  I know that a number of students have given evidence to the effect that they are estranged, but it has not been deemed acceptable by SUSI.  We will definitely ask the Minister to look at the existing guidelines and the process followed by SUSI in this matter.  I suggest the guidelines abe widened.  We should generally accept anything that can act as evidence of estrangement and SUSI should be eligible to make an informed decision.  Before now we believed its process was too stringent.  A number of the claims are being referred to the completely impartial grant appeals board which is an arm of the Department of Education and Skills.  We do not want cases to constantly have go through that arm of the Department because the standards of SUSI are too high.</p> <p>  I shall reply to the points made by the Chairman.  On assets, I completely understand the concerns expressed.  What we have included in the paper might not be considered to be committed to any strategy or attack on the issue.  USI has, however, been pragmatic.  We realise there is a certain pot of money available for student supports and that if a student receives a grant fraudulently, there will be less available for those students really in need.  In that respect, we want the matter to be dealt with where fraudulent claims of income are supplied or where applications are submitted by what I have termed "asset rich families".  We do not want a farmer to be told he or she has too much land and must sell a fraction of it to fund a college education for his or her children.  Equally, we do not want someone who owns a local newsagents to do the same.  There is no difference between owning farmland and a local business; in that context, there is no rural-urban divide.  We should not jump into such a strategy willy-nilly.  We do not want to have a situation where people will have to sell land or a business to support a student in his or her college years.  We are pressing to have a group of relevant stakeholders brought together by the Minister and the matter fully discussed.  We want a strategic point of attack in legislation which will not affect the person reliant on his or her farmland or family business but rather the person who owns a classic car collection.  We need to sit down and properly discuss the matter.  It would be inappropriate to proceed without first outlining the background.  </p> <p>  Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell mentioned interest rates.  That matter has not been brought into the foreground.  Grants are provided by local authorities or the grants authority, SUSI.  We have position papers on State-backed loans and banks giving out loans.  We hold certain positions on the matter, but they are based purely on the provision of students supports and grants.  That is why we did not deal with the matter earlier.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Annie Hoey" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042200002#M00400"><p>We mentioned mature students and their personal income, an issue we have found to be problematic.  Last week I attended the forum on lone parents organised by Senator Katherine Zappone, at which I heard alarming stories which I had not heard before.  I heard about a woman who had gone through a marital breakdown.  She lived at home for about one month to try to sort herself out.  As a result of living at home she lost rent supplement and was deemed to be dependent on her father, even though she was in her thirties.  This had left her incredibly distressed.  She was pregnant at the time and also had a four year old child.  The upheaval had had an impact on her ability to cope.  She ended up having to take a year out to reassess where she was going and try to get back on track.  Someone should never have to take a year out to sign on to become eligible to continue his or her education.</p> <p>  There is a similar problem in providing proof of independence.  It is difficult to move straightaway from being an undergraduate to a postgraduate student.  No student should have to sign on for one year to prove he or she is independent from his or her parents.  It does not make sense that people must do this to prove they are independent.  </p> <p>  The issue of added years has caused confusion.  My sister had such a problem.  She was told there was no support available and was unable to find any information online.  If grant authorities cannot find the information, students definitely will not be able to find it, which is worrying.</p> <p>  On the issue of mitigating circumstances, people do not necessarily repeat just because they are lazy or having a great time.  There are serious reasons such as marital breakdown, the loss of a parent, illness, etc.  Such circumstances have a massive impact on the ability of students to return to education.  I started college in 2006 and every year since I have seen students drop out for personal reasons.  They were of the view that they would not receive the support needed to continue studying.</p><p>We get telephone calls all the time from students on courses at level 7 on the National Framework of Qualifications who wish to avail of the option of doing an additional year to obtain a level 8 qualification.  It seems, however, that as far as SUSI is concerned, that add-on year amounts to a whole new course and participants are no longer eligible for existing supports.  Everything essentially goes flying out the window.  We would like to see clarity in respect of all courses that have the option of an add-on year, so that people are not left in a situation where their supports are withdrawn.  Students often commence a course in an institute of technology because of the points level, because it is local to them and so on, with the intention of proceeding to level 8 by way of the conversion year.  After completing three years, however, they are told they no longer qualify for support.  That is not acceptable.  We are talking about a continuation of the same course, albeit perhaps with a slightly different name.  We would like to see an awareness on the part of SUSI that this option is available and an accommodation of it, rather than having this back and forth we are seeing at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conor Stitt" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042200002#N00200"><p>Senator Moran asked about adjacency rates.  When the decision was made to extend the distance criterion from 24 km to 45 km, the implication was that all students living within 45 km of their college are expected to commute.  That is not realistic in many cases, however, because a distance of 45 km as the crow flies might not translate to a reasonable commute.  In Galway, where I live, parts of east Clare are within 45 km of the college campus.  However, anybody who knows Galway knows there is the ring around Galway Bay and factors like that to consider.  We already gave the example of Dungloe in west Donegal, which is an 80 km round trip for students of Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  That is not really a reasonable proposition.  We have estimated the fuel and public transport costs and the options available to students living these types of distances from their college.  In some cases, people would not be able to make it in time for their lectures or would be very late arriving home.  In the case of Dundalk Institute of Technology, students living in Drogheda no longer qualify for support.  This is a harsh measure which has bluntly cut out a lot of students or seen a slashing of their grant payment.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue suggested that the committee might be able to obtain some additional costings from the Department, which we would greatly appreciate.  In terms of the adjustment in respect of the adjacency rate, the appropriate calculations would have been included in the budget costings.  I understand the adjacency rate saving is a projected &euro;12 million per year and &euro;50 million over four years.</p> <p>  In terms of how students aged over 23 can prove they are living independently of their parents for the purpose of qualifying for grant support, we would recommend that they be able to approach their local community welfare officer, who could verify on the student's behalf, on the basis of the evidence presented, that the student is living independently.  This might involve the welfare officer putting a stamp on a form and submitting it to SUSI.  One of the difficulties many people have with the new regime is that the centralisation of the process means they can no loner go into their local authority office and meet a person face to face and get an issue sorted.  It is only possible now to talk to somebody by telephone, which means the personal touch is gone.  Where we formerly had that type of sit-down contact there was more scope for flexibility, discussions could be had and a decision might be made there and then rather than having to send off documents and wait weeks for a response.  I have suggested that community welfare officers might be the persons best suited to assist students in these matters because they would have sufficient training and expertise to provide assistance and, in a context where we are seeing a reduction in the numbers on the live register, they might be in a position to offer that assistance.  While welfare officers were among the busiest of civil servants in recent years, they might now have the time to perform this role.</p> <p>  We would be strongly in favour of a situation where decisions by SUSI are more transparent.  We certainly do not want to see a situation where it is left to the authority of SUSI to define the standards.  Where those standards are too high, the Minister and the Department should be free to administer guidelines in that regard.  Certainly, in the case of establishing estrangement or independence from parents, the standards are far too high.  SUSI has a massive labour force and it seems to us that staff are essentially given a party line.  They are told, for example, that if a student wants to prove estrangement, he or she must do X, Y and Z and there is no flexibility in it.  Instead, in these types of cases, any evidence that it is possible to provide should be considered.  When SUSI has been challenged on this issue, it has claimed it will accept any evidence.  However, in our experience, that is not what is happening when students initiate the assessment process.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. David Duffy, chief executive of AIB, who is accompanied by Mr. Mark Bourke, chief financial officer, Mr. Bernard Byrne, director of retail and business banking, and Mr. Brendan O'Connor, head of the financial solutions group.  The format of the meeting will be that Mr. Duffy will make some opening remarks.  In advance of the meeting, we collected questions from members of the committee and submitted these to AIB.  I thank Mr. Duffy and his staff for responding in writing to these, which we received on Monday.  The responses have been distributed to members.  Together with the input of our witnesses today, I hope that all the key topics will have been covered.  Nonetheless, a question and answer session will follow to clarify any matters after Mr. Duffy has made his opening statement.</p> <p>  Before I proceed further, I express the committee's regret to Mr. Duffy and his staff that his opening statement and answers to the committee questionnaire were given, unknown to the committee, to the media before he had an opportunity to discuss them in person with the committee today.

Once again I thank the committee for providing AIB with this platform to give the Oireachtas and, ultimately, the public a detailed update on the bank&rsquo;s progress.  This is my fifth opportunity since I became AIB&rsquo;s chief executive to meet this committee and, as the committee knows, it is likely to be my final meeting.  I am sure the committee will have some support with that, but I have enjoyed these meetings and the dialogue we have had here.  The meetings over the past three years have been robust, but always constructive.  These engagements allowed my team and me to explain as openly and frankly as possible our strategy to stabilise the bank and ultimately to move to a position of sustainability.  Our discussions with the committee informed and helped frame our subsequent decision-making.  We did not always necessarily agree but we have held a common goal to rebuild AIB from its distressed state after the crisis into a profitable bank equipped to support the Irish economy, to prioritise professional service for our customers and, over time, to seek to return to the Irish taxpayers the support they provided in such large measure.   My colleagues have been introduced by the Chairman so I will not repeat those introductions.</p> <p>  I am prepared to leave AIB in the confidence that the management team will continue to lead the bank towards delivering our strategic objectives, putting our customers at the heart of our business and playing a pivotal role in Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery.  After a period of transformation over the past three years, the bank&rsquo;s financial performance has improved, with profits before tax in 2014 of &euro;1.1 billion.  The bank&rsquo;s impaired loan balances have been reduced by 23% to &euro;22.2 billion during the year and lending approvals stand at over &euro;13 billion.  Progress has been made in reducing mortgage arrears with a 22% reduction in arrears for private dwelling homes in Ireland in 2014 and the bank is in a position for the first time to make a &euro;280 million cash payment to the State on the preference shares.</p> <p>  AIB&rsquo;s recovery over the past number of years has had to be a fine balancing act.  Most obvious, it had to be done in tandem with implementing solutions for customers in financial difficulties while protecting taxpayers&rsquo; capital and, at all times, attempting to return the financial metrics of the bank to sustainable levels both in terms of margin and the bank&rsquo;s cost base.  It is particularly appropriate that AIB has this forum, at this time, to set out its perspective in terms of a number of issues that are currently the subject of widespread public debate.  We have already sent the committee detailed responses to its advance queries but I would like to highlight a number of issues. </p> <p>  Let me begin with the mortgage interest rate charges and, in particular, the standard variable rate.  First and foremost, let me explain that AIB&rsquo;s mortgage pricing reflects consideration of a number of points, the first being the cost of risk attached to a loan.  The impact of the recession on the mortgage market in Ireland triggered one of the highest loan arrears and default rates in Europe and, unfortunately, as a result, the level of risk in lending to Irish mortgage customers is proportionally higher than the rest of Europe and has to be factored into our pricing decisions.  Thankfully this cost of risk is declining as economic conditions improve and arrears levels reduce.  The bank remains focused on further reducing the level of arrears and impaired loans on its balance sheet in the coming period.</p><p> The operating costs of running AIB were &euro;1.4 billion in 2014.  This represents a reduction of &euro;350 million compared to 2012 levels, following a significant reduction in head count, general administrative costs and progress towards a more efficient operating model.  The bank remains focused on ensuring the group is run as efficiently as possible from a cost perspective, while ensuring its customer service levels are appropriate and its systems and processes are robust.</p><p>  Given its credit rating, the cost of funding for AIB is different to the simple average of other banks across Europe.  The narrative that AIB is able to fund itself at the ECB base rate is simply not the case and is an overly simplistic assessment of a much broader set of circumstances.  It is important to note that only 3% of AIB&rsquo;s funding is sourced from the ECB.  This is an important point to consider in regard to the debate later today.  The bank&rsquo;s funding costs have certainly improved over the past number of years and it remains focused on further reductions, based on market conditions.</p><p> On the need to generate sustainable and viable returns for shareholders, AIB as a commercial and systemically important institution must ensure that lending is at sustainable rates to ensure it is able to generate a return for shareholders but also to rebuild its capital in order to insulate against any future adverse shocks.  AIB&rsquo;s net interest margin in 2014 of 1.69%, excluding ELG costs, increased in the year, but was still below average bank levels across Europe.  Given AIB is currently 99.8% owned by the State, the majority of any profits generated by the bank are ultimately to the benefit of the State.  In incorporating lessons learned from the recent painful past, the bank cannot return to a situation where its lending decisions are being undertaken on any basis other than a medium to long-term view of sustainability and viability.</p><p> Over the past number of years, the bank has worked to improve all of these metrics in the context of creating a sustainable business model capable of supporting economic recovery while also seeking to create an investable model so that over time the bank can start to return capital to the State.  As a result of the bank&rsquo;s underlying positive performance and improvements in funding costs and the cost of risk, in December 2014, AIB, EBS and Haven implemented a number of reductions to mortgage rates.  For example, the move meant savings of approximately &euro;330 per annum for customers with a mortgage of &euro;200,000 on a 25 year term.  If a customer with a similar mortgage chose to move to a two or three year fixed rate option of 3.8%, this would have resulted in savings of &euro;800 per annum.  Importantly, the reductions we implemented benefitted both new and existing customers.</p><p> Further rate reductions for AIB customers, existing and new, are something that my team and I continue to consider.  However, it is critical to bear in mind just where this bank has come from.  In just over a three year period, AIB has moved from reporting multi-billion euro losses to &euro;1.1 billion in profit in 2014 - into profit for the first time in a number of years.  Considering all of the factors outlined, when the appropriate opportunity arose late last year, we moved to cut variable mortgage interest rates for our customers.  We must maintain a balance between securing the bank&rsquo;s present and future financial health, preserving and building capital to fuel the economy and repaying the State the sums invested in the bank, while all the time providing our customers with appropriate and sustainable lending rates in the market. </p><p> The bank is carefully monitoring the variable components that influence interest rates and will act accordingly in favour of our customers on mortgage rates.  We did so after looking at the facts involving all of the elements I have outlined in this letter.  There is no ECB rate.  It is just not relevant to AIB and we are not funding at some cheap rate in Europe.  That is just 3% of our funding.  We have a much higher funding rate and in addition we have the cost of risk and the cost of running the bank.  We can only charge a rate above those costs if we are to maintain a margin.  If we charge below those costs, we will have a loss making bank.  Previous tracker rates are an example of that, where the cost of funding, the risk cost and the management of the bank costs were higher than the rates charged on tracker mortgages.  We do not want to go to that place again.</p><p> That said, as we looked at the four elements to which I referred earlier, the last variable rate cut we made was when we looked at those elements and asked whether if we made a rate cut we would still maintain a position of sustainable profitability in the bank.  If so, we could pass on that rate cut to our customers.  Our principles have been to run the bank on a commercially viable basis, with sustainable profitability and yet to be fair and equitable in the treatment of our customers.  That is how we arrived at our decision of December 2014.  As we look at the variables, we see a continuing positive trend this year.  We will consider those four variables and if we see that trend continue over the next couple of months, towards our half year financial year, we will consider making a further rate cut.  However, that will be decided on the basis of those variables, cost of funding, our cost to manage the bank and our risk operating costs.  If all of those costs reduce, as they have in the past, we will be willing to consider another rate cut in the next couple of months.  We will look at our financial performance in that window.</p><p> This completes my additional supplement, which I make for the sake of clarity, as our position seems to have been defined in the media.  I would rather it be clear today, but we can discuss it further.</p><p> I also want to refer to the question of mortgage arrears.  Apart from dealing with the commercial impact of distressed loans on the bank&rsquo;s balance sheet, we absolutely share concerns at the societal consequences of the ongoing difficulties associated with legacy debt.  Reflecting this concern, our trained staff deal with customers who continue to experience financial stress and we work tirelessly to arrive at sustainable solutions that will allow them to emerge from arrears.  I have said it many times before and reiterate again today that AIB aims to keep people in their homes where possible, if customers engage with us.  With that as our primary motive, we have put in place what we believe to be the most comprehensive set of permanent arrears solutions in the market.  Where there is no affordability of any form of mortgage repayment, a loss of ownership may be the appropriate solution, but we believe we have a pragmatic approach to residual debt, recognising that one cannot restructure where there is no affordability. </p><p> We have engaged with third party channels such as the IMHO for those customers who feel they cannot come directly to the bank.  We pause the legal process when customers engage with us and enter a sustainable restructuring arrangement.  While we have much more to do, the success of this approach is borne out in our most recent set of results, with overall arrears levels in our mortgage portfolio in the Republic reducing by 18% in 2014 and owner-occupier arrears falling by 22% and buy-to-let arrears down by 7%.</p><p> Similarly, as we seek to protect employment and viable businesses, solid progress was achieved for non-mortgage customers who typically have exposures across a number of asset classes, including SME debt, associated properties and buy-to-let mortgages.  At the end of last year, a total of &euro;4.7 billion of non-mortgage loans were subject to forbearance and we continue to constructively engage to offer restructures to our customers in 2015.  The improving economic climate in Ireland is translating into an increased appetite for credit, with growth in the personal, business and corporate banking segments of the market.  In 2014, we approved over &euro;13 billion of lending in Ireland and our lending draw downs to our customers were 42% higher than the previous year, including our mortgage and business customers.  We continue to have capacity to lend and we remain focused on supporting our customers, jobs and the broader Irish economy.  These figures are reflective not only of the improving economic backdrop in our main markets of Ireland and the UK but also speaks to the underlying ability of the bank to lend prudently to our customers in the future. </p><p> While the bank has made enormous progress in recent years, we are planning for the challenges that lie ahead.  We continue to focus on rebuilding the trust and confidence of our customers and improving customer service levels.  We have previously indicated that we are in discussions with the Department of Finance over the future capital structure of the bank and while I am not in a position to discuss this in any detail, these considerations are continuing.</p><p> On behalf of AIB, I want to express thanks to the committee for inviting us here today and for the huge support the State has given this bank.  On a personal level, I want to acknowledge the help of the Oireachtas in the course of my work as chief executive of AIB over the past three years.  The bank will continue to approach with vigour the challenges ahead.  As a public company with a commercial mandate, AIB has to balance the requirement of generating value for our shareholders, most principally the Irish taxpayer, with the requirements of our customers who also need the support of the bank.</p><p> In summary, AIB today is a profitable business, generating capital for shareholders.  It has received EU approval for its restructuring plan, has passed the ECB stress tests, is reducing arrears levels and overall levels of impaired loans and is well positioned from a funding, capital and liquidity perspective to prudently lend over time and support the country&rsquo;s economic recovery.  We look forward to any questions.</p></speech>

Three weeks ago, Fianna F&aacute;il, as an Opposition party, dedicated its Private Members' time in the D&aacute;il to a full debate on the issue of variable mortgage rates.  I will put a number of matters to Mr. Duffy to which I ask him to respond.  </p> <p>  Most people on a variable rate mortgage understand that the interest rate they pay will move in line with market conditions.  When conditions are bad, they expect the rate to increase and when they improve, they expect the rate to reduce.  The standard variable rate is not like the tracker rate, which is linked to the rate set by the European Central Bank.  There are approximately 300,000 variable rate mortgage customers in Ireland, of whom approximately 140,000 are with Allied Irish Banks.  These customers are paying far in excess of the variable rates charged elsewhere in the eurozone where the average variable rate is 2.09%.  AIB is not the worst offender in this regard and the bank has reduced its rates recently.  I commend it on reducing its variable rate for existing and new customers, especially as some other banks have existing customers paying a standard variable rate of 4.5%.  These banks will be challenged on that matter. </p> <p>  The cost of funds to Allied Irish Banks is declining and currently stands at 1.57% according to the bank's figures.  Its net interest margin is increasing and currently stands at 1.69%.  Will Mr. Duffy take us through the sources of AIB's funds and the cost of each source?  Customer accounts provide 63% of the bank's funding.  What is the cost of this saver and deposit base?</p></speech>

I will provide some context for Mr. Bourke.  To put this in simple business terms, the way we look at this as a business is that one has a cost of risk.  Even in good times, one has mortgages that do not work and different kinds of loan defaults.  One then has the running costs to the bank and the costs of the funds one acquires.  These three costs need to be considered when one tunes to one's total cost.  That is normal business.  The bank then charges a rate for its product.  If one looks across Allied Irish Banks, we have those three costs.  As I stated, the European Central Bank rate is simply not relevant because we only source 3% of funding from the ECB.  When we add up the three costs to which I referred and then look at the rates across all our products, we arrive at a figure of 1.6% for the net interest margin, which is at the lower end of the average among our peers.</p> <p>  I want to provide context by stating that we are not trying to get to the point of making tremendous profits for a shareholder valuation.  We are looking for sustainable profitability and wish to be fair.  As was the case with the previous cut, if these costs come down, we will try to contribute by giving a rate cut to our mortgage customers. </p> <p>  Mr. Bourke will provide the science of how this builds up to provide some clarity for the Deputy. </p></speech>

We have other debt and subordinated liabilities which amount to about &euro;3.5 billion and &euro;18.6 billion, respectively.  We then have deposits by other banks, which stand at a <i>de minimus</i>level of about &euro;300 million.  All of this adds up to the 1.57% figure.  The important issue on which we must concentrate is that the difference between the yield on our loans, in other words, the rate at which we lend, and these costed funds is about 1.33%.  Approximately 70% of this is to cover cost.  In a normalised world, another 20% of that would be a normalised cost of risk.  The remainder is our sustainable profit level.</p></speech>

One has to look at this as a total of our assets and lending.  What is, on the one hand, the blended rate at which we charge out and what is the blended cost of funds?

Our cost of funds has declined from 1.70% to 1.57% over the past year.

Encouraging switcher activity at the front end through very cheap forward rates is not where we want to be at.  One of the driving forces behind the change we made in December was to make sure we benefited front book and back book customers.  The change meant our existing customer base got the benefit of the reduction.  That philosophy is one we will take into anything else we do from a pricing point of view in order that we are fair to the entire customer base.  It is much easier to put out an attractive rate in the front of the market and not suffer the cost into the back book.</p><p>Our view is that we should try to be fair to all our customers, whether they have been with us for a long time or just about to come to us, so that the customer will know what he or she will get.  In regard to switcher activity, our objective is to make sure that people know what they will get.  It is a choice as to whether the customer moves to us or not.  We are very open to it</p></speech>

Mr. Duffy mentioned three components of mortgage pricing - cost of funding, the overhead costs of the bank and the cost of risk.</p></speech>

The Deputy has outlined the three costs but the fourth is the rate one sets for one's products, that is, the income, but the other three are the costs.</p></speech>

That would not be the norm.  Why is the fixed rate lower than the variable rate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1173" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Byrne" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042200002#D01000"><p>We implemented that change in December.  With a brand new product, a new offering in effect, one can secure marginal funding for it because it is a new funding cost.  We were able to pass on the benefit in respect of that.  At some points in time, the variable rate is lower and at other times, the fixed rate is lower.  The reasons that people opt for fixed rates are certainty of cost and to secure cash when things are tight.</p></speech>

Ultimately, banks effectively make the fixed rate higher than the variable rate to factor in some element of risk.  The fact is that one can get a loan on a fixed rate of interest at a price ranging  from 3.5%.  The lowest differential is 0.75%.  Is it fair to say that AIB expects the rate to come down?</p></speech>

We do not control all the elements so one does not know, but we would say that based on what we know, we would expect the trend to be positive.  Our two year fixed rate is at 3.8% and all of our existing customers can switch.  When we look forward, we would expect the rates to be better.</p></speech>

There is no difference between the fixed and the variable rates.  The cost of funding has definitely come down.  Am I correct that in January 2015, AIB raised &euro;750 million at a cost of 0.625% and in March 2015 the bank raised &euro;500 million at 1.375%?  Both rates are a good bit lower than the current 1.57% cost of funding that the bank uses at present.  AIB has been restructured significantly and the rate of 1.57% that the bank is quoting for the cost of funding is basically the 2014 rate for the cost of funding.  We represent the ordinary person who goes to the bank and sees that a fixed rate mortgage rate is lower than or equal to the variable rate, which on the face of it does not appear to make sense unless the bank knows that the rates are going to drop and they are possibly taking profit from the variable mortgages at the variable mortgage holder's expenses.</p> <p>  The bank is raising funds in 2015 at significantly lower rates than applied in 2014.  I cannot see why AIB Bank needs to wait until the announcement of the results for the first six months when it is clearly evident that the bank has factored in that the rates are coming down and the restructuring costs have come down.  We meet ordinary people who have mortgages.  A situation can arise where a number of people have the same level of mortgage, which is not very large, and the person on a variable rate may be paying &euro;300 to &euro;600 more per month than the person on the tracker mortgage.  Mr. Duffy wants to be transparent and fair and my question is why AIB does not reduce the rate now.</p></speech>

It is not just the funding rate; it is the cost to the bank and the cost of risk.  We need to see a little bit of confidence in all three of those factors, because they can change every quarter.  It is only a month or two since December 2014 when we cut a rate.  We are only five months into it.</p></speech>

All our existing customers can switch to that rate which would be a very significant saving right now and they can do so today.  We contact our customers and explain that to them.  We are trying to manage the transition in the very short term as we have outlined.  If all of our variable costs are coming down as we manage them and not all of them are within our control, we will pass on that rate cut to our customers and that is the principles we have set out to borrowers.</p></speech>

In 2014, AIB raised money at 2.33% and 2.75%, raising a total of &euro;1 billion in the two bids.  In 2015, AIB has raised a total of &euro;1.25 billion, of which &euro;750 million was raised at 0.625% in January and &euro;500 million was raised at 1.375% in March.  AIB has control over the restructuring costs and the cost of funding is definitely coming down.  I would contend that risk is also coming down.</p> <p>  I wish to make a point to Mr. Bourke.  He said the bank does not provide specific detail on the margins the bank makes on mortgage holders, yet Mr. Duffy states the rate the bank charges is based on factoring in risk from mortgage holders.  One cannot have it both ways.  One cannot say in one breath that the bank does not provide the information and at the same time say that the rate AIB charges is based on the risk that it factored in. </p> <p>  I have two questions for Mr. Duffy.  First, can we take it that there will be a reduction in the mortgage interest rate sooner rather than later?  Second, will he indicate if he has a figure for the risk factor in terms of the mortgage holder?</p></speech>

On the specific question of interest rates, if we see the variables change and continue to change through our actions and through market actions, then in the short term we expect to be able to make a rate cut.  That is as specific as I can be - that is short term.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Bourke to take the Deputy through those matters.  I want to make one comment, however, and that is that we have to be very careful.

When we look at &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.5 billion at a lower rate, that is contributing on an ongoing basis to a decrease in the cost of funding.  It is very marginal.  If one looks at the figures for last year, one will see our total debt issued at &euro;8 billion.  The cost went from 3.63% to 3.49%.</p><p>It is very gradual and the effect is marginal.

We run the bank on a commercial basis at arm's length from the shareholder.  The decisions on cost and pricing are ours and nobody else's.  The cost of risk is an input, but it is an observed input in the marketplace.  When we examined the three cost elements mentioned and, therefore, the pricing of our products, we made the decisions.  Where we have seen improvements in the three cost elements, we have passed them on to our customers.  That is exactly how the model works.</p></speech>

Property prices are increasing rapidly, while rent costs are spiralling.  Part of the problem is on the supply side.

One of the key issues is the availability of equity from third parties because the developers may not have it.  A significant portion of the equity which traditional developers or builders had was eroded as a result of the economic crisis.  We have learned the lessons from the crisis and the banks are putting proper structured debt arrangements in place, which reflect the appropriate amount of debt that can be taken.  We will not put equity in or have equity-like instruments for such financing.  Debt financing is generally considered to be available if one can put a structure together.  </p> <p>  The second element which causes challenges for availability on the equity side is the uncertainty around some of the rest of the development pipeline and the time involved.  The picture is complex.  We have a &euro;500 million fund available and are keen to deal with the issue.  A significant number of developers have made good progress with us.  We do not think the debt side presents a challenge, but we need a capital structure.  The banks will not get back into the provision of the entire capital structure, as was the case in the previous economic cycle.  Therefore, equity needs to be available.</p></speech>

It is not just about senior debt lending for property or equity because there is also the issue of planning permission.  It is not something one can kick-start particularly quickly as one has to obtain planning permission first.  It is often modified planning permission because a development that may have been envisaged four or five years ago is not the one that would sell today.</p></speech>

I notice that, even though the figures are still quite low, the level of repossessions, including voluntary surrenders, has gone up substantially in the past few years.  I get the impression that we might have been in a phoney war for the last 18 months, whereas now we are moving into its last stages.  As I am sure the delegates understand, having read all of the reports in the media, there is huge concern, particularly about the number of repossession cases before the courts.  We are facing what has been called a "tsunami of repossessions".  They mainly involve family homes, but I would like to spend some time talking about the buy-to-let market also.</p> <p>  I am looking at AIB's own numbers for the actions it has before the courts.  I speak regularly to a lot of people dealing with clients in distress and can say AIB is not the worst by any means and that where there is engagement between a financial institution and its borrowers in a way that is fairer than that engaged in by other financial institutions, it should be acknowledged. </p> <p>  Question No. 43 deals with the level of write-downs.  The delegates say they cannot distinguish between residential mortgages for principal dwellings and buy-to-lets in terms of write-downs.  According to my quick calculations, the number of residential mortgage write-downs in 2014 versus the number of surrenders works out at just above 40%.  Is it be accurate to say AIB offers write-downs in approximately 40% of cases concluded with a voluntary repossession?</p></speech>

There was a lot of misrepresentation in the media this morning.  Mr. O'Connor will speak about what is actually happening in the courts and then deal with the Senator's question about discounts.</p></speech>

When a write-off actually happens has a lot to do with when a property is sold because there is no certainty until then.  We may agree to a write-off, but that may not be reflected in the numbers until the write-off actually happens.  These are a set of financial accounts rather than a reflection of all of the agreements that may be in train with customers at any given time.  The number of 40% does not hold true, but neither do we disclose what the number is.</p></speech>

It looks like it has offered a write-down in approximately 41% of cases.</p> <p>  Nearly 10,000 of the bank's buy-to-let loans are in arrears for more than 90 days.  In Question No. 57 it is stated the bank appoints receivers for buy-to-let properties in certain circumstances and honours the former lease and the PRTB rules and regulations in the residential tenancies Act.  I have raised this issue on a number of occasions and there is a lot of concern about the activities of receivers appointed for buy-to-let mortgages.  I accept that the bank does honour leases, as it should under the law, the PRTB rules and the regulations in the residential tenancies Act, but does it have any service level agreement with the receivers appointed by it covering how they behave, particularly towards tenants?  We are aware of tenants being treated appallingly.</p></speech>

As we have a small group of receivers, we can ensure there is consistent interaction between us and the receiver and between the receiver and the tenant, if one is involved.  We review these service level agreements on a regular basis.  Receivers are aware of our protocol that if a formal lease is in place, we honour it and that where there is no formal lease in place, we give people the maximum notice period allowable under the Act, regardless of their tenancy arrangements.  Therefore, if they are only in the building six months, we use the longest notice period in the graduated scale which is, I believe, 118 days.</p></speech>

We have made our mistakes which we try to resolve as best we can, but our policy is to identify if there is a tenant and communicate what we can within the bounds of the law.  There are privacy and confidentiality issues as regards the borrower, but we certainly aim to put the tenant on notice.</p></speech>

I was also struck by his comment on the use of legal action to bring reluctant borrowers to the table.</p><p> I want to ask Mr. Duffy a further question.  There is a narrative that were it not for the courts, we would still have people swanning off on three holidays a year, not engaging with the process and so on.  I personally think that is way overstated.  Mr. Duffy appears to be agreeing that in some instances, legal actions seems to bring people to the table in a way that other activities on AIB's part have not.  On AIB's relationship with the IMHO, overall, in terms of the number of court actions, AIB's numbers are reasonably low in comparison with some other lenders.  Does Mr. Duffy think that having the IMHO as a body independent of the bank has been helpful for borrowers who may be fearful of engaging with a lending institution?</p></speech>

That is why we introduced the IMHO, whereby the person can go, not to the bank, but indirectly to somebody else who would represent their interests.  In answer to the Senator's question, I believe it has been very helpful to have that independent body which represents more of a consumer-friendly interest, and to then engage with us in trying to sort something out.  That has been very successful.</p> <p>  The other issue that was raised was the tsunami of repossessions.  That was misrepresented in the media today.  For anybody to be in the position where we are in a court repossession discussion or in the court process would require them to not have engaged or repaid us anything in a number of years.  In those cases, significant numbers will not end up in repossession territory at all because I think we have about 50% who re-engage.</p></speech>

We are actively seeking an adjournment in 50% of cases where there is a court date because we have had re-engagement.  At certain stages in the process, we tend to get re-engagement and, certainly after we give the regulatory letters, we get re-engagement of about 50% at every stage.  We actually have 800 people in the court process at the moment who are on a test period, so while they will appear in the legal numbers, they have re-engaged.  They are on a test payment period and when that test payment period is over, we would expect them to come out of the legal process.  We have brought 2,000 people back from more than two years in arrears who are no longer in arrears when, previously, they would have been in the legal process.  It does drive an intensity of engagement and our observation is that it leads strongly to people coming back to the table.</p></speech>

I want to start by recognising some things that the bank has achieved and has done.  First, I want to recognise the improved performance of the bank.  A noticeable turnaround has been achieved by the bank, by the management of the bank and, no doubt, by all of the employees of the bank over the last few years.  As the owners of the bank, I think we need to recognise there has been a very significant turnaround.  I would like to also recognise the introduction of the debt-for-equity product.  I know the numbers are still small but my understanding is that they are growing and it is obviously something we raised at the committee some time ago.  AIB's look at the post-retirement period is also something that was raised at this committee and was something AIB acted on, which was very welcome.</p> <p>  The JV with the IMHO is very welcome and I am glad to hear that Mr. Duffy considers it a success.  AIB also deserves recognition for a progressive approach to residual debt in comparison to one bank in particular, Bank of Ireland, and maybe some of the others.  I think AIB has taken a progressive approach to this.  While I do not want to put words in his mouth, I am delighted to hear Mr. Duffy say today that the bank would not have anything to fear from moving from a three-year to a one-year bankruptcy period.  That is also very welcome.</p> <p>  Does AIB have a current market cap value on the bank?</p></speech>

I took a look back at October 2012 when we had this conversation at the finance committee.  AIB's rate was 3.5% and it has gone up to &euro;4.15%, so it has gone up by 65 basis points.  At the same time, the ECB rate has come down by 70 basis points.  I appreciate it is only 3% of the funding but, at the same time, risk has obviously fallen dramatically for a variety of reasons, including the significant increase in house values, operating costs are down, provisioning requirements are down and, I imagine, there will be a significant rewind this year.  I think it was Bank of Ireland that had a &euro;280 million release of provisioning, so I presume AIB will also have a reduction in provisioning.  Obviously, with quantitative easing happening, the direct cost from the ECB at only 3% is minimal in terms of leverage but wholesale funding is falling across the eurozone.  Therefore, if all of the drivers of cost bar one seem to have fallen significantly at the same time that the variable rate has increased significantly, is it reasonable to conclude that the sole driver of the increase in the variable rate is to drive shareholder funding?</p></speech>

The answer would be that, no, there is not a sole driver.  If the Deputy looks at the funding we have at 3% from the ECB, which is so limited that it does not materially affect our rate, if he looks at what Mr. Bourke said earlier about the marginal cost of our funding having improved, but very marginally in its totality over that period, and if he looks at the fact we have reduced our costs but we have further to go on that, taking all of that together, four months ago we made a reduction based on what we have been able to achieve thus far, and we are looking in the next couple of months at considering something similar.  There is no sole driver.</p></speech>

I am going back further, to October 2012.  The variable mortgage rate is now significantly higher than it was in October 2012, so AIB's mortgage rate has gone up but all of the drivers of cost associated with that have gone down.  On the basis that the rate has gone significantly up and the costs have gone significantly down, is it fair to say the only reason the mortgage rate has gone up, while all of the bank's costs are going down, is that it is being driven by shareholder funds, which is the only remaining driver Mr. Duffy has identified?</p></speech>

In that sense, we had to get the business back to profitability.  Yes, it is down to not eroding shareholder funds or having an unsustainable bank.</p></speech>

I appreciate the witnesses have stated that blended margin, or the average net margin for the bank, is below industry standard.  Let us say the variable rate is 4.15%.  The last report we have for the blended cost of funding for the bank was 1.57%, and while it is probably slightly lower now, let us use that.  That would suggest the margin on variable rates is about 2.7 percentage points.  Does Mr. Duffy know if that is higher than, lower than or at about industry norms for the eurozone?</p></speech>

We must remember that is one element of the cost, which is comparable in the eurozone, but there is then the cost of risk, which is significantly more expensive than the eurozone, and then there are the operating costs.</p><p>Those are all of the elements that come to the margin between the cost and the rate one charges.</p></speech>

I cannot give the Deputy the comparative data with other countries for this specific book but what one is seeing is the reflection of the cost to serve and the cost of risk which is actually better but is historically far worse in this country for a number of reasons specific to it.</p></speech>

AIB has 50% of the entire standard variable mortgage market.  These mortgage holders are not interested in whether the net margin for the bank overall is reasonable but if the net margin on variable rate mortgages is reasonable.  I have no idea whether it is or it is not.  On the same basis that the bank was able to tell the committee that the net margins across all of its banking activities are below the industry norm, will the bank come back to the committee to let us know how that 2.7 percentage point margin on the variable rate mortgage compares to others?  If it is competitive, then fair enough.  However, it may not be competitive and those with variable rate mortgages would like to know that.</p></speech>

The closest example is the UK marketplace, a marketplace in which we operate so we are very familiar with it.  The average standard variable rate in the UK is 4.85%.  Obviously, the base rate is 50 basis points, meaning there is a slightly higher base rate.  The actual customer rate for a standard variable mortgage is 4.85%.</p></speech>

It could be that they view the rate we have offered as declinatory, namely a rate that is damaging to their business.  In such cases, they have the option of going to the Credit Review Office.</p> <p>  I am not aware of instances where that has been the case, however.  Normally, if someone was uncomfortable with our credit decision, they could appeal to us first, as we have a separate independent internal process.  In the event they were uncomfortable with the decision at that point, they could then go to the Credit Review Office.  The number of appeals that go to the office is very small.  Over the past four years, out of 150,000 SME credit decisions made by all banks, fewer than 1,000 have gone to the Credit Review Office.

The only criterion we use is how much somebody can pay.  Is there enough there to structure a sustainable mortgage solution?  We do not go into matters of policy but affordability for the individual in question.  There is always an individual set of circumstances in such cases.</p> <p>  If somebody has some level of affordability that allows for a mortgage restructure, we have a product to allow that to happen.  Where someone does not have it, we have a process which allows a voluntary sale for loss and will not pursue the residual debt.  The only way we can sustain a restructure is if we have the customer&rsquo;s information, that they are willing to talk to us and willing to make a payment in line with affordability.</p> <p>  Those with mortgages over 720 days in arrears represent a large cohort.  In AIB, 60% of those have made no payment at all, which represents 7,000 accounts.  If that is their maximum affordability, it will not be possible for us to restructure the mortgage.  Our responsibility is to help the customer exit the property and we will not go after the residual debt if it is not there.  We actually can do nothing unless we have that level of engagement.</p> <p>  All of the statistics for mortgage arrears relate to accounts.  When one sees 10,000 accounts, this is most typically 8,000 properties.  It is usually 1.25 to 1.5 accounts per property due to top-up loans on mortgages.</p></speech>

Last year, we had a net writeback of &euro;188 million.  All of the backdrop economics are an improvement on this.  I would expect it to be in excess of that figure for 2015.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1285" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042200002#H01500"><p>Last year, &euro;76 million of that &euro;188 million was for mortgage accounts and the other was broken down between the other headings.  The bank is now expecting a higher level of writeback.  In layman&rsquo;s English, the bank overprovided for bad debts on those mortgage accounts for &euro;76 million in 2014 and will have a higher figure for 2015.  Essentially, it will be &euro;150 million that the bank has presumed it might not get back.  I know the bank changed the factors regarding house prices from their drop from the peak.  There is a minimum of &euro;150 million of overprovision for mortgage losses in the bank&rsquo;s figures for 2014 and 2015.  Variable interest rate mortgage holders pay for this overprovision.  The bank has been excessively hard on the variable mortgage rate holders with that level of overprovision.  It has overstated how bad these accounts were and has penalised them accordingly.</p></speech>

When we provide for mortgages, it is across the full volume of mortgages on the basis of that peak to trough drop.  If that improves - there has been an improvement in the market - we will have overprovided and it writes back.  As long as the economy keeps getting better, one will get a better result on these provisions.</p> <p>  However, the second point does not necessarily follow.  The fact that we have provided is the critical issue for us to be able to tackle borrowers in distress.  If we have provided, then essentially we have the facility to restructure and in many cases write off the debt.</p></speech>

It is clear this year it will be higher because the house price fall from the peak will improve this year.</p><p>It is inevitable that there will be another increase this year and Mr. Bourke is changing his assumptions.  His assumptions may have been valid at the time, but in light of current experience, they are a little severe.  I ask that some of the write-back he is giving on mortgage accounts be given to those mortgage holders on the variable rate.  That is a request.  He can take it or leave it because my time is limited.  I can discuss it with him but I think he gets my message.</p></speech>

The bank targeted the buy-to-let market with tracker mortgages, and everyone knows the profitability on the variable rate is much higher than on the tracker, so the bank is losing more money on the tracker-----</p></speech>

Only 3% of the bank's funding comes from the European Central Bank funding rates but it has much more than that out on tracker mortgages on its buy-to-let side.  The variable mortgage rate customer is carrying not just the loss of owner-occupiers with tracker mortgages but also an excessive cost of tracker mortgages on the buy-to-let side, of which the bank has a disproportionate amount.</p> <p>  The bank wrote off &euro;461 million last year on residential mortgages.  It seems to be saying it will write off the negative equity.</p> <p>  This is my last question.  Mr. Bourke said the bank is in a position to make a &euro;280 million cash payment to the State.  In view of the fact that the bank is still overcharging its customers, is it not premature to be making that payment to the State, which is on the back of its mortgage holders?  I believe it is premature.  When will it make that payment and for what reason?  Has the bank been asked by the Government to make a payment or is it doing it to keep in with the Minister?</p></speech>

I have five quick questions which they might take together, if they will bear with me.  First, would the bank be open to third-party review of the applicable standard variable rate in circumstances where a consumer can demonstrate that this rate is inflicting hardship in their circumstances?  Would there be a role for an external agency to arbitrate in this matter as it applies to individual borrowers in much the same way as the Credit Review Office assists small and medium businesses with credit challenges?  This would be in an extreme case.  I salute what the bank has done but are there some cases where an independent, objective assessment would assist?</p> <p>  Second, on repossessions, I appreciate what the witness said about 50% re-engagement.  That is tremendous, but what is the bank's practice on voluntary assisted sales where the home owner surrenders the house and assists in the disposal process?  Does the bank write off the balance of the debt once the asset has been sold?</p> <p>  Third, has the bank done any analysis of the people in persistent arrears where they are failing to engage with the bank?  That would be a hard core case.</p> <p>  Fourth, what is the total amount of the current level of loans in arrears where the bank expects to repossess the property?</p> <p>  Fifth, has AIB sold any of its non-performing loans to debt investors or vulture funds, as they are often known?  What steps has the bank taken to ensure customers are protected on such a transfer?  Those are my questions, and I am grateful to the witnesses.</p></speech>

He asked if we would mind having an independent review in terms of someone's rate.  We have a pre-arrears protocol.  If someone has difficulty with their mortgage today, whether that is from a rate or whatever caused it, under the Central Bank protocols, we have a pre-arrears unit, they can identify their difficulty and we will run the affordability.</p> <p>  In terms of an independent assessment, the only independent assessment of affordability would be done through the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI.  I suppose that is the only one that could look at someone's case and apply reasonable expenses guidelines to it.  We do that.  We also add between 20% to 25% on top of that.  An independent assessment of affordability could be done.  The one that exists today by proxy is the ISI, but we have a level of reasonable living expenses in excess of that.  Would I personally mind if there was an independent check of affordability?  No.  I have seen it suggested, and I do not think it is a bad idea at all.</p> <p>  Regarding voluntary assisted sales, where someone has no affordability post the sale of the property, we do not go after people for the residual debt.  There is not much point.  However, we do look at residual debt on the basis of affordability, so to the extent that someone can afford to make some payment to the residual, within those reasonable living expense guidelines etc., we will seek it, and typically a payment for a period that is less than the insolvency period.</p> <p>  The last question was whether I could give the Senator an estimate of the value of the arrears in terms of properties we will repossess.  I am afraid I cannot because at this stage I cannot tell him the number of properties I believe will ultimately end up in repossession.  It will be significantly less than what was reported in the newspapers this morning, if we consider the levels of engagement that take place.  The bank has said that where someone cannot afford their mortgage we will not go after them for the residual debt if they sell the property.  In effect, that is the outcome we get if a house goes to possession.  It makes more sense for the individual, the borrower and the bank to do that consensually and achieve that outcome rather than go through a possession process.  However, I would like to find out how many are in this queue that we can restructure, and that is why we try to get the re-engagement.</p></speech>

On the mortgage repossessions issue, most reasonable observers would agree that to have a functioning mortgage market the bank must have entitlement to enforce or realise its security, but I am sure the witnesses would agree that there are many desperate cases that need special attention.  They will be aware that the Government will shortly announce initiatives in this regard to support those who are still in mortgage arrears and in negative equity.  Have the witnesses had any engagement with the Department of Finance on this?  Has it sought any advice or have officials spoken to the witnesses about it?  Are there any specific areas they would like Government to examine?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned that with regard to voluntary disposals, in most cases they look at the financial status of the borrower and will write off on the basis of what that shows up, and perhaps write off all the residual debt after the sale of the property.  Do they engage with borrowers before it comes to that in terms of arriving at what is affordable for them if that meets what the property might achieve on an open market sale, perhaps write down the mortgage at that stage, allow them stay in their home and retain ownership of the property without having to agree to voluntary disposal?  Is that something in which they engage?</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming mentioned the bank's write-backs and write-downs.  Many of the losses generated in AIB and in the other banks were as a result of losses that crystallised when it had to sell some of its loans to NAMA, but there was significant provisioning as well.</p><p>Given the capital appreciation in property prices over recent years, I would have thought AIB would have significantly higher write-backs than &euro;150 million last year out of the total amount written down.  How does AIB arrive at a write-back?  Is that when a mortgage or property is finally sold and the price realised was higher than AIB expected?  Can AIB take a general view of its asset book and state that markets have improved significantly over recent years, the bank probably made too large a provision on its general loan books and take a figure there as opposed to realising individual write-backs when deals are settled?</p><p> In terms of AIB's engagement, I am sure other members received correspondence today from a lady in Waterford who is concerned about an agreement she had with the bank which was reneged upon in terms of legal action that is being taken against her.  She was distraught when I spoke to her this morning.  She asked me to raise that with AIB.  Although I do not want to get into the specifics, is Mr. O'Connor available to meet members on specific issues?</p><p> Following on Senator Hayden's point on receivership, the conduct of some receivers is an area about which I would be gravely concerned.  I wrote to the bank previously about one family in Galway which had fallen out with the bank and where receivers were appointed.  I refer to the figures in terms of what is being deducted from rents.  This is a buy-to-let situation and there were multiple properties.  Gross rents over a two-year period were close to &euro;400,000 but the amount credited back to their accounts was less than &euro;50,000.  Therefore, there were significant amounts being reduced.  They had made the case to the bank on several occasions that the return to the bank would be much stronger if they were allowed retain the management of the portfolio of assets.  I wrote to the bank about this.  I got a rather condescending response, not from the bank but from the bank's legal representatives, suggesting that I should have more interest in a return to the taxpayer than the borrower.  In this case, the proposals that were put to the bank would have resulted in a significantly better return for the bank and, ultimately, the taxpayer.  Is there an ability for us and these families to meet these bank representatives to engage?  Has the bank cases which have come out of receivership where the bank has allowed the individuals to manage the assets?  In the case I mention, there is no doubt it would result in a better return for the bank.</p></speech>

That is why we appoint the receivers.  It is because the cashflow has been diverted somewhere else.  I do not know the specifics of the case, but that is why we appoint receivers.  I cannot see any circumstance - I would like to know the detail - where &euro;400,000 would be the receivers' fees, but I can tell Deputy Walsh we have never paid a percentage in receivers' fees that even remotely approaches a number like that.  Absolutely, we are willing to engage on the circumstances of the case.</p> <p>  Deputy Walsh asked about engagement with Government initiatives on arrears.  We generally speak about it in the context of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, formerly known as the Irish Banking Federation, IBF.  I have seen some suggestions that are out there.  We have tried to be as constructive as possible.  We will support, both in the spirit and in the letter, whatever initiatives issue.  We deal with whatever legislation is in front of us and that is what we will do.  I am in favour of anything that constructively helps to resolve the arrears issue.

The week a borrower goes into arrears, he or she receives a letter informing him or her of being in arrears with a standard financial statement, SFS, which we ask him or her to fill out.  That is the process by which we judge affordability.  If we get an SFS, we will make an offer to the borrower based on the financial detail that come out of that.</p> <p>  Throughout the entire process, to the extent that the borrower does not follow that up, we send out another letter, known as a Provision 28 letter, which states that we need to keep this moving to the extent that if the borrower does not engage with us, we will have to deem him or her non-co-operating.  That is followed by what is called a P29 letter.  Approximately 50% of those who get a Provision 28 letter engage then.</p> <p>  A P29 letter states one is non-co-operating.  At that stage, approximately 50% of those who are still left in that bucket engage.  If a person has not engaged by then, at which point he or she has had a quite significant amount of time, he or she will go into the legal process.  Approximately 50% of the borrowers engage before it gets to civil bill stage, and after civil bill stage, as I stated earlier, in approximately 50% of the cases that go to court, we are actively seeking adjournments.</p> <p>  It is all about engagement.  We ourselves have various channels in the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation.  To the extent that one engages, one will get an offer.</p></speech>

The first is where we have worked through restructuring and one gets to an end point where we have visibility on cashflows and additional assets of the borrower.  In the second, where we have large portfolios, such as mortgages and personal lending, we estimate the change in market value through the peak-to-trough estimation and that drives a level of the write-backs.  The other side of it is the specifics that arise from each case, as Mr. O'Connor referred to.</p></speech>

He went on to state that only 3% of AIB's funding is sourced from the ECB.  Perhaps he could elaborate on the bank's credit rating when it goes to market to raise funds.  AIB is a profitable bank which has restructured and is working through bad loans.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to AIB going to market in early 2015 and how the cost of funds had dropped substantially over 2014, and it is likely, according to the bank, to drop further.  Is there someone out there who gives the bank a credit rating and how, for example, would that credit rating be impacted, adversely or otherwise, if it were felt that the bank was but a puppet bank to be manipulated by political considerations in terms of the range of issues that impact on individual customers of the bank?  I am conscious that I have four other questions and perhaps the witnesses could try to condense the replies as much as possible.</p></speech>

What would have driven our ratings over a long term is the history of the bank and, in particular, the fact that we have a singularly large proportion of non-performing loans versus the total loans that the banks have.  That means that our rating would be lower than the premium banks, for instance, across Europe, and that translates into our cost of funding when we issue debt securities in the markets.  Everyone's cost of funding has come down but ours is still consequently higher as we have lower ratings across the board as a result of our history.</p></speech>

Is there any indication?  The State, because of its improved credit rating, has been getting better deals for the taxpayer for State loans.  It has extended terms and has reduced interest rates.  Is AIB working aggressively to reposition itself?  Why is it that only 3% of AIB's funding is coming from that cheap source of funding at the ECB?  Can AIB restructure its loans and, therefore, impact positively on the cost of funding?</p></speech>

If there was less obligation to make a return to the shareholder or shareholders, would the bank be in a position to deliver more with regard to the standard variable rate?  One of the suite of options offered to mortgages in distress is mortgage-to-rent, and the bank clearly states there is zero take-up of this option.  To me this is very disappointing because in theory it is the best solution whereby people stay in their home.  They surrender ownership, which is painful, but they can remain in their home and pay rent according to capacity.  Given the &euro;220,000 threshold that applies, it is an option available to very few people in the greater Dublin area because of property prices.  Does the issue of value need to be significantly examined?</p></speech>

Since the report was issued on 31 December, three cases have been fully booked; another case is about cash received, which makes four; 27 are at the legal stage, which brings the total to 31; and another 253 are in progress, of which 132 are with housing associations to determine whether they wish to buy the property.  Much work was done in the fourth quarter by the housing bodies, banks and others.  It is still very complicated to try to simplify it, but the number has increased to 30 in recent months, with another 130 with housing associations to determine whether they wish to buy the house.  It has improved but it is still very complex.  For it to be more widespread, greater capital values are required and some of the rules about affordability and the various other rules attached would need to be reviewed.</p></speech>

Whether the State on a long-term basis has granted the benefit of tax losses to an entity or whether it has decided to upfront it, the State was going to have to write the cheque, and it has managed in effect to avoid this position.

By the time one gets to a write-down, it is two years after one started to restructure the loan.  In 2012 and 2013, when we stabilised customers and found out their sustainable earnings, we went through a process of engagement to come to an agreement and went through the legal and contractual write-down.  We get to the point of write-down 18 months to two years after this.  The bank has had a non-performing loan book of SMEs and mortgage customers and there is a process.  What we see in 2014 is the culmination and the manifestation on the balance sheet of work that began back in 2012 long before anyone had a timetable for any initial public offering, and it will continue into 2015 and 2016 as the work that began in 2013 works through the system.</p></speech>

I wish to make two observations.</p> <p>  Mr. Duffy described a number of factors that play into the overall decision-making process.  In terms of the interest rate that applied to variable mortgages, he said that operational costs were one of the factors.  How significant a portion of the overall decision-making process is represented by the bank's operational costs?  Does he regularly compare, with his peers across the eurozone, the bank's operational costs and analyse how they compare with others?  If so, how do they compare?  Is the bank at the point where there is no more latitude for its operational costs?   </p> <p>  My next few questions are perhaps more suited to Mr. O'Connor.  Earlier he described that most of the SMEs he engages with in Galway, that are in significant financial difficulty, diversified away from their core activity into property construction and management.  He said that he tries at all times to create a separation between those two entities so that the core business, if it is viable and sustainable on its own, continues to trade, survive and thus retains and protects the jobs already employed in that core business.  How distinct or distant is that separation?  Ultimately, one is talking about one or two individuals who are deeply involved in both activities.  Does the bank require, if the core business becomes substantially profitable, that some profits are diverted to the non-core business which is an asset that just sits there and is not worth a lot?  How does the mechanism work?  How is it determined which element of the core business's profits can be diverted towards the non-core construction activity?  </p></speech>

We benchmark it regularly against our competitors.  By any benchmark, one can see an improving trend.  Banks are moving, ever more aggressively, to reduce their costs in a continuum.  We will still continue to focus on ours and expect to be able to make further improvements.  That will continue.  My colleague shall comment on arrears.</p></speech>

We look at the totality of debt across a company which means it can be property and, as the Deputy is probably aware, it is pretty intertwined.  We will look at the sustainable debt at a point in time without any forecast saying the business will grow by between 10% and 20% for the next however length of time.  We will cut a loan at that level of sustainable debt.</p></speech>

One can assume some models but we have to forecast what it is going to look like.  We will cut a loan at that level and the company will service that loan.  We will also put in a "B" loan which will be the equivalent of equity.  The Deputy asked how does one make sure some profit is not diverted and how we assess same.  We do so by a very small piece which says, "If you do better we expect you to pay back that "B" loan."  Then we will have a "C" loan to which we will say, "To the extent that you are compliant with the "A" loan, and have paid it down like you said you would", then at the end of the period we will write-off the "C" loan.  That means the only recovery we have is through the "B" loan unless there is some excess on an asset sale, or something like that, and we contract that upfront.  All of that means that when a person gets their agreement he or she knows exactly what must be done with the "A" loan, he or she understands  exactly what the quasi equity piece looks like under the "B" loan and, under the "C" loan, he or she has a date that gets comprised to the extent that they he or she does not re-default or anything like that.  That is how we operate.</p></speech>

However, I acknowledge Mr. Duffy's office and AIB on the issue of cases that I brought to their attention.</p> <p>  I wish to give some credit to the comments made by Mr. O'Connor that AIB seems to take a more reasonable approach to people in mortgage arrears which I put down to the fact that it is 100% owned by the State.  Mr. Duffy has more or less acknowledged, in his statement, that because the bank's shareholder is the Government it is under more pressure to be a bit reasonable about these things in a way that some of the other banks that have come in here have not been.  I am sure they are very nice people too but that is not the point.  Certain other banks that have come in here have a very different attitude.  They do not give a damn what we or the Government thinks about priorities, dealing with distressed mortgage holders, rates and such like.  I welcome that fact.  </p> <p>  I am worried about influences on the bank.  Mr. Duffy said in his opening statement, in a number of different ways, that the other influences on the bank is "the need to generate sustainable and viable returns for shareholders" and, to use a particular phrase, "to create an investable model so that over time the bank can start to return capital to the State".  That is a euphemism for privatisation.  Am I correct?  We are talking about creating a model where the State disposes of its holdings in AIB which are sold off to private interests.  Is that the case?  </p></speech>

I want a system whose priorities are not solely about the bottom line and that its mandate is a bit more focused on the wider economy, keeping a roof over people's heads and all those kinds of things.  Is it the inevitable direction that the bank seems to be taking and which Mr. Duffy's speech indicated one where we will move away from that?</p></speech>

Given all the leaks today, I am not so sure.  However, I will be explicit.  Shareholder ownership does not decide how we run the bank.  I can tell the Deputy that explicitly and that I would not take the job if that were the case.  Let us be clear about that upfront.</p> <p>  The principles which we operated were much more than those based on one's shareholder.  They are about the long-term viability of this bank and this country, which starts with two things.  A sustainable profitability because one has to be able to generate capital in order to repay the State and to lend.  The lending was our biggest obligation on one level.  </p> <p>  The second thing we have articulated from the outset is to treat customers fairly.  If one does not do so then all of the other issues we have talked about is nonsense.  The bank will not be sustainable because one's customers will remember.  What we have said from the outset is to keep people in their homes who have distressed mortgages, wherever possible, and protect jobs in the SME world, wherever possible.  That is a lot of what we have talked about today.  There is no shareholder direction that gives us the answer.  If we do not do those two things then two generations of people will have a very negative view of this bank.  If we do them well, they will have a very positive view of this bank.</p><p>Our whole philosophy is not about whether we are owned or not by one group or another but about that issue.</p></speech>

I am not asking Mr. Duffy about his personal relationship with the Minister but about his working relationship in terms of what directions the Minister gives him.  The Government says it wants relief for variable interest rate mortgage holders and fairness for people in mortgage arrears but when we complain about the banks not offering such support, the Minister says there is nothing he can do about it because the banks are independent entities.  I want to try to square the circle.  What is the actual relationship?  How often do the Minister and bank representatives meet?  To what extent does the Minister ask the bank to do something about variable rate mortgages?  Could Mr. Duffy explain the nature of the relationship to us?</p></speech>

It is governed by a shareholder agreement, which creates independence for the bank in all commercial decisions.  That responsibility and those commercial decisions are the responsibility of the board of AIB.  Therefore, we engage with the Department of Finance, our shareholder, as with any shareholder, on all matters concerning the performance of the business but we make and have made all the decisions on commercial issues, including mortgages, increases and decreases, and the branch closures in the past, at board level in AIB and independently of our shareholder.  That is what the shareholder agreement defines as the operating model.</p></speech>

I banked with AIB for many years and I am very familiar with its workings.  I will not go back over some of the points that were made.  Mr. Duffy might give me some answers in writing if he cannot answer all my questions now.</p> <p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has not been mentioned.  What is the typical rate the bank will lend at through this vehicle?  What is the percentage cost of this?  Many SMEs would benefit from the vehicle.  I have been hearing rates of approximately 4.5% plus but I have a feeling that if the rate becomes too high, it will not be practical.  We need to ensure the product is as cheap as possible to get the SMEs back working.  We can review it in time.</p> <p>  A question raised with me and many others concerns how loyal customers believe the bank is imposing high interest rates on them by comparison with new businesses.  They feel aggrieved.  That is why a stir is being created.  The customers want their loyalty rewarded.  There must be some way of dealing with this.  Since this is becoming an issue, it needs to be dealt with.</p> <p>  Mr. Duffy said the average interest margin is 1.69%.  I do not like margins.  One of Mr. Duffy's Munster lenders, whom I will not name, stated one could have one's tail end in the fire and one's head in the fridge but one's average would not be too bad although the extremes would be poor.  I am sure Mr. Duffy heard that.  My point is that the percentage is masking a lot of items.  It is creating a fog that I cannot get around.  There is a myriad of factors in the background.</p> <p>  Some people are saying AIB is not engaging with the mortgage holders.  I heard about the whole list of forms.  The forms and numbers need to be in language that people can understand if there is a pre-arrears case.  I acknowledge that the bank does deal with this but the information needs to be communicated better.</p> <p>  I recently witnessed bank representatives in a courtroom seeking orders.  A particular bank, not AIB, wanted a committal order to be extended.  The judge threw out the case.  He was very frustrated because one either seeks a committal or not.</p> <p>  How many repossession cases will AIB deal with this year?  How many will proceed to full completion?  I would like to see more engagement to keep people in their homes until the bitter end.  I acknowledge that I heard Mr. Duffy refer to this many times.  I understand that we are dealing with a legacy issue.  There is a perception that there is not enough contact being made.  Many people are e-mailing me about this.</p> <p>  A bugbear of mine, another legacy issue, is Belfry.  I would like to be told that no more Belfry-type funds will ever be issued in any form and that people will not be given cheese and wine and asked to invest because they are valued customers.  What occurred was wrong and it will be wrong if it is ever done again.  Will AIB do anything for those customers who have had to bear a full 100% loss on their investment?</p> <p>  With regard to the restructuring of businesses, how much is new lending?  Mr. Duffy mentioned all the new lending.  Many of the restructurings involve new lending, by definition, but they are already in place.  There is nothing wrong with it but I wish to know the percentage.</p> <p>  With restructuring, there is a hidden cost.  I would like to see the bank bearing some of the burden of the restructuring debt.  There are all the costs that go with it and securities being perfected, etc., but the burden is landed on the customer.  It should be shared a little more equally.  Mr. Duffy will understand where I am coming from on that.</p> <p>  What are Mr. Duffy's views on the new Central Bank rulings regarding equity for mortgages?  Why has there been a 27% reduction in Central Bank and bank deposits, as mentioned in AIB's report?  There is a view that the banks, but not just AIB, are mopping up equity a little too diligently.  How does Mr. Duffy feel about that?  The figure for impaired loans, &euro;22 billion, is still huge.  How much of this will actually be realised?  What will it crystallise out to in the end?</p> <p>  I appreciate that the bank has a mess to tidy up, and that it is doing so.  It has done a very good job in many respects.  It surely represents a cost on the bank.  Do the delegates know the cost at present?  The cost will obviously be reducing as the bank becomes a normal functioning bank.  Will the reduction be passed on to customers or will it go back to shareholders?  There are many issues to be addressed and we could do with a second meeting.  I would appreciate a written response if Mr. Duffy cannot answer my questions in detail.</p></speech>

Many people would be surprised that the bank wrote down some &euro;461 million in mortgage debt in 2014.  That was significantly ramped up by comparison with the two previous years.

What we would say is that we are working our way through the book.  There is a lag between the write-down and the agreement with the customer because there is quite a bit of legal documentation, etc., concerned.  In some cases, the property has to sell.  One might agree with a customer that the residual or a portion thereof is to be written down but the property must go on the market and there has to be closure and a sale.  Therefore, there is a lag.  One is actually accounting for some activity in 2013 that results in a write-down in 2014.  However, I would say that we still-----</p></speech>

The delegates may tell me it is a matter for the Minister rather than the bank but I presume they have views.  Given the healthier position of the State's finances and that there is no great pressure to move to dispose of the first tranche in 2015, do the delegates have a view, in the context of the commercial interest and restoration of the bank so it can perform normally in the economy, on the timeframe that would be ideal in so far as there is what I describe is a reality in the commercial world?</p></speech>

There are positives associated with doing it now and with doing it later; there is no right answer.  Obviously, creating an impression across the world that the bank is a back-to-normal business that investors are paying for is a very good thing.  Maybe there would be price differences on the different days on which one decided to sell but, on average, over the longer term, they would probably balance out.  There is not necessarily a right or wrong answer because of those factors.  Obviously, the sooner a point is reached where there are investors coming in and returning the value to the State, the better.  However, we are not particularly concerned about when it happens.

In a particular set of cases, where somebody is party to a loan with somebody else, only one party might arrive in.  There could be a joint mortgage.  In some respects, one wonders why it goes to a vote because one cannot just tear up the mortgage contract of somebody else unless he or she is present.  This makes it very different because there could be separation circumstances where somebody is trying to move on.  However, one cannot just tear up the mortgage and recontract.  A second reason concerns where the proposals from the PIPs seek to have some assets placed outside the arrangement.  We had one case in 2014 &mdash; I do not want to get into the specifics &mdash; in which there were assets overseas that an individual wanted to leave out of the arrangement but we were just not going to agree to something like that.  The third reason concerns the nature of the forbearance sought.</p> <p>  Regarding a mortgage, a certain type of forbearance may be sought although we will offer a different type.  We are trying to remain consistent with people in terms of what restructuring arrangements we offer.  People may seek a principal write-down although standard forbearance or a different type of mortgage restructuring would do.  In all cases that we turned down, we offered an alternative, with the exception of one where we did not believe the mortgage was sustainable in any shape or form.  In that case, we offered, on the basis that the house would be sold, to write off the residual in full.  The mortgage could not be sustained otherwise.  In all the other cases, all the offers we had allowed the person to stay in his or home.  In bankruptcy cases, this would not happen.  I am happy about our interaction.  We vote commercially across all of these cases.</p></speech>

I received a communication from a constituent associated with an SME.  Obviously, SME lending is crucial to the future of the State.  The SME employs approximately 100 people so it is quite big by the standards of a rural constituency such as Clare.  It is a well-known and long-standing family business.  Through the most difficult years of the recession, the business kept all loans within contract, paying all on a full interest and capital basis without exception.  Approximately 20% of the loans were in a two-year review programme.  Owing to this, the business had a very good relationship with its local bank and decided that it would seek additional funding for capital investment.  It was not a huge amount.  It was less than 50% of what it was paying down every year.  The business was a bit surprised when its file was transferred to the Financial Solutions Group in Dublin.  The group is a section of the bank dedicated to supporting businesses and personal customers in financial difficulties.  A well-known accountancy firm was appointed to carry out an IBR to support the application but that firm also specialises in receiverships.  That was another slight concern but there were no difficulties with the bank whatsoever.  The bank then started examining the two-year review programme and effectively threatened the company, which was perfectly functioning, that it would appoint a receiver if it did not accept new loan terms and conditions.  This involved an increase of approximately 2% on the margin on the loans.  Of course, the term was also pushed out to make it stack up on paper.</p> <p>  At this stage, the SME sought legal and financial advice, which was that it made no sense to sign up to the arrangement.  However, it posed the question as to what alternatives existed?  When a bank appoints a receiver to a perfectly viable company, it cannot remain perfectly viable for much longer because the receivership will have a considerable impact on its reputation and credibility.  An SME employing 100 people might be a big fish in Clare but it is a tiny fish compared to AIB.  The bank will spend as much money as it takes; that is what banks do.  Does AIB prey on its successful SMEs to help fund those that are not successful?  Is there a deliberate policy of doing that in the bank?  We all know that successful mortgage holders, or those who are fortunate to be able to repay, are paying over the odds to pay for those who are not as fortunate and unable to repay and, of course, those who refuse to repay.  Does this apply to SMEs?</p></speech>

I will have to get the details from the Deputy because he said the customer has always kept in contract.

My question relates to the question posed by Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon and, to an extent, that posed by Deputy McNamara.  In my constituency, a number of SMEs are in difficulty and I received complaints from them, to differing degrees, about how they are treated by banks.  In one case that relates to AIB, the small business concerned is a shopping business that seems to be profitable but the fear of the person involved is that the shop will be closed down.  The person concerned was foolish during the boom and purchased properties he should not have bought.  He will say so himself and expects to get a big whack on the knuckles on that.  He accepts that but it seems inappropriate that, if a business is viable, the core business should be closed down.  Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon received a positive response to this but that is not the vibe I am getting from small businesspeople.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-22a.1444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015042200002#S00200"><p>We are sitting as a joint sub-committee on petitions.  We will record the decisions of the committee.  The committee has received a total of 136 petitions to date since the launch of the petitions system.  Some 124 of those petitions have been brought before us on at least one occasion.</p><p>Today, we will discuss nine petitions.  The first petition is No. P00018/14, in respect of Mr. James Dooney, regarding the lack of systems in place to allow a psychiatric nurse transfer to a suitable geographical area.  I propose that this petition remain open and, following agreement with the petitioner, it will be brought before the joint committee for full consideration at a later date.  This petition, as currently worded, relates to an individual and is an issue of importance.  If the petition is changed to reflect a broader issue, then our committee will revisit the matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The second petition is No. P00027/14, in respect of Mr. Alan Moran, regarding the holding of an abortion referendum.  The committee has agreed that we will get advice and that it is inadmissible.  The committee has agreed that we will get advice from the parliamentary legal adviser and refer the matter back to the committee at a later stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next petition is No. P00028/14, in respect of Ms Elizabeth Shannon, which calls for the resignation of two judges.  The recommendation from the committee is that all correspondence be returned to the petitioner, in accordance with section 92(4) of the inquiries Act.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The petition is closed and is inadmissible.</p><p>The next petition is No. P00033/14, in respect of Mr. Michael Power, regarding discrimination in the primary medical certificate.  This petition is deemed to be inadmissible because it has been dealt with by an ombudsman.  However, the issue raised by Mr. Power is being addressed in two other petitions.  We will keep Mr. Power briefed even though we cannot accept his petition because it is inadmissible.  We will keep him briefed on the progress of the other two petitions out of courtesy.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next petition is No. P00035/14, in respect of Dr. Franka Winter, which is  entitled, &quot;Married person tax credit not for migrants&quot;.  The petition is deemed inadmissible because the petitioner has not demonstrated that he has exercised all of the avenues of appeal.  However, we understand that the issues raised have since been addressed.  That is a good outcome for the petitioner in this regard.  Is it agreed that the petition is inadmissible although there has been a good outcome?  Agreed.</p><p>The next petition is No. P00036/14, in respect of Ms Noreen Corcoran, re health care <i>v</i>. water charges.  The petition is inadmissible as the issues raised are inadmissible under Standing Order 165C(2) which states:<blockquote>In relation to admissible petitions, where a petition deals with-(a) local or regional matters; or<br /><br />(b) matters which are more appropriate to a regulatory public body or a body established for the purpose of redress;the Committee shall establish that all available avenues of appeal or redress have been utilised by the petitioner prior to the Committee considering the matter.</blockquote>Is it agreed that the petition is inadmissible because of those terms?  Agreed.</p><p>The next petition is No. P00042/14, in respect of Mr. Daniel Pena, which is  entitled &quot;Sasam&oacute;n, new bridge between Ireland and Spain.&quot;  Sasam&oacute;n is a location in Spain and the term &quot;new bridge&quot; refers to a new cultural bridge between Ireland and Spain.  We could not deem the petition admissible because it does not deal with matters that are pertinent to the Houses or specific to this committee that would come under the remit of the committee or these Houses.  However, we did think what he had to say had merit.  Therefore, we will refer these matters and will write to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We will bring the suggestions mentioned in the petition to their attention and we will ask them to respond to the petitioner.  Although this committee cannot deal with the petition, we hope the petitioner will appreciate our efforts.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p>The next petition is No. P00001/15.  It is considered frivolous, vexatious or otherwise constitutes an abuse of the petitions system as the telephone number and e-mail address do not exist.  I wish to state that it is disappointing that anyone would submit such a petition and engage in such nonsense.  This is an important system for citizens and many citizens engage in it, give of their time and make an effort, plus this is a new committee in this Oireachtas.  The petition has been ruled out.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next petition is No. P00005/15, in respect of Mr. Thomas Keary, and is entitled "Unpaid salary for night duty worked".  We have looked at the Standing Orders.  We think this person has raised the issues with the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner which means the matter has been through the due process.  Our Standing Orders do not allow us to revisit issues that have been addressed by the Ombudsman, the Courts Service, the Labour Court or the systems that are in place.  We will advise the petitioner to look at trade unions and whether there are new legislative or policy areas that could be examined.  We have to deem the petition inadmissible.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
