    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rogier Schulte" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800003#C00300"><p>I thank the chairman and members for this opportunity to present to the committee.</p><p>  It is timely to discuss emerging demands on land use.  Changing land use is a slow process, not only in Ireland but internationally, that requires early engagement because it is difficult to manage.  The time horizon is between 2020 and 2050.  The European Commission is preparing a land use directive aimed at dealing with the challenges we will be discussing today.  We would like Ireland to be in a position to inform this process rather than respond to it in ten years time.  Our work is based on numerous reports and scientific papers but this presentation will be a whistle-stop tour.</p><p>  At global level there are two grand challenges facing agriculture, namely, achieving and maintaining food security and sustainability.  By 2050, the world population will have risen to 9 billion.  Particularly in emerging countries, there is an increase in demand for livestock produce.  The demand for food is expected to go up by 60% by 2015.  With sustainability, there is the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change on agriculture.  Globally, agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh water.  There is also pressure on biodiversity.  Wherever agricultural areas expand, it commonly comes at the expense of biodiversity such as with the Amazon rain forests or high nature value farmlands in Europe.</p><p>  The question we are facing is how we can maximise multi-functionality of our limited land resources.  Ireland is no different in this respect and can be considered a microcosm of these global challenges.  Food Harvest 2020 is an agricultural policy in response to food security concerns.  We also have a raft of environmental policies coming from Brussels and national level.</p><p>  What do we expect from our land?  There are five high level demands on land use, namely, the provision of food, fibre and fuel, water purification, to sequester carbon to offset greenhouse gas emissions, to provide a habitat for biodiversity and a home for nutrients in the form of cow or pig slurry or sewage sludge from human waste.  Over the past five years, Teagasc has conducted a scoping study on the extent to which we are likely to meet all these demands.  Over the short term, up to 2020, there is a real potential to meet these competing demands for land but only if the process is managed from the very start.  That was also the conclusion of the independent environmental analysis of Food Harvest 2020, published by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the past fortnight.</p><p>  How can we achieve the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020?  It can be done through intensification, keeping more animals on the same intensively farmed land base to achieve more output.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800005#E00200"><p>I thank Dr. Schulte.  That was very informative.  His work has identified many of the areas that this committee realises need to be addressed and dealt with in some detail.  A debate needs to start, even on some of the choices to be made.  That is the aim of the committee&rsquo;s work and Teagasc is our first witness.  We said we would start where the preparatory and scoping work was being done to help us to navigate and the information provided is very helpful.  I have some questions, but I will first call members to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800005#E00300"><p>I thank Dr. Schulte for his presentation.  The Chairman has outlined its importance.  The target of 9 billion people by 2050, a 60% increase in food production in order to provide food security and a huge effort towards further intensification of production will create their own difficulties in respect of environmental quality.  The problem is that in many parts of the world food will never be produced, unless some revolutionary way to irrigate desert and so forth is found.  How does Teagasc hope to manage this?  It is all a question of management.  Professor Schulte mentioned incentives.  The option is to use the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, etc.  That shows the market side, on which the European Union and the CAP create incentives to manage and direct production.</p><p>  I did not hear any mention of GM production, but I may have missed it.  What are the delegates views or opinions in that regard?  Do they see it as part of food security in the future and what are its consequences?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800005#E00400"><p>I thank Dr. Schulte for his presentation.  It is a big subject and it would probably take more study than an afternoon meeting to try to come up with some reasonable questions in response.</p><p>  Are the goals of Food Harvest 2020 and the various environmental policies with which we must comply mutually exclusive?  Is it possible to satisfy all of them through correct land usage?  Dr. Schulte has said measures in the water framework directive need to be assessed for cost-effectiveness.  Does that mean that we need to decide it is too expensive and that we should not do it and justify this, or what does it mean?</p><p>  In respect of carbon sequestration in agriculture, we hear a lot about the amount of methane cattle produce, but can it be measured against how much is absorbed by growing grass?  How will this be achieved in the future?</p><p>  Dr. Schulte has said soft incentivisation is preferable.  Are there studies of how effective that has been under the CAP and how was it achieved?  Does he foresee farming practices being officially restricted based on soil type in an area, for example, it might be desirable to allow intensive or resource-efficient farming on soil that can manage it and restrict it on other soils, rather than allowing the market to decide?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800005#E00500"><p>The last time I saw a paper like this was in University College Dublin given by some of Dr. Schulte's predecessors.  The focus obviously has to be on soil type and land use and, broadly, how soils function.  That is one of the challenges.  There are gleysols, heavy soils, limestone soils and deep soils.  I appreciate Dr. Schulte is trying to aggregate them in averages, but how can he be more specific about the different soil types across the country in a way that will help achieve the 2050 goal?  The most important thing he said was that in September this year the soil type identification would be updated.  There have been changes owing to drainage and so on which have created different types of soil.  How will that input into his process?  In respect of carbon sequestration, habitat diversity and water purification, he has indicated that forestry has a significant role to play as a carbon sink.  We only have 7,500 ha and aim to have in excess of 10,000 ha in forestry.  Does he have any view on how we will achieve this?</p><p>  The real challenge is to explore the compatibility of achieving a 60% increase in world food production by 2050 and the central and important issue of sustainability.  Does Dr. Schulte agree that is the nub of the problem?  We have so often been behind the ball in dealing with the European Union.  Did Dr. Schulte say it was bringing out a land use directive for 2019?</p></speech>

We should be making a major input into formulating this directive and be proactive, rather than standing on the sidelines, being reactive, until all hell breaks loose.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800006#F00200"><p>I thank the delegates for bringing clarity to an enormous body of work.  As Deputy Thomas Pringle suggested, we would probably have to lock ourselves in this room for a week to do justice to their research, but we will start where we can.  The global soil challenges are big issues, but there is no mention of the almost 1 billion people we currently fail to feed.  That is important to be put on the map alongside all of the other important matters.</p><p>  Deputy Willie Penrose referred to wanting Ireland to inform the EU directive.  I agree that Ireland should play a role in this regard.  Are the delegates having to fight their way into that process or insert themselves into it?  Why would we not be invited to become involved?  Surely the European Commission would have an interest in what we and others might have to say.  I wonder, therefore, where we stand in terms of our European counterparts.  The soil map of Ireland is welcome, but we are late to the table in developing it.</p><p>  In regard to Food Harvest 2020 and what is imaginatively being called harvest 2025 - that is for politicians to ensure we do not get too confused - do the delegates think the body of work they have produced is compatible with these strategies?  Do they also need to insert themselves into that debate and, if so, how much support can we offer them?  </p><p>  My final question is whether the cattle on the page are bugged.  I observe that they are wired.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800006#F00300"><p>I ask the delegates to provide further details on the sustainable model farm at Kildalton College.  What trials and experiments will be conducted there?  Has any thought been given to renewable energy that is land sourced to mitigate the output increases under Food Harvest 2020?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rogier Schulte" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800006#F00400"><p>I thank members for their excellent questions.  I wrote them down but do not hesitate to tell me if I skip any.  </p><p>  The 60% increase in demand for food is a global figure, but there are very different challenges and demands around the globe.  There is great potential for developing countries to increase yields through the use of science and technology and the application of simple things such as fertiliser.  We are working closely with Irish Aid to lend our expertise in agricultural production and have established an international food security committee to co-ordinate that expertise with Irish Aid.  Senator Susan O'Keeffe is correct to point out that 1 billion people are undernourished or hungry.  That is one of the main drivers of our collaboration with Irish Aid.</p><p>  There is a certain degree of confusion about the targets set under Food Harvest 2020.  It contains only one volume target, that is, an increase of 50% in dairy and milk volume in response to the phasing out of the milk quota.  All of the other targets are value based.  The changes in the demography of the national herd and land use will be less dramatic than they may appear at first glance.  For example, the projection from our Teagasc FAPRI Ireland model is that we will see an increase in milk volume and the number of dairy cows, but it will be partially offset by a projected contraction of the national suckler herd.  As these additional dairy cows produce more calves, they will offset some of the suckler cow production.</p><p>  On whether intensification under Food Harvest 2020 will increase pressures on water quality, this is where management comes in.  Our agriculture catchment programme aims to measure the impact on water quality of intensive agricultural production in compliance with the nitrates directive.  This is a complex programme, with complex outcomes, but the headline is that the nitrous action plan will go a long way towards ensuring good water quality across the board.  When we bring our paper into the equation, a wide range of soils have the capacity to process additional nutrients.  This is reflected in the good water quality status we enjoy in Ireland compared to many other EU member states.  However, certain soils are approaching their maximum capacity for processing these nutrient loads and purifying water to quality standards.  This is where target management comes into play.  Some soils can cope with additional nutrient loads, whereas others cannot.  The most important achievement of Food Harvest 2020 is that it has brought sustainability and growth in the agriculture industry to the same side of the table.  The environment is no longer considered a constraint on production.  We are now building on our green credentials.  Bord Bia is promoting this as a point of differentiation on international markets.  The sustainability of our systems will allow us to grow the industry.  Clearly, we cannot afford to sit still because other countries are catching up with us rapidly.  We have to keep working on sustainability.</p><p>  That leads me to the question of genetically modified organisms, GMOs.  This is a complex area.  Perhaps members saw the most recent episode of "Eco Eye" which featured some of Teagasc's research on GMOs.  We maintain a completely scientific position on the subject.  There are clear benefits from GMO crops, but there are also perceived risks.  We are researching both the potential benefits and the potential risks in highly controlled and regulated conditions and will await the outcome of our research before taking further steps.  It is worth noting that the field of genetic modification is developing very rapidly and the distinction between conventional breeding and genetically modified breeding is beginning to blur in laboratories.  It may become increasingly difficult to tell one from the other.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Reamonn Fealy" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800007#G00200"><p>I thank everybody for their questions.  There is a comprehensive list for us to deal with.  I agree with Senator O'Keeffe that we would want to be here for some time to adequately address them all but we will do our best.</p><p>  On the notion of incentivisation, Deputy Pringle's question referred to the effectiveness of incentivisation in terms of soft incentivisation versus hard incentivisation.  Most of the work in that area is conducted by my colleagues in the socio-economic area of Teagasc where the effects of different types of incentivisation are rolled out.  However, as a general principle, we view the construction of a framework that avoids red-lining - another question we got a short time ago was on restricting areas of land for particular types of activity - as a particular path that should be avoided.  </p><p>  Traditionally, the way we have implemented changes and moves towards best practice was through the incentivisation model.  Ultimately, if we are to expect our farm stakeholders to be the arbiters and those responsible for maintaining our land to the best possible quality in a manner that will lead to the best economic outputs and the best agricultural production outputs while maintaining environmental quality, we must have cognisance of the fact that it is a public good and a service to the public good, and incentives must be designed to meet that end.  That is what is engendering the approach we are now examining with regard to a framework for moving into the future.  A framework needs to be built that takes account of the multiple outcomes of agricultural land use in Ireland, be they for environmental quality or for agricultural productivity.  To date, incentives have been designed with a singular outcome in mind and while the incentive is designed in such a manner that would bring one to that end, it has created what are termed perverse outcomes in that there have been negative impacts that might not have been considered previously. </p><p>  Two examples come to mind.  Traditionally, perhaps our management around upland areas and sheep has been shown in retrospect to be misguided, and the issue around overstocking has created some problems, particularly in the western areas.  Also, in retrospect the expansion of forestry onto deep peatland soils with a singular species was not the most productive and useful way to go in forestry, but we are learning.  As research, time and resources are put into these problems we are learning that there are better ways to approach the way we incentivise land management.</p><p>  One or two questions were asked about soils.  Soils and soils mapping is a particular area for spatial analysis in Teagasc.  If I understand his question correctly, Deputy Penrose asked how we take account of the finer detail of soil variability in Ireland in a national mapping.  It is a good question and one I have had to deal with for nigh on 16 years in my career in Teagasc.  It is a challenging task.  Depending on the classification system we use there are ten or 11 major soil groups in Ireland, and nine of them have been recorded as occurring in one field in Cork.  Without referring to Cork, that suggests how difficult the task is of mapping our soils.</p><p>  In terms of the way we approach this problem, with the production of the 1:250,000 map, we show soils in their generality and we show soils with the proportions that occur in a particular region.  These are called soil associations.  That is the classic industry standard, so to speak, in terms of the way soil mapping should be approached.  We would always add a caveat when people are using the data that soil maps are not to be used for sight-specific purposes.  For any reason, be it for the positive side of farm productivity or a farmer making an assessment within field or regulatory efforts, a national soil map should not be used at point or field scale.</p><p>  Senator O'Keeffe asked if we are ahead or behind the curve.  Interestingly, when I started in Teagasc we had drifted behind.  We are now coming towards the front, particularly in light of the near completion of phase 1 of the Irish Soil Information System, ISIS, project.  This is an opportune time to answer this question because we are at the end of phase 1 and it is due to be presented towards the beginning of March.  For the first time we will have a comprehensive database containing all our soils information that has been developed over many years, since the mid-1950s, which will be available to the public via a web browser interface.</p><p>  In this regard we have European colleagues and peers on our steering committee, and colleagues of mine have been invited to present to European organisations on the way we have developed that system.  We are using leading edge technology to both store and disseminate the information, and at this stage we are coming back into a position where we are beginning to lead the curve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rogier Schulte" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800007#G00300"><p>If I may follow up on that regarding another question posed on our access to the Commission and feeding into that process.  It is because of initiatives like the Irish Soil Information System, and a representative from the European Commission is chairing the steering committee of that project, that we now have a good working relationship with it, particularly its soils unit in Ispra, in Italy.  Also, the paper the members have before them has been read and commented on by the European Commission.  The landmark proposal to which I referred is a very large Horizon 2020 proposal on soil quality and soil functions that we are leading for that very reason.  We are reasonably satisfied, therefore, with our working relationship with the Commission.</p><p>  One of the benefits of being a relatively small country is that we have fairly short lines of communication here compared to other countries in that we have good collaboration between the State agencies and the various Departments that are involved.  It is relatively easy to get a group of people together and come to a position compared to the position in some of the bigger member states that have to go through more layers, so to speak.</p><p>  Deputy Penrose asked about the offsetting of carbon emissions.  Our figures suggest that, currently, the offsetting equals one third of agricultural emissions in Ireland and that without action that will not improve because our first generation forestry that was planted after 1990 is beginning to mature.  We will then go into second generation forestry etc., and the potential for carbon sequestration of those is lower.  However, in a report on carbon neutrality as a Horizon point, we also identify actions that can be taken to rectify that, and increasing of forestation is an option in that regard.  There is a difference in terms of the physical land base that in theory is available for additional forestry.  However, the reality is very much restricted by regulation and social dimensions.  It involves forestry, a change of enterprise type, a complete change of business, and there are also social barriers.</p><p>  A question was asked on the bio-energy side.  If as a country we want to seriously get involved in bio-energy, it requires a change in our energy infrastructure, and there would be significant economic costs involved in that.  When we talk about bio-energy, like many other countries the thinking is moving away from liquid biofuels because liquid biofuels are considered in direct competition with food production.  When we talk about bio-energy now we are talking about either bio-energy crops - willow, miscanthus - where there is less competition with food production.  </p><p>  We are also at a very early exploratory stage of anaerobic digestion of grass in combination with slurry.  The one thing this country can produce very well is grass.  If we chose to we could produce much more grass than we currently do, which could be used for bio-energy without undue competition for land.  There are many obstacles to overcome before that becomes a reality.  Again, it would require a change in the infrastructure of our energy distribution network.  In terms of Horizon 2020, we should not pin our hopes on that but when we are talking about Horizon 2050, it is one of the options that could be explored.</p></speech>

When we talk about 2020 or 2050, it is the students who are in Kildalton now on whom we will be relying to make all these discussions a reality.  Also, the Kilkenny area, or the wider catchment area there, is where we see a lot of movement in terms of Food Harvest 2020 - many new entrants into dairy production.  What we are doing there is bringing together all our research on sustainable farming from all our research centres - our dairy production centre, our beef research, our tillage, our rural economy and our soil centres - to showcase options for best practice in sustainable farming.</p><p>  It is always difficult in our line of work to make that link, from proving options at research level in experiments to achieving it on the ground on a large number of farms.  This will be the focal point where we will demonstrate different options for different farms.  There is no one blueprint for sustainable farming.  We will demonstrate options - going back to the paper - on how to maximise what we get from the land, in terms of food production, water quality and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>  As to whether we can capitalise on that natural capital that we have there, it will involve a large KT programme bringing both farmers and food business on board.  Where Bord Bia has its Origin Green programme, this will be a focal point where all the stateholders can come and see at first hand what sustainable farming looks like.  That will be rolled out over a seven-year period.</p><p>  The first year, this year, what we are doing is a baseline survey.  If we want to show progress over time, we have to know the baseline information.  This year we are simply measuring everything and as from next year, we will introduce, step by step, further measures to improve efficiency.</p></speech>

There will be three phases.  Phase one, which will be next year and the year after, we are simply implementing best practice which we would recommend anyway, that is, the grass wedge, the carbon navigator, the five-point nutrient plan and the ten-point biodiversity plan.</p><p>  In phase two, we start looking at the infrastructure in the college.  In terms of bio-energy, there is, for example, a large woodland in the area that is currently and traditionally largely unmanaged.  We propose to manage that for it to have two functions - a public amenity function and a producer of energy for the college as a client.  Bio-energy crops may be an option also for the college as an energy client.</p><p>  In the third phase, we will look at emerging technologies.  The ICT area in agriculture is developing fast.  We expect that in five or six years' time it may become affordable for real-time monitoring of, for example, both soil conditions and animal movements, and we will start implementing those emerging technologies.</p></speech>

Dr. Schulte stated that if it is tailored correctly it can be effective, but we do not know whether it has been tailored correctly until it is too late.  I also question the cost-effectiveness of measures under the Habitats Directive.</p><p>  I would make one last comment about the paper, which states, under Towards Functional Land Management, that, "reductions in greenhouse gas emissions do not need to be locationally bound &ndash; the spatial origin of reductions is irrelevant in the context of their global warming potential".  It refers to it on a global level as well.  Is that a dangerous concept to be giving to the EU in the context that one would export global warming reductions to the Third World and continue as before?  Perhaps the question is not relevant to today but it is one that came to mind when I was looking at it.</p></speech>

I refer to the freshwater pearl mussel.  It is a big qualification, that it "may be required".  I wonder why it may be required.  I understand the cost, but I wonder whether that the only consideration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rogier Schulte" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014021800008#H00700"><p>These are good questions also.</p><p>  Let me start with the cost effectiveness and then I will come to the pearl mussel as an example.  We conducted a study in the Lough Melvin area.  Lough Melvin is one of these pristine water bodies.  It was a North-South collaboration because it is a cross-Border lake.  We looked at approximately 20 different options to reduce loss of phosphorus, from the land to the water.  Phosphorus was the biggest threat to that pristine water quality.  We found that, in theory, many of the measures would be effective in reducing phosphorus flow, from the land to the water, but the difference in cost was significant.  To give two extreme examples, one measure proposed in the scientific literature is to stop access of animals to the water bodies.  In the Lough Melvin area, the challenge is that there is water everywhere and the stocking rate is low, and one would need miles of fencing to keep each cow out of the water.  If one considers the cost effectiveness of stopping that one cow from standing in the water, it is an expensive option.  Another measure we looked at was soil testing for phosphorus and customising the fertiliser management accordingly, which came out as a cheap option.</p><p>  It is worth noting though that such difference in cost effectiveness is catchment specific.  The reason fencing was so expensive on Lough Melvin is miles per cow.  If one goes to a different catchment with well-drained soils, few rivers or streams, and a high stocking density, that equation changes completely.  Also, if one looks at other risks, such as transfer of pathogens, then in that equation for keeping the cows out of the water one comes up with a different figure for cost effectiveness, but it can differ by orders of magnitude.  In fact, in the Lough Melvin scenario, and if the objective is to reduce phosphorus, then the fencing option turned out to be 100 times more expensive than soil testing if one compares kilo for kilo of phosphorus lost to the water.  It is a real issue.</p><p>  On the additional actions for the pristine water quality, the pearl mussel is a peculiar case study.  A map in the presentation shows the catchments where the pearl mussel is found.  It is a slow-growing animal.  It is particularly the young pearl mussels, the juveniles, that are sensitive to both nutrient loss and sediment loss.  Basically, if there is excess nutrients and excess sediment, they get buried and sufficate at the bottom of the stream.  Once they grow to adulthood, they can live for a long time.  They can live for over 100 years.  The challenge is that in all of these blue catchments shown the slide the pearl mussel has been found but in some of these catchments we - by which I mean the National Parks and Wildlife Service, as it, not Teagasc, conducts the surveys - find only adults remaining.  These adults are almost relics of when those waters were pristine, whereas in some of the western catchments there are still viable populations that have a chance of breeding and continuing themselves.</p><p>  This leads us to a peculiar challenge.  Under the Habitat Directive, we are obliged to protect this species but nobody knows whether it is technically possible for these old pearl mussels to start breeding again in some of the more intensively used catchments - hence our hesitation in making straight statements on what should be done.  To the best of our knowledge, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has now also prioritised the catchments accordingly.  It has put the highest priority on those catchments where the pearl mussels are still breeding and there is a chance of success.  That brings me back to cost-effectiveness.</p></speech>

Our understanding from the report is that Ireland has met its obligations in terms of designating areas for Natura 2000 sites.  Within those areas, the outlook for the future status of many of the habitats is poor to bad.  This is the column on the right hand side of the graph.  That is where the challenge lies.  In our conclusion, we say that additional actions are required.</p></speech>

It is a major challenge.  We wanted to invite the witnesses to appear to establish a well of knowledge.  Resource efficiency and balance are the key issues.  The diagram showing the same number of animals and the same amount of feed, with extra food at the end, is the optimum.  If we can do that and use science and good management practices to do it, then we can argue the case about trading.  We can ask what is the point in us not increasing our production in an area we happen to be good at just to achieve a percentage reduction in overall output, when other countries can to other things better than we can.  There should be a certain level of re-evaluation, without compromising it.  Our 20-20-20 targets need to be looked at in that light.  The question is what to use to factor in mitigating allowances against energy, bioenergy and off-land wind energy.  That is a hot topic but it is a land-based use while hydroelectric energy is a river-based use.  Science and management will form a key part of this.</p><p>  The project will take longer than the lifetime of this D&aacute;il.  It would be worth the time of the committee to see a host farm in the south east.  We have a proposal to see a host farm for another reason.  We could do worse than go to Kildalton to gather information.  Trial work on forestry is also being done there.  It is taught in the college and some information may be available.  We could do worse than see what they are scoping out.</p><p>  I thank the members.  Although not many committee members were present, the questions show there is interest.  We cannot overestimate the subject for the future of because we have put great stock in Food Harvest 2020, to be followed rapidly by food harvest 2025.  We must also deal with the other issues.  Perhaps the witnesses can make the slides available to us.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by officials of the Department, Mr. Philip Kelly, assistant secretary, Mr. Tommy Murray, principal officer, Ms Orla O&rsquo;Brien, assistant principal officer and Mr. Garry Purcell, higher executive officer, all of whom work on different aspects of the Competitiveness Council agenda, which is quite broad.</p><p>  The first item on the council&rsquo;s agenda is a policy debate on industrial competitiveness. <b></b>It is intended that the council would send a clear signal to the March European Council on industrial policy priorities and on ways to improve sustainable industrial competitiveness.  The debate will be informed by four Commission communications adopted in late January.</p><p>  The core Commission communication, adopted on 22 January, &quot;For a European industrial renaissance&quot;, was presented by Commissioner Tajani.  It does not promote any particularly new initiatives but sets out the Commission's key drivers and priorities for EU industrial policy and industrial competitiveness.  It also proposes to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP from 15% currently to reach as much as 20% share of GDP by 2020.  </p><p>  It<b></b>draws on the recommendations contained in the Commission&rsquo;s annual growth survey , provides an overview of actions already undertaken and puts forward selected priorities to speed up the remaining actions.  It reflects our own belief that we need to focus more on industrial strategy and on manufacturing potential that is probably untapped.  </p><p>  The European Commission is urging member states to recognise the central importance of industry for creating jobs and growth, and of mainstreaming competitiveness concerns across all policy areas.  This is the key message of the communication. </p><p>  The Greek Presidency will chair a policy debate at the council on industrial competitiveness on the basis of this core communication.  The results of that debate will be fed into the similar debate on energy, climate change and industrial policy which is to take place at the European Council meeting of 20-21 March 2014.  The Presidency has also associated three other important Commission communications recently published, namely, &quot;A vision for the internal market for industrial products&quot;, which builds on the results of the evaluation of EU law in the area of industrial products to assess the regulatory framework&rsquo;s overall coherence and fitness for purpose; &quot;Energy prices and costs in Europe&quot;, which analyses the cost of energy across Europe and proposes actions to reduce energy costs in the context of Europe&rsquo;s global competitiveness; and &quot;A policy framework for climate and energy in the period from 2020 to 2030&quot;, which proposes a new policy framework around energy efficiency, renewables and emissions to 2030. </p><p>  The common strand through each of these communications is that, in Europe, a policy supportive of a strong role for European industrial actors needs to address all policy areas in a co-ordinated way in order to promote this transformation.  That means developing better co-ordination mechanisms to address more coherently different policies such as environmental, climate, energy, trade, competition, skills, state aid and regional policies, all in support of sustainable jobs and growth.  For some time competitiveness Ministers have been grappling with the problem of how to achieve greater coherence across the policy spectrum between national and EU efforts.  Our view is that there is an onus on the Competitiveness Council to robustly monitor and track all unintended consequences of other council formations decisions and policies in the context of competitiveness and jobs. </p><p>  For example, high energy costs are now a significant threat to Europe&rsquo;s competitiveness.  Therefore, competitiveness and energy must go hand in hand and the new 2030 climate framework must take into account international competitors and the development of an internal energy market and energy infrastructures and interconnections.  The energy price gap is so wide that gas in Europe is three times more expensive and electricity twice as expensive as in the US.  As a result, the transfer of production from Europe to the US is a real threat.  Therefore it is very important that the internal market in energy is completed as a contributor to lower costs for industry and business - the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in particular.  This is a vital component towards sustaining Europe&rsquo;s external competitiveness.  </p><p>  While the communication calls for the EU to continue to vigorously pursue free trade agreements, the final conclusions themselves could have mentioned the strengthening of links between trade and free trade agreements and completion of the internal market and the growth agenda in that regard. I believe that we have to exploit the added value and benefits of free trade agreements as a contributor to global regulatory convergence, jobs, growth, the export potential of goods and services, and in particular internationalisation opportunities for SMEs.     </p><p>  The communication fails to mention the potential for &quot;reshoring&quot; or &quot;in-shoring&quot; of firms and industry back to Europe as a consequence of advances in technology, competitiveness gains, etc.</p></speech>

The agenda is broad at the National Competitiveness Council, but it strikes me that employment and job creation are periphery to this agenda.  The agenda states that the European Commission is urging member states to recognise the central importance of industry for getting jobs and growth.  That is Andrex puppy stuff; everybody loves it.  Where are the specifics in respect of job creation?  The four Commission communications are for a European industrial renaissance, a vision for an internal market for industrial products, energy prices and costs in Europe, and a policy framework for climate and energy.  Are there job creation targets associated with each of those communications?  Or are they just waffle statements with very nice English?  Has a SWOT analysis been done on the implementation of the Commission directives that might cost jobs in some member states?  Surely job creation and job protection should be at the heart of all of those communications.  I do not get a sense of it from this.</p><p>  Can the Minister provide an update on the state aid modernisation AOB item?  What is its potential impact on Ireland and our current state aid regime?  I am glad the Minister is going to introduce the "reshoring" industry agenda, but the UK has implemented a very successful strategy in recent months.  There was a very good report last night about reshoring industry back into the UK, even heavy manufacturing, which we were told was gone in that country.  Have we learned from that so that Ireland can bring back manufacturing jobs that may have been lost to other countries in recent years?  Is there a strategy in place for doing that?</p></speech>

The areas of initiative are not a surprise.  They are about better integration of the market, which will promote opportunities.  They are about improving the operation of the digital market, which has a big untapped potential in Ireland.  It is estimated that 75% of online trading goes out of Ireland.  This is about Horizon 2020 and the &euro;80 billion investment involved, and the attempt to focus more of that on manufacturing.</p></speech>

Europe has put its money behind it.  The Horizon 2020 programme involved a substantial increase in a welcome sense from an Irish point of view because we are top of the league in terms of access to funds for SMEs under the programme.  The programme has increased the proportion going to small and medium-sized enterprises from 15% to 20%.  The Commission has identified as key priorities advanced manufacturing, key enabling technologies and bio-based products.  The Commission goes through the list in the document.  Clearly, delivery is everything in this area.  There is a clear view within the European Council and the Heads of State, that a growth strategy is needed for Europe and that growth strategy will be a micro-growth strategy.  It is in these areas.  It is a political judgment to say whether there is a sense of urgency but I believe there is a sense of urgency.  Clearly, we would like to see more.  As the committee is aware, a budgetary ceiling was put on what member states would agree to under the European budget for the coming years and, therefore, Europe must work within the budgetary constraints.</p><p>  Reference was made to state aid modernisation, which deals with a broad area.  There are aspects relating to reform of the <i>de minimus</i> rule.  The Commission is increasing the <i>de minimus</i> rule.  There are several aspects but regional aid is the area of most interest for people in Ireland and we need to advance a new regional aid map by the end of June.  In the coming weeks we will be finalising an approach to the regional aid map.  It is currently being examined by the various agencies in respect of the balance that must be struck.</p><p>  In the negotiations there was a rather negative starting point.  The proposal was to reduce it such that 25% of the country would have been covered by aid.  However, through the negotiation of the directives we got it back up to 51.28% in an Irish context, which is marginally more than where we were under the previous regional aid map.</p><p>  The other hotly-contested issue was the proposal by the Commission to remove large companies from the so-called C regions.  The proposal was that there would be no aid to large companies in the C regions.  Again, that was re-negotiated and, essentially, large company aid is still permitted once it relates to diversification, new products or processes or new economic activities.  Large company aid remains a possibility within the so-called C regions.  Either a country is in regional aid or otherwise and this means the C regions in the context of Ireland.  We do not have any A regions.</p><p>  The Deputy is right about the re-shoring.  There was an interesting case recently in Cork involving Tyco, which had pulled out of Cork and left only a small compliance team.  Significantly, the compliance team proved rather strategic within the organisation and this helped to win back significant investment.  We are alert to the opportunities in this sphere.  The Eishtec case involved business process outsourcing but, again, it is interesting that there is growing interest in on-shoring.  Where a high-quality added-value service is delivered, it can compete and the vogue for off-shoring is somewhat less than it was.  There are opportunities for Ireland in this regard.</p></speech>

I welcome the presentation.  Like my colleague, I take the view that the document is high on aspiration and low on detail.  How does the Minister envisage that the industrial proportion of GDP will be increased in the coming period?  What key barriers to competitiveness have been identified?  Has there been any prioritisation of these key barriers?  Often the key barriers are focused on workers' terms and conditions, but there are other key barriers which need to be focused upon as well.</p><p>  Reference was made to sustainability and energy.  What are the details in the proposals on reducing energy costs without going down the US route of energy generation?  The regulatory coherence concerning the transatlantic trade and investment partnership is attractive but there is a good deal of scepticism about the projected growth.  The Department released a press statement saying there would be a 0.5% increase in the EU GDP.  However, in another press statement the Department said there would be a 2.6% increase in European GDP.  People in this country have heard of the Lisbon treaty bringing jobs and increasing GDP and they have heard of the fiscal treaty bringing jobs and increasing GDP.  Is there any way we can get further detail on that?  Has there been forecasting with regard to the level of jobs that will be created from these competitive initiatives?  That is the crisis issue throughout the eurozone at the moment.  There are concerns with regard to free trade negotiations to the effect that they will favour big business and large agribusiness to the detriment of smaller businesses, smaller farmers and workers' rights.  What efforts are being made to ensure that small businesses, workers' rights and small agribusinesses are being protected?  Has taxation cropped up in any of these competitiveness negotiations?</p></speech>

As I said to Deputy Calleary, it is not unlike our own challenge.  Our approach to the Action Plan for Jobs is not altogether dissimilar to the European approach.  It considers a wide range of areas.  It is possible to see this from the headings, which refer to the integrated market and how we bring down barriers within the market.  Clearly, the biggest of these barriers which remain are in the services sector rather than manufacturing.  Generally speaking, manufacturing does not have many barriers left.  However, there is an opportunity through free trade agreements to bring down barriers.  With the United States the tariff barriers would be of the order of 2% to 3% whereas the non-tariff barriers in the areas where they apply run to 20%.  The non-tariff barriers within many of the free-trade areas are the real opportunity.  The idea is to open up markets by having more standard approaches and mutual recognition of standards.  In a country like ours with our pharmaceuticals it represents a big opportunity.  Clearly, if we do not have to replicate the same approval network in the United States and in the European Union and if there is mutual recognition, then it takes out costs and allows us to compete.  To a considerable degree the integration of markets offers opportunity.</p><p>  Another area is investing in innovation, new technologies, production inputs and skills.  It is similar to our agenda and involves looking at how we use our research budgets in a way that opens up opportunities in sectors where we have a competitive edge in Europe.  The document has identified areas such as smart grids, digital infrastructures, clean vehicles and advanced manufacturing.  These are areas we would not dispute.</p><p>  Access to finance, which is a major subject of debate here, is still a subject of debate in Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021800006#E00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and his team.  The business of the Competitiveness Council is European competitiveness.  One of the areas in which Ireland is in big danger is energy and I ask the Minister to speak about what we can do ourselves.  Britain has made a decision about fracking, a subject we have not discussed.  The Irish Sea will be the location of fracking.  Recently published figures show that Ireland will be one of the largest importers of energy supplies in future years.  We can do something about this on our own, rather than relying on others in Europe, but we seem to have turned our backs on it.  In the United States ten or 15 years ago the amount of imported energy supplies was making the country uncompetitive.  It has since become competitive because it has found its own source of energy.  What can we do to reverse the position here?  The European Union is not restricting us, rather it is due to our own inability to do something for ourselves.</p><p>  Another area in which to provide opportunities for small and medium businesses is e-commerce.  When I was in a small shop in Estonia, I saw that the company was exporting all around Europe.  Half a dozen employees were selling by way of a system of e-commerce.  Borders and boundaries are restricting e-commerce and cross-border trade over the Internet.  What can we do about this?  What is the European Union doing to ensure cross-border barriers are removed?</p><p>  The Minister referred to complaints about food labelling.  We introduced legislation on food provenance.  If we were to introduce information on food provenance in food labelling, customers would have more confidence and trust in Irish food than in food products from other countries.  However, we seem to be reluctant to do this and are waiting for the European Union to move in order that there is concerted action.  This would remove Ireland's inability to compete in the European market.  The Minister also raised the issue, although he said it was the responsibility of the Department of Health.  These are actions we could take and which would give us the ability to be more competitive.  For example, the United States is composed of 50 states, each of which seems to have a great deal of freedom to compete and energise itself.  The European Union, including Ireland, tends to be hampered by a system of centralised control.  The United States seems to be able to work so much better and have become much more competitive.  I would like us to follow some of its example.</p></speech>

It is remarkable to note that the energy price gap is so wide that gas is three times more expensive than electricity in Europe and twice as expensive as in the United States.  The Senator referred to the increase in production in the United States, importation to Canada and so on, whereas we are largely reliant on certain somewhat unstable countries in the Middle East, notwithstanding the improved situation in Iran.  When we talk about the Internal Market in energy, what exactly is anticipated and what will the impact be?  The Minister has indicated that there is a concern about transportation from Europe to the United States.  Will he expand on this?</p><p>  In regard to the country-specific recommendations for the new semester, have we had initial communications on what is proposed?  In its annual growth survey the Commission has confirmed five areas for reform, one of which is growth-friendly fiscal consolidation.  What is envisaged under this heading?  We all know the Government's view on corporation tax, namely, that there should be no change in the current arrangements.  Is that issue likely to feature again in discussions at European level, including at the Competitiveness Council?</p><p>  There was reference to the German practice in regard to apprenticeships.  Are there other models in the European Union that are similar to the German model or, on the other hand, more similar to our own in a context of high levels of participation at third level?  Some time back a delegation from one of the federal states in Germany came before the committee and put forward the view that this country's level of third level participation was too high and that we needed to do more in terms of other training and education models.  Is there something we can learn from other European countries, apart from Germany, that might be helpful in this regard?</p></speech>

I understand negotiations are ongoing between the United States and the European Union on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP.  Colleagues have outlined the concerns regarding Ireland's ability to compete, particularly in high energy sectors.  The energy cost differential between the European Union and the United States, as outlined, certainly gives us a great deal to consider.  Will the Minister comment on this, particularly in the context of the TTIP process?</p></speech>

Where, for instance, electricity is cheapest in France or wind power is most plentiful in Ireland, it offers the benefit of the cheapest source across the network.  This reduces the stand-by capacity required, a significant factor for a small market, particularly when one is using renewables.  Where markets are integrated, there is no need to tie up so much capital in providing stand-by capacity.  One can buy at the cheapest price and thereby manage the delivery of electricity more cheaply.  That is chiefly what the Internal Market in energy offers.</p><p>  On the country-specific recommendations, we will not have a communication until mid-year or thereabouts.</p></speech>

The huge growth in third level participation here probably puts us at one end of the spectrum.  As the Deputy correctly stated, approximately half of the relevant cohort in Germany would take the apprenticeship route.  However, there is a route back, and this underlines the strength of the German system.  It is not the case that someone who takes the apprenticeship route in Germany cannot return to the academic track.  The German authorities allow for transfers back.  Austria is somewhat similar to Germany.  Spain is trying to integrate some of the features of the German system into its own.  We are trying to do likewise.  The difficulty for us in this regard is that we need to develop new apprenticeships, draft new legislation and so on.  In the short term, traineeships - which have very high placement rates - offer the sort of opportunities people require.  I would like to see further developments in this area because possibly it is closer to where our industry stands at present.  In the long term, we want to see those in industry committing to apprenticeships in order to develop the skills bases of their sectors.  In the short term, traineeships could have relevance in Ireland because they are not as time-intensive as apprenticeships, they are not as costly from an employer point of view and the placement rates attaching to them are high.  Perhaps there is an opportunity here for a two-phase strategy.</p><p>  On the issue raised by Deputy Lawlor, it is not so much a question of competition, because the tariffs in high-energy-use sectors are not that high.  It is much more of a relocation threat - in other words, the prospect that businesses will actually move to the US to avail of the advantage of low costs.  That is the real threat, as opposed to existing business being undermined by the free trade agreement.  The tariffs in those high-energy-use sectors are only 2% or 3%.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014021800008#G00700"><p>No, it has nothing to do with that.  The TTIP negotiations make no difference.  The concern is that businesses may move to lower-cost energy sources.  TTIP has no relevance in that regard because it only changes tariffs.  However, the tariffs in this case are extremely low.  Reducing a tariff from 2% to 0% would be neither here nor there in terms of competition if it is possible to avail of energy prices elsewhere that are a half or one third of those that obtain here.  It is not that TTIP could trigger any change in industry location; it is, rather, the sheer difference in prices.  That is a concern in Europe and it is why there is a focus on how we might facilitate a renaissance of industry in Europe and on identifying the sources of competitive advantage we can develop around technology, skills, niche sectors and the application of key enabling technologies.  That is where the debate lies in Europe.  TTIP is not really a significant new source of vulnerability for high-energy-using manufacturing industries in Europe.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a great deal of interest in that matter among members.  Will the Minister indicate how this matter will be approached at the Council meeting?  Will it be the subject of informal discussions beforehand?  Has it been discussed previously?  This issue seems to present a challenge for Europe, particularly in the context of international energy costs.  Will the Minister outline what he intends to say at the meeting in respect of funding for SMEs and access to finance?  How does he believe we can move forward in that area?</p></speech>

Such talk strikes one as odd because our economies have become fixated on activity in areas at the opposite end of the spectrum.  I refer to the focus there has been on information technology, etc.  References to manufacturing and a new industrial revolution jar somewhat in the context of the trend to which we have become accustomed.  Is the Minister of the view that our economy has become very lopsided in the context of its over-dependence on information technology and all the skills and activities associated therewith?  If we were to heed the calls with regard to a new era of manufacturing and a return to making things - the bedrock of economic activity from the earliest times - how would we be positioned?  Is Ireland well placed to make a mark in such a new era of manufacturing?</p></speech>

I am delighted to hear that food labelling is on the agenda for the forthcoming meeting.  I understand that sugar is the main issue in this regard, particularly with regard to the number of ways its presence can be disguised in food through labelling.  Sugar is linked to obesity, especially in children.  I do not know what is the nature of our contribution in respect of this matter.  However, if we can ensure that from a European perspective it is identified as just what it is - namely, sugar - then people will know how much of it is contained in the foods they are eating.</p><p>  Senator Clune referred to finance and SMEs.  There is a need to try to obtain funding in order to encourage entrepreneurs to set up operations.  I welcome the recent report from Mr. Sean O'Sullivan on this matter.  We discussed this matter during our recent visit to Brussels.  There is a need for new and innovative ways of obtaining finance.  There appears to be a challenge for all of us in this regard.  I would welcome the Minister's views on that matter.</p><p>  In recent times I have been talking a great deal about commercialising research.  I sent a report to the Minister on the matter and I am aware that he wants to discuss it with me.  We face a major challenge in establishing how we might commercialise all of our research.  A huge opportunity exists in this regard because Ireland is one of the countries that is best suited to facilitating collaborations between big and small industries and bringing innovation to reality as a result.  This is an issue to which we must give consideration.  As I have stated previously, Ireland is the only country in the OECD that does not facilitate research technology organisations.  Under the OECD model, money can be drawn down by organisations that are not institutions of education.  A major barrier exists in this regard and it must be addressed.</p><p>  I propose that we encourage the development of a mentoring system across Europe.  If such a system were established, then businesses here trying to expand their operations into Europe could do so through what are called "closed networks".  Mentors from all over Europe would be connected together by means of such networks.</p></speech>

I refer to the idea of increasing our proportion of manufacturing.  One of the major threats to manufacturing is the fact that so much money is being funnelled towards assets, whether such assets be properties in south Dublin or assets on a stock exchange elsewhere.  It is with those assets that we are competing for the location of funds.  As central banks make more funds available, unfortunately, most of those funds are bypassing manufacturing - that is, the production of goods, which creates jobs and is productive in the long run - and going into assets.  I ask if increasing that proportion could be part of the Minister's thinking into the future.</p></speech>

Everyone who attends the Council meeting tends to view it from his or her own perspective.  We would see the need for greater interconnection and the need for us, as an isolated energy player, to get more integrated, diversified energy sources.  The approach taken is probably different for different countries.  A new 2030 energy climate framework has just been published by the EU.  That would probably be a backdrop to the discussion.  It is probably fair to say that Ireland is still absorbing what has been set out, and I believe the European Parliament will comment on it.  There are binding targets up to 2020, one being that 20% of energy is to be produced from renewable resources.  It is now setting the targets for the next period, which include a 40% reduction in carbon emissions up to 2030 and that 27% of energy be produced from renewables.  That will be a topic of debate, but I cannot say how the debate will go.  We are still assessing that.  We are very much dependent on other countries as to how they adopt these targets.  Much of the interest in Ireland being a centre for the export of renewables is entirely dependent on what the UK might do.  The debate on this will probably not reach many conclusions.  The reports point to areas in which there is potential for efficiencies, better integration, better use of conservation methods and better examination of the transmission and distribution networks.  They point to things we could be doing and they will probably arise in the debate.</p><p>  Deputy Conaghan asked if the discussion about manufacturing jars with the new trends.  It does not really, because with smarter, more intelligent mechanisation, Europe is becoming competitive again.  We have more customised production that is closer to identifying what the customer needs and meeting it exactly in smaller runs, and that is where Europe feels it is getting back into the game.  The application of ICT and smart infrastructure to the manufacturing process is where we are getting back in the game, but having the right conditions for that to emerge is crucial.  I do not think our economy is lopsided.  It is true that manufacturing has lost 20% to 25% of its employment base in the past ten or 15 years in Ireland and elsewhere generally.  We have taken a big hit in our manufacturing base and we have expanded the services sector generally.  This will be the first year that our service exports exceed our goods exports, which is hard to believe.  We are unique in Europe in that sense.  We have adapted well to the services opportunities and many of our exports are in business services.  We are not lopsided in that sense in that we are ahead of the curve.  There has been more rapid growth in trade in the sectors the Deputy mentioned and we have done well in them.  It would be foolish to forget about manufacturing.  As to how are we are fixed in terms of manufacturing, we have some strong sectors, food being one of them, which is on the verge of a very strong resurgence.  We are very well fixed in some sectors.  We continue to be very competitive in the pharmaceutical sector.  As the patent cliff has hit some products, we have successfully moved in the bio-pharmaceutical sector and we are diversifying and staying relatively ahead of the curve.  Our employment in the overall pharmaceutical sector is steady despite the convulsions that are happening within the sector.  We are pretty well placed.</p><p>  Where Europe can be competitive is in niches in the value chain, as opposed to the whole process.  Companies are increasingly looking at a global supply chain.  Parts of it can be done in one country with a competitive edge, and that is the way we are seeing this develop.  There are some sectors we could not support and in which we could no longer be competitive but there are other areas of manufacturing in which we can be.  That is where we can fit in.  We published a document on manufacturing last year, the recommendations of which we will start to implement this year.  This involves getting companies to look at where they can build their competitive opportunity.<i></i></p><p>  On the Deputy Collins's point on food labelling, I know the Italians are worried about a voluntary system where there may be multiple ways of presenting contents, which could represent an indirect barrier to competition.  It is not so much the principle of it; the concern is about barriers to trade as opposed to why there is labelling of the sugar content in the first place.  That is the issue that will be raised in this context.</p><p>  The Deputy made a fair point in highlighting that all our research spending is channelled through the higher education institutions, and she also raised this issue during the debate on the Estimates.  To be fair, we require 30% funding for any of the significant budgets.  They have to be able to open up to industry, but there is no doubt that there are some exemplars of good practice.  Many people look to Germany, whose models are more diverse.  It has technology centres that have nothing to do with institutes of higher education.  We certainly need to be open to those opportunities.  We are learning in this sphere.  We are trying to make sure our spend, which is small in international terms, is effective.  We are rated as having a good bang for our buck.  We are feeling our way to make sure we spend money most effectively.  It is an area that is certainly worth examining in terms of how can we open up that possibility</p><p>  Tommy Murray has told me there is an Erasmus for entrepreneurships.  That does not quite fit in with the Deputy's suggestion of a trans-European mentoring network.  That is the sort of thing that Commissioner Tajani is very keen on and he is very much pushing the idea that there ought to be European networks for trade missions.  It is something we can certainly pursue with the Commission.</p><p>  The Deputy raised the issue of services.  I fully agree with her that the services sector - as was the case some years ago and as we see in other countries - is one that offers very solid employment with a career structure, but that is not the case in Ireland.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton and his officials.</p><p>  The relationship between Enterprise Ireland and the local authorities is crucial to how the local enterprise offices, LEOs will work.  On Second Stage I welcomed the provision of the service-level agreement, which is a very detailed document and contains measurable targets.  I want to ensure that local authority funding is robust and open to scrutiny so that people will be able to see that funding levels do not change and that enterprise related funding does not get subsumed into the overall budget when the local authority come under pressure.  Let me give an example, many local authorities will be under pressure as a result of the storm damage.  I do not want a situation to arise that will allow the funding allocated to enterprise to be moved to another subhead to alleviate specific pressures.</p><p>  Amendment No. 3 refers to performance targets agreed in service level agreements SLAs.  In order for the SLAs to have real effect there needs to be consequences if Enterprise Ireland or the local authorities do not meet their targets.</p></speech>

My Department will be providing the funding for enterprise support and there will be no question of it being absorbed into the other works of local authorities.  The key to the success of the local enterprise offices is, as the Deputy says, the forging of this new relationship between the staff who were in the county enterprise boards and who will continue to be deployed and the local authority staff who will be coming in.  There will be 120 staff from the county enterprise boards and also 50 staff from the local authority side.  In addition, we estimate there will be the equivalent of approximately 40 staff on the local authority side to provide access to services such as planning advice, who will not be deployed full-time to the local enterprise office.  We reckon that there will be a substantially enhanced service available to local enterprises but it will be made up of enterprise budgets coming from our Department and the provision of staff for some enterprise support services from the local authority.  That is the structure.</p><p>  This year's budget will be better than last year.  We are protecting that budget.  It is our view that forging a relationship between the business service units of the local authorities and the enterprise delivery functions in the existing county enterprise boards will result in a one-stop-shop with a broader range of services available in a single location.  A key to its success will be to achieve a genuine buy-in to the enterprise agenda by the local authorities.  One of the strengths of the proposal is that local authorities have very significant networks and it is our ambition to harness that network.  The Deputy may know that the City and County Managers Association last year published 2,000 initiatives by different local authorities, approximately one third of which would be specific enterprise supports.  Our ambition is to encourage more of that local innovation from local authorities to support enterprise.</p><p>  The Deputy raised another issue which is very much on the money, so to speak, the issue of what happens if a local authority is not delivering.  The approach is not to impose an immediate penalty clause whereby the funding is slashed because that would only mean that local enterprise would suffer.  I refer to the special delivery unit in the health sector which examines individual areas that are not performing to the desired and expected level.  In the same way, the Enterprise Ireland centre of excellence will look at the reasons for any failure with the service level agreement.  The ambition will be to build it up to the expected standard.  There is the possibility for reductions or mergers whereby another local authority could take on the task if there was a complete failure on the part of the original provider but that is not envisaged because we envisage that the delivery will work.  A strong technical support unit within Enterprise Ireland will be a centre for innovative thinking and will help to develop that network to a national standard.  Like most performance-enhancing initiatives in the public service it is about supporting a higher standard of delivery, monitoring and setting standards, encouraging, recognising and rewarding success and supporting those who are not delivering while ensuring that they can enhance service delivery.  We are not planning to take the approach of immediately slashing the budgets of a county that is not performing.  Instead, we plan to work with that county in the interests of the enterprises in that area and to bring them up to the standard that we expect.</p></speech>

The Minister will move on and another colleague may take over the brief.  The commitment for some form of performance review of the relationship needs to be included in the legislation.  The Minister mentioned that another local authority may take over the function.  I do not recall seeing a provision in the legislation for that to happen or perhaps I missed it.  The Minister could be setting up super-LEOs and there is only one of them.</p></speech>

The purpose of this provision is to encourage counties and local authorities to understand that the success of their county depends on the success of their enterprises and in particular the smaller enterprises.  Our aim is to enhance our capacity to reach enterprise by enlisting the support of what is a very significant economic player in the county.  There are long-stop powers to have the service provided by a different local authority but this is not something we would envisage.  A service level agreement of this nature will be organic.</p><p>  We want Enterprise Ireland to be innovative.  For example, micro-finance is an innovation which is being delivered through the local enterprise offices.  We would like to enhance mentoring and perhaps re-organise the system of mentoring so that in cases where a county would not have access to specialists that these could be provided through the network.  The service level agreements will emerge and evolve over time but the performance metrics are an inherent part of them so they will be published.  The service level agreement will set out the metrics that are to be delivered.  The allocation of the annual budget will be revised based on demand and quality of service.  If a county is not delivering and is unable to justify the level of activity as against the budget allocation, the first issue will be to examine whether the continuing level of budget allocation is justified.  This is the conversation we envisage.</p><p>  Service level agreements are at an early stage of development.  The Department has service level agreements with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and all departmental agencies and offices and we are learning to use them.  They are a very important way of empowering a Department such as ours to have a better policy input, better monitoring and a better capacity to understand and to drive change.</p></speech>

One of the major problems we have in this country is that we do not enforce compliance and regulation, which often leaves workers and people within the system vulnerable.  One of the reasons we have this problem is due to the lack of funding going into enforcement and the lack of processes to incentivise proper compliance with regulation.  We can do this at no cost to the State.  While I have a particular problem with the local property tax, what the Government did was logical.  If a person who puts an extension onto their House wants to apply to claim back VAT over a few years, he or she must make sure they are tax compliant.  Therefore, it incentivises people on a cost free basis to be compliant with local taxes.  </p><p>  From speaking to subcontractors that a number of them would say that the legislation is positive.  However, there is no enforcement with regard to subcontractors.  We could incentivise compliance among subcontractors by providing that unless they are fully compliant they cannot tender for Government jobs.  We could provide for the same with regard to compliance to employment law and Labour Court judgments.  We could provide that unless they are compliant in that regard they will not entitled to draw down grant funding or any other service from a local enterprise office in the future.  That no doubt would improve compliance on a cost free basis to the State and would have a positive effect on the experience of workers in businesses.  That is the idea behind this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2014021800004#C00400"><p>I agree with the sentiment that we should ensure that people who get State support are compliant.  We propose there will be a procedures manual for the local enterprise offices.  We are currently working on that and a requirement of compliance with labour law will be included in that review.  We will examine exactly what the Deputy has set out.  We must strike a balance.  Some of these are very small micro start-ups.  We do not want to set up excessively onerous compliance statements.  We need to use judgment here.  Clearly, our intention is that compliance with tax, labour and basic environmental law and all of those areas will be requirements.  We need to examine what nature of compliance presentation we would expect.</p><p>  The Deputy's amendment provides that companies would be compliant with Labour Court judgments.  We have a voluntary system of industrial relations.  I would not envisage getting involved in industrial relations and mixing industrial relations into this area.  That would not be the right approach to take.  On the issue of compliance with Labour Court judgments, both sides can put forward reasons where people are in dispute or are unhappy with a Labour Court judgment and we try to deal with those issues but we do so within the tradition that we have in place.  Therefore, I do not think the inclusion of that area is appropriate here.  However, on the main thrust of what the Deputy has said, namely, that we should ensure that clients of our local enterprise offices are compliant across the law, that is certainly something we will seek to build into the procedures manual and to have a way of certifying that.</p></speech>

Will it be watertight?  Why not give it the force of law while we are at this stage of the process and have it as a guaranteed right for employees where if they are working for a company that is not compliant, that company will not have opportunities to draw down taxpayers' money to either grant aid or support its business in any way?  The law itself needs to be discerning between different types of compliant and non-compliant businesses.  Why not give this requirement the strength of law?</p></speech>

I do not think that we should set up a body, the job of which is to support the growth of enterprise, and in some way to try to reserve to it a policing role in regard to areas like Revenue where Revenue has a panoply of powers available to it to enforce its codes.  I do not see that we would be doing anything for the quality of Revenue enforcement by having a five-person local enterprise office in a county seeking to challenge a business in regard to enforcement.  I do not think this is something we would put into law.  What we need is to have is a system where, like in other areas, there is an expectation that companies which apply will be compliant, but should not tie it into a legislative framework where they would be penalised and all grants would have to refunded, or whatever it would be.  That is not a sensible way to proceed.</p></speech>

People can inadvertently fail to comply with any item of legislation but what we seek to do here is to provide a first-stop-shop to make sure that particularly new small businesses are aware of their obligations and opportunities.  The reason we are bringing in, for example, the local authority, which is in charge of licensing in respect of their environmental or planning obligations, is that we are providing a one-stop-shop where businesses can get information about their compliance requirements but we are not moving on from that to create this as part of a more penal measure.</p><p>  One of the kickbacks from the idea of the involvement of the local authorities was that many businesses were saying this will mean they will use their obligation to collect rates, in effect, with regard to the enterprise support.  We need to keep responsibilities under different codes separate as well as enforcement.  We do not want to create an environment where the attitude would be that businesses should not engage with certain bodies because all they are after is to see if one had paid one's rates on time or whatever it would be.  This is not the function here, rather it is to support enterprise in the local area.  That is what we want to do.  While compliance is fine, to start implying that no grant will be applied and having a penal dimension to this would not be in the spirit of what we are trying to achieve here.  We are trying to promote new start-ups.  </p></speech>

We will also go further in establishing a first-stop shop to allow companies to access information in respect of relevant areas.   They will also have access to a service in respect of local obligations, including licensing, health regulations and planning regulations.  We will promote compliance and make it easier for companies to be compliant.  One of the features of a first-stop shop is that it makes compliance easier.  We will not, however, require local enterprise offices to perform the Revenue task of enforcing compliance with the tax code.  To do so would be a step too far.  The Deputy is arguing that a small office with five staff should ensure compliance before paying out any grant.  We will not require these offices to enforce every element of the tax code.</p></speech>

The service level agreement must be reviewed formally every three years.  It must not be allowed simply to evolve or become the subject of an informal process.  It would be prudent to provide that a formal review will be undertaken every three years to ensure the agreement is current and reflects technological developments in business practices.  </p></speech>

This is technical legislation which moves the functions previously located in the country enterprise boards to Enterprise Ireland and allows them to enter into arrangements.  We should not set out a legal obligation in this sphere.  I accept, however, that we should re-examine the service level agreements every three years.  I will be pleased to make this a policy expectation and report back in three years to make an arrangement that we will have a three-year review.  That is a reasonable expectation on the part of the Deputy.</p></speech>

Will the Minister explain where it is suggested in this relatively simple amendment that a charge to the State would arise?  Many in the business community believe local authorities do not fully understand business, especially small businesses.  Some local authorities, including Mayo County Council, are making serious efforts to make this model work, while others treat businesses as a charging centre for development levies and rates.  They do not necessarily get business.</p><p>  Under the service level agreement, the local enterprise office will be subject to the usual oversight at local authority level.  This involves reporting to plenary meetings which are nodded through without much discussion.  I want elected councillors from all parties and none to engage in oversight.  There should also be some form of business input into an oversight board, particularly in the early years.</p></speech>

The amendment would reinstate a similar board in an oversight position and would, therefore, be in conflict with the principle of the Bill, as read a second time.  The amendment is also ruled out under Standing Order 131(1).  The Deputy should seek a full explanation from the Bills Office.

I have in mind companies which provide a service in the local community.  While Enterprise Ireland has stated it will make every effort to understand such companies, its focus, understandably, is on companies that want to export and high potential start-ups.  It does a very good job in that respect.  The amendment would require Enterprise Ireland to focus on the needs of the butcher, baker and candlestick maker, as it were, by are currently supported by country enterprise boards, for example, through training.  Businesses need to be trained and briefed in areas such as employment law, an issue raised by Deputy T&oacute;ibin.  Many enterprise boards used to provide such training.

The reason we established a small business centre of excellence in Enterprise Ireland is to do just as he proposes.  We need to create within national policy institutions a drive to improve the capacity of small businesses at local level to establish and grow.  Implicit in this is that the domestic economy and export orientated sectors are equally important.  We have established a small business unit, whose role, through the transfer of functions, will include the domestic economy, not only the exporting economy.  We are transferring functions that require the small business unit it to deliver in this area.  It will be up to the Department, through oversight and the delivery of services, to ensure we continue to support the non-exporting sector.</p><p>  There is a clear desire to have a thriving domestic economy as well as export sector.  We are bringing a wider range of business into the heart of government policy-making on enterprise.  We will not support companies by providing grants but softer supports such as mentoring will be provided.  We continue to believe that grants are not appropriate because if one grant-aids one company in the domestic economy, one is effectively supporting one competitor against another.</p></speech>

We have met those involved and worked out the delivery expectations.  That will continue and intensify as we move to the set-up process.  We will be meeting all the county and city managers to drive home the opportunity and responsibility of this, and we will underpin that with the service level agreement.  Most local authorities are very much aware that the future of their county depends on this.  To be fair, many of them have been doing very interesting things.  For example, those in Cork county hive off 1% of the rate base to support enterprise.  Many counties have been doing interesting things on their own but this offers the opportunity bring about peer review and mainstream good practices.  It is about giving people a chance through the centre of excellence and Enterprise Ireland to look at what innovative local authorities are doing.  Part of the budget will also be on a competitive basis, so the local enterprise offices offering to do more interesting things will have access to additional funds.</p></speech>

We are moving away from having locally elected representatives involved in this enterprise function, and it will be purely a matter for unelected officials.  That is wrong.  The role and oversight of local business people in the running of county enterprise boards has been important so there should be some way of involving business people in some sort of advisory function in a LEO.  We will get back to this on Report Stage in a way that is amenable to the Bills Office.</p></speech>

Those involved will have access to metrics and key executives.  I would look to local councillors to be a big part of the enthusiastic drivers of a better enterprise strategy coming from local authorities.  I see the role of local authorities not as being token members of a board but rather recognising that this is something in which there should be an interest from a strategic perspective within the county.  Every councillor should be interested in the issue and report back, asking whether more can be done and driving the pace.  Perhaps I have a different view or experience of local authorities.  Local councillors can play a very good role in the area.</p><p>  The evaluation committee will have local business people on it and we will retain that connection to the business community.  We also expect that LEOs will be part of building a wider pro-enterprise network with the local authority.  This means we could have a series of networks and initiatives filtering from the business community that would be taken on by the local authority and enterprise office.  Part of the role is to build that necessary entrepreneurship environment.  For example, I would see a very close connection between the LEO and the community enterprise centres, of which we have more than 100 scattered around the country.  I saw a recent report on them and they have space which we can use as an asset, and I expect local enterprise offices to drive the use of those assets within a county to the advantage of enterprise.</p><p>  I disagree with Deputy Calleary's view.  Ultimately, oversight will be provided by the service level agreement through Enterprise Ireland.  Local councillors and businesses will have roles and the process will be run professionally, with a national standard being applied and a centre of excellence driving innovation within the network.  It is a balanced package and even if I was on the opposite side of the House, I would argue in favour of this approach rather than having a token councillor on a board.  In my experience with local authorities, such membership is not anything as effective as when the council acts as a unit and takes on the view of driving initiatives across a county.  That is a better role, and local councillors should take a greater responsibility in scrutinising activities occurring in the area.  We are trying to devolve into local authorities an important enterprise delivery process.  If councillors take this on, it could be a model for other types of devolution, which would have councillors holding to account parts of the State in a better way for a county.</p></speech>

Cork will have LEOs and rural development Leader groups so the consumers will know where to go and have access to a wide range of services.  People will be able to communicate in the network and there are business people from civil society.  People will be asked to step up; although some are good at sitting back and complaining about the State not doing enough, there is often much going on of which they are unaware.  There is a responsibility on private or civil society to get involved and influence that.  I have asked about enterprise assets before and it is important that LEOs are in rural areas, even if it is just for one day per month.  They must almost provide an opportunity for business people in an area to talk to representatives and express needs.  That would be a really worthwhile exercise.</p></speech>

I saw recently an interesting point in a review of mentoring to the effect that two thirds of all mentoring is of start-up businesses while only one third is of existing businesses.  The point was made that this is not a proper balance.  One should really be considering the strengthening of one's existing base of SMEs or micro-enterprises.  That reflects the point that Deputy Collins is making.  We need to look not only to the start-up businessman walking in the door but also to the assets in many micro-businesses that are already in place to determine whether the latter can be strengthened with a view to development.  A general weakness of ours lies in this area.  Part of looking afresh at manufacturing involves recognising that we have considerable manufacturing capability, often in rural areas, that could be the source of greater growth.  I accept the point in this regard.</p><p>  On Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's point, we are determined that there will be local access.  Since we set up the action plan for jobs process, we have had the objective of going into the communities to meet the businesspeople.  We expect LEOs to be working with local business networks and to provide opportunities for people to have an input regarding their work.  This is not to create some sort of detached ivory tower.  I do not believe a board is necessary for what we desire.  What we need is to set a standard and an expectation of how the work should be done.  It is a question of having a pro-enterprise, pro-entrepreneurship location in the county and using influence and power to create the appropriate environment.  An absolute requirement is that the LEOs would be networking regularly with their client base.  I agree that we need to have the offices plugged into local enterprise.  I do not agree that we need a board to do that as the system we have can deliver it.</p></speech>

Current employees of the county enterprise boards will, upon dissolution, become members of Forf&aacute;s&rsquo;s superannuation scheme, the Enterprise Ireland superannuation scheme or a local authority scheme, as appropriate.  This is provided for in section 12(5)(<i>a</i>).  It provides for their entitlement to superannuation benefits to be calculated and paid by the body that accepted them into its employment.  This is already in the Bill, as laid down.  As it stands today, Enterprise Ireland does not have a superannuation scheme but will establish one once the Forf&aacute;s legislation has been enacted.  The Bill allows Enterprise Ireland to become an employer in its own right.</p><p>  The amendment at section 12(5)(a) is to deal with the existing and deferred pensioners from the county enterprise boards.  The amendment to section 8 is input to ensure that the liability for those pensioners does not transfer to Enterprise Ireland.  The amendment at section 12(5)(b) allows for the responsibility and liability for those pensioners to transfer to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and for those pensions to be calculated and paid by the Minister.  The amendment at section 12(5)(c) is to ensure that the functions in regard to any existing pension schemes that were invested in a county enterprise board will now be vested in the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  I may have another amendment on Report Stage referring to the administration of the pensions for existing pensioners and it involves the existing pensioners for Forf&aacute;s and Shannon Development also.  My officials are currently working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to finalise this.  It may be the case that no amendment is needed in this Bill and that the matter will be handled in the Industrial Development (Forf&aacute;s Dissolution) Bill 2013.  This was just to ensure that existing pensioners were catered for in the legislation.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive officer and am joined by my colleagues Mr. Kevin O'Donovan, chief development officer, and Mr. Peter Harte, chief technology officer.  The company was established in 2008 and specialises in the development of onshore wind electricity generation.  It has a presence in 16 countries.  We have Irish offices in Tullamore and Cork city.  Through our Greenwire project, we propose developing 40 wind farms on 20,000 ha of land in the midlands to generate electricity for export to the United Kingdom on a new, dedicated grid connection.</p><p>  Public debate on topics of national importance such as this is always welcome.  It provides us with an opportunity to discuss the benefits of our proposal in a national forum and set out how the project can be a catalyst for economic recovery in the midlands.  I acknowledge the anxieties that have been expressed by many in regard to wind energy in general, and the proposal for the midlands in particular.  I am very much aware that we have an obligation to allay concerns and provide answers to many questions raised.</p><p>  We are moving towards a European energy market where a trans-European power network connecting countries across Europe would facilitate surplus power flowing to where electricity is needed.  It would make Ireland more self-reliant in the event of a crisis.  In Ireland, we have an abundance of wind, much more than we need ourselves.  Therefore, we have an opportunity to create a new export industry, such as our beef and dairy export businesses, creating thousands of jobs.</p><p>  In its document Strategy for Renewable Energy: 2012&ndash;2022, the Government has identified the exportation of renewable energy as one of five strategic goals.  With that in mind, the Irish and British Governments are hoping to deliver an intergovernmental agreement very soon to facilitate the trading of renewable energy between the two countries.  A strategic environmental assessment and new planning guidelines are being drafted by the Irish Government.  Our project, therefore, is in line with Government policy.</p><p>  The Greenwire proposal is very timely in light of developments in the United Kingdom energy market.  Our British neighbours have been energy-independent since the discovery of North Sea oil and gas in the 1970s but these reserves are nearing depletion and the United Kingdom is once again facing reliance on imported energy to meet its demand.  The United Kingdom is also decommissioning its ageing nuclear and coal power stations, which currently supply 20% of its energy.  The United Kingdom has made a commitment that 30% of its electricity will be from renewable resources by 2020.  While it has three times as much onshore wind as Ireland, it will need another 12,000 MW of renewable energy capacity before 2020 to achieve this target.  This is why Britain's energy challenge should be seen as Ireland's opportunity.  However, it is important to note that the United Kingdom has other options for meeting its energy needs, including offshore wind energy, hydroelectricity, thermal energy from Iceland and nuclear energy from France. Ireland must take the opportunity or risk missing the chance to create the new export sector.</p><p>  The midlands possesses an enormous and largely untapped natural resource in wind energy.  Tapping that resource could have a transformative effect on the economy in the region.  Our planning laws require that for projects of such scale there must be a community contribution.  If granted planning permission for Greenwire, Element Power intends to establish a comprehensive community-benefit programme to assist the community where the wind farms are located, particularly people living closest to the turbines.  The entire local community would reap the dividends from our project, not just landowners, local authorities, businesses, tradesmen and others.</p><p>  The community-benefit programme would be established prior to construction and would operate for the duration of the wind farms' commercial lifetime.  We have met numerous voluntary community groups, development associations, local enterprise bodies, sports clubs and societies across the five counties where the project is proposed.  These meetings have taken place as a part of a series of public information days in addition to an  extensive consultation programme, which has been under way since 2012.  The feedback garnered to date has been extremely positive on many levels.  The community-benefit programme would have a number of components, particularly a near-neighbour fund for those living closest to the turbines, a local community fund, an educational fund and an enterprise fund.  The near-neighbour fund would include the financing of practical energy projects for individual households.  It would be established such that those living closest to the wind farms would receive direct supports from those farms.  We propose that all families living within 1 km of a turbine benefit directly from the project.  We are engaging with the community to see how best the fund might operate.</p><p>  The local community fund would distribute finance annually to deserving projects within the communities where the wind farms are located.  We have met over 100 community groups over the past two years that are interested in participating in this programme.  The educational fund would help to finance educational initiatives for students in communities where wind farms are located.  The local enterprise fund would foster local enterprise and employment creation through the support of small and local businesses.</p></speech>

We have made our submission to the committee and I will not read it laboriously.  I will just make some comments on the wider context.</p><p>  Unless one understands the concept of climate change, the need for limiting unrestricted further penetration of fossil fuels, greenhouse gases and what they are and how they impact on global temperature and climate, it will be hard to convince any member of this committee of the benefits or otherwise of renewable energy and low-carbon energy.  The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, have published reports clearly linking greenhouse gas emissions, global temperature increase and climate change.  Indeed, this committee, in November 2013, referenced the conclusion that a 2&deg; rise in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels was a trigger for dangerous climate change.  This thinking has impacted on the global response and how the globe is trying to manage this clear threat to the world.</p><p>  Restricting the rise in global temperature to 2&deg; will require reductions of greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 90% below 1990 levels by 2050.  This equates to approximately 450 parts per million of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents.  Actually, we have gone off that trajectory.  This year, we are expected to breach the 400 parts per million for the first time.  This has a massive impact and it is being clearly demonstrated.  It has an ecological impact for wildlife and we see it already in rising sea levels.  In Ireland, for example, it has been exacerbating the flood effects of heavy rainfall.  These so-called one in 50 year weather events - Bord na M&oacute;na is familiar with this area and has very clean data dating back to the 1950s and 1960s - are now happening annually.</p><p>  There has been little media or other comment regarding the devastating floods in Cork, Limerick and elsewhere pertaining to the impact of climate.  It has been very much focused on response and whether we were ready for them.  However, one person who must be listened to is the head scientist of the British Meteorology Office, Dame Julia Slingo.  She said that while none of the individual storms had been exceptional - she was talking about Britain but one could reference it to Ireland - the clustering and persistence were extremely unusual.  She said:<blockquote>We have seen exceptional weather.  We cannot say it's unprecedented, but it is certainly exceptional.  Is it consistent with what we might expect from climate change?  Of course, as yet there can be no definitive answer ... but if we look at the broader base of evidence then we see things that support the premise that climate change has been making a contribution.</blockquote>In response to this global threat and notwithstanding the absence of a fully agreed global deal, the EU has embarked on a path to a low carbon future, with targets to reduce 2050 emissions by 80% to 90%.  Indeed, the recently published EU framework proposal for 2030, which is a follow-up to its 2020 framework, would see renewable energy targets of 27% above the 20% penetration and a greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 40% below 1990 levels, which is double the 2020 target.</p><p>  In this global and regional environment, Ireland must recognise our outstanding renewable energy resources.  We have outstanding renewable energy resources, not just in wind but also in biomass.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.172" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Swords" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021800005#D00300"><p>On behalf of Mr. Joseph Caulfield, Mr. Ultan Murphy and Ms Agnes Doolan, I thank the joint committee for the invitation to appear before it.  My name is Pat Swords and I am a fellow of the Institution of Chemical Engineers and a chartered environmentalist.  I have more than 25 years' experience in industrial design over a wide range of industrial projects encompassing food, drink, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and power stations.  Moreover, I have spent ten years and more travelling to and from central and eastern Europe while helping to bring in the environmental legislation into the new and emerging member states.  I have nothing to sell and do not have a dream.  However, we seek one thing, and that is what Turn 180 is, namely, to turn around, go back and re-evaluate the situation, particularly within the legal framework in which we operate.</p><p>  We have at present a recently-appointed expert panel on pylons.  Had the evaluation and assessments of that project been done three years ago in the legally required strategic environmental assessment process with the proper stages of public participation, we would not need that expert panel.  It would have been done in accordance with the law and the obligation to have public participation and information.  A strategic environmental assessment was never completed for the Irish renewable energy programme and no assessment has ever been done for it.  It was on this basis, having documented it, that the United Nations Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee in Geneva took the communication in my name against the European Union as a party to the convention.  At that stage, Ireland had not ratified the convention and consequently, I was obliged to take the matter against the European Union.  The compliance committee ruled that the European Union had broken the terms of the convention with regard to the manner in which it was implementing the national renewable energy action plans.  It failed to provide the necessary information to the public, it had failed to ensure the public participation was carried out when all options were open and effective public participation could take place and it had failed to take due account of the public participation in the final decision.  Consequently, it has been told to go back and repeat and engage with the public and to do it again.  As this is not happening at present, the compliance committee is engaged in compliance proceedings against the European Union at the forthcoming meeting of the parties' treaty convention in June 2014.  There also are ongoing proceedings in the High Court in my name against the Irish State with regard to this matter.</p><p>  The evidence given by the European Union to the compliance committee basically pointed out it is generally recognised that renewable energy - and wind energy in particular - is better from an environmental perspective than non-renewable sources.  The point of it being "generally recognised" is what this comes down to, as no assessments have been carried out at European Union or national level to quantify what actually is going on.  In fact, in its opening statement to the compliance committee in Geneva in 2011, the European Union made it clear the Irish public was not entitled to information, other than regarding what was a threat to its environment.  In particular, the public most certainly was not entitled to information on cost-effectiveness related to renewable energy.  Consequently, this matter led to a further communication, on which I assisted, with our near neighbours, the United Kingdom, which also ruled that its national renewable energy action plan had breached the terms of the convention, had not been assessed properly and had not gone through the stages of public participation with the public.  Both countries in which this renewable export programme is being furthered have serious legal failings with regard to information and the public participation process.</p><p>  As an experienced engineer who has worked on power generation projects and who has seen things work or not work, one keeps saying to oneself that when it comes to providing a reliable economic electricity system such as we have had for generations, all this talk about outstanding natural resources of wind energy is, I am afraid, bunk.  It will not work.  Experienced engineers are making this point all over the world.  Even my own mother, who has no education beyond secondary school and is in her 80s, can figure this out.  How is one expected to cook a turkey for Christmas when one is waiting around for the wind to blow in order to have electricity in the oven?  That is the bottom line.  Consequently, I refer to recent statements to the effect that the Irish renewable energy programme is a no-brainer and that Ireland will save huge amounts in respect of fossil fuels.</p></speech>

We should have had the debate long ago.  People have many concerns, which is the reason for today&rsquo;s meeting.</p><p>  My first question is for Element Power.  Reference was made to a lot of land lease options that have already been made in regard to its proposals.  One is with the semi-State agency, Coillte.  Could someone expand on the extent of the land lease options?  It was also stated that 1,000 options exist with farming families.  Could some information be provided in that regard?  Are the arrangements ready to go, subject to planning applications being made?</p><p>  Element Power also referred to local community dividend.  I hear opposing views on the matter.  There is much controversy in the public domain and opposition has been voiced at public meetings.  How successful is the company in promoting local community dividends?  Does the company have the support of any community groups?</p><p>  Element Power also mentioned that no overhead lines are associated with its projects.  I find that hard to believe.  Is it proposed to underground all the lines from generation, transmission, distribution and for the connection with the grid?  I would like some clarification in that regard.</p></speech>

That process involved looking at areas that are environmentally designated and carrying out a detailed analysis to identify regions that could be suitable for development.  As part of that one has to meet landowners and see if they are interested in considering wind development projects.  Agreements would be made with landlords to investigate the development of wind farms on their lands.  We have option agreements in place with private landowners and with Coillte as well.  Coillte lands have been used quite a lot for wind development already in other parts of the country.  We are at the stage now of assessing those lands where we have agreements with the landowners to determine if the sites are suitable.</p><p>  In terms of the local community dividend and community groups supporting the project, we have an office set up in Tullamore with a team which specialises in going out and meeting local community groups.  We have published thousands of newsletters.  We have a website and a lo-call phone number.  The idea is to get feedback from the community in terms of reaction to the project.  A range of reactions have been received to date.  We found engaging directly with community groups to be very successful.  We try to explain what is involved in the project, the stage it is at and at the fact that there is still a long process prior to the development of the project.  The groups range from local voluntary groups, development groups, sporting organisations, local societies and anyone who wants to talk to our team in Tullamore.</p></speech>

What that involves is groups of turbines being put together.  The power from them is gathered onto low voltage cables and then they converge on intermediate step-up substations.  Around 20 of those will be located throughout the midlands.  From those 20 substations higher voltage cables - again underground - on public roads and on private lands, will gather the power to converter stations.  We will have two large converter stations which covert the power to DC, which is the most suitable way of transporting the power over much longer distances specifically to take the power to the UK.  That will deliver the power to two connection points, one in north Wales and one in southern Wales.  We will put everything underground.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy for setting the context around the climate change debate, something which we are not discussing enough in this country.  In recent weeks there was extreme flooding on various river basins and in villages and towns in my constituency in Waterford.  That should act as a wake-up call.  Reference was made to one in 50 year weather events.  The context is important in terms of energy security and how we will reduce our carbon emissions.</p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na has 80,000 ha of land in its stewardship.  How much of that is redundant?  Does Bord na M&oacute;na propose to introduce wind farms to its land holdings?  Reference was made to isolated locations and that there are no dwelling houses within the vicinity.  Could Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy please expand further on the issue?  If the wind farms were not to go ahead on the land, what other uses would be possible?  Such land is a national asset as it is owned by a semi-State company.  Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy identified an economic use for the land which is now redundant.  Could it be put to a better use?</p><p>  I agree with much of what was said about a proper planning process.  That is where public confidence comes into play in terms of proper spatial planning.  It is important to note that the Government is putting out for public consultation new guidelines on the development of wind farms.  I welcome that.  No matter who the developer is &ndash; Bord na M&oacute;na or a private developer &ndash; proper planning process must be adhered to.  Could Mr. D&rsquo;Arcy clarify the position on the Bord na M&oacute;na lands?</p></speech>

Our contract with nature is a vision which plays to the concept of sustainability.  Our definition of sustainability is not just economic.  As a key semi-State organisation we need to be profitable, to deliver dividends to the State and to manage our affairs in a responsible manner.</p></speech>

This is a finite resource and progressively over time less of the land will be related to peat production activities.  As an entity licensed by the EPA under the integrated pollution prevention control licensing regime we have an obligation to stabilise the peatlands when we finish the production process.  A team of ecologists is engaged in restoration and rehabilitation work designed to achieve stabilisation of the peatlands.  We have a number of examples of projects where we have successfully rehabilitated and restored peatlands throughout the country, particularly in north-west Mayo and the midlands.  This was recognised recently when the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht published the national peatlands strategy and the review of special areas of conservation, SAC, and natural heritage areas, NHAs.  The review mentioned some Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands would be designated as SACs and NHAs, which recognises the work done by Bord na M&oacute;na in restoring and rehabilitating peatlands.</p><p>  One of the great advantages of use of these peatlands for wind farms is, as we mentioned in our statement, it is possible to co-locate rehabilitated and restored peatlands and tourism amenities and activities on lands which are also used for wind farms.  This is one of the great attractions of the wind farm project.  By and large, it is true to state the range of uses for these peatlands after they have finished cutaway is relatively limited.  In a large number of cases they will revert to natural amenities for the communities located in the areas.  It is possible to place projects such as wind farms on these lands, which will help create economic as well as tourism amenity projects in localities throughout the country.</p></speech>

I note it has a very sceptical stance on the development of renewables and I would like a better understanding of this.  Given what we have heard other witnesses state, does Turn 180 believe climate change is having a negative impact on the environment, particularly when one considers the Irish environment and the weather systems we have experienced in recent years?  Does Turn 180 believe there is a need to address this particular problem with regard to climate change?</p></speech>

It is not that everybody thinks the same way we do.  There are many parts of the world which do not think the way we do.  The Chinese are very analytical.  The Chinese Academy of Sciences, which I fully support, correctly pointed out the flaws in the scientific process which has led the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  Many technical people do not support the position we are in now.  A one in 50 year flood will occur once every 50 years; one must just wait around.</p><p>  The renewable programme was first initiated 16 years ago by the European Union.  No real assessment was done for it.  Under the 2001 directive the European Union was required to conduct an assessment by 2005 of the external impact of non-renewable sources.  External impacts are the environmental damage costs associated with non-renewable sources.  The report was to be repeated every five years.  I looked for it but it was never done.  It then launched into a massive 20% renewable programme.  At no stage was it worked out what was to be built, where it was to be built, what was the impact and what was the cost.  People were not allowed to participate in the decision, which was taken at higher levels.</p><p>  With regard to climate change, a figure of &euro;25 per tonne was pulled out of the sky because they did not know what carbon dioxide was doing.  They also had a computer model in the National Technical University of Athens which stated we would save X tonnes of carbon dioxide.  Nobody has been able to access this programme.  It is the confidential property of the university.  It is clear from reading some of the side notes to it that it completely fails to take account of the massive inefficiencies we carry on the grid in existing thermal power plants as more and more renewables are put on.</p><p>  The 20% target was shared among the member states based on their existing renewable capacity and a factor based on gross domestic product.  The European Union did not know what was to be built in Ireland, what good it was to do, and when we would achieve the 16% target.  All of the member states had to implement in a rush a national renewable energy action plan.  Such plans should have been subject to strategic environmental assessment but this was bypassed.  Section 5.3 of the template for these plans asked for the expected greenhouse gas reductions, the expected costs and the expected to job creation.  The Irish national renewable energy action plan goes from section 5.2 to section 5.4.  The table was never filled out.  It was not filled out in 19 member states.  Other countries such as the UK fudged it.  The UK referred to another document which did not assess it either.  We need to go back and look at this from square one.</p></speech>

We all know the three main contributors to carbon emissions in this country are agriculture, transport and the energy sector.  Given our economic dependence on agriculture and transport it would seem obvious the energy sector is the place to look to making the savings.  Does Mr. Swords not agree with this?  All political parties are pushing to set targets.  I do not believe we should set targets.  We should assess the situation.  However I believe we do need to address it before it is too late.  Mr. Swords believes we should not publish the legislation and that we need to do impact assessments beforehand.</p><p>  With regard to energy security, Mr. Swords dismissed wind energy altogether in his statement.  Does he not agree efficiencies are being made in power stations as we speak?  I know the Great Island station in the south-east is being converted from an oil station to a gas station and it is doubling its capacity.  These measures are being taken but we need to do more than this.  Wind energy can be part of the solution.  I certainly would not state it can be the complete solution, but given the natural resources we have available to us does Mr. Swords agree wind energy can be part of the overall energy security solution?</p></speech>

As I stated, the planet has not increased in temperature in the past 16 years.  I spent ten years going over and back to Eastern Europe.  I sat for many months at the end of Bulevardul Unirii in Bucharest in the ministry of the environment looking at Ceausescu's palace.  Something I learned there is the environment does not belong to the state but to the people.  The people must be given robust procedural rights.  As Deputy Coffey rightly pointed out, adopting climate change targets has a huge impact on agriculture and other issues.</p></speech>

There is a company called Kilpaddoge Energy, and one of the owners of that company is in this committee room now.  Kilpaddoge Energy has applied to Kerry County Council to install 52 diesel generators in a plant in Kilpaddoge, County Kerry.  On its website it clearly states that the purpose of this plant is to back up wind energy.  We used to have a peat burner in Lumcloon, Ferbane, in west County Offaly.  That will become a gas burner and the website of Lumcloon Energy states that the purpose of that gas burner will be to back up wind energy.  Wind energy is adding more fossil fuel generation to the grid, not subtracting it, because it is not capable of displacement.  Displacement means when one adds 1,000 MW of wind generation one takes 1,000 MW of fossil fuel off.  It is not doing that.  It is doing the opposite.  It is adding, because of intermittency.  On a calm day in this country we produce 95% of our electricity from fossil fuels.  I will give Deputy Coffey a hint, and I hope he can read between the lines.  Every day, France produces 5% of its electricity from fossil fuel generation, while we produce 95% from fossil fuel on a calm day.</p></speech>

We import 88% of our energy, mainly gas and oil.  In 2009 we set renewable energy targets of 16% for gross final consumption by 2020 and 42% for renewable energy penetration, as Mr. D'Arcy said.  Wind can be part of the mix.  As Deputy Coffey said, this source of generation can only be included through a suite of measures including wave, biomass and wind.</p><p>  Mr. Caulfield mentioned areas such as Tarbert and Lumcloon, which are on the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER's to-do list regarding the provision of energy into the renewable and electricity markets.  I am very disappointed at CER's progress on that.  Companies such as Lumcloon, which has a connection to the grid, a licence and planning permission, can contribute to the energy sector and be a backup to the existing wind energy provisions without anything coming on stream into the future.</p><p>  The big issue is that there is massive new technology and larger wind turbines are being contracted at a lower elevations than was previously the case.  Everybody seems to agree that the guidelines are outdated.  Even the proposed guidelines in draft form could be construed to be outdated based on the number of submissions being made.  The other guidelines from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the EPA's guidelines on noise and best practice, published in 2013, have no statutory power.  We must address that issue.  Some statutory power must be given.</p><p>  Mr. D'Arcy and I know that Bord na M&oacute;na, in its history, was one of the main drivers of the midlands economy, particularly in my county of Offaly.  It had to evolve and meet changing demands, alter work practices, diversify and seek new revenue streams.  It did that by consultation through communities and with its work force and by negotiation.  No amount of imposition from the top down achieves the sort of results we all desire.  It will be the same in this instance, in realising the potential that may exist, but only if there is proper consultation.  Mr. D'Arcy mentioned that there must be a proper planning process.  That is an indication that the existing planning process is not proper and does not meet with the satisfaction of those who will be affected most and who may benefit most from what is proposed by all and sundry.</p><p>  There is talk of the benefits of value-added jobs but the numbers cannot be quantified now.  Both governments have entered into a memorandum of understanding about the export of electricity from this source.  The Element Power representatives said they were anxious that an intergovernmental agreement would supersede and take the place of the MoU.  If one does not have proper planning processes in place, and one acknowledges that, one cannot expect the MoU to be replaced now with an intergovernmental agreement.  Most of the cutaway bogs are almost entirely cut away.  The day of the public service obligation, PSO, is coming to an end.  We can see that with the proposed sale of power plants in Shannonbridge and Lough Ree.  There is a role, as there has been, for energy production in our region into the future.  The cutaway bogs are the prime location where that should begin.  We will see how it progresses thereafter.</p><p>  The new proper planning guidelines must be put in place.  I hear the benefits that can accrue to localities, communities and local authorities.  They would be great and most welcome and they would address many of the concerns and issues that many candidates will have when they put themselves before the electorate for the local authority election in May.  This would make their job much easier when one considers the lack of funding available to them from the sources to which they have become accustomed in the past.  It is simple to say that nuclear power would bring much economic benefit too.  That is not to say it would meet with the approval of the localities where it would be sited.</p><p>  We must ask some real and honest questions and I would like to hear the opinions of those before us today in answering those questions honestly.  They might take stock of where they are regarding the consultations that are taking place with landowners in areas of counties that are not designated within county development plans, within counties which have had the foresight in the past to acknowledge the potential that exists in this area and consult with their localities, communities and county with a view to arriving at a consensus whereby areas might be designated for consideration where the experts with the planning expertise who are to protect society and communities thereafter would be charged with the responsibility for adjudicating on any such applications.</p></speech>

We are trying to develop a new export industry for Ireland.  A number of constituent parts must be put in place before we can create this new industry.  The IGA is part of that, as well as the planning guidelines -  Deputy Cowen is correct - and the SCA must be put in place.  The opportunity for Ireland is the UK's 2020 targets.  There is nothing post-2020.  If we are to participate in the opportunity we must be able to develop the export opportunity over the next year or two.  There is a long lead time for the development of a project of the scale and size we anticipate.  The longest lead-time item for such a project is the underground cabling, which must be ordered three years in advance.  Therefore, we must have planning permission and everything in place for a project such as this if we are serious about meeting 2020 targets.</p><p>  We could have a lot of discussion about whether the planning guidelines are good or bad.  I agree with most of Deputy Cowen's comments, although there may be nuances.  The planning guidelines in Ireland have stood the test of time, and we are reviewing them now, which is good.  Deputy Cowen asked whether guidelines should be binding.  A company such as Element Power will comply with whatever the planning guidelines are.</p></speech>

I am conscious of a decision by Offaly County Council yesterday.  When the council members were asked for a comment by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on an application in Rhode for 32 turbines across a large portion of the north east of the county they acknowledged that they were going through a process of re-evaluating their existing development plan, which goes from 2015 to 2021, or whatever it might be.  That process has obviously acknowledged that the guidelines that were there for 2009 and 2015 are very outdated.  The promoters acknowledge that they want to work with everybody involved to have proper guidelines in place from 2015 onwards, yet behind the door they are making applications in the meantime.</p></speech>

As Deputy Cowen pointed out, some counties have strategies at different stages and some counties have no strategies in place.  Some sites that we may identify at an early stage may be outside the designated areas.  As I mentioned earlier, as part of the site selection and assessment process the onus is on the various experts we have working on the environmental impact assessment for the project.  The process they carry out to assess the suitability or otherwise of sites is to prove that any specific site that might be outside a current wind-designated area has merits that warrant its being considered to go forward for a planning application.  We are in the process now.  If the site is unsuitable based on that assessment, it is not included in the planning application.  Ultimately the planning application goes through the planning process, with the board and the local planning authority giving their views on the suitability of those sites.</p></speech>

Lest there be any view to the contrary, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has shown its process to be reasonably robust regarding planning applications pertaining to wind farms.  Very recently, some of the largest proposed developments in the midlands, of which Deputy Cowen would be aware, have been refused planning permission for exactly the reasons about which he expressed concerns, such as setback distances and impacts.  Deputy Cowen asked whether the guidelines needed to be updated.  First, they are being updated through the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, process.  I take the Deputy's point that perhaps this should have happened some time back rather than waiting for a project of this scale to trip the process of review.  However, it makes sense that processes and guidelines need to be updated, if for no other reason than the fact that technology is moving on in leaps and bounds.</p><p>  Somebody made a comment about the longevity of wind farms.  Bord na M&oacute;na was the first company to build, own and operate a commercial wind farm.  It had a total capacity of 7.5 MW with hub heights of 30 m and outputs of 330 kW.  That wind farm was built in the early 1990s in the north west of Ireland and is still operating today.  Technology has moved on.  We are in the process of building a wind farm where the hub height is 100 m and the rated output is 3 MW.  Guidelines need to move alongside technology.  Regarding social acceptance and community benefits, Bord na M&oacute;na is very much a community-based organisation, particularly in the midlands.  It draws most of its support and employees from the midlands.  Some communities in the midlands did not exist before Bord na M&oacute;na.  County development plans need to be aligned with regional and national development plans.</p></speech>

Mr. Reilly will speak on a particular planning application which involved three counties with three different sets of planning guidelines for one development.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Reilly" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021800010#J00200"><p>Deputy Cowen spoke about the revision of guidelines.  It is necessary to revise guidelines for anything as time moves on.  The interesting thing here is that we are currently erecting 28 3 MW turbines on cutaway peat land in County Offaly.  That project was brought through the planning process in 2010.  We conducted a very significant public consultation exercise as part of that.  We got tremendous support from the local community.  Of course the community had questions.  These were the first large-scale wind projects to be developed in the midlands.  The communities had questions and probed us in that regard.  However, those wind farms received planning permission under the current guidelines.</p><p>  The key issue communities want to understand is that noise will not emanate from them that will disturb their sleep or keep them awake at night.  Setback distances sometimes get confused with the need to comply with very strict low nighttime levels of noise.  In this instance the noise limits with which that wind farm is required to comply are a couple of decibels lower than the noise limits with which the peat-fired power station just down the road must comply.  There is a lack of consistency here.  That peat-fired power station has been operating in the locality for 14 years.  We have had a very small number of noise complaints operating at 43 decibels and 45 decibels at nighttime.  We do not believe operating a wind farm at roughly 43 decibels will cause any problem for local communities in terms of noise.  In order to comply with those noise limits, the minimum setback distance on the project had to be in excess of 650 m.  There are minimum setback distances and the reality is that in order to comply with the noise restrictions it will be necessary to set back these turbines considerably further from housing.</p><p>  Mr. D'Arcy said we are also constructing a farm that straddles three counties in the south, Laois, Kilkenny and Tipperary.  We had to submit three separate planning applications to the local authorities because at the time the planning guidelines were such that the planning application for that size of farm was submitted directly to the local authority.  We had three different interpretations of elements of the guidelines.</p><p>  Referring to Mr. Cowhig's point, there is no doubt that the review and tightening up of guidelines is always welcome.  In developing any of these activities Bord na M&oacute;na will not be - nor ever has been - in the business of disturbing or trampling on local communities.  We want to work with local communities and we will only propose to locate wind turbines - in this project or in any project we develop across our land holdings - where it is deemed appropriate to do so.</p><p>  I believe it is entirely appropriate for the local authorities to designate areas for wind energy.  That assessment can be looked at, and local authorities and communities can decide where it might be deemed appropriate to locate these, which would help everybody.</p><p>  Deputy Cowen asked about having an independent economic review of wind energy.  In a way it is a pity this does not happen because some of the facts relating to the economics of wind energy are clear to see.  For example, in the wholesale electricity market today, the average wholesale price of electricity coming from the mix of fuels we have, gas, peat, coal and renewables, last year was &euro;90 per MWh - &euro;90 per unit of production.  Today, the new wind farms under the REFIT support scheme are receiving &euro;70 per MWh.  In our view the economics of wind energy are clear to be seen.  If somebody wanted to conduct an independent analysis, it might put to bed the debate on pricing.</p><p>  On CO2 emissions reductions, in 2006 the electricity sector was responsible for the production of 15 million tonnes of CO2 emissions to meet a demand of 27 TWh.  Unfortunately, owing to the economic recession in 2012, demand fell back to the 2006 levels.  The provisional figures for CO2 emissions recently published by the EPA indicate that emissions in the electricity sector fell to 12.1 million tonnes.  Wind energy has had a major contribution to make to the abatement of significant CO2 emissions in a cost-effective manner.</p></speech>

In particular as regards planning of all medium and large-scale projects such as wind turbines and electricity generation systems, the environmental impact assessment directive dates back to 1985.  It is also part of Article 6, the main component of the Aarhus Convention on citizens' procedural rights.  The EU pointed out that it knew of no other member state that had been involved in so many compliance issues and actions at the European Court over failures to comply with one single directive as Ireland had with that directive.  That is not a good endorsement.</p><p>  It also pointed out our failure to transpose properly the strategic environmental assessment directive.  That failure led to EirGrid bypassing the necessary Grid 25 SEA and did not engage in proper public participation process.  It only received 22 submissions, of which only three, including one from me, could be identified as having come from the public.</p><p>  There is a massive problem with regard to access to justice.  Dissent protects democracy.  Ireland has had major problems with groupthink which led to our economic collapse.  It is right that people should have the right to challenge when they see substantive and procedural breaches.  That is part of the convention and part of people's human rights.  However, we do not have arrangements for proper access to the courts that is not prohibitively expensive.  Last week, the UK, where the cost of access to courts is lower, was ruled to be in breach of the European directive and the convention with regard to being not prohibitively expensive.  Its legal system did not comply.  The Irish Academy of Engineering has pointed out that the regulatory system in Ireland is dysfunctional and unfit for purpose.  It leads to enormous frustrations for developers and citizens.</p><p>  As with any development, with wind farms the purpose of environmental impact assessment is to weigh it up and identify the negative effects, which are considerable, and the positives.  There is only one positive - an alleged environmental benefit.  When that is summed up, all An Bord Plean&aacute;la can do, because it is the obligation of it or the local authority, is to make pub-talk statements such as "makes a valuable contribution to climate change".  It has no figures or data.</p><p>  The national renewable energy action plan proposed to develop 7,145 MW of wind energy.  How will we fit that in with a distributed rural population and ensure they will be protected?  We never carried out a strategic environmental assessment before we adopted it to work out the impact on human beings and develop the necessary mitigation measures as required by law.  We put the cart before the horse.</p><p>  Pillar 1 of the convention is about access to information, not just press releases.  People want more detailed information and are entitled to it.  When we seek that information from public authorities we are denied it.  When we appeal to the Commissioner for Environmental Information and pay &euro;150, we are told it takes one and a half to two years if it gets addressed at all.  Bord na M&oacute;na refused to comply with a request in January 2012.  It finally went to appeal, which it lost in September 2013.  It is required by law to comply within three weeks and is still refusing to provide access to information when citizens submit AIE requests.  Citizens cannot access information to which they are entitled, such as the cost-benefit analysis for this programme.</p></speech>

The communities of Taylor's cross and Garbally were not informed by Element Power that it planned to build a wind farm there; they were told by me.  After seeing the map I telephoned a few people in the area and then decided I had better tell all of them.  I made out an information sheet and headed into the area, which is quiet and rural.  I went door-to-door and braved a vicious dog or two.  Most of the people in the area had never heard of the export project.</p><p>  I also take issue with the Government.  In January I noticed the agreed memorandum of understanding signed by the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, but many people in the population had not noticed it.  Many people do not read newspapers or press statements issued from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  When I told the people of Garbally that they were to get a wind farm, most of them knew very little about it.  That is how the communities of Garbally and Taylor's Cross learned about the wind farm.</p><p>  When Offaly County Council drew up a good wind strategy document in 2009, it designated certain areas as suitable for wind farms.  I have problems with why it decided this.  It stated the areas south and east of Kilcormac were not suitable for wind energy project development, having regard to the higher density of housing, the proximity to areas of high amenity and the likely effect on views to and from such areas.  Element Power has since moved into the Kilcormac area and signed options with farmers there.  The Kilcormac community, like the community in Garbally and Taylor's Cross, now finds itself facing an application for a wind farm in the area.  Like many communities in the midlands, we are in a David versus Goliath situation.  We must fundraise to hire planners and consultants to face the huge financial resources of Element Power and Mainstream Renewable Power.  It is very unfair and one-sided and people are under great stress.  There is not much money in the county.  We have set up a committee in the Banagher-Garbally area, some members of which are going door to door to try to get people to contribute to a fund to protect us.</p><p>  I wish to quote a short statement from one of the residents of Garbally, an English man, Mr. David Bacon, who happens to be married to a local lady.  He states he represents the Banagher and Garbally wind information group and outlines its experience of renewable energy project development in the area.  He states that if it were not for the efforts of an interested and well informed friend - <i>c'est moi</i> - he would doubtless be as ignorant now of Element Power and its plans for Garbally as he was in October 2013.  He states he had a vague notion of wind energy project development in the midlands and did not know any specific information.  He also states he was not alone in this, as not one resident to whom he subsequently spoke knew about Element Power or the 185 m turbines.</p><p>  A Garbally resident has drawn up a poster which tries to convey the enormity of the turbines.  I have spoken to many women friends in Birr Golf Club about wind farms in the midlands and most of them write me off as a little batty at this stage.  Outside Birr there is a wind farm at Knockshegowna, but the turbines there are a mere 18 m high.  The turbines planned for Garbally and Taylor's Cross are 185 m high.  The planner Auriol Considine stated the Cloghan wind farm was a significant industrial installation in a quiet rural area.  I was very involved in the appeal against that wind farm.  I went to the extent I did because I am a proud BIFFO - a bright intelligent female from Offaly.  I did not want to see a wind farm anywhere in west Offaly while I was there.  I went to the extent of hiring an excellent planner, Mr. Peter Crossan, to make an observation on the wind farm in Cloghan.  Last year I knew nothing about the planning process and did not send in an objection because I thought as I lived three miles away in Banagher, I would not be eligible to do so.  Then I discovered I could send in an observation.  Mr. Crossan made an excellent observation for me which I believed helped considerably in making our appeal against the Cloghan wind farm successful.  I remind people why Auriol Considine from An Bord Plean&aacute;la upheld our appeal.</p></speech>

There would be a loss of visual amenity for the locals, excess noise and shadow flicker.  She also noted that there were 34 houses within 1,200 m of the site.  Significantly, she stated only the minimum requirements of the 2006 guidelines had been applied.  Many of the houses would suffer a great loss of residential amenity.  We are lucky that Cloghan is to be found near 12 special areas of conservation and six special protection areas for birds; therefore, the threat to wildfowl was another reason she had turned down the application for the wind farm, with the negative effect on tourism.</p><p>  To go back to the statement by Mr. Bacon, he states he need not list the many reasons the people of Garbally do not want industrial wind turbines in their area.  He states these concerns have been put to the Government and the energy companies on numerous occasions but they have been met with derision.  He states with certainty that the overwhelming majority of Garbally residents do not want them.</p><p>  Since I broke the story, three land owners who do not live in the area have come forward about four turbines, but there may be others.  They do not have to live with the consequences.  Mr. Bacon also states once an application goes in they only have seven weeks in which to defend themselves.</p></speech>

I am heartened in some ways and disappointed in others by the efforts invested in promoting bio-energy, which most of us accept is the most sustainable way of creating energy.  It is done through the use of organic crops, rural-based initiatives and a never-ending crop cycle.  Despite this, we only meet 1% of our energy needs through bio-energy production.  The Government must give direction in terms of policies and subsidies.</p><p>  Today I heard the CEO of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, speak about the savings derived from sustainable energy production.  A figure of &euro;1 billion was mentioned.  When I had the opportunity to analyse the document which was, strangely enough, only produced today when the groups were attending, the reality is that, if every conceivable puff of wind was captured in the grid, the savings would amount to &euro;1 billion.  As everyone present knows, however, when the wind blows too strongly, turbines must be turned off.  The figure of &euro;1 billion, therefore, is mythical.</p><p>  This feeds into my concern about some of the figures thrown out by others at this meeting when addressing the genuine questions ordinary people like Ms Doolan, others and I want answered.  I support all alternative energy ideas, but I do not buy into the myth that, as laid out today by the SEAI, we are saving money through wind energy generation.  In reality, the cost of energy in Ireland has increased by more than 100% in the past decade.  This is the third most expensive country in Europe.  At the peak of our requirements in January 2010 when we needed 5,000 MW, only 40 MW could be provided by way of wind energy generation.  This figure debunks everything we have been told today.  Wind energy production is not the solution to our problem.  We have been told that it will reduce the cost of energy to the user.  In Germany, probably Europe's most progressive country, it cost each user an extra &euro;300 last year to buy into the concept of wind energy generation.  It will cost the German state &euro;23 billion in 2014.</p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na is proposing to install between 300 and 350 turbines in the Bog of Allen, each of which will be 190 m tall.  It referred in great detail to its concern about communities.  These turbines will be seen from at least 10 km away, never mind the noise generated.  The turbines that produce noise of 45 decibels are only 60 m tall.  What is Bord na M&oacute;na's proposal for the setback from people's houses?  How many turbines does Bord na M&oacute;na intend to install in County Mayo?  The carbon benefit of wind energy was mentioned, but for each of these pylons we need the equivalent amount of concrete poured for 150 houses.  The improvement in the carbon footprint will be done away with in installing such tall turbines.</p><p>  Peak demand is 5,000 MW.  If we are to go ahead with everything that is in the pipeline, we will have between 2,000 MW and 3,500 MW of wind energy per annum.  As we have already hit our target of 40%, what will we do with the energy we do not need?  Exporting to the United Kingdom is a dated concept.  As we all know, the European Union abandoned its renewable energy targets for 2020 in the past two weeks.</p></speech>

Will Mr. D'Arcy clarify that point?</p><p>  When it was put to Mr. Brian Motherway, CEO of the SEAI, today that between 25 MW and 28 MW would be generated from wind energy, he replied that we would never reach that target and that most of the projects would not go ahead.  Bord na M&oacute;na is a semi-State company that uses taxpayers' money.  Is it investing that money in projects that will never go ahead?</p><p>  When Mr. D'Arcy's organisation made a presentation to us across the road in Buswell's Hotel a number of months ago, it told us that one of the reasons its project was sustainable, as opposed to those of its now strategic partner, Element Power, and Mainstream Renewable Power was that Bord na M&oacute;na did not need to lease land, worry about property devaluation, etc. because it had the Bog of Allen on which to install turbines.  Now that it is linking with the other organisations, how will the taxpayer be satisfied that Bord na M&oacute;na's strategy has changed and how can it square the clear statement from the other companies in the field that they do not intend to run these projects in the long term but to flip and sell them?  The companies' main investors are not from this country and have no community interest in sustainability which Bord na M&oacute;na claims it has.  How can it propose this concept which will increase the cost of electricity and affect our economic well being and use taxpayers' money to do so?</p><p>  Mr. Cowhig stated he would underground his network.  Will he confirm that none of the Grid25 build which will cost the taxpayer &euro;2.3 billion will carry any of Element Power's electricity?  This is important from the taxpayer's point of view.</p><p>  Can the idea of guaranteed prices be squared with the fact that American energy policy has been changed completely?  America has moved towards fracking.</p></speech>

We have developed a number of projects over the past couple of years.  Specifically on export, we will build our own infrastructure and will have no connection with the upgrade for 2025.  However, so that there is no misunderstanding, there will be an opportunity for the Irish State, if it wants to, to tap into our infrastructure.  There are huge benefits to the Irish State from that infrastructure.  However, that is step two of any particular process.  The export project we are discussing today stands up on its own economically.  The OFTEC agreements will be fully funded by the UK, with no cost to the Irish taxpayer.</p><p>  In regard to the guaranteed price for electricity, one of the things we will require to build a project such as this is a long-term OFTEC agreement, which will be for 15 to 20 years rather than 50 years.  Much in this regard is dependent on the negotiations, which will be outside our hands.</p></speech>

Bord na M&oacute;na, as it is required to do, has launched and is working through a process in relation to specific peatlands and boglands and has invited parties who have land interstitial to or adjoining that land - such lands may have similar characteristics and may be isolated or adjoining our lands - to join that process.</p></speech>

Technically, Bord na M&oacute;na is an unlisted PLC in which the State has a majority shareholding.  We generate our own incomes and profits and do not draw any funding from the State.  All of the investments are done on the back of the Bord na M&oacute;na balance sheet.  None of it comes from taxpayers.</p></speech>

We have a planning application in with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to build 112 turbines on our cutaway peatlands in Mayo, which is representative of a project of approximately 350 MW, which will be a direct connection to the national grid in support of our 40% 2020 targets.  Senator Landy also made reference to our having already hit our 40% target, which I did not fully understand.  We have not hit our 40% target.  The latest indication is that we hit the 20% target for renewable electricity in 2012.  We still have a way to go to hit the domestic targets.  Beyond that, there are sufficient projects in the pipeline between various players, including private developers and some of the commercial semi-state companies, to achieve that.  I do not think anybody expects all of those projects to go ahead.  There are various elements of projects that need to be assigned grid connections and, crucially, planning permission.  Bord na M&oacute;na tries to ensure that it invests in the development of projects that have the best possibility of seeing the light of day.  Thankfully, it has not failed yet.  I cannot say, however, that we would never fail from a planning perspective.</p><p>  In regard to the EU abandoning its targets beyond 2030, that is not the case.  The recent EU announcement indicates that the European Union will move from a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 to a proposed 40% reduction by 2030 and from a proposed 20% renewable energy target to a 27% target, which would not, as current targets are, be binding at member state level but at a European level.  This will bring into play the spectre of energy co-operation between EU member states, which is vital to the achievement of future decarbonisation targets across Europe in a cost-effective manner.</p><p>  The export project that we are here to discuss today could form the cornerstone of what Europe is doing as it seeks to decarbonise its power system in the period to 2030, 2050 and beyond.</p></speech>

There was a failure under the public participation conducted on this in 2012 to provide any information other than the names of the projects.  We requested the information from the Commission's Director-General for Energy, Mr. Philip Lowe, and the secretary general of the European Commission, Ms Catherine Day, and then took the matter to the Ombudsman, following which copies of the project questionnaires were released to us.</p> <p>There is much concern about Grid Link, which is the massive pylon project running from Cork through Waterford and up the Wexford coast in some of the most beautiful areas of Ireland.  These are obvious concerns.  When we consider the information on the project questionnaire for Grid Link, it is clear it is part of an overall process to connect to France and Great Britain, and that is why it is put in the project as a common interest.  It is admitted that if &euro;500 million is spent on building Grid Link, it would reduce generation costs in Ireland by &euro;11 million per annum because of more efficient power station operation.  In other words the money is spent to reduce costs by &euro;11 million per annum.  If interconnection is facilitated to Great Britain or France, the saving could go to &euro;40 million or &euro;110 million, but an interconnector to the United Kingdom would cost an extra &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million, and one to France would cost even more.  We would then be at a figure of approximately &euro;1.5 billion.</p><p> It is stated that the investment is planned primarily to facilitate the integration of 1,283 MW of wind generation in the south of the country.  That is what Grid Link is about.  However, they also point out that the connection of such capacity can only be facilitated if further interconnection is installed to provide access for this generation to the British and continental European markets.  We know already that the grid is operating in an unstable manner and we are dumping wind but Grid Link is connected to the building of interconnectors.  If interconnectors are not built, there is no reason for Grid Link other than to save &euro;11 million per annum from inefficient power station operation.  There is much inaccurate information in the public domain and the committee is welcome to have this information.</p></speech>

I come from County Laois, in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, and many wind turbines are planned for the area, and some have already been erected.  It is a major issue.  There is an underlying concern because for a number of years we went mad building houses and apartments, and we were going to generate wealth selling property to each other at inflated prices.  We know how that ended.  There is a concern, touched on today, about energy on a global scale, particularly energy trends.  I am a passionate supporter of renewable energy but there are some alarm bells in my head when it comes to the wind energy sector.</p><p>  I will direct my questions first to the Element Power representatives.  Are we throwing all our eggs in one basket?  It seems to be a questionable means of generating power as it is intermittent and must be backed up by gas or fossil fuel when there is no wind.  We twice had a big freeze in the winter period two and three years ago but there was very little wind at a time when we depended much on electrical power.</p><p>  There has been much discussion of how we are meeting our renewable energy targets and reducing greenhouse gases.  This committee has put in much work on a related report, and nobody wants to see the goals realised more than I do.  People in the midlands believe nothing is being achieved to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with the wind turbines because the cable is to be run to an interconnector and we are to help the Brits meet their goals.  This will not help us meet our targets but England and Wales in particular will be helped in meeting theirs.  Will the Element Power representatives address that?</p><p>  The structure height is to be 185 m and I do not have a problem with modest wind farms properly located as part of meeting our renewable energy targets.  The size of what is proposed is absolutely enormous on a flat landscape and the project will be seen from Portarlington to Mount Bolus.  The structures will be huge.  What does Element Power consider to be a reasonable set-back distance?  My questions relate to whether we are putting all our eggs in one basket and if we are making the same mistakes as we did with the property boom.  There is also the question of how this will help us meet our renewable energy needs and what is a reasonable set-back distance.  If Mr. Cowhig lived in a rural area, how close would he allow a 185 m high turbine to be?</p><p>  I travelled a road the other night which I had not used for four or five months.  It was dark and because it is a rural area, there is only so much that can be seen.  The road is smashed into bits and there are large potholes in it.  I contacted the neighbouring council and our council about the damage done to the road.  When I arrived at the destination the person I met raised the subject and pleaded with me to do what I could.  There have been hundreds of lorries carrying concrete trundling along the road for a number of months.  I had not been on it for three months but I could see that it was smashed to bits.  The representatives of Element Power have spoken about community gain but in the area to which I refer the road network has been completely smashed to pieces.  Would Element Power support the idea of a substantial bond being lodged with local authorities, if it could be retrievable rather than an insurance bond that is too hard to reach?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.249" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Cowhig" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021800014#N00600"><p>I will take the last question first.  There is an obligation on all developers to ensure that when they have a project, it is developed responsibly.  They are not allowed to start development until there is a compliance document with the local authority.  Any reinstatement required is agreed in advance.</p><p>  With regard to the turbines being 185 m high, it is important for people to understand that we have not yet decided what size turbine to use.  This is part of the process that must be gone through to see what kind of technology can be used after going through the various steps identifying location.  We do not yet know what size or kind of turbine can be put in place, although we believe the most efficient will be one at 185 m high.  That does not necessarily need to be the turbine height after going through consultation.</p><p>  The Deputy asked if there will be another property-type bubble with wind turbines.  Wind energy and the development of energy in general is very different from commercial development, where building is done one spec and selling occurs afterwards.  Projects like this export programme will not proceed until all the necessary binding contracts are put in place, and one of the most important elements is a long-term off-take agreement.  One should not end up in a position like we did with the housing boom.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked if we are reducing our own emissions.  This is an export opportunity open to us as a country.  We believe we can meet our own 2020 targets and our UK neighbour has an energy shortage and needs to achieve its own targets.  If we are rewarded as a country - and not just us as a company - it would make sense for us.  There are ways for us to use in future elements like interconnection.</p></speech>

Any power system, like Ireland's 15 years ago, requires a great deal of back-up plant to make up for the fact that sometimes some plant is unavailable, and, more importantly, for the fact that there is a variation in demand between the peak in the winter, typically in December, and the lowest demand in the summer.  The numbers in Ireland at present suggest there is a peak demand on the island of approximately 6,000 MW and we have 10,000 MW of generation installed to meet that.  Ten years ago, the plant would have cycled day and night with fluctuations in load.  More recently, it is cycling up and down with wind.  Crucially, however, not one new megawatt has had to be built because of the new megawatts of wind.  Over the last ten years we have built over 2,000 MW of new wind and not one new megawatt of conventional generation was required to back those up, simply because they were already there for the purpose of backing-up what was previously a day-night fluctuation.  I believe that is quite safe.</p><p>  On the question of putting one's eggs in one basket, if Ireland were not to pursue a wind energy strategy, it would certainly be putting its eggs into one energy policy basket, namely, imported gas.  Without wind energy, Ireland was heading to 80% to 90% dependency on gas.  Energy policy in Ireland suggests we will go to 40% wind, and that will remove some of the dependency on imported gas.</p></speech>

They said that they do not have a problem with local councillors designating matters in the county development plans.  In Laois and other counties, however, the designated areas for the planned locations are being ignored in many cases.  The land rights for the plant and wind farms are being bought up completely off-pitch or off-stage.  With regard to the guidelines, would they support proper statutory regulations regarding the siting of wind farms?  Communities feel the guidelines are a little elastic and that they can be pulled north, south, east or west or be made as long or short as one wishes.  There is a feeling that the new guidelines might not be much better than the old ones.  There are planning regulations for most other things so how would Bord na M&oacute;na feel about reasonable regulations in terms of its developments locally?</p><p>  The other question is about the entire alternative energy sector, where there is use of biomass, peat and wind.  We only have a short time so perhaps the representatives would give brief answers.  How much time or focus is given to looking at geothermal, anaerobic digestion and hydro options?  Bord na M&oacute;na might not have many opportunities on site for hydro, but people involved in Spirit of Ireland, in many publications over a number of years, spoke about the potential of hydro.  We have two huge examples of hydro, one in Wicklow and one on the Shannon.  How much investigation has there been of hydro?  I am a little concerned about this reliance on wind alone.</p><p>  With regard to height, there is a maximum height beyond what is reasonable.  As some speakers have said today, planning is about a balance and what is reasonable.  Some buildings that were proposed for this city did not get permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the city council because it was believed they would be outrageously high.  It is the same in rural areas.  The turbines are 185 m in height, which is almost 600 feet.  We have never seen anything like that and it will change the Irish landscape forever, particularly in the midlands.  If there was something that height within a five or six mile radius of where I am living, I would be able to see it.  Would the representatives be prepared to buy into, or see a need for, a maximum height for turbines?</p><p>  My final question for the representatives of Bord na M&oacute;na is about undergrounding cables, Grid25 and the debate about pylons as opposed to the underground option.  Bord na M&oacute;na, like Element Power, is opting for underground.  It might be a different system but it is an underground system to carry the cable to the interconnector.  What made them decide upon the underground option rather than the over-ground one?</p></speech>

I will comment on low-carbon technology.  The Deputy asked if we are looking at various different and alternative technologies.  We have been and are doing that.  There is quite an active innovation process in Bord na M&oacute;na.  Deputy Stanley will be very familiar with the fact that we have a significant solid fuels business and we are developing a range of low-carbon replacement products for these, including briquettes, coal and so forth.  It has required a great deal of technology and new product development, and it is ongoing.</p><p>  We have looked at a variety of different technologies.  All of them are proving challenging in terms of energy storage but with developments such as electric vehicles and so forth, it potentially has the opportunity to provide some solutions in that regard.  We have put a great deal of time into areas such as landfill gas, which is another form of renewable energy, and particularly into technology relating to cleaning this gas and making it more useable.  This has got applications throughout Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Reilly" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021800015#O00500"><p>To make a final point on the other technologies which we look at on an ongoing basis, the fact is that on a levelised cost basis, that is, when one looks at the cost of power produced from anaerobic digestion, for example, it is significantly higher than the cost of onshore wind.  It is similar with geothermal and solar photovoltaic, PV.  Germany was mentioned earlier.  One of the reasons Germany is paying such large subsidies is that it has installed very significant levels of solar PV on its system.  Onshore wind remains one of the most cost effective technologies and, in the Irish context, biomass, particularly when used on a co-fired basis with peat, because the stations are already there.  That is the reason Bord na M&oacute;na's focus on renewable energy at present is primarily on onshore wind and biomass.</p><p>  With regard to the undergrounding, it is to do with the design of the systems and the distances.  The cabling that happens within a wind farm, the AC voltage cabling, and the distance one must travel there mean that one can, reasonably cost effectively, put those cables underground.  It is similar with the AC network that will be used to link the farms to the central point.  We are not travelling over very large distances.  If one is travelling over very large distances, which will have to happen with Grid Link or Grid West, and moving high voltage electricity over distances, the cost of undergrounding that and the ability to underground it safely is very prohibitive.  In our case, the distances being travelled are quite short so it is possible to underground the cables.  That is the reason for our perspective on it.  The other key issue is that Bord na M&oacute;na's land bank in the midlands is interlinked with the rail network.  We can run the cables between the farms along that route or along that cable network.</p><p>  On the issue of planning guidelines, we wish to make it clear that we believe a revision and assessment of the planning guidelines, as is being carried out at present, is appropriate.  There was reference earlier to a wind farm in Offaly that was turned down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la because only the minimum guidelines were adhered to.  From our perspective, on our Mount Lucas wind farm, the minimum setback we have from the nearest residence is over 680 metres.  On the farm I referred to in Mayo, the minimum setback distance will be almost 1 km.  That will be necessary to comply with the noise limits, which I believe is the most important issue.</p></speech>

Does Turn180 not see climate change happening and think we do not need to replace or stop generating electricity using fossil fuels?

I hope that they have not increased but everyone else is telling me that they have, and there is all of the information that has come to us.  What is the source of Mr. Swords' information?  I believe we are experiencing and will experience serious changes in weather patterns in my lifetime.</p><p>  I wish to recap on Turn180's position on wind farms.  Does it oppose them <i>per se</i>?  Does it favour nuclear energy?  What are the options?  I would like to know because we need to examine all the options.  I do not favour nuclear power.</p><p>  With regards global warming, Mr. Swords referred to the past 16 years.  We could say there has not been an increase in the past six years.  I am asking if he is saying there has not been an increase in global warming in the past 50 years.  If there has been an increase in temperature, what has been the cause?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the models that are used to predict a catastrophic global warming scenario have been wrong.  There has not been a rise in temperatures in the past 16 years.  We need to look at all this.  There is huge disquiet that there is a catastrophic scenario and that scenario is deeply controversial.  We can deal with the issue offline at some other time and I do not want to go into the matter.</p><p>  As regards alternatives, I have already stated that we have a good generation system.  We invested heavily in it between 1999 and 2012 so we are good to go for 20 to 30 years in advance and we do not have to rush into anything.  We do not need to throw out the good power station that we have and build a nuclear power station but we should look at all of the options and find the right one.  My approach is that the process should be done correctly and that is what the convention is about.  The convention is not against nuclear energy and I am not against nuclear energy.  The convention, as was said, is not against wind energy.  There may be circumstances in which wind is suitable.  Wind energy does not make sense when one looks at it from an engineering perspective and from the perspective of the large-scale roll-out of a scheme. </p><p>  One reason it does not make sense is because it causes inefficiencies in other power stations.  We have some of the most modern gas-fired stations.  They are the most efficient stations in the world because they are 55% efficient at full load.  That means that when we put in 2 units of gas we get more than 1 unit of electricity.  If we ramp them back to less then 50%, they fall off a cliff and by the time we are down to 40%, we are down to percentages in the 30s in terms of efficiencies and are burning 3 units of gas to get 1 unit of electricity.  The combustion gases - the pollutants - increase by a factor of three when we throttle them back.  Therefore, when one operates at one third of the load, one puts out the same amount of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide pollutants as one would if the station had a full load.  That is not a sensible way of doing things so we must look at it from an engineering perspective and analyse the whole thing properly.</p><p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's report has ignored the fact that these inefficiencies occur on the grid.  Despite this, the REFIT for financing wind farms gives the wind operator &euro;67 and gives the company &euro;10.  They take it because of the extra balancing costs and the extra inefficiencies they incur.  At the same time we ignore the inefficiencies in our emissions calculations.  We need to look very carefully.  As we put in more renewables, the inefficiencies increase on the grid so it is a diminishing return with wind energy.</p><p>  There were 11 sources of renewables identified in the directive.  There has never been any consideration of technology alternatives in Ireland, and that is a legal binding from the Commissioner for Environmental Information.  We just ended up with 90% wind.  I spent 180 days working in Croatia between 2008 and 2009 getting the country ready for membership.  Croatia joined in July and brought in its national renewable energy action plan in October.  It has the same size of a population and relatively the same land mass as Ireland but it ruled out the large-scale deployment of wind because it was too expensive and too much of it would be imported.  Instead, it went looking at agricultural sources such as biogas, etc.</p><p>  For hydro power to work in a country, nature must do one a favour.  If one was located between Serbia and Romania, where the River Danube is massive and bursts through the mountains, one could barely just generate enough electricity for Ireland.  We only have the River Shannon from which we get 80 MW on full flow but we need between 2,000 and 5,000 MW so hydro power is not going to work.</p></speech>

This is the second day of our hearings.  Before Christmas, we heard from the Lakelands Wind Farm Information Group and we will hear from others involved in the industry, government and communities.</p><p>  I have some questions on how wind energy supplies for export will be transmitted to the United Kingdom.  There is the east-west interconnector between Ireland and Wales.  Do Bord na M&oacute;na and Element Power see themselves using that interconnector?  Who will build the connections between the wind farms and the station in County Meath?  </p><p>  I refer to land agreements with Coillte.  Coillte has a lot of land in natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation.  How much of it is suitable for wind energy generation, considering that it will be restricted by being located in special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas?</p><p>  Have the two energy companies conducted cost benefit analyses of how this project will be advanced?  A number of speakers referred to the requirement for the back-up of fossil fuels.  Communities have contacted public representatives about this requirement.  How can the energy companies square this with making up the deficit when there is no wind blowing?  </p><p>  There are queries about the option agreements being presented to local communities.  Are we looking at lease or options agreements?  What is the ratio between them and what is their duration?</p><p>  The Aarhus Convention has been mentioned.  What is the energy companies' understanding of their responsibilities under the convention?  While there has been a degree of consultation, the fact that there have not been public meetings to advise communities has been a deficit.  The fact that there has been a lack of public discourse during which we can obtain accurate information is causing a real problem for communities.</p></speech>

Mr. Harte will deal with the questions about the grid, while Mr. O'Donovan will deal with the land use questions.  </p><p>  As I outlined in my opening statement, we have looked at the benefits to the community in the midlands of developing an export project of around 3,000 MW.  Our estimate is that it should be worth at least &euro;1.5 billion to the five midland counties over the lifetime of the project.  That is made up of community contributions of more than &euro;10 million per year and &euro;50 million per year between rates and rent payments to landowners.</p></speech>

We believe the scale of the resource and the combined projects in the midlands will probably account for around 3,000 MW; effectively, that is six times bigger than that for the existing cable, which could not accommodate that capacity.  We have proposed as part of the Greenwire project - other projects have proposed similar connections - to build a new dedicated HVDC connection directly to the United Kingdom.  That is the same technology as for the east-west interconnector but at much higher ratings.  It will not look that different in terms of what goes in the ground.  It is still a cable on a public road, but it is the technology which can move that quantity of power with very low losses and at reasonable cost to the United Kingdom.  It has been proved the world over.</p><p>  On the question of requiring a back-up, it is indisputable that there may well have been a day when Ireland had a demand for power of 5,000 MW and the wind was not blowing, but for everyday one can point to in that example, I can point to another when the wind was blowing and provided over 50% of our power supply.  What matters is how much power one ends up with at the end of the year.  Last year nearly 20% of all of Ireland's electricity was generated by wind energy, an impressive figure which will increase to 40% by 2020.  That is what will give us a degree of energy independence compared to the use of gas.  As I said, we can do this without requiring any new fossil fuel plant because we already have a generation fleet in Ireland, to which Mr. Swords referred, which is new, modern, efficient and large enough to cover all fluctuations in terms of wind energy and which is already doing this on a daily basis.  It is still capable of doing so in the future; therefore, there is no requirement for further back-up for the domestic market.  </p><p>  On the export project, the question of back-up is one for the United Kingdom, but I believe is in the same position as we are and can easily accommodate the levels of wind energy it is planning to use.</p></speech>

While we are aware of other developers' plans in terms of how this would happen, Bord na M&oacute;na does not have a particular view on this matter because it is not our area of expertise.  Transmission is not an area in which we are well qualified or have a history of involvement.  We are aware that transmission is an issue in the negotiations between the respective Departments, EirGrid, National Grid and the regulators in both jurisdictions and will be a critical question to be answered as part of the intergovernmental agreement process.  We await the outcome of those negotiations and will obviously comply with whatever is deemed to be the most appropriate approach, whether it be developer-led, grid operator-led or some other method.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Reilly" time="16:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021800018#R00300"><p>On the question of the backup piece, it is important to note that managing demand on the power system is not new in Ireland.  We have a very interesting situation in Ireland where we go to sleep at night, unlike most of the rest of Europe.  Demand at night time drops to about 2,000 MW and rises at the winter peak to approximately 4,500 to 5,000 MW.  Following demands on the power system and variations in that demand day to night, over the weekend, winter to summer and so forth is being done all of the time.  The need for backup capacity, as has been explained, is not a new phenomenon.  It is very important for people to understand that nobody here is talking about wind ever producing 100% of the electricity demand in Ireland.  That is not what is in play here.  We need to be sensible about this.  At present, 20% of our electricity is coming from wind and that is being managed very well.  It has been recognised globally that the management of intermittent yet predictable forms of energy is being done brilliantly in Ireland in the context of the isolated nature of our power system.  Increased interconnection with neighbouring power systems will enhance our ability to put more low carbon energy onto the power system, which is a key challenge for Ireland in terms of our de-carbonisation agenda.</p><p>  We completely agree that there is a need for consultation but it is sometimes difficult to know how best to do it.  When we launched our project in October of last year, we held open days in halls in various communities.  We had people in those locations for the entire day, which allowed mums on their way home from school runs or others on their way home from work to drop in and engage with us.  We endeavour at all times to provide people with the most up-to-date information on what we do, and while I am sure we do not get it right all the time, that is always our intent.  There is nothing to hide here.  There is nothing terribly secretive about what we are doing.  We are endeavouring to follow national and EU energy and environmental policies in a way that is best for the economy and the country while taking on board all the concerns of local communities.  That is what we attempt to do.  We may not get it right all the time but that is certainly what we try to do.</p><p>  As I said earlier, as a company we also produce electricity from biomass.  We are getting paid a lower price for our onshore wind energy than for our biomass energy.  A lot of the biomass we will require in the future will have to be imported because we simply do not have the resources here, unfortunately.  We are using the resource that is available in an optimal way.  We have tried to develop this resource through an energy crop programme, but for a variety of reasons, that programme has not yet taken off to the extent that we would like.  However, we will certainly keep working on it because we believe that the agricultural community in Ireland can play a very big role in helping to secure our energy future.</p></speech>

I would not have thought that the middle of Ireland was a good spot for wind speeds.  Are the structures so high that the wind speed does not matter?  What is the lifetime of the structure?  When it comes to decommissioning, what will happen to the materials in the turbines?  This is a technical question.  Do the elements in the actual turbine have to be maintained at a constant temperature that is cooled in summer and heated in winter?  If that is the case, what level of maintenance is required and what costs are involved in maintaining them?</p><p>  In the presentation from Element Power we learned that the number of turbines in the midlands and Kerry is 750.  Although the number of turbines is the same, are the heights of the turbines in Kerry the same as in the midlands?  The questions of distance from turbines has been opened up for consultation.  People have raised the question as to whether the distance from the turbine should be related to its height.  Would it be feasible that the turbine be located at a distance of ten times the height of the structure from any building?  We have very disperse settlement patterns and in the midlands, homes are scattered across the landscape.  It has been suggested there will be 3,000 turbines in the midlands.  How can we ensure they are located so that they will not impact on people's homes as well as not having an impact on sound levels, property values and the health of the community?</p></speech>

The offshore wind turbines are more expensive and are more technically challenging.  They are located at sea and it is significantly more expensive to install the foundations as well as getting the cabling out to them.  There is also the challenge of operating in a harsh environment.  Onshore turbines are far more competitive than offshore turbines in terms of the cost per MWh of energy.  The opportunity for onshore wind turbines in Ireland is the ability to deliver power at a competitive price.</p><p>  In response to the question on the lower wind speeds in the midlands, there has been significant advances in turbine technology in the past decade to the point that turbines in lower wind speed environments can produce quite high capacity factors and be very efficient.  That is achieved by having a larger graded turbine in that environment.</p><p>  As part of the compliance with planning permission, it is normal practice to put in place a decommissioning bond for the removal of the turbines and the restoration of the land.  It is standard practice that an actual decommissioning plan would form part of the agreement with the planning authority of the county council.  Both a decommissioning bond and a plan for decommissioning are put in place before the project is started to ensure that when it comes time to decommission the wind farm, it can be done as per the plan and the secure bond will cover the cost of it.  Obviously, the turbines must be maintained and there are jobs in maintenance and ensuring that the turbines operate within their operating parameters.  They have the capacity to operate in different environments, such as very cold to very warm weather, but there is a requirement for engineers and technicians to be able to operate and maintain the turbines.  </p><p>  The technology has evolved so that larger bladed machines are considered more efficient in lower wind speed areas.  Our experience throughout Ireland is that we conduct an assessment on a site by site basis as to the most suitable locations for turbines and the most appropriate turbines for that location.  That is part of the planning guidelines and feedback from the local authority on a particular site.  A key part of our role is to work with each of the five planning authorities in the midlands local authorities as well as complying with the planning guidelines.  The planning guidelines are being assessed and updated at present and, of course, we will comply with the guidelines when the project goes through the planning process.</p></speech>

The cost of installing a wind turbine offshore is almost three times that of installing it onshore because one will be working in deep water and face all the challenges of working at sea.  We have been monitoring wind speeds across our sites in the midlands for the past eight to nine years.  The average wind speeds in the relatively flat landscape of the midlands are the envy of other members states such as Germany, where the capacity factors for wind farms are 25%.  In the midlands one would expect with current technologies to get about a 35% capacity factors.  This is one of the reasons that Ireland has a major competitive advantage in that we can produce renewable clean electricity from onshore wind at a price that is lower than anywhere else in Europe because of our wind speeds.  There is no question but that one would need to build at the heights we are building at Mountlucas, which is at approximately 160 m.</p><p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy referred to a setback of ten times the height of the structures.  Ten times the height of a 160 m structure, such as in Mountlucas, would require setback distances of 1.6 km.  In effect, on a site such as Mountlucas that would mean that the turbines would move into a very small cluster right in the middle of the bog.  In terms of complying with regulations, for example, there would be no issue in terms of complying with the noise standards but one would be limiting the ability of the wind farm to capture its resource.  As we have said, we believe there is an appropriate setback distance and it should be related to noise.  </p><p>  Another point the Deputy raised - I understand the reason for the confusion on the issue because we have heard it also when we have spoken to people - is that it is proposed to install 3,000 turbines in the midlands.  Nobody is proposing to erect 3,000 turbines in the midlands.  People are talking about an export project that might have 3,000 MW capacity and using modern turbines that would involve a maximum of 1,000 turbines.  The Bord na M&oacute;na proposal is a 2 gigawatt project and we are looking at in the region of 650 turbines.  We understand that misconceptions such as these are raising concerns among people.  I do not think that one would install 3,3000 turbines in the midlands.  That will not happen.  One would not have appropriate locations across the midlands to put 3,000 turbines.  We believe it is possible to install between 600 and 700 turbines in appropriate locations.</p></speech>

We are developers and that is the business in which we operate.  All we can do is monitor developments in the market and the signals the market is giving and work on that basis.  If signals change in the middle of a process, our investors will lose the money invested in the project.</p><p>  On option agreements outside the county development plans, most of our option agreements are in areas designated in county development plans.  Those which have been signed outside county development plans are being assessed, as Mr. O'Donovan noted.  If it is found that the options are not suitable to be included in the planning process or if they proceed through the planning process and planning permission is not granted for them, they will lapse at the end of the relevant period.  There is no other reason for and no ulterior motive behind our signing up to these option agreements. </p><p>  On the subsidy for the export project, as we are seeking a long-term project in the United Kingdom, the UK energy consumer would underwrite the long-term off-take agreement for this project.  I confirm that there is no cost to Irish taxpayers for the export project.</p></speech>

The current investment is being made off the balance sheets of the respective companies.  Will it fall back on taxpayers?  Obviously, once an intergovernmental agreement is signed and subsequently backed by sovereign states, the sovereign states must deliver on requirements set out under that agreement.  In that sense, there could potentially be exposure if the sovereign states do not follow through on whatever intergovernmental agreement may or may not be put in place.  </p><p>  As for the costs to taxpayers arising from subsidies for wind energy generation versus fossil fuels, Mr. Reilly may wish to comment.</p></speech>

It is correct that Ireland and most of the rest of the world provide subsidies for fossil fuels.  Much of this is linked with energy security.  In Ireland's case, the subsidies afforded to peat-fired energy generation arise from the State's need at a certain time to increase its indigenous production of electricity.  As I indicated, in 2000 Ireland imported almost 90% of the resources required to generate electricity.  This is not a sustainable or secure position.  The European Union encourages member states to use indigenous resources.  Just as the Spanish Government subsidies coal-fired generation in Spain, there are elements of subsidies for various fossil fuels in Europe.  This is allowed under EU state aid rules to encourage indigenous production.</p><p>  For the purpose of moving forward, the International Energy Agency has much to state about the cost of electricity generation.  If fossil fuel subsidies were withdrawn, renewable energy resources, for example, geothermal energy and some of the more expensive anaerobic digestion approaches, could perhaps compete better on a level playing field.  That is an issue for policy makers rather than developers.  We will follow policy and the price signals being given to us in terms of development.  Bord na M&oacute;na is generating electricity from three sources.  I forgot to mention landfill gas.  The simple fact is that the lowest price paid to us is for onshore, wind-generated electricity.</p></speech>

Has either Bord na M&oacute;na or Element Power considered taking a slightly different approach, for example, providing an investment bond which communities or individuals could purchase?  Have they considered the option of compensating people with free electricity?</p><p>  On Turn 180, I am interested in the delegates' thoughts on the increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and whether this is having an impact on climate change.</p><p>  On the amount of fuels we are importing to generate electricity, are the delegates concerned that Ireland is an island that is susceptible to the vagaries of world events which could leave us vulnerable in terms of energy security?  </p><p>  The delegates referred to hydroelectricity.  Have Bord na M&oacute;na and Element Power considered the option of ocean energy?  Do they have a policy on that energy source? </p><p>  The potential of hydraulic fracturing or fracking is being widely discussed.  Would fracking be a good idea in terms of Ireland's energy independence?</p></speech>

Bord na M&oacute;na recently completed a consultation on the development of the Mount Lucas and Bruckana wind farms which are domestically connected.  Neither of these wind farms had prescribed community benefit schemes associated with them through planning.  We indicated, however, that we would put in place such schemes.  Bord na M&oacute;na is involved in such schemes; for example, we have a community benefit scheme as part of our landfill operation.  We wanted to consult local communities on the formal nature of schemes and how they would be operated.  We conducted an interesting consultation before Christmas and are considering the responses we received.  As one would expect, we received a wide range of views from community organisations, local sports groups and individuals.  A couple of themes emerged from the consultation.  Element Power has referred to this issue.  Many people want the benefits to be local with a capital "L".  This alludes to the concept of near neighbours under which the people whose houses and properties are close to wind farms should be the first and largest beneficiaries of any benefit scheme.  There is a sense that this is the correct approach.  Bord na M&oacute;na is considering what it can do for near neighbours in terms of educational bursaries or support for energy efficiency improvements in homes, perhaps to the point of contributing to domestic electricity bills.</p></speech>

I would add that the community benefit programme is a very important part of the whole process.  Community buy-in and acceptance of a project such as this is important.  It is also part of the SID process that a community benefit programme must be put in place.  It could well be taken out of the hands of the developers, as it could be imposed on us through the SID process in terms of on how that money is to be distributed or who is to manage it.  It is important that community consultation takes place around this whole process.  We are open to looking at issues such as investment bonds and free electricity.  We gave a commitment here today that we believe that everyone living within one kilometre of a turbine should be compensated in some way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.285" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Swords" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021800021#U00300"><p>I will start off by talking about CO2 levels in the atmosphere, which is a controversial aspect.  It boils down to whether there will be catastrophic or a mild warming.  The actual catastrophic outcome exists in the models and nowhere else.  As an engineer who works with heat transfer and other things, the idea that we can actually model the earth with any accuracy is appalling - we just cannot do it.  We are failing to do so.  These models have predicted a temperature rise of 0.2 of a degree in the past ten years and we had a flat.  We need to go back and look at these models because if we are facing a mild warming instead of a catastrophic warming, everything is different.  Also, we need to know what is the cost.  If we are spending &euro;180 to negate a tonne of carbon dioxide whose economic damage is worth less than a euro, that does not make much sense.  We have adaptation policies also.</p><p>  With regard to fuel importing, I would point out that in Saudi Arabia, where I worked, where there are 27 million people, all food is imported apart from a tiny amount.  For as long as Saudi Arabia can afford to buy food, there is not really a problem.  We export of the order of &euro;150 million worth of farm and life science products and export approximately &euro;150 million worth of other goods, including food and related products; therefore, we have &euro;300 million worth of exports.  If we are exporting, can we afford &euro;6 billion worth of fossil fuel?  Yes, but we have to look, first, at the competitiveness of that industry.  With soaring electricity prices, the American Chamber of Commerce is constantly telling us in budget submissions that its industries are no longer sustainable here.  Let us not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  We have ended up with an unhealthy situation involving a single gas pipeline going to Moffat in Scotland and running down to Ireland.  There are other gas sources on the market.  Great quantities of LNG are coming on stream.  The US is looking to be an exporter and Shannon LNG is seeking to go ahead and put gas into the network, so there are other options out there.</p><p>  Ocean energy is now working out at 22 cent by kW hour.  We can generate electricity in conventional plants at about four to five cents per kW hour.  Ocean energy is erratic.  Wind and wave varies in the same way as on land, and tidal energy does not follow the curve demanded by the consumer; it follows the curve of the moon.  It  is a huge amount of money to force on people when one does not really know the benefit.  What are we actually doing and what are we saving?</p><p>  On the issue of fracking, whether we do it or not, other people will do it.  They have already done it.  There are approximately 50,000 wells in the US and it has been a roaring success story for the US.  The way I look at it is quite logical, in the sense that I have worked in pollution control for more than 20 years.  If significant pollution occurs which is unacceptable then we do not allow it to happen; we shut down that particular industry.  If no pollution occurs and if the industry is of benefit to society then, obviously, we let it go.  That applies straight across the board for everything.</p></speech>

There is a presumption that the same approach is being taken by each one and it is not helpful.</p><p>  I wish to direct some questions to Element Power.  We have spoken about new planning guidelines which are coming on stream.  Ideally, what would the witnesses like to see in them?  I put this question to all three delegations.  We tend to introduce planning legislation from a developer perspective which, in effect, diminishes trust in the system within the general community.  I would like to hear a broad view of what each delegation has to say on what the planning guidelines should include.</p></speech>

All we can say at the moment is that whatever the result of that process, we will have to abide by it.  We have already given that undertaking here today.  Even if they are guidelines, we as a company will comply with those.</p><p>  The way things are set up in Ireland, we have to have a legally binding contract with somebody before a business transaction can take place.  While it would be nice in theory to start off by trying to get the community together for a community based project, it is not possible.  At the end of the day, we have to have an optional agreement over particular land where the turbine will be sited.  If there was a way to get the community together first and then put the turbine in place, I would like to hear it, but this is the way it has always been done.</p></speech>

It is separate and I said earlier that we are open to looking ways that the local community can invest, be it by way of an investment bond or a share equity investment.  As part of that, we have to engage with the community and get an understanding of what it wants.  At the moment, people who neighbour these projects are coming to us and asking how are they going to be compensated for living near the turbine.  That is part of the process we are working through right now.  This has been happening on a small scale all along, but what is different now is the scale and the volume.  We are talking about 40 different wind farms that are built at the same time, so we are trying to develop an overall package so that we can work on those projects at the same time.</p></speech>

The community gain is seen as an afterthought, rather than starting out with getting buy-in from the community, and so friction is created.

When we brought it up at the beginning, people would have said that it would never happen, that we were mad or whatever.  When we started this project back in 2011, we first had to socialise the idea and say that this was something that can happen, and explain to people the concept of building a cluster of wind farms and exporting the power to the UK.  It took us a full 12 months just to get people to sit down and accept that this was something that could happen.  As part of that, we had to look for a land mass where people were willing to participate in the project.  It would be very difficult to go before a community with a blank sheet and say that this is a concept; it has to be built up in steps and made happen.</p><p>  We have met over 100 local communities in the midlands for discussions.  They put forward various ideas and told us what they would like to happen.  This is part of the overall process, so that we can sit down and see how best to put together an overall policy.</p></speech>

We have broken that community gain up over the four different headings: the near neighbour fund, the local community fund, the educational fund and the enterprise fund.

When I was on Kildare County Council a few years ago, we had a look at wind energy and whether it should be included as a heading on its own in our development plan.  In fact, it was not included because it was not seen as an area that would be the most likely for wind power, mainly because the land mass is very flat.  Now there are very high turbines and we are talking about an industrial level.  Why were the midlands selected?  There is also quite a dense rural settlement pattern in the midlands that is different from other parts of the country that currently have wind farms.</p></speech>

Planning permission has been granted for 375 turbines in County Kerry.  They are placed on top of a hill, so they are as visual as the type of turbines we are hoping to put in the midlands.  There were other criteria as well.  We needed to build a project of a scale as close to the UK to the possible.  The midlands was an obvious place to look at developing a project like this, because there had not been development in the midlands like there has been in the rest of the country.</p></speech>

They examine the siting of the turbines, the right landscape for them and the landscapes that may have more capacity to site turbines.  Their role is to assess the suitability of land.  It is more a case of identifying whether the lands have the capacity to absorb turbine development.</p></speech>

We wanted to allow community and interest groups and individuals to have a say and, therefore, we did not put out any proposals.  As part of the next stage we will give consideration to all these bits and pieces and we will go back to the local communities with further engagement.  This relates to our domestic projects.  The possibility of community involvement in larger projects may be something that will come about as part of an export project, if that were to happen.</p><p>  Anyway, we have not got to that stage in Ireland with the development, despite the fact that we are installing approximately 2.5 GW on the island of Ireland.  This is being done over a 12- to 14-year period.  If we accelerate an element of this in the coming years we could possibly deliver the supply chain demand that could result in manufacturing coming to Ireland.  Certainly, it is something that those of us in Bord na M&oacute;na are keen to work towards as best we can to ensure that such supply chain demand might come about.</p></speech>

Reference was made to rural communities and planning permission being turned down.  I would not be the greatest advocate of one-off housing, with some exceptions, but some people are struggling in this regard.  This applies to people who have a reason to live in a community, who are from the community and who are turned down because of the impact a one-off house might have on the community.  Let us contrast that experience with something as visually intrusive as these projects.  They are on an industrial scale.  Do the deputations accept that they would have a sizeable impact?</p></speech>

We have never hidden from that fact, not from the word "Go".  However, what we should consider, particularly in Bord na M&oacute;na's case, is the form and nature of the land that we have in this part of the midlands.  For example, the Mount Lucas site, on which we are siting 28 turbines, is 1,100 ha in size.  That is one of the smallest individual cutaway bogs that we have in the midlands.  It is the form and nature of the landscape in the midlands which, we believe, allows us to consider something of this scale without intruding to the point at which it becomes a major problem for communities.  Obviously, on the periphery of our cutaways we begin to move into areas where there are communities and one-off houses.  However, there are considerable tracts of landscape in the midlands of such a size where there is no population at all.</p></speech>

It is a rather good template for what a large-scale wind farm, developed in post-industrial peatland that is a long way away from anywhere, looks like.

Bord na M&oacute;na held a briefing in Buswell's Hotel not long ago during which I asked Mr. D'Arcy about the hydrological assessment of the bogs.</p></speech>

An important point to understand with regard to many of the bogs in Britain is that the bogs we are discussing here are cutaway bogs.  We have gone past the peat layer into the mineral layer.  The hydrological properties of that land are, as the Deputy rightly points out, somewhat different from the sponge effect of a bog.  Some of these areas, not necessarily those we have identified for our clean energy hub, straddle the Shannon and in many cases are below its water table level.  When the peat is cut away the pumps in many of these areas will be turned off and they will flood naturally.</p><p>  Yes, it is possible to combine renewable energy and turbines on flooded peatlands, for want of a better term.  The engineering process to create the foundation and so forth is different but it is eminently possible.  As we are on the subject of water and water management, Bord na M&oacute;na has been before this committee talking about wetlands and flood management and the prospect of storing some of this water, treating, managing and disseminating it to attract water-dependent and other industries into the midlands.  That is a very viable option for some of these peatlands.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Ryan" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021800024#X00300"><p>As I said earlier, we are governed by the integrated pollution prevention control, IPPC, licences issued by the EPA.  That requires us to file a rehabilitation and restoration plan for each of our bog areas.  We have 130 bog areas throughout the country, only some of which are encompassed by the clean energy hub project.  That is only approximately 20,000 ha of the 80,000 ha we possess.  In the past year we filed a rehabilitation plan for each of the 130 bog areas with the EPA.  That includes a hydrological assessment of the bogs.  The rehabilitation plan covers all of that in respect of the future use of those peatlands after peat harvesting is finished and they become cutaway.</p><p>  There is some scope for flood attenuation along the Shannon using our bogs.  It is important to put that into context.  A few years ago we spoke to this committee about the serious flooding along the Shannon in 2010.  Much of the midlands was flooded at the time, including many of our peatlands.  Although the extent of the water was substantial and the extent of the peatlands appears substantial, the real contribution it could make to attenuation of flooding on the Shannon is relatively small, between 5% and 10%.  Almost by default we understood in 2010 that it was possible and was a potential future use for the peatlands along the Shannon.  It is not that big a factor in flood attenuation apart from the Shannon and the Suck.</p></speech>

We are very well positioned on the periphery of Europe for what the report suggested would be the real opportunity for big industrial development with export potential, which would be offshore.  In the past couple of weeks a report has come from the European Commission on blue energy.  I understand that Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s land ownership, and what it will do with it, puts it in a position that is different from those of Element or the other developers, but is it factoring that in?  The scope for putting turbines on land is finite.  Already there is very significant resistance to large-scale proposals.  Is Bord na M&oacute;na considering that?</p></speech>

There are huge opportunities offshore to build for hundreds of megawatts.  While offshore development is expensive and there are commitments from the industry to reduce the cost of offshore technology, therein lies an opportunity for Ireland, if we want to take it.  Ireland has to decide whether it wants to do this.  There is a benefit in considering this opportunity.  Blue energy is the way of the future.  There will be many opportunities there but it is not commercial now.  The costs of offshore development are being reduced and we are considering the opportunity for commercial development in wave and tidal energy.</p></speech>

With regard to 20% of the &euro;6 billion worth of fossil fuel imported, which is beyond dispute, we are in a very precarious position in being at the end of a pipeline.  We may well have reasonably good power stations, but if there is nothing to power them, would the witnesses accept that we are in a precarious position?  Could that 20% be increased?  For example, in the future, electricity is likely to be used to a greater extent in vehicles, whether rail or cars.  That is one of the three big areas we have identified where targets are not met.  We have signed up to them, whether or not one agrees with them.  Do the witnesses accept there is a good economic argument for increasing the amount of electric energy we generate, and that it will be used more prolifically in the future because it is already being used?</p></speech>

I speak from an engineering perspective.  The figure of 20% of &euro;6 billion is correct.  We have left ourselves in a very precarious situation.  I must mention the Corrib development, which has been stalled because of the problems with the planning process.  For example, an unnecessary tunnel was forced upon the developer and it is unacceptable that someone died in that tunnel.  We also could have built the Shannon LNG and it would not have cost us very much.  Instead, the arrangement with the State was unfavourable and the development did not proceed.  We have options.</p><p>  On the question of expansion of the electricity grid, I do not share the Deputy's optimism.  If we do not keep the cost of electricity competitive, usage will not increase.  We are in a very serious position because the cost of electricity in Ireland is highly uncompetitive, at 1.7 times the cost of electricity in France and 1.65 times what Finnish industry pays.  The cost of gas in the United States is between three and eight times the cost in Europe; the cost of electricity is two to three times lower than in Europe.  As a German speaker I am familiar with German industries, and they are walking out of Europe and moving elsewhere.  The population of the state of Texas grew by 425,000 over a year ago because of a significant construction boom, much of which was funded by European money invested in production and chemical processing plants, in which I have had an involvement.  </p><p>  One of the most effective ways to use electricity is through what is termed a heat source pump, a ground source pump.  This is a renewable device which provides three units of heat out of one unit of electricity.  This is a renewable technology but it will not work if the cost of electricity increases.  If we do not keep the cost of electricity competitive, the market will not grow.</p></speech>

The current guidelines are being used in a compulsory manner by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for deciding planning permissions.  They are legally binding norms.  They fall under Article 8 of the convention in that there must be a public participation process.  Once the public submissions were received there was only a two-week window in February last year.  This is inadequate as a preparation timeframe and was not compliant.  We requested and received more than 900 records, and more than 500 public submissions were received.  The public submissions referred to concerns about health and annoyance issues, yet the Department decided to exclude health considerations from its guidelines.  What is the point in the legal basis for these guidelines, considering they have failed to take due account of the public participation process, which they have ignored?  We have requested the record but it has not been provided.  Guidelines are put in place to protect residential amenity, which means that people should not suffer annoyance or adverse health effects.  What is the point of these guidelines?  They have absolved themselves from having any legal validity with regard to health.</p></speech>

I will be brief as it has been a lengthy meeting.  Some interesting questions have been asked.  This is a very important debate.  The witnesses are representing energy companies who are responding to Government and EU policy on appropriate investment for the future.  I note that Turn 180 challenges the renewable energy policy, but Ms Doolan described it best.  I agree that the group should have the right to challenge the proposals.  I am from County Mayo and we have a lot of history with regard to energy.  The first wind farm was at Bellacorick in 1992 and the Corrib gas project is in County Mayo.  The county has the highest wind speeds and probably the best ocean energy off the coast.  This is becoming an issue of national discussion, but it has already been discussed in County Mayo.  These policies have been evolving and the debate is only now getting attention from the media.  If we are all being honest, until something immediately affects us, we are not so concerned about it.  Discussions about carbon emissions and proposed infrastructure might evince a passing interest in these matters, but that is all.  Renewable energy technology has evolved and advanced, which means we should take a second look, because we are asking people in some areas to come to terms with wind farms.  The 350 MW wind farm in County Mayo will be the biggest wind farm in the country and it will be built not far from where I live and near the existing small wind farm.  This will have significant implications for the people in my area.  If we had discovered oil in the midlands people would have concerns about the oil wells, because people regard the visual amenity of their environment as being very important.  As we try to navigate the future, there will be objections from every source.  Some people campaign against fracking and others campaign against wind farms; I know of objections to bioenergy projects and also to ocean energy projects.  It is reasonable to envisage that some fishermen may not be happy with ocean energy projects.  Green energy and clean technology is the way to go.  All the comforts of modern living require more appliances and it is a certainty that energy consumption will rise.  The need to reduce energy usage will leave some people in poverty and disadvantaged.  These are very tough decisions, which require a debate about energy security.  I agree with Mr. Swords.</p><p>  I refer to the REFIT tariff and preferential payment for wind energy.  It is more expensive to set up a wind farm, but the wind is free and the farms require only maintenance.  It is agreed that energy security is a problem.  We have been dependent on technologies for the past 60 years which are based on fossil fuels and on oil in particular.  Wind turbines were invented many years ago but it was decided to use oil to provide energy.</p></speech>

I ask that he bear with me a little longer.  My point is that we need new thinking on this issue, and education has a role in that.  We must have more engagement in primary schools, such as the green flag initiatives, to teach pupils about the environment, the importance of conserving water and that rubbish thrown on the ground does not simply disappear.  It is about teaching the next generation to be responsible citizens.  Oil and gas are finite resources.  We do not have any of the former in this country and the latter is causing a great deal of trouble.  We must think responsibly as citizens, with a view to moving our eggs out of the basket they have been in thus far.</p><p>  It will always cost more to do that.  Renewables are a more expensive endeavour because our lifestyles are based around fossil fuels.  We have been discussing when it should be done and how soon is too soon.  The bottom line is that there is no good time to move towards something more expensive, but we have to take the long view.  An issue we need to address in this regard is the disconnect between the massive plans being brought forward, whether in regard to pylons, wind farms or anything else, and people's perception of the benefits or otherwise of these projects.  The policy documents the Government produces make wonderful reading with their talk of targets, indigenous resources and so on.  I accept we have to deal with the practicalities of engineering etc., but there is a gap between what is being proposed and people's understanding of the potential benefits for the country as a whole into the future.</p><p>  As I said, the largest wind farm project in the country is based in my area.  The energy it generates will not be for export but will instead contribute to the 650 MW we are putting into the system under the Gate 3 programme to bring us up to our 2020 targets.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a history in Mayo.  Its peat-fired power station has been dismantled and a wind farm will come on stream once there is some upgrading of the transmission lines.  People in the area are open to this type of project because we have a tradition of energy projects.  Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB are undertaking this project as a joint venture but they are not doing themselves any favours by the manner in which they are proceeding.  We have heard fine talk today about community gain and the delegates have invited us to visit one of their projects.  However, what I mean when I talk about community gain is actual on-the-ground benefits for people in the form of local employment in both the construction and operational phases.</p><p>  Mayo County Council has a very advanced renewable strategy , including wind energy, which takes into account all potential benefits in a type of blueprint that can be modified.  The council has set out a tangible community gain, for example, of &euro;2,000 per megawatt of wind installed.  Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB will not go even to that amount, notwithstanding the fact that the land they are operating came from local farmers by way of compulsory purchase orders.  What the witnesses from Bord na M&oacute;na are describing does not match what I am hearing at public meetings in regard to their company's engagement with people in respect of community gain.  There must be a recalibration of approach.  As public representatives, we must listen to people and show better leadership.  That leadership should focus on a recalibration of our engagement with the issues to put communities at the heart of the process.  The companies involved in these projects cannot treat communities as an afterthought or present a package and simply say how great it is.  People are much more discerning than that.</p><p>  I have put forward a proposal in regard to the project in Mayo which I have checked with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Bord na M&oacute;na, as a public company, has to follow certain rules on tendering which, on the face of it, seem to preclude it from prioritising local workers for the construction phase of its business.  However, it is entitled to apply for a derogation from the Commission for Energy Regulation which would allow it to do so.  Many young families in my area are struggling.  The power station is closed.  For those with small farms, their only off-farm income was in construction.  These people are looking at outside workers being brought in by Bord na M&oacute;na to build roads and so on.  Where is the local employment gain in that?</p><p>  Bord na M&oacute;na is effectively a pioneer in terms of influencing public attitudes to these types of projects and persuading people to accept new types of infrastructure.  The company must get it right instead of focusing on divvying up so-called packages.  However, it is not even going with what the county council has suggested.  There has to be a great deal more dialogue in respect of this project.  Fair play to the local people who are willing to go with this, because they will be at a disadvantage in certain respects.  There must be a trade-off of for them in terms of community gain and not just buttons.  We need a serious debate on this.</p><p>  A suggestion I have made - one of the witnesses referred to something along the same lines - is that people immediately impacted by infrastructure should get reduced cost electricity or something to that effect.  Communities must be offered a stake in the generating capacity.  An issue of concern in this regard is the transparency, or lack thereof, regarding the disclosure of generating capacity.  I understand Bord na M&oacute;na carries out measurements on site before it proceeds in order to ensure a project is bankable.  To what extent are those data being disclosed?  There is mistrust among communities that people are not being upfront with them.  We hear all this talk about commercially sensitive information, but Bord na M&oacute;na is a State company and, as such, has an even greater responsibility in this regard.  In the first instance, however, the onus is on the Government to provide a statutory framework which incorporates the community gain element.  As it stands, it is all very <i>ad hoc</i> and not at all transparent in terms of how moneys are being administered.  I know of private companies which are offering more than Bord na M&oacute;na is offering in my neck of the woods.  If that type of debate and engagement can be accommodated, perhaps there will be greater positivity about energy projects.</p></speech>

I urge both energy companies to take that into account.  Local employment and local gain must be at the heart of all this.  Given the scale of work they are talking about and if we are to buy into these large packages, we need to get down to the nuts and bolts of it, as Mr. Reilly described, in terms of how this will be done.  The delegates from Element Power will be bankrolling the projects they have discussed.  Are they talking to local manufacturing companies?  Is it all tied up with IDA Ireland and how far have those discussions progressed?  We cannot make false promises to people.  The reality is there are limited opportunities in direct employment from wind farms.</p><p>  I conclude with a technical question.  Reference was made to the use of AC power lines within wind farms.  In regard to export potential, I understand it is a DC line that will take the current to the interconnector.  If we have AC technology within the wind farms and a DC line to the interconnector, does it mean we are looking at convertor stations?  If so, are they not a significant consideration in the planning process?</p></speech>

They might be aware of the Bill that is down for First Stage on the D&aacute;il Order Paper.

We are making such decisions on the basis of desperation.  This is because we have to pay back to Britain the money we supposedly received from it in the form of a bailout.  We are now so desperate that we no longer care whether we destroy our communities, blight our landscape for ever and decimate our tourism industry.  The decision is being made because we are desperate.  One should not make decisions when one is desperate.  One should sit back and think about what one is doing.  This meeting will be the beginning and end of the consultation process for Element Power and Bord na M&oacute;na.  They will have everything on their side in the future and they will ram home their advantage.  Sadly, however, the public will not put up with that.  If the companies do not work with the people on this matter, then what is envisaged will never come to pass.  I will not be involved, but if turbines are erected, people will use chainsaws and angle grinders to bring them down.  That is a fact.  One does not tell Irish people what to do with their own land or how to live their lives.  We beat the Brits out of here who tried to do that, and they will be beaten out again if that is what it takes.</p></speech>

In the course of a debate a motion was passed specifying that the amount would be &euro;10,000, but the document refers to an amount of &euro;2,000, and Bord na M&oacute;na was not even at the races with that.  What Mr. Reilly has described, which is a very plausible approach, has not happened on the ground where I am.  The organisation is dealing with people who are willing to accept wind farm infrastructure, but there has to be payback for them, and I agree with that.  It is up to the witnesses to make sure that happens and that there is meaningful engagement on how community gain will work out.</p></speech>

We have had discussions with the Cowhig power group and various groups down there and we are going to proceed to consultation on the formal nature of the community benefit scheme that we propose.  We want to engage with communities and want to understand what they would accept.  I agree with the Deputy regarding the local community in Mayo in terms of the 650 MW of proposed wind energy for domestic consumers.  The people of Mayo - I am generalising here - want to see that happen.  That is the sense we have got.  We are willing to work with them to try to make sure that project ultimately does come to pass - that is our intention - in a way that is acceptable to the local community.</p></speech>

Deputy Mulherin is correct in that where there is a change from AC to DC power lines, a converter station is required.  It would consist of underground cables coming in with AC and going back out with DC.  Effectively, it consists of a large steel-clad building with some transformers outside it and some cooling fans inside.  One would only see one of these if one were to have a look at the one in Woodland.  It exists already for the east-west interconnector.  That is what one would look like.</p></speech>

We are constantly talking about billions and billions of euro going around.  There is obviously a wonderful financial model and the citizen is to get a few bob and a few jobs here and there.  Fundamentally, the Aarhus Convention providing for access to information and public participation is not about consultation.  The decision cannot be made until members of public have engaged and the process has been brought through.  When we go through our environmental impact assessment and our public participation procedures, we weight up and evaluate what are the benefits and what aspects are not beneficial.  The decision is based on a reasonable proportionate measure.  Just because something has negative environment impacts does not mean it will not be approved, but we cannot have disproportionate negative impacts for very small benefits.  It is part of the renewables directive that measures for the licensing and operation of renewable generation have to be proportionate and transparent.  We have a huge failing in that area.</p><p>  As regards the money to be given to the community, that divides communities.  There are people who do not want to have these developments around them for very good reason.  When we come around to the question of community gain and statutory community gain in particular, we have to be very careful and question whether it is a bribe.  That is being examined legally in the United Kingdom.  One cannot go around and give people money because there are other people who have every right to participate in the decision who are going to have financial issues with it or whatever.  One must be very careful.</p><p> The other side of the issue, speaking from my perspective as an engineer with 25 years' experience of major projects ranging in value from &euro;50 million to &euro;500 million, is that projects have to be delivered on time, on budget and safely round the globe.  If I do not deliver on those criteria I am out of a job - or prosecuted, in various places such as Ukraine where I have worked.  One of the issues with the engineering profession is a tendency to deep conservatism.  We assess things.  When a dream salesman comes in we know it is a dream salesman.  Our energy policy in Ireland is dysfunctional and it is all over the place.  Whatever sort of dream comes along, everybody jumps on board.  At the same time, 50% of the money, if not more, that is being paid in electricity bills comes from industry or commercial entities.  They cannot carry this charge and be competitive - they are going to walk out.</p><p>  As regards the Bill, an assessment has been done of what land is available.  If we had followed the strategic environmental assessment process and adhered to it, which we did not do and which is now subject to legal proceedings at the UN and elsewhere, we would know what the proper distance is to protect the human population.  Therefore, we could have planned - taking account of the scale of our landscape that needs to be protected, special areas of habitat, etc. - what exactly we could build.  Yet we have a plan to provide for capacity of 7,145 MW.</p></speech>

They are very welcome.  I agree that the people are the most important concern.  It is important they are given the factual information from both sides.  It is also important for the committee to get the views of every side on the debate before decisions are made.  Factual information is important.  I was involved in organising a conference on renewable energy, held in Dublin Castle, which all the energy companies attended.</p></speech>

There was nothing about what happened inside Dublin Castle.  It is necessary to put the entire picture on the table.  I live in Dublin which means I do not live in either the midlands or in Mayo.  The full picture must be given to people.  We should have a presentation on when and if the lights go off and the factual situation on permanent capacity at the moment.  We do not want to go back to the dark days.  As Deputy Flanagan said, it has nothing to do with bailing out the country.  It is about ensuring stability of supply from a renewable source that reduces CO2.  The issue is how we go about that.</p><p>  New designs for wind turbines come on-stream all the time.  One design has an apron hood that reduces the height of the turbine while increasing capacity by 30%.  I have not seen any company come up with such an approach even though it would involve a reduction in the minimum required distance from houses based on the height of the turbine.</p><p>  I also wish to inquire about access to the grid for the wind that is produced.  On 17 December 2013 a total of 50% of energy consumption was generated by wind energy.  That sounds great but it does not happen every day because wind is variable and it decreases.  A question mark has been raised in Germany about the variability of wind.  It is not noticed in a country where there are very few wind turbines and very little production capacity but the situation changes when the use of wind turbines increases dramatically.  In 2000 in Germany, the number of wind turbines was six and in 2010 there was an increase to 23.  One must take into account the wear and tear on conventional fossil fuel power stations when they have to ramp up to increase production and then wind down.  When every factor is included, could someone indicate the cost of the reduction in fossil fuel production or the cost of decommissioning the power stations?  Witnesses will be aware of the spinning reserve that each fossil fuel power station must keep on reserve.  On 17 December there was a 50% reduction in the power required from fossil fuel power stations.  I have heard it said that power stations keep 90% in reserve, just in case.  When one takes into account the need to have that much electricity in reserve, having other electricity being used and with no storage capacity, is it the case that when one goes around one meets oneself coming back?  I have not heard the issue addressed.</p></speech>

I am a proponent of wind energy and renewable energy.  I am also a proponent of ensuring we have all the facts on the table for every type of energy production.  Reference was made to cost; 2 cent for fossil fuels compared with 22 cent for hydro energy and wave energy.  One must balance environment protection against the cost and examine all of the aspects.  We need an additional presentation on the ramping up and scaling down of production and the spinning reserve in order to have all the facts.  We must also focus on when the lights will go off.  It is not about paying back our debt, it is about climate change, CO2 and other issues.  We want to get that right.  Hydro is the most positive element but as has been said, we have only the Shannon, we do not have the Nile.  Wind is the next best option and nuclear energy is the third best.  People should not shake their heads.  I am calling it as it is, based on published studies and taking pollution into account.  Biomass comes after that.  All technologies are being considered.</p><p>  We have an abundance of wind in Ireland.  We export beef, fish and other products without anyone decrying that.  When we start to export wind, there is a big singsong about it.  Could one of the witnesses remind me how much wind energy was worth to this country in the past five years?  I have forgotten the amount but it was of the order of billions.  The worth was given in production terms.  One has to ask whether it is worth that much when one takes into account the reserve and the cost of production.  There are swings and roundabouts.  I thank the witnesses for attending today&rsquo;s meeting.  The committee has a lot of questions to ask of other people as well as today&rsquo;s witnesses.  I hope the climate change Bill will improve our energy situation.  We must do something to ensure the lights do not go off.</p></speech>

Pressure is what one puts in the tyre of a car.  I understand that.  I do not respond to pressure.  First, I would be disappointed if renewables such as wind, hydro, tidal and wave, geothermal and biomass could not be used to significantly reduce our dependence on dwindling and increasingly expensive fossil fuels.  I like to see the reality of situations as well.</p><p>  My first point relates to the companies themselves.  There was speculation that many of the people involved were close to Government, that they were sitting on boards and advising the companies.  I refer to former politicians, former advisers to Government and former civil servants and the relationship between the political and governance system and the energy companies.  Could the witnesses tell me whether they have people on their boards or as advisers or consultants who were politicians?</p><p>  On the export of energy to Britain, what was the nature of discussions or negotiations with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and-or their equivalents in Britain?</p><p>  The third theme relates to leasing or purchasing land options.  The witnesses explained how they identify the areas where they hope to put pylons.  Have the negotiations with landowners involved goodwill payments?  How much has it cost the companies to date?  Are the agreements subject to planning permission being granted?  Could those who signed the leases or options renegotiate or back out of the agreements?</p></speech>

Outside of the members who are on the board through the worker participation Act, it consists largely of businesspeople of one kind or another.</p><p>  Senator Keane spoke about factual information, renewable information and so forth.  I totally agree with her.  We have seen that even today in this very good discussion, and I acknowledge many of the contributions from the different sides.  There is a need for an evidence-based approach to this, where we get the facts and put them down to the best of our ability, notwithstanding that many of these are interpretations.  The facts are there, but how those facts are interpreted is what comes into opinion forming.</p><p>  With regard to designs for wind turbines, in general there has been a good deal of development in turbine design, both for small turbines suited to more domestic environments and for the larger turbines proposed.  All of the companies will continually look at turbine technology design in terms of scale, efficiency, noise and overall impact.</p><p>  On the conventional power plants, if we take the island of Ireland without any interconnectivity, 100% back-up will be required for wind energy.  The same would apply for 100 islands the size of Ireland.  Each of the islands will need its own renewable energy capacity and its own back-up.  It is when these 100 islands start interconnecting that the efficiencies are achieved, particularly if we look at it on a European basis, which is what is driving much of policy here.  There is a European view on this in terms of bringing in nuclear power from those areas that have nuclear energy and that are very good at producing it, such as France and Britain; bringing in renewable energy from those areas in Europe that are particularly good at wind energy, such as Ireland and Scotland; bringing in bioenergy from those areas that have scale and capability; and bringing in solar energy from those areas in southern Europe and North Africa to allow them to contribute.  That is the concept of the overarching super-grid.  It is not only on production, because another important point that has not been mentioned is usage and getting smart grids and smart devices <i>in situ</i> that are much more responsive to the fluctuations occurring on the grid.  That must be taken into account as well.</p><p>  Deputy Colreavy mentioned the Green Paper on energy.  I totally accept that.  There have been a number of White Papers and Green Papers at various stages-----</p></speech>

As I stated previously, Ireland has a lot of opportunity in this regard and it is important for all key elements to understand what is that opportunity, to communicate to the communities that are directly and indirectly involved and then to ensure we are on that horse when it bolts and that it is a sustainable horse that is going places.  There is a shift under way in moving from a fossil-based energy system to a much less carbon-intensive system.  In such an environment, Ireland disproportionately does better than those parts that have been benefitting-----</p></speech>

As for the new designs, however, the new designs I have seen result in them becoming higher and bigger.  A design called the Saphonian version 1 actually also has a storage facility, the first in the world to so do.  It has no blades but resembles the sail of a ship.  My point is that this design would answer three of the questions with regard to height, storage and continuity of supply.  Were Mr. D'Arcy in a position to state something like that was available and could be obtained through whatever company - I understand no company in Ireland is doing it - it also should be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

It is something that has been considered by the Irish Naval Service and I am familiar with that.  In a general point on wind, the history of wind power is there for all to see.  Wind energy has been deployed throughout the Middle Ages, be it on sail ships or windmills, in a variety of different locations worldwide.  This is not a new source of energy but what is new is its deployment for the production of electricity to the scale and extent under discussion.</p></speech>

If the United Kingdom wishes to meet its targets, the best of luck to it.  I do not know how it will so do and do not really care.  No regulation, rule or resolution states that Ireland has an obligation to help the United Kingdom to meet its targets.  Essentially, what is being pursued here is profit.  Ireland is not attempting to abide by a law and is not trying to be compliant with a rule or regulation.  What is being pursued here simply is profit and Ireland has no obligation to help the United Kingdom in any way, shape or form.  We can wish them the best of luck in meeting their targets, however they do it.  They probably will meet them through the use of nuclear power and fracking anyway but we have no obligation to do this.  What is being pursued here is pure profit on the part of a number of different entities, including a Wall Street hedge fund based in Teaneck, New Jersey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.397" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Swords" time="18:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014021800031#EE01000"><p>There has been a lot of discussion and it is scaremongering to suggest that lights will go out.  We have a single pipeline going up to the south west of Scotland and it is undesirable that we have that.  We have a fully functional gas terminal at Corrib and were we obliged to lay the pipeline in a hurry, we could drop it along the beach in about four to six weeks.  It is only a distance of 9 km and laying rates of pipelines on ground often can exceed 1 km per day.  We have a flexible connection of approximately that length, which must be connected at the wellhead.  This has not been done to prevent it from corroding.  They are waiting until the entire project, which is ten years out of date, is completed.  In reality, we could switch over to the Corrib field and keep everything going.  We have alternatives and there is no rush.  Even were that pipeline to western Europe through Scotland to go bang, we still would have other alternatives.</p><p>  The other issue when it comes to wind is that many things can be done.  Man went to the moon and back in 1969 and 1970.  However, it is a question of economics and sense, as no one has been back there since.  The question is whether it is sensible, not because it looks good or appears nice.  When it comes to wind, in simple terms one must consider what it is, namely, kinetic energy and that is half the mass multiplied by the velocity squared.  As for the mass, there are 30 km of air above me but that does not weigh very much and is very poor.  The velocity squared pertains to the velocity of the wind, which only has a velocity of 4 m/s to 6 m/s, which is only 14 km/h to 15 km/h on average in the midlands.  Consequently, the amount of energy one gets is very low, highly distributed and very erratic.  Moreover, there is no way this will change and therefore one must build more and bigger wind turbines, as one must catch more air.  If one wants more energy, one must catch more air and therefore one needs a bigger project.</p><p>  Another aspect concerns the power that comes from a wind turbine.  While it actually is turning and appears as though it is turning, the power is fluctuating all the time because it is related to the velocity cubed.  If the velocity is halved, the power falls by one over two cubed, which is eight.  In other words, if the wind speed halves, one gets 12% of the power even though it actually is turning around.  This leads to the fact that someone must balance all this and our power stations are operating like cars stuck in traffic, that is, inefficiently.  In fact, we are only getting approximately half of the savings claimed and this was known before this programme was started because EirGrid drew up the report on it.  Even though a figure was reached of having 50% of our electricity being generated by wind, the fuel saving achieved was less than half that.  Moreover, at that point the grid was being destabilised and tripped and we were dumping wind because the grid was being destabilised.  We must go back and assess all these things.  We must work out the benefit and there is no point in creating huge grids all over the countryside, connecting this, that and the other at a massive cost that does not work out on the basis of cost benefits but which merely really annoys people because of the visual and other intrusions on their society.</p></speech>

From an Irish point of view, the Strategy for Renewable Energy 2012-2020, published by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in 2012, has the export of wind power as a strategic goal.  In the United Kingdom, the authorities are in the process of introducing a new energy Bill and as part of that, they have introduced a mechanism to support importation projects from their point of view.  Consequently, there is a policy context.  The Deputy is correct that it is being developed as we move along.  In an Irish context, the planning guidelines and the strategic environmental assessment is being done.  We only have a memorandum of understanding between Ireland and United Kingdom at present and await the completion of a full intergovernmental agreement.  The Deputy is correct that waiting for all these things to happen would be a nice way to do it and had we the luxury of so doing, that is what we would do as investors.  It would be much easier for us to sit back and not to be investing the millions of euro we are investing.  However, this is not an opportunity that will stay there for ever and a day.  Consequently, as a company, we are trying to position ourselves in order that if the opportunity does arise, we will be able to take the benefit of that opportunity.  It is a risk strategy but that is what one must do in business.</p></speech>

On 24 January last, this investor petitioned the High Court to appoint a liquidator to take possession of the assets of the company.  The High Court appointed provisional liquidators on 24 January to effect the full cessation of the business of the hospital.  This resulted in the loss of 382 jobs and the closure of 130 beds.  Adjacent hospitals, including St. James's Hospital, Tallaght hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital, all had high numbers of patients admitted to their emergency departments at the time the hospital closed.  In fact, today there are 419 patients admitted in hospitals without a bed.  The National Maternity Hospital, the Coombe hospital and the Rotunda Hospital, the three Dublin public maternity hospitals, have consistently reported that they are operating at 30% above their capacity.  In recent months, Mount Carmel Hospital had been treating a large number of patients from public waiting lists.  In addition, the HSE had contracted 25 beds to alleviate overcrowding in acute hospitals.</p><p>  To give the committee some factual information, a number of investors made a bid recently to buy the hospital as a going concern.  One bidder had concluded a due diligence exercise and had take-over funding in place.  Linked to this, St. James's Hospital had agreed to manage and operate Mount Carmel Hospital on behalf of this investor.  The interest of St. James's Hospital is important for a number of reasons.  First, it would allow the hospital to transfer patients and services to Mount Carmel Hospital and thereby create capacity for the planned new children's hospital on its site in Dublin 8.  Also, St. James's Hospital planned to reduce its waiting list numbers with the extra bed and theatre capacity opened up by the usage of Mount Carmel Hospital's facilities.  Following NAMA's rejection of this bid, these opportunities have been lost.</p><p>  With regard to occupancy, throughout 2013 bed occupancy increased at Mount Carmel Hospital from a low of 20% in March to near full capacity at the end of the year, prior to the hospital being liquidated.  The higher occupancy was mainly as a result of the HSE contracting 25 beds to relieve the chronic overcrowding that has plagued acute hospitals in the region.  These hospitals are repeatedly in the news for having a chronic over-crowding problem.  In particular, Tallaght hospital, Beaumont Hospital and Connolly Hospital immediately benefited from the access to these 25 additional beds.  St. James's Hospital and the Mater hospital also stood to benefit within weeks.  The 25 beds were contracted by the HSE because the public health service is unable to cope with current demands for health care.  This additional capacity has now been lost.</p><p>  As regards waiting lists, 2,300 public patients were prioritised to be taken off waiting lists and have their operation promptly carried out at Mount Carmel Hospital.  A total of 1,100 public patients, including children, had their operation carried out, with a further 1,200 public patients having scheduled appointments for operations.  Many of these individuals had been waiting three years for an appointment.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Letterkenny Hospital, Naas Hospital, Sligo Hospital, Tallaght hospital and St. James's Hospital all benefited from this waiting list initiative.  The 1,200 people have now been returned to public waiting lists with little, if any, prospect of having their procedure completed.  The 1,100 patients now return to an over-crowded public hospital system for their follow-up care and outpatient appointment.  This additional capacity is now also lost.</p><p>  Recent statistics show that there are 60,000 people waiting on public waiting lists for operations.  The members have been furnished with figures which are submitted by the HSE to the health sector trade unions' at the bi-monthly national joint council meetings.  The latest figures confirm that nursing whole-time equivalents, WTE, employed in the public services have reduced by more than 5,000 since March 2009.  This reduction records a loss of almost 1,000 posts since December 2012 alone.  I point this out in the context of a number of nurses and midwives now going into the jobs market and finding it almost impossible to rebuild their careers elsewhere.  The reductions were effected by the moratorium on recruitment during a period of continued increased demand for our public health services.  The members of the committee have the waiting list figures for each of the hospitals.</p><p>  I will now outline the immediate cost to the Exchequer.  The Social Insurance Fund will meet the cost of all the redundancies.  At a conservative estimate, this will cost the public finances between &euro;6 million and &euro;8 million.  In addition, with 328 workers applying for jobseeker's allowance, at a conservative estimate it will cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;4 million per year.  It should be borne in mind that an additional 64 staff are currently at the Labour Relations Commission in talks with the employer regarding redundancy, so we expect there will be a further hit to the public finances in respect of jobseeker's allowance.  The loss of VAT and PAYE receipts to the public finances is conservatively estimated to be &euro;7 million per year.</p><p>  It has been widely reported that the aforementioned bid failed due to it being approximately &euro;2 million below what NAMA was prepared to accept.  It would appear that 382 jobs have been sacrificed for a balance of &euro;2 million, while the public finances suffer by &euro;17 million immediately, and a potential ongoing cost of &euro;11 million per year thereafter.  A considerable number of public patients will have their operations delayed.  Our public health care system will come under additional pressure as a result.</p><p>  Mount Carmel Hospital made a loss of approximately &euro;1 million in 2013 on a turnover of &euro;28 million to &euro;30 million.  Staff accepted a number of cost saving measures in 2012 and 2013 as a result of the pain and hardship of the Haddington Road agreement being extended to those employees.  The effect of that will not flush through the system until 2014.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014021800004#D00200"><p>I thank Mr. McAnenly for his presentation.  I am delighted the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has come before the committee.  We will also have a discussion with the Minister and the Department of Health.  We requested that NAMA come before the committee but it declined.  It has furnished us with some documentation which does not throw much light on what we would like to find out about the offers put on the table and how much it would have cost to secure Mount Carmel Hospital as a going concern and private entity or to have it taken over by the State and placed in the public hospital system.</p><p>  I do not know what we can do about Mount Carmel Hospital.  We all know where it is.  It is closed and being wound down.  Documents have been transferred in recent days and it is ceasing to exist as a hospital as we speak.  It is still important that we find out how much it would have cost to maintain the hospital if due diligence were done by the Department of Health and HSE on whether it would have been an asset for the State in the provision of health care.</p><p>  I visited Mount Carmel Hospital a number of weeks ago and one could sense the staff were very deflated.  They were shattered.  Caesarean sections were taking place when I was there.  It was a very vibrant and alive hospital.  What I found amazing when examining the figures was the number of public patients being treated there under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  These patients will now go back on the waiting list and the National Treatment Purchase Fund is shopping around, examining other private health providers such as the Beacon Hospital and the Mater Private Hospital to see whether they can fill the void.  This is why I cannot hold out much hope for the hospital itself.  We felt we should try to find out exactly why it closed and whether it was a simple case of liquidation because it was no longer viable or if other avenues were available.</p><p>  I wish to convey my sympathies to the staff.  It has been a part of the community of south Dublin and part of the broader health system for many years.  I represent a Cork constituency and people came from throughout the country for specific treatment in Mount Carmel Hospital, referred through the National Treatment Purchase Fund or private health insurance.</p><p>  It does not make much difference now, but how it was handled by NAMA, the courts and the liquidator and how they informed the staff was very disappointing to say the very least.  We should put on record that sending out a press release or informing the media before staff and management is distasteful.  It happens all too often in this country that the last people to be told are the staff.  A press release is sent out from a PR organisation to inform people their livelihoods have been taken away and it is not good enough.  This was badly handled.</p><p>  Mr. McAnenly stated Mount Carmel Hospital was not just a maternity hospital and this was also brought to my attention when I was there.  A large volume of other procedural traffic also went through it.  When one considers this, what must now happen will put huge pressure on the public hospital system in the greater Dublin area, and other private hospitals will have to be contracted to take up the void.  We have not thought this through.  If it came down to &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million, based on analysis done on the cost of social welfare and other Departments, it would raise very serious questions on what effort the Department of Health or HSE made to see whether it could be rescued as a going concern and brought into State ownership so it could continue to provide a service.</p><p>  The development of the national children's hospital at the St. James's Hospital site is a key issue.  I am not an expert on planning, architectural design or engineering but the development of a massive infrastructural development at such a tight site will cause huge dislocation to St. James's Hospital.  It will have a major impact on the workings of St. James's Hospital for a number of years while it is being constructed.  Mount Carmel Hospital could have taken the overflow or surplus during this construction.  Even at this late stage, this needs to be explored.  If we cannot reverse what has happened, it should still be seen as a medical facility to complement the public health system in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>  I do not know what we can do for the staff of Mount Carmel Hospital at this late stage.  They have our sympathy.  I thoroughly believe it is appropriate to bring the witnesses and other stakeholders before the committee to hear what they have to say about why the facility was allowed to close.</p></speech>

We will have an opportunity to engage with the Minister directly after this meeting.  What the witnesses have shared with us will be very helpful in preparing for it.  I join Deputy Kelleher in expressing disappointment that NAMA did not feel it appropriate to come before the committee.  It is most regrettable.  NAMA certainly has questions to answer and we will have to explore them in another way.</p><p>  The lamentable end result of all of this is we will lose a health care facility.  I am not a champion by any means - far from it - of private health care provider entities but nevertheless one must recognise in the situation we are in this was a health facility with 130 beds, 382 staff, expensive medical equipment and extensive premises which are now to all intents and purposes closed down.  It is most unwise.</p><p>  I thank the INMO for ably representing its membership in the nursing and midwifery staff.  The staff themselves only learned of what was intended through the media.  They have been laid off without proper notice.  A number of them have decades of service in Mount Carmel Hospital and other facilities.</p><p>  I noted the remarks Mr. McAnenly made in his presentation on NAMA.  I ask him to elaborate on the role of NAMA in all of this.  To my mind, it has looked at this as an asset securing loan acquirement in cold balance sheet terms with no consideration whatsoever of what the facility was about.  I wonder where stood its social responsibility, which it most certainly has or is supposed to have, I understand, as part of its terms and responsibilities.</p></speech>

I will not repeat the comments of my colleagues, Deputies Kelleher and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, other than to agree and to declare an interest.  I was born in Mount Carmel myself and had my tonsils out there.  Consequently, I have had some experience of the facilities.  However, like my colleagues, the manner in which this decision was communicated is a subject of concern and I certainly have taken note of the INMO's recommendations.  Mr. McAnenly raised some really valid issues and in addition to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's questions about the staffing, what arrangements are in place?  Are arrangements in place for transferring or picking up on expertise?  As I have heard different communications, it would be really useful for the joint committee to have clarity in this regard.  Another question that has not been raised previously pertains to the hospital's current infrastructure and facilities.  At what level are the facilities?  Did the hospital need a major overhaul or are these facilities fully operational?  I seek to understand what is the infrastructure that has been left there.  I again refer to the manner in which the news was communicated to the local area, the staff and to everyone concerned.  I cannot imagine what the week in question was like for those who were pregnant and had been booked in to attend Mount Carmel.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance today and certainly look forward to hearing their answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014021800005#E00300"><p>I will be brief.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance and, like my colleagues, acknowledge it is a difficult time for staff who made a huge commitment there in the provision of health care for many years.  It is not easy for anyone who is dedicated and committed to his or her job to suddenly find one's employment changes overnight without any pre-warning.  I have examined the affidavit filed in the High Court and the financial position does not appear to have been great for some time.  Were staff aware of the difficulties that existed or were they kept completely in the dark?  The aforementioned affidavit indicates there appear to have been losses from 2007 onwards.  The figures being given here in the affidavit, which I presume was filed, indicate annual losses since 2007 that vary between somewhat more than &euro;1 million and &euro;1.5 million.  Three different figures were given in the end, which add up to approximately &euro;43 million in liabilities.  Were the staff aware of the difficulties?  Was there any pre-warning of such difficulties or was this all kept in the dark without any prior warning?  If that was the position, it was very unfair.  One problem that exists at present for everyone in private health care is there now is a lot of competition in that sector.  Another issue is the number of people with private health insurance is decreasing.  However, from a staff point of view, was there any pre-warning with regard to the financial difficulties that existed?  As for re-organisation since 2007, was there consultation about creating efficiencies in order that the maximum number of jobs could be maintained throughout that period over the past six or seven years?</p></speech>

I met Mr. Philip McAnenly almost immediately following the announcement of the closure and he kindly briefed me fully on pretty well all the information that has been presented here.  I remembered it point by point.  The question that Senator Colm Burke raised is easily answered because it was public knowledge that Mount Carmel Hospital, which was controlled by Gerard Conlon, paid a huge price to the sisters for the hospital.  Interest charges alone on that sum of money would have hung a huge albatross around its neck.  In fact, the operating loss of slightly more than &euro;1 million in the past year, given the subdued levels of occupation, almost constitute an achievement when one considers what the interest charges would have been.  If one takes a rate of 4% on the guts of &euro;60 million, which we believe was the initial figure when the loans were advanced, that amounts to &euro;2.4 million alone in interest charges.  While interest did fall with the reducing European Central Bank rates and so on, it does not take rocket science to know that the over-mortgage or overloaned position of the bank was the problem, not the operational matters.</p><p>  I wish to double-check with the witnesses a statement by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, that the demand for maternity services, relatively speaking, has peaked and is falling as the birthrate falls.  While this is known to all, there had been an orderly transition to other types of medicine.  In fact, my own dear father died in Mount Carmel in March 2010 after two years of highly caring nursing.</p></speech>

I suggest we should drill into it.  My sister is a nurse in Mount Carmel and the hospital has been there since 1950.  I remember being there with the Minister in 2012 when new machinery was being installed in one of the operating theatres.  That is only a year and a half ago.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher asked about the offers.  My information on that matter comes from what has been made public and is in the media.  I understand there were two serious bids, one by a company called Centric - I read in the newspapers that it may be interested again to some extent.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip McAnenly" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014021800006#F01800"><p>No, there have been no further discussions.  The second bid is more serious; Mr. Mulchrone and Mr. Barry had an interest in bringing together a number of new services to the hospital and a number of new consultants were going to bring work to the hospital.  In addition, I understand a bid of &euro;14 million was made.  Of that &euro;14 million, some &euro;10 million was going to be paid for creditors, including the Revenue Commissioners who were happy with the payments being made to them.  The remaining &euro;4 million was to be paid to NAMA.  I understand that before Christmas NAMA was prepared to accept closer to that figure but subsequently, in the two to three months later, it decided to reject the bid of &euro;4 million.  It would appear that &euro;2 million was the sum required to continue the hospital funding and that was based on 2013 figures when the occupancy level of the hospital fell to 20%.  In the weeks prior to the liquidation of the hospital, the occupancy was almost at full.  The figures I am presenting of a loss of &euro;1 million based on a &euro;28 million to &euro;30 million turnover are somewhat skewed.  It may have been more accurate if we had looked at figures for the final six months or the final quarter of the year which would have shown a more accurate picture of how profitable or viable the hospital could have been, based on closer to full occupancy.</p></speech>

There are very compelling and persuasive reasons as to why the hospital should have been saved along with the 482 jobs that have been lost.  Only the catering jobs remain and these are currently in the conciliation services of the Labour Relations Commission.</p><p>  There is a national public interest issue at stake.  This is not about patients in one part of Dublin.  I refer to the waiting lists in Letterkenny, Naas and Sligo hospitals as well as in larger Dublin hospitals which are struggling with well-documented capacity problems.  These hospitals all obtained immediate relief when the HSE purchased 25 beds in Mount Carmel to relieve the overcrowding.  Patients who no longer required acute hospital care and attention could be moved to Mount Carmel for the next phase of their care.  The other concern of a public interest is the impact this is likely to have on the development of the already delayed national children's hospital.  St. James's Hospital is on the record as stating that it needs the capacity at Mount Carmel Hospital to create the new site because adult beds would be lost in the creation of the new children's hospital.  The decanting of adult beds to Mount Carmel would solve the problem for St. James's.  </p><p>  I ask what level of joined-up thinking took place across a number of Departments and publicly funded bodies such as NAMA, who should have had an interest in ensuring that almost 400 jobs were saved and that adults who cannot afford the private health system would be able to access immediate care and have their operations and procedures carried out promptly.  </p><p>  The HSE prioritised the most sick children and adults from its waiting lists to be treated in Mount Carmel Hospital.  A total of 1,100 patients had their procedures completed and they would require further outpatient care but they must return to an overcrowded, overburdened public health system that cannot cope with them.  The only reason they were treated in Mount Carmel Hospital was because the public health system could not look after them.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the input of the HSE and the Department of Health.  The level of co-ordination between HSE and the Department and the board of St. James's Hospital is worthy of further examination.  I am not sure if there was liaison between the board of St. James's Hospital and the Minister's office but I believe there should have been with regard to the potential risk to a number of patients on public waiting lists.  A number of elderly, confused patients were immediately transferred into the 25 contracted beds.  They were transitioned from Beaumont and Tallaght hospitals into Mount Carmel Hospital, with a consequent aggravation of their confused state.</p></speech>

They would have been largely permanent staff.  In response to the Deputy's question regarding the chances of the staff rebuilding their career elsewhere, unfortunately, it is almost zero because there is a recruitment ban in the health service.  The moratorium on recruitment provides for some grades being exempt from the recruitment ban but unfortunately nursing and midwifery are not exempt grades.  The Government may consider in the medium term temporarily lifting that ban on recruitment not only because of the difficulties those 205 nurses and midwives now face, but because of the well-chronicled and well-reported difficulties that the public health service is currently suffering.  We need only consider the number of patients who were on trolleys last night.</p></speech>

It is interesting to note that in the history of health care provided at Mount Carmel Hospital there was never one incident of MRSA, which has plagued our health services elsewhere.  Since 24 January, I have spent up to 14 hours per day on-site at the hospital trying to support staff and going through the redundancy procedures, etc.  It is vexing to see the excellent facilities that are there.  As nurses, both me and my colleague would have worked in public health care facilities over the years that were not a patch on what we have seen in Mount Carmel.  It is a fantastic facility.  The buildings are pristine, with many single rooms and two-bed rooms, all en suite and all available today for use by the public, yet they have been closed.</p><p>  Senator Burke asked if staff were made aware of the financial situation at the hospital.  Each of the unions involved, including our union, would have worked very closely with both the previous management of the hospital and the interim management since NAMA acquired the assets to effect cost savings to try to ensure the future of the hospital.  We would have introduced all the cost-saving measures civil and public servants endured under the Haddington Road agreement.  Staff would have worked the additional hours for no added pay.  Staff would have lost premium earnings, as did staff in the civil and public service.  All those cost-saving measures were introduced in an effort to secure the future of the hospital.</p><p>  In addition, we engaged with management in effecting a round of redundancies at the hospital last year but we were moving in a direction that led us to believe, and we were being informed by the interim managers, that we were moving closer and closer to a break-even point with every passing day.  We were looking forward to 2014 when the full values of those cost savings would be measured in the annual budget and where we would have been operating a hospital that would have had close to 100% occupancy.  We have no doubt based on the accounts and the figures that were presented to us regularly and at the monthly - and sometimes more frequently than that - meetings with management that the hospital would have moved into profitability in 2014.  <b></b></p><p>  Deputy Mathews mentioned that the Minster has repeatedly stated that the birth rate has peaked.  That may be the case and that may be for reasons due to legislative changes over the years, but it is also a fact that the masters of each of the three Dublin maternity hospitals have repeatedly reported that they are operating at more than 30% above the optimum level or their desired or ideal capacity level.  It is a red herring to refer to declining birth rates.</p></speech>

While it was reported in the media that a number of caveats were attached to the Mulchrone-Barry bid, the media did not carry any reports on the Centric Health bid, which was, I understand, made by two consultants.  It was reported that the Mulchrone-Barry bid failed, <i>inter alia</i>, because it included too many caveats.  It should not be unusual to find caveats attached to bids where a hospital is in the process of an orderly wind-down.  This was not the liquidation of a factory, block of apartments, hotel or restaurant.  The hospital was fully occupied on 24 January when the owner petitioned the High Court to liquidate the asset.  I imagine that if any investors were buying a hospital which was almost fully occupied and fully operational, it would be normal to expect some caveats attached to any bids for the facility.</p><p>  We have not had any discussions with the National Asset Management Agency.  NAMA did not engage with us about the welfare or future of the employees or the timeframes under which it was funding the liquidation.  </p><p>  To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's question, it is not too late to rescue the hospital.  The liquidator was appointed on 24 January and two thirds of the staff were made redundant on 31 January.  The majority of the third remaining were made redundant on 7 February.  Between 15 and 20 staff are decontaminating areas of the hospital where they are still employed.  Few of these staff have been successful in securing an interview with a prospective employer, not to mention getting a job offer. </p><p>  When one pays attention to the public media, it is clear that work could be transferred to the 130 beds.  This would provide significant comfort to the public health service in terms of people who are ready to move from an acute hospital setting to a step-down type setting that would be more appropriate to their needs, including health care needs.  Mount Carmel is ideally located and, with a little imagination and innovation, the hospital could be opened again very quickly.  </p></speech>

Without studying the issue in great deal, that appears to be roughly the right price.  Mr. McAnenly is correct that there will be caveats.  My experience, having spent 20 years in this business, is that one would expect caveats.  The big elephant in the room that must be explained is the decision not to accept a bid which would have averted a cost to the State of &euro;17 million.  When one adds the &euro;14 million bid to the &euro;17 million cost, the total cost is &euro;31 million.</p></speech>

It created some uncertainty for patients and prospective patients, and the HSE stepped in quickly to ensure a seamless transfer to other maternity services where required.  Understandably, it has been difficult for staff to come to terms with job losses, particularly those who have spent the best part of their careers working at the hospital.  I acknowledge that and, on a personal level, I am disappointed that a suitable buyer could not be found for the hospital.  However, let me be clear that a State purchase of the hospital as a going concern was never a viable option.</p><p>  Following an approach from NAMA, my Department undertook a high level examination in order to assess the feasibility of HSE purchase of the hospital.  It immediately became clear that the purchase of Mount Carmel, as a stand-alone low volume hospital, would be contrary to Government policy on maternity services.  Current Government policy on maternity services is based on the premise that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services or tri-located with adult and paediatric services.  The benefits of co-location and tri-location are clear and accepted internationally.  Co-location allows the mother access to a full range of medical and support services should the need arise, such as cardiac and vascular surgery, intensive care facilities, haematology services and psychiatric services.  Tri-location ensures immediate access on-site to paediatric services when foetal or neonatal surgery or other interventions are required.  The availability of these services helps ensure the delivery of an optimum safe service for mothers and their babies.</p><p>  I assure the committee that Government policy on maternity services is evidence based.  The model of stand-alone maternity hospitals is not the norm internationally and is no longer recognised as international best practice for future service development.  Where other countries have reconfigured, the move has been to co-location and tri-location.  In Ireland too, we are moving in that direction.  Last May, I announced the Government's intention to relocate the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, to the St. Vincent's University Hospital campus at Elm Park.  We also propose to provide a new maternity hospital on the St. James's campus, alongside the new children's hospital, and thus we will have a tri-located maternity, adult and pediatric facility.  In the context of our move to the provision of bi-located and tri-located facilities, the acquisition of Mount Carmel as a stand-alone maternity hospital would represent a retrograde step.</p><p>  I should also put on record my reservations regarding the low volume of births in the hospital.  Best practice, and the development of excellence in patient care and safety, is predicated on a high volume of patient throughput.  On the international front, there has been a clear move to close smaller maternity units and consolidate services into larger hospitals.  As a doctor and as Minister for Health, my primary concern must be the provision of safe high-quality care to patients.  Patient safety issues are issues on which we will not compromise.  I assure the committee that the provision of maternity services in a small stand-alone maternity hospital or in a maternity unit within a non-acute setting does not constitute best practice or represent safest practice, and clearly does not provide the level of safety and quality that our patients need and deserve.</p><p>  In considering the option to purchase Mount Carmel as a going concern, my officials examined the potential impact of the closure of the hospital on maternity service capacity in the greater Dublin area.  The reality is that there has been a significant reduction in birth rates in Dublin, and in the rest of the country, in recent years.  It is also relevant that the Central Statistics Office, CSO, projects that birth rates will continue to fall, at least until the early 2020s.</p><p>  The latest draft information available from the HSE indicates that there were 25,877 births in the three Dublin publicly-funded hospitals in 2013.  Since the peak in Dublin in 2010, the number of births in Dublin public hospitals has reduced by over 1,900 births.  In Mount Carmel in 2012, the most recent full year for which figures are available, there were 1,323 births, some of which were from outside the Dublin area.  Thus, we can be confident that our maternity services have the capacity to deal with the additional demands on their services arising from the closure of Mount Carmel.  This is borne out by the fact that within hours of the announcement regarding the liquidation of Mount Carmel, the three Dublin maternity hospitals made it clear that they had the capacity to treat maternity patients who had planned to give birth in Mount Carmel and invited mothers to be to contact them to arrange their transfers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014021800010#K00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his response on this issue.  A point that sticks out in his statement is that the hospital was seemingly assessed solely on the basis of its being viewed as a maternity hospital.  There seems to be no further expansion of thinking in terms of capacity.  We understand that best international practice in terms of maternity services points to tri-located or co-located services, at the very least.  However, was there any due diligence procedure or assessment of the broader issue of the elective surgical procedures the hospital was providing?  Quite a large number of public patients were contracted to the hospital through the NTPF and the special delivery unit in recent times.  From March 2013 until the closure earlier this year, there was almost full occupancy.  Therefore, there was quite a large throughput of non-maternity procedures.  Nowhere in the Minister's statement did he refer to examining services beyond maternity services.  One should bear in mind that only 25 beds in the hospital were being used for maternity purposes.  The rest were used for elective surgery cases in respect of specialties and disciplines right across the spectrum.  When the high-level examination to assess the feasibility of the HSE purchasing the hospital was carried out, did the high-level group engage in any due diligence exercise on the broader issues?  Was the group just sent in to assess the maternity services alone?  We will have to have some clarity on that.</p><p>  I do not expect the Minister to wave magic wands in this particular area.  Every Minister is obligated to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely and efficiently.  I will receive the usual reminders from the Minister on taxpayers' money being spent wisely, or otherwise, but one should consider this in the context of the fact that the Government is ramping up the purchase of elective surgery from the private providers.  In recent days and weeks, we have seen a large increase in the purchase of orthopaedic services.  There is certainly an issue of capacity in the public hospital system.</p><p>  If one carries out any analysis of specialties in all elective areas in the public hospital system, leaving aside the emergency and maternity services, one realises there is a capacity issue.  Consequently, we are purchasing from private providers continually.  Am I missing something?  Day in, day out, we are referring people to private hospitals for orthopaedic and many other services.  Why is it the case if there is not a capacity issue in the public hospital system?  One must bear in mind that commitments were made about new hospitals in the north east and all that flows from that.</p></speech>

We are talking about a 130-bed hospital.  It had a very good track record, not only in the early maternity area.  Even accepting that it is not Government policy or best international practice to have stand-alone small maternity units, the issue of elective surgery must be considered.  Such surgery was being provided continually.  One should also bear in mind that the vast majority of the elective surgical procedures concerned public patients contracted through the NTPF or the special delivery unit.  When the Minister addressed us today, he did not make reference to that other than by making reference to the issue of maternity services.  Could we have clarity on that?</p><p>  Although the Government states there is joined-up thinking and that silos have been removed, and while there are buzzwords floating around, any quick analysis of the actual cost to the State in terms of job losses and the consequent impact on the social welfare budget and the subsequent loss of revenue, combined with an analysis with regard to NAMA, debt write-down, interest rates, and purchase of the facility as a going concern demonstrates we are down, demonstrates it is no longer a question of tens of millions of euro but of a few million euro here or there.</p></speech>

I have made that patently clear to the Minister over the years.  However, I have to recognise that in the context of the current configuration of the hospital network, Mount Carmel was playing an important and useful role.  The loss of its facilities is therefore a loss to the structure of delivering hospital and acute services.</p><p>  In his contribution the Minister spoke of Mount Carmel as if it was wholly and solely a maternity facility.  He only spoke of it in that context and at no time did he allude to the range of other services that it has provided.  I understand that they include: orthopaedics; ear, nose and throat; paediatrics; and a range of surgical procedures that were carried out at that hospital.  Only a proportion of the 130 beds in the facility were designated for maternity purposes.  </p><p>  As regards the role of NAMA in all of this, my understanding was that it had a social responsibility but it does not appear to have employed it in this particular instance.  I am told that St. James's Hospital had plans for Mount Carmel and envisaged the transfer of patients and services from St. James's, thus increasing capacity at the latter hospital, while the site designated on that campus was being developed for the new national children's hospital.  Are there consequences arising from the NAMA decision concerning Mount Carmel and the development of the children's hospital?</p><p>  The Minister also said he envisaged a new maternity hospital on the same St. James's campus alongside the new children's hospital.  I have not had the opportunity to visit the site and can only accept what the Minister has told me.  Other voices that are familiar with it would even question that it has the capacity to take a new national children's hospital, let alone a maternity hospital in tandem at the same location.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on that. </p><p>  I am also anxious to know about the HSE's engagement with NAMA.  This is very important.  I am told that the HSE had discussions with NAMA without briefing St. James's, even though the HSE and the Minister would know that St. James's had a specific interest in the Mount Carmel facility.  In the course of those discussions the HSE representatives sought to present themselves as speaking on behalf of St. James's.  Will the Minister revisit all of this with NAMA, the HSE and St. James's so that we can establish the full truth and the full facts concerning the various engagements that took place, including St. James's with NAMA and the HSE with NAMA?  Why was there not the same overlap in terms of the HSE and St. James's?  There appears to be a significant deficit there in terms of engagement.  That is coming directly from sources within these entities, particularly St. James's.</p><p>  Will the Minister comment on the view that has been repeated time after time that the Mount Carmel facility was expected to return to profit this year?  All the indicators suggest that is the case, so could that not have prompted a different response to the one that materialised? </p><p>  At our meeting immediately prior to the Minister's attendances, the INMO's representatives made a number of recommendations and would like us to press the Minister on them.  One of the recommendations is to re-explore with NAMA why it did not take on board the health care implications of the decision to move as they did against Mount Carmel, rather than solely the financial considerations.  The Minister has not ruled out the reopening of the site as a health care facility, while indicating other roles it might have.  Will he please elaborate on that?  Can the Minister have discussions with St. James's to see if it can conclude its plans to operate the site, as it had developed them?  I am told that it had intended to do so.</p><p>  Of Mount Carmel's 382 staff, some 205 were nurses.  The Minister said he was pleased to note that some of the staff have already been offered employment in other hospitals.  My understanding was nursing and midwifery were not among the exempted grades.  Will the Minister indicate what numbers and what hospital sites we are talking about?  With the ongoing employment embargo how is it possible?  If Mount Carmel is not going to resume providing services as heretofore, can we ensure that the displaced nursing staff and other staff will be facilitated within the network of hospital sites?  </p><p>  Will the Minister take on board preferential treatment arrangements for staff at Mount Carmel to ensure, as the INMO wishes, that their service is reckonable in the public superannuation scheme?  I would be grateful for the Minister's replies to those questions.</p></speech>

Have we advanced that research at this stage?  A recent report indicated that people with dementia who are returning home had an average stay in hospital of 22 days, whereas those who were getting nursing home places had an average stay in hospital of 59 days.  In view of that, there is an urgent need to examine step-down facilities.  Have we made an advance on this issue concerning Mount Carmel?  The figure of 59 days is more than eight weeks in hospital, so there is a huge cost factor to the State.  A stay in hospital costs roughly a minimum of &euro;6,000 per week.  In that context, perhaps Mount Carmel could be used as a step-down facility for the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-18a.505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014021800012#M00100"><p>On Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s points, I referred in my speech to other considerations.  We have discussed the maternity end of this because Mount Carmel was the only private maternity hospital, whereas there are many other private hospitals dealing with the general medical care.  It is important we deal in facts.  In 2004, there were 16 private hospitals in the Republic of Ireland.  Today, there are 21.  There is plenty of capacity.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund and the SDU, special delivery unit, used Mount Carmel to ensure outpatients did not wait untimely lengths for treatment and there were plans to use it again.  There is no shortage, however, of capacity in the private sector to take up the slack.  Apart from that, Mount Carmel provided medical paediatric and surgical services in a range of areas including orthopaedics, ophthalmology, gynaecology, endoscopy and ear, nose and throat.  As I said, there are plenty of other providers to cover that capacity.</p><p>  During 2013, the HSE secured additional treatment capacity in Mount Carmel, as well as in other public and private hospitals.  However, the number of treatments outsourced to these facilities represents less than 1% of the total number of annual scheduled outpatient appointments and less than 0.5% of the total number of inpatient and day-case appointments undertaken nationally.  Obviously, there is no shortage of capacity and there is no need for any concern in that regard.  The HSE will continue to avail of the support and services offered by other public and private facilities where capacity is required and available.  It is considered that other hospitals will be in a position to take the proportionate cases previously outsourced to Mount Carmel.</p><p>  We will explore the use of the site as a step-down or short-term transitional facility for older persons.  It will take some time to do that, however.  The HSE is already examining it but at this stage it is not clear whether Mount Carmel can offer what is needed.  To establish this would require a full assessment including appropriateness of accommodation, availability of staffing, ability to provide the required services to be determined, as well as outcomes, costs and timescales to commence the delivery of services.  It is certainly part of our desired armamentarium that we want to have such facilities in highly-populated areas where people can continue their recovery having had their acute medical condition addressed, rather than sitting in a hospital bed at great expense, as Senator Burke pointed out.  It is important they would get the type of service they need because historically they did not.  Once their medical treatment was over, that was it.  They did not get the physiotherapy, occupational therapy or speech and language therapy they needed that could have resulted in many of them living an independent life at home.  Sadly, if the opportunity passes, then they are destined for long-term care which all members will agree is not acceptable.  As we all know, no matter how nice a place is, there is no place like home.</p><p>  Discussions with NAMA were raised.  The Department and the HSE would have had discussions with NAMA.  However, it is a business decision by NAMA as to what it does with this facility.  The hospital was losing money on a weekly basis.  Contrary to what several members claimed that it was on target to make a profit at the end of this year, my understanding is that it was on target to lose over &euro;1 million.  This could not be sustained.</p><p>  I do not believe the VHI should be determining the market.  If a private hospital comes on-stream that has the appropriately qualified staff and facilities, there is no reason it should not be insured to treat insured patients.  However, if it goes out of business, it has to be a matter for it.  The VHI cannot be expected to support it, nor the Government.  As I pointed out already, we had only 16 private hospitals in 2004 while today we have 21 plus Mount Carmel.  It would not be fair to say that private medicine is disappearing off the face of the health landscape.</p><p>  It was claimed that concerns have been expressed about the national paediatric hospital which we are not discussing today.  However, I want to set down a marker in this regard.  The Government has made its decision and it is not resiling from it.  Those voices of concern want it built elsewhere.  I am happy that the Government has made the right decision and that St. James&rsquo;s is the right place for the hospital.  It has more than enough space to accommodate the hospital planned, as well as the maternity hospital.  Neither is there any planning danger with the expansion of this site and the additional grounds bought at another location.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in referred to the recruitment embargo affecting midwifery services.  We always said the embargo would be operated in a flexible fashion to get the right skills mix.  Last year, we recruited over 700 nurses to the health service.  Those with particular expertise in theatre, ICU and midwifery are much sought after.  I believe the nurses in Mount Carmel with these skills will be quickly taken in by other hospitals.  We also have 200 more general practitioners in the GMS than we had four years ago, as well as 200 more consultants.  The health service is trying to get its skills mix right and focus on the right people delivering the right care in the right place at the right time to the right sort of patient.  In other words, this is about treating the patient at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, efficient and as near to home as possible.</p><p>  We do have a problem in urban areas with delayed discharges and patients not being able to get the precise treatment they need to recuperate properly while other acutely ill patients are unable to access a bed because it is occupied inappropriately.  This is to the detriment of the patient who is delayed.  This is what we are addressing through the frail elderly programme put in place by the clinical probes.</p></speech>

There are still difficulties in some hospitals with regard to discharges, meaning people are in hospital for too long.  Mount Carmel had surgery and post-surgery facilities.  One would assume it could cater for step-down and transitional care with little conversion or capital expense, other than the purchase of it.  With HIQA&rsquo;s further assessment of step-down facilities and community nursing homes, there could be pressure on beds in the greater Dublin area in a year or two.  Has the Department or the HSE looked at Mount Carmel providing a solution to these imminent problems?</p></speech>

I have been advised that the HSE voices endeavoured to present themselves as speaking for St. James&rsquo;s.  There is a serious matter there.</p> <p>I have asked the Minister whether he will address this matter and explore the detail of this with NAMA, the HSE and St. James's Hospital.  Will the Minister inform himself in respect of the interest of St. James's Hospital specifically allied to the development of the new national children's hospital and be supportive of any interest that St. James's Hospital would have in the Mount Carmel facility?  </p><p> In his address, the Minister said "we would endeavour to support staff in their efforts to find alternative employment."  How is that being done?  What type of supports are being offered to staff who had formerly worked in Mount Carmel and now find themselves out of employment?  Does the Minister have the facts regarding the staff who have already been offered employment in other hospitals?  How many of them are there?  What hospitals are we talking about?  It would be very informative and worthwhile to share that with the committee.  </p></speech>

The HSE is looking into that.  I do not like alluding to it as a step-down facility.  What is envisaged if we were to purchase it is a facility that would have some transitional long-stay services but would focus more on rehabilitation and on getting people back home.  If older people who are frail and become ill are in bed for even 48 or 72 hours, they can stiffen up and lose a lot of function and it takes quite a bit of effort to get them mobilised again.  It can be done and in a large number of cases, people can go home and continue to live independent lives, albeit with certain supports.</p><p>  The Deputy used the word "assume" and, of course, I am reminded of my son who when he was 14 explained what "assume" can do to one.  It can make an ass out of you and me.  We are not assuming anything.  We will examine it and have very clear idea of what is involved in transposing this into the sort of facility that we feel best serves the health services' requirement to serve our citizens.  </p><p>  In respect of St. James's Hospital and NAMA, I must lay down a marker.  The HSE has the right to negotiate in these situations - not individual hospitals.  We could end up with a situation where St. James's, St. Vincent's and Tallaght have their eye on it.  I know that St. James's might have had an interest in it and still does but it does not have funding to run it the way it was as a going concern.  Things remain on the table from the point of view of this facility being used again as a health facility.  No one hospital will have a say over how that is done or used.  The HSE as a national entity and the Department of Health will determine the policy in respect of how to best serve the people of the greater Dublin area in respect of a facility of this nature - not one single hospital.  I lay down that marker loud and clear, particularly given the situation we have had in respect of section 38 agencies and their non-compliance with public pay policy.  </p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was asked about staff and how they are being supported so perhaps Mr. Carter from the HSE could give him a pr&eacute;cis on that.</p></speech>

There is still live debate with those individual nurses.  Can I give the Deputy an exact number of people who have definitely been offered contracts at this stage?  The answer is "No" but as I said, there has been quite strong engagement for the past three weeks.</p></speech>

It relates to how St. James's will be able to facilitate its ongoing work responsibilities while the construction of the new national children's hospital would be underway.  That was the primary interest it had in Mount Carmel.  That is something that surely the Minister would be either already informed of or interested in.</p></speech>

I am fully informed of the fact that there is a 50-bed unit in Inchicore to which St. James's has access in order to address the issue referred to by the Deputy.  I am also fully informed of the fact that there is planning permission for an eight-storey building in order to allow for the decanting of services off the site to clear it and that this was achieved in eight weeks, which is great credit to the people in St. James's.  However, I stand over what I say.  The HSE is the authority here - not any individual hospital or hospital management.  The HSE must act in the best interests of all of Dublin, not just one particular catchment area.  That is not a thing I say lightly but I will not apologise for saying it either.</p></speech>
