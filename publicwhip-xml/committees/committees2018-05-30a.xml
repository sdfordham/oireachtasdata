It is an honour and a pleasure to be in front of the committee for a second time.  In this short presentation I would like to walk the committee through the country-specific recommendations that were adopted last week on Wednesday, 23 May.  Before I do that I would like to explain the context in which these recommendations have been adopted by the Commission.</p> <p>  Last week the Commission adopted what we call the spring package.  The spring package is part of the European semester, which is a process of economic policy co-ordination within the European Union.  This package includes the country-specific recommendations, but also the assessment of the Commission concerning the national reform programme and also the assessment, in the case of Ireland as a country with the euro as its currency, of the stability programme.</p> <p>  The European semester starts in the autumn with the adoption of what we call the autumn package, which includes the annual growth survey, the alert mechanism report and the recommendations for the euro area.  In the annual growth survey the Commission establishes the policy priorities to be implemented in the European Union.  In November last year, in the annual survey, the main policy priority was to continue the efforts along the virtuous triangle which consists of boosting investment, pursuing structural reforms and ensuring responsible fiscal policies.  This year, on top of this, much emphasis has been placed on the European pillar of social rights.  The second document adopted by the Commission last autumn was the alert mechanism report in which we carry out a screening of the economic situation in every member state and identify the countries for which we have to carry out a more detailed analysis, what we call an in-depth review.</p><p>Last autumn Ireland was identified as one of the countries that would benefit from an in-depth review.  In November the Commission adopted the recommendations for the euro area.  These recommendations must be implemented and all member states in the euro area should ensure they implement them.</p><p> Once the Commission has adopted this autumn package which sets out the policy priorities and identifies the countries for which an in-depth review is necessary, the Commission services prepare the country reports.  The county reports were published on 7 March 2018.  They provide an assessment of the economic and social situation in the member state, including progress made in the implementation of the country-specific recommendations of the past year.  The country reports also include the results of the in-depth review of the concerned countries.  On the basis of the in-depth review published in the country report in March, the Commission concluded that Ireland was still experiencing macroeconomic imbalances characterised by large stocks of external private and public debt, a high number of non-performing loans and rising property prices.</p><p> On the basis of the conclusions of the country reports and taking into account the national reform programmes, which are presented by the respective member states in April, the stability programmes, which present the medium-term budgetary targets of the Government, and the national reform programme, which presents the economic policy priorities of each member state, the Commission adopts the proposal for the country-specific recommendations that we adopted last year.  This is the context in which the country-specific recommendations were adopted as part of the European semester cycle of economic policy co-ordination.</p><p> This year the country-specific recommendations adopted by the Commission are framed in a context of the fastest growth pace of the European economy in a decade, with record employment, recovering investment and improved public finances.  The Commission noted, however, that new risks are emerging such as volatility in global financial markets and trade protectionism.  For this reason, it is important that we use without delay the current favourable conditions to make Europe's economies and societies strong and more resilient.</p><p> The Commission proposes three recommendations for Ireland, that is, three blocks of priority areas: first, budgetary policy and fiscal structural issues, including taxation and sustainability of public finances; second, infrastructure and skills; and third, measures aimed at fostering productivity growth and reducing the stock of non-performing loans.</p><p> I will explain the rationale behind the different recommendations, beginning with the first, the compliance with EU fiscal rules.  In 2019, the structural balance is forecast to reach a deficit of 0.4% of GDP, thus achieving the medium-term budgetary objective of a deficit of 0.5% of GDP.  For this to happen, growth of Government expenditure should remain below 5.3% in 2019.  Ireland is expected to comply with these provisions, including the debt rule.  The debt-to-GDP ratio has declined significantly, but it is also true that part of the decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio is due to the denominator effect.  GDP in Ireland includes contract manufacturing.  Members will remember that in 2015, Irish GDP grew by more than 25%.  In terms of GDP, while we see that debt is declining, in nominal terms, in terms of size, Ireland's debt is still very high.  This is the reason that the Commission recommends that given the current cyclical conditions and the heightened external risks, Ireland should use any windfall gains to reduce general Government debt further.  The Commission is recommending that this is the prudent fiscal policy to follow.  I have learned that the recent plans for a rainy day fund would set aside &euro;8 billion over the medium term.  I believe this is an important development and could provide a fiscal buffer during a future economic downturn.</p><p> I will now deal with the composition of public finances, in particular taxation.  Corporate taxes as a proportion of total taxes continued to increase.  Such taxes are highly concentrated among a few large multinational enterprises which are prone to high volatility.  Some recent tax measures have focused on cuts and reliefs and seem to have increased further reliance on highly procyclical sources of revenue.  The Commission considers that broadening the tax base could help improve revenue stability in the face of economic fluctuations.  Moreover, there exists further potential to improve the way the tax system can support environmental objectives.</p><p> The long-term sustainability of public finances presents risks related to the cost of ageing, although it is true that Ireland has introduced some significant measures to increase the efficiency of public healthcare, such as a cost-saving agreement with the pharmaceutical industry, a financial management system and activity-based funding.  Some measures have also been taken to improve the availability of primary health care.  The Government has also introduced a wide range of reforms to contain public pension expenditure.  Nevertheless, according to the most recent long-term assessment approved by the ageing working group of the economic policy committee, the cost of ageing represents a medium fiscal sustainability risk for Ireland over the long term.  On this basis, the Commission believes there is a need to increase the cost-effectiveness of the healthcare system and to pursue the envisaged pension reforms.</p><p> I will now address the second recommendation.  The Commission found in the country report that barriers to inclusive growth remain in the form of skills mismatches and skills shortages.</p><p>The country report also found there was insufficient access to affordable and quality childcare.</p><p> Although unemployment fell to 6.7 % in 2017, certain groups are still largely detached from the labour market and socially excluded.  In addition, years of reduced Government investment are taking their toll on the availability of housing and appropriate clean energy, transport and water infrastructure.  In housing markets, persistent supply shortages, coupled with increasing demand, continue to fuel property price increases.</p><p> The Commission concludes that addressing emerging infrastructure bottlenecks is essential for sustainable and balanced growth in the future.  It therefore recommends that Ireland improve the skills of the adult population and effectively implement in a timely way the relevant parts of the national development plan, including infrastructure and childcare.</p><p> The Commission finds that the productivity of domestic companies is lower, or growing at a slower pace, in comparison with the multinationals operating in Ireland.  Given the current favourable economic conditions but also keeping in mind the existing risks and uncertainties, the Commission's third recommendation is that Ireland stimulate research and innovation with a view to enhancing the resilience of the domestic sectors.</p><p> Although Ireland continued to make progress in reducing non-performing loans, their ratio-to-total gross loans remains among the highest in the EU.  Particularly worrying are long-term mortgage arrears, which are those in arrears for over two years.  These represent 60% of the total mortgages in arrears in 2017.  Reducing the long-term arrears could improve the resilience of the Irish banking sector and help to address the problem of debt overhang, which reduces the incentives for SMEs to put credit to more productive uses.  On this basis, and as part of the same third recommendation, the Commission recommends promoting a faster and durable reduction of long-term mortgage arrears through promoting write-offs while protecting consumer rights.</p><p> In sum, the Commission proposes a comprehensive package to underpin the sustainability of public finances, foster productivity and enhance the resilience of Ireland's economy to external shocks, to which Ireland, like any other small open economy, is highly exposed.  This is along the lines of the strategy of the Irish authorities to build resilience in the face of global challenges and the recommendations of the National Competitiveness Council.</p></speech>

I will call on a number of Deputies, who should keep their contributions to five minutes each.  Replies should be kept to approximately the same time.  That should allow everyone who has indicated thus far to be accommodated in the time available.  The first to indicate was Deputy Chambers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018053000002#F00300"><p>I thank Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay for attending.  I am conscious that I do not have much time but I have two questions.  I note that Brexit has been mentioned in the country-specific recommendations as a risk to our economy.  That it is probably the greatest short-term risk is obvious.  In that regard, has Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay recommendations on our budgetary process?  What provision should we make for it?  Is he satisfied that the rainy day fund is sufficient or should we be doing something in addition to buffer our economy against the threat of Brexit?</p> <p>  My next question is on childcare and labour activation rates.  This issue impacts on women more.  How do we compare with our EU counterparts?  Is it a major concern for the Commission?</p> <p>  In line with the country-specific recommendations, Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has stated that we need to reduce our reliance on countercyclical taxes, corporate tax receipts and windfall tax revenues to fund services.  Would he consider an increase in corporation tax receipts a windfall?  If so, how should we proceed if we see a substantial increase?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018053000002#F00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  We are not making a particular recommendation concerning Brexit, which we consider to be one of the risks to the current economic framework, because we have not introduced in our analysis in the country report and when preparing the country-specific recommendations any hypothesis or assumption regarding the final institutional framework of the relationship between the EU and the UK.  As the committee knows, negotiations are ongoing and we do not know exactly how the transition period will operate.  Issues remain to be resolved.  Nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.  As such, the Commission will not make any hypothesis about particular impacts based on the process and final result of the negotiations.</p> <p>  Regarding the rainy day fund, it is important that we acknowledge that the Irish economy is a small and open one and, therefore, is exposed to external shocks.  Given that we are in the positive phase of the cycle, the Irish economy should be ready to deal with a possible slowdown owing to various causes.  Public finances are one of the first areas of an economy to be affected by a slowdown caused by an external shock.  For this reason, the Commission proposes the creation of buffers.  They will not only apply to Ireland.  The Commission's global recommendation is that Europe should take advantage of the good times to prepare the economy for a possible future slowdown.  As such, and without assessing whether &euro;8 billion is enough, the rainy day fund is important for us and we are supporting the Government's decisions because the rainy day fund would provide the necessary buffer to an external shock, no matter its cause, and allow Ireland to deal with a slowdown's impact on public finances.</p> <p>  In the Commission's view, the lack of affordable childcare in Ireland can be a barrier to accessing the labour market for certain workers, particularly single parents.  Childcare is a condition for more inclusive growth.  Workers who need someone to take care of their children during their working hours must be supported in accessing the labour market.</p><p> On corporate taxes, the Commission sees they are booming in Ireland at the moment.  Corporate tax receipts are increasing at a faster pace but at the same time we see that these receipts mainly come from, or are heavily concentrated in, a group of multinational companies.  Those revenues, therefore, are subject to high volatility.  That is the reason the Commission recommends that these extraordinary revenue gains are used to reduce debt further.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018053000002#G00200"><p>I also want to touch on the rainy day fund.  We are told its creation will allow the Government to address future crises, if and when they happen.  The difficulty I have with the rainy day fund is that we have crises that need to addressed right now.  I refer to homelessness, the lack of affordable childcare, which Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay pointed out himself, and a skills mismatch, which he likewise pointed out.  To address them, I feel it would be more prudent to invest now rather than squirrelling away some funds in a rainy day fund.  There is an issue around whether what is being proposed by the Government is actually a rainy day fund or a contingency fund.  Given recent experience of downturns and shocks to the Irish economy, &euro;8 billion would be just a drop in the ocean of what has been previously spent.</p> <p>  I have some questions.  On the rainy day fund, would there need to be a change in the fiscal rules to allow its creation?  The Commission made, and Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay spoke of, some recommendations on the over-reliance on corporate tax, the narrow tax base, the issue - that we saw even this year - regarding commercial stamp duty, the effective and timely implementation of the national development plan, addressing the skills mismatch and the lack of affordable healthcare.  There is a contradiction between putting away the extra money we have into a rainy day fund but having to address all of these issues as well.  Will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay comment on that?  </p> <p>  It was my understanding that the whole point of the fiscal rules was to create buffers in the first place that would ensure prudent public finances and prevent unsustainable expenditure and trends.  Would Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay agree that the Stability and Growth Pact, SGP, in the forms of the medium-term objectives, MTOs, and the expenditure benchmarks, is not an adequate countercyclical buffer in itself and therefore minimises the need for a rainy day fund now?  I refer to having crises that we have to deal with now rather than preparing for ones that may come farther down the line.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018053000002#G00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  His first question referred to the extent the Commission wishes to promote and support a rainy day fund in Ireland and if the fiscal rules would need to be changed.  We do not need to change the fiscal rules.  The rainy day fund is consistent with the fiscal rules in the sense that it has a countercyclical nature.  When the economy is booming and there are extraordinary revenues, those revenues are saved in the form of assets.  They can then be spent when the economy is in a slowdown, revenues are lower and expenditures increase - to pay unemployment benefits or other things.  The idea of the rainy day fund is precisely that the additional money is not spent in a procyclical way that may lead to overheating in good times.  On the other hand, when revenues go down, there is then a reserve of money which can be spent in the rainy days so that it is not necessary to go to the markets to borrow money.  That is the basic idea of the rainy day fund and therefore it is consistent with the spirit of the fiscal rules.</p></speech>

I am talking about investment in capital projects which will stand to us farther down the line as well.</p></speech>

The Deputy's second question was whether a rainy day fund was needed in the current situation.  Am I right?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018053000002#G00700"><p>In my interpretation, the Deputy's second question - taking into account that revenues are higher than expected and there is this positive surprise of extra revenues on one hand and some expenditure needs on the other - was whether the extra revenues should be used to cover expenditure needs.  That is what I understood from the Deputy's reasoning.  The key issue is that most expenditures are permanent, while part of these revenues are extraordinary.  There is a risk that extraordinary revenues will be used to finance something which is permanent.  That would then have a permanent effect on total expenditure.</p> <p>  That is precisely the reason the European Commission is proposing not to be procyclical in good times.  The economy may be overheated if all the higher revenue from the good times is spent.  As the growth rate in Ireland is high compared with the potential growth, the country is in the positive phase of the cycle.  The European Commission is proposing on that basis not to use permanent revenues.  Some of the increases in revenues do have a permanent nature, but the part of the revenues that are purely cyclical will disappear once the economy slows down.  I mention that because the Deputy referred to it.  That is precisely the idea with reaching the MTO where the structural balance is zero given the conditions of each country.  </p> <p>  In Ireland's case, given its high growth, structural balance is considered to be in equilibrium when the structural deficit is 0.5% of GDP.  That will be reached next year.  The idea is that we then allow automatic stabilisation to operate so that permanent increases in expenditure are not adopted without being financed by permanent revenues.  That is the essence of the fiscal rules in the European Union once countries have reached the MTO.  Discretionary increases in expenditure should be matched by discretionary increases in taxation - but in permanent taxes and not in taxes associated with extraordinarily high revenues.  </p></speech>

My comments are not in order of importance but just as they come to me.</p><p> On the issue of labour activation and supporting the social benefits derived from it, there is a concern in some circles that the agenda being pushed by the European Commission and OECD discriminates against those who decide to stay at home and raise children.  An economist will argue that where someone looks after another person's child, that is good work which is measured, but where someone looks after his or her own child, that is not work as it is not measured and therefore does not count.  My preference is to leave it to parents to decide what is best because every family and every circumstance is different.  For example, the policy decision to introduce child benefit many years ago achieved this objective because the benefit is paid to all parents for all children.  It is a form of basic income.  However, in recent years we have discriminated by providing tax breaks and particular subsidies.  I would not argue against them, but I fear in that respect if it is done in a way that creates a differential.  The American Senator, Elizabeth Warren, has written about the dual income trap.  I do not know if Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has read any of Senator Warren's books.  The trap she describes is that in an economy where everybody is working, the price of property increases and there is no flexibility or room to manoeuvre, for example, if one has a child who is sick.  Every family has different circumstances.  Elizabeth Warren argues that this is socially disadvantageous and the consequences are measurable and specific.  Everything I hear from the European Union is driving in that direction.  It is all about the economy, economic growth, labour activation and perhaps not having as many migrants, although that final point is an assumption on my part.  I express that fear and also that while economists can measure everything, perhaps they cannot measure the real value of quality of life.  Every family can achieve quality of life and balance in different ways but for us to discriminate so clearly carries a risk.  </p><p> I have a second broad question.  Ireland is an open trading economy and many of my friends work internationally.  Some who have returned from China tell me that the costs of wages in China have gone incredibly high.  The price of steel has also increased.  One of the reasons we have expensive construction costs is that material costs are all rising because the world economy is growing at full throttle.  We have also been printing money.  The printing presses in America and in Europe have been rolling for ten years now.  At some point, this will surely feed into inflation.  What is Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's assessment?  When the Commission makes country assessments or wider assessments, how does it indicate a risk of inflation?  I presume inflation brings a risk of higher interest rates which, in turn, would create certain risks for a country such as Ireland with high nominal debt levels.  How does the Commission forecast inflation?  Does Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay hear the same argument that I hear from friends working in the global economy, namely, that inflationary pressures are becoming real?</p><p> My third question-----</p></speech>

On the question concerning whether the Commission is discriminating against people who would like to stay at home and take care of their children, the answer is definitely "No".  There is no discrimination.  The idea is to allow people to make choices and to give a choice to people who want to participate in the labour market but cannot do so because they have to take care of their children.  We are not promoting a choice but giving them a choice.  If people decide to participate in the labour market and would like to develop a professional life, the Commission's line is that we should ensure that a lack of sufficient and affordable childcare does not prevent them from entering the labour market.  We are not saying that everybody should work.  However, when an economy uses its maximum resources it is good for everybody because living standards increase.  I agree with the Deputy that some things cannot be measured by economists or statisticians.  In terms of the essence of the recommendation, we are not saying that everybody is obliged to participate but that a structure should be in place and all those who would like to benefit from it should have the option of doing so.</p></speech>

The cost they bear is the income they do not receive.  If dual income becomes the standard in an economy, house prices increase to the extent that the person who forgoes income is unable to buy a house.  For this reason, should the provision not be to support both parents or to leave the choice to parents?  One side should not be neglected because in a rising property market, it becomes impossible to make the choice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Carlos Mart&iacute;nez Mongay" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018053000002#H00800"><p>It is difficult for me to see the link between both issues.  What the Commission tries to recommend is that governments, policymakers and economic policy put in place conditions to support people to make the most rational choices based on their preferences.  The failure to provide enough affordable and good quality childcare is not fair because it means many people who would like to develop a profession cannot do so.  That is the Commission's line.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that GDP does not cover everything and certain factors other than GDP are not easy to measure.  However, when one wants to buy a house, one needs the money to do so.  In respect of housing, the Commission is pushing and supporting the Government with its national development plan in order to foster and promote social housing.  The Commission is recommending action on both fronts.  Economic policy should allow people to make their own decisions, not to impose a decision from one side or another.</p> <p>  Concerning the risk of inflation, the Deputy will understand that as a representative of the Commission, I do not comment on monetary policy.  Inflation comes under the remit of the European Central Bank, ECB.  According to our forecasts to date, inflation is still subdued in the euro area.  In particular, in terms of core inflation, which is inflation net of the impact of energy prices and more volatile components of inflation, we are still far below the ECB target of 2%.  When the economy is gathering strength inflation increases and we see inflation building up.  However, it is still far behind the ECB targets.</p> <p>  On the question on broadening the tax base, the Deputy mentioned environmental taxes.  The way pollution is taxed in Ireland and the way the environment and environmental policies are supported leave some room for introducing some environmental taxes.</p><p>Such taxes would lead to a more permanent source of revenues, particularly as these taxes depend on investment in certain goods that are more or less stable.  This is what we are recommending.</p></speech>

I will try not to get into great detail because many of those whom we represent who may be following proceedings to try to take something from this process will get lost in highfaluting language.</p> <p>  The bottom line is we are meeting the demands the European Union has placed on us through the fiscal rules.  The Commission acknowledges the Irish economy is growing fast but we must be careful about external factors.  However, Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay stated he cannot comment on the great damage that could be done to our economy by Brexit.  The Commission represents the EU member states which represent us in the Brexit negotiations.  The Commission has a duty to ensure the effect of Brexit on Ireland is minimised.  If everything goes south, we have a development plan for the next ten years that is not Brexit-proofed and against which both the ESRI and the Department of Finance have warned.  The Copenhagen Economics investigation discussed the significant effect Brexit will have on a wide range of sectors.  It is unfortunate, to say the least, that Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay cannot give us any comfort on that issue.  We are speaking in a vacuum when we do not address the issue of Brexit directly.</p> <p>  Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay states we have record employment but there is a skills shortage and a particular issue with childcare costs.  He states our public finances are under control but, because of years of underinvestment, we have major issues in housing.  If nothing else, Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has confirmed for me and my party that this year's budget must be focused on health and housing.  I failed to mention Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's point that we were not getting value for the investment made in health.  That is an understatement in capital letters, so to speak.</p> <p>  I have a question on Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay's comments on the mortgage arrears issue.  He stated the Commission recommends "promoting a faster and durable reduction of long-term mortgage arrears".  This goes back to the Central Bank which is, I am sure, dancing to the Commission's tune.  The Commission argues that certain banks in this jurisdiction should sell their loans that are in mortgage arrears.  In response, I put it to Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay that the D&aacute;il and the Minister with responsibility in this area want relevant and appropriate protections in place for consumers who are, in this instance, homeowners.  We cannot stand idly by on this issue and we will not take direction without safeguards and legislation being put in place.  I am surprised and disappointed that Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay has not qualified his comments on this matter with such an essential proviso.  This recommendation will not be implemented unless legislation is put in place.</p></speech>

The negotiations are ongoing.  There is a chief negotiator and the chief negotiator is the only person who should speak on the state of play of the negotiations.  For this reason, I will not comment on the state of play in the negotiations.  What I can do is point out to the Deputy that my personal interpretation of the progress made so far is that the issue of the Irish Border has been at the centre of the preoccupations of the Commission.  As a matter of fact, the issue was included in the first phase of the negotiation together with the issues of the budget and citizens' rights.  The Commission is putting Ireland at the front of its preoccupations and this is shared by all the member states.</p></speech>

The point is that in the case of Brexit, as Mr. Barnier said, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  Therefore, it is premature to speak of whether we are in this or that position.  In any case, it is clear from the facts that the Irish Border was placed at the centre of the first phase of the negotiations.</p> <p>  Concerning the budget for 2019 and priorities, what the fiscal rules do is fix targets but it is up to member states and parliaments to decide on the composition of budgets.  What the Commission can do is advocate for a certain course of action, for example, investment in human capital or infrastructure or measures to enable people to participate in the labour market.  For these reasons, we should try to ensure the composition of public finances is growth friendly but that composition is a national affair.</p></speech>

I am a little sceptical that this is part of a political blame game the Commission is playing about Brexit and the decision by a member state to leave the European Union, in other words, that the Commission wants to send a warning signal to any other member state that might choose to go down the same road.  Let us say I am wrong and my scepticism is unjustified.  The position of people here, clearly articulated by the Opposition and the Government, is not only that we do not want a hard border but we will not accept one.  Much of the focus has been on whether Britain, despite the so-called backstop, might try to wriggle its way out of that commitment and have a hard border of sorts through another name.  We will not accept that.  There will be resistance if there is an attempt to impose a hard border.  Will Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay provide an assurance that if the negotiations with the EU do not work out, the Commission will not insist on some sort of border by another name in order to protect the integrity of the European market?  In the same way that Irish people have no intention of accepting hard borders imposed by Britain, they have no intention of accepting from the European side a demand to impose hard borders or any other kind of border to protect markets or anything else.</p><p>I would like a comment on that. </p><p> Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay is correct to identify huge infrastructural deficits in housing, health and childcare.  We could add water infrastructure, which is a huge area, to that.  We might not have such infrastructure deficits if the European Union had not imposed such cruel austerity in the aftermath of the banking collapse.  Setting that aside, as Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said, it seems a little odd to identify the need for urgent investment in these areas to essentially buffer our economy, diversify our economy, prepare it for possible external shocks and so on, and then say we should put a load of money into a rainy day fund, which effectively means investing in bonds, the international markets, etc., rather than investing in these key areas of education, housing, health or childcare.  Such investment would buffer the people and the economy against external shocks, rather than essentially depending on the vagaries of the financial markets.  If there are further financial shocks, rainy day funds based on that could evaporate quickly.  We should not set aside on a rainy day fund.  We should invest in areas that would genuinely enhance the strength and infrastructure of the economy to provide a meaningful buffer against further external shocks and over-reliance on certain sectors, which Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay rightly identifies.</p><p> I have a question regarding the windfall gains.  I do not agree that they should be put against debt but they should not just be squandered on pointless expenditure.  They should also be diverted into meaningful capital investment and infrastructural development in education and so on to build up the skills base to which he referred.  Would he include in those windfall gains the &euro;13 billion that Europe has said we should collect in taxes from Apple.  Does he think it is folly in the extreme for the Government to legally resist the collection of that money rather than use it for investment?</p><p> I agree with the Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay on tax reliefs but I would like him to elaborate because there is massive over-reliance on tax reliefs.  Whatever economic benefit we might get from them now, that could evaporate, because, in many cases, they are not strengthening the underlying domestic economy.  The benefit is going in many cases to multinationals.  Could he elaborate on what is meant by shifting from tax reliefs?  One of our major corporate tax reliefs is research and development, mostly benefitting large multinational corporations.  Does he mean that expenditure should instead go into universities, third level education and so on?</p></speech>

Nothing is decided until everything is agreed.  My personal reassurance here is not relevant.  All I can do is remind the committee that there was a first phase of the negotiations in which the Irish Border was a key issue, among the three most important issues.  Now the negotiations go on.  Mr. Barnier reports back to the member states and he travels to the different capitals to inform and maintain contact.  I have nothing more to add on this.</p> <p>  Concerning infrastructure and the social income, there have been several questions relating to the same issue.  I have answered them indirectly.  First, the key issue is that the Commission does not decide composition.  Composition is Ireland's business.  It is up to Ireland to decide which part of the expenditure goes where; it is not up to the Commission.  The Commission can recommend certain areas which we consider to be our priority in the country.</p> <p>  Second, the Commission does not establish the level of structural expenditures or the level of structural revenues.  The rules say that member states should achieve what we call "structural equilibrium", which means a structural balance that simply allows automatic stabilisers to operate, and does not create any pro-cyclical fiscal policy, either in good times or bad times.  However, it is up to the member states to decide on the levels of expenditure and revenues.  By that I mean that one can perfectly comply with fiscal rules by setting certain levels of expenditure and setting the corresponding level of revenue.  It is up to the national parliaments to decide the spending they want to carry out and then set up the corresponding level of revenue.</p> <p>  What the Commission is saying, not only to Ireland but to almost every member state, is that revenue has a volatile component.  This volatile component, which depends on the cycle, and in the case of Ireland, depends on the role and activities of multinationals, can disappear in the same way it appears. It should not, therefore, be allocated to finance permanent expenditure.  This is the reason the Commission says that next year, Ireland should in principle achieve the medium-term budgetary objective, MTO, that is, equilibrium in structural terms.  Now it is up to the Irish to decide their level of expenditure.  I cannot remember the figure exactly, but let us say it is 22% and the Government would like to spend 27%.  The Commission is saying that Ireland should look for a way to finance this additional 5% of GDP in a permanent way, with permanent revenues, that is, structural revenues.  The Commission is not telling Ireland that it is spending too much or too little or how much it should spend on every item; that is up to Ireland to decide.  The Commission is telling Ireland that given its cyclical position and the fact that it is growing above its potential, these additional revenues should be put aside to be prepared in the case of a slowdown, to avoid needing to go to the markets for additional money when the markets are closed or not ready to lend much money.  </p> <p>  The need for infrastructure, which the Commission clearly recognises, has been mixed up with the need to create a buffer.  The buffer can be created.  The Commission is not exactly recommending the rainy day fund, although we support the initiative.  The Commission is telling member states - not only Ireland because there are other countries in the same situation with booming economies growing above potential - that extraordinary revenues should be allocated to reduce debt.</p><p>The less debt there is in a slowdown the easier the access to the markets.</p><p> Concerning Apple the answer is simple.  Apple is paying the &euro;13 billion to the State but it is in an escrow account, which means that the money cannot be touched until there is a decision of the European Court of Justice.  Fortunately, in the European Union we are under the rule of law.  The Commission decided that Ireland had in place a selective tax system and was giving some competitive advantage to a given company.  Ireland opposed the decision, as was its right, which is the beauty of the law, and now we have to wait until the court decides who is right and who is wrong.  If, for instance, the court decides that the Commission is right, this money can be spent by the member state because it is revenue it should have received in the past.  It is possible that the court will decide the Commission was not right for reasons I do not know and then the member state should surrender the money.  So for now, this money cannot be touched but it will be there.</p></speech>

We have a Parliamentary Budget Office, which did a good report on that.  Its recommendation was that it only makes sense if, within the fiscal rules, such a fund can be used in future years to provide fiscal flexibility.  I asked the Minister for Finance when he appeared before the committee whether he is confident that the Commission will recognise it in that way and I would be interested in getting such reassurance from Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay that if we have a rainy day fund we will be able to use it when it rains.</p></speech>

However, there are two different issues.  The first is the fiscal rules.  The rainy day fund is completely consistent with them, and precisely with this idea of achieving the equilibrium and then using the extraordinary revenues to compensate extraordinarily low revenues in the future.  The other issue, on which we need to do further work, is how this is accounted for by an independent authority, EUROSTAT and the EU's statistical network with which Ireland's statistical institute works.  From the economic point of view, the rainy day fund is completely consistent with the spirit and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, in particular with the preventive act because the idea is precisely that when the good times come we prepare for the bad times so that over the cycle we have a totally neutral fiscal policy.  The other question is how is this accounted for statistically and this is perhaps where we will have to do work in the future.</p></speech>

It is at the heart of that answer.  We can understand the perspective of the Commission and, depending on their perspective on a rainy day fund, people might agree with the general thrust of what Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay is saying.  The question, however, is how EUROSTAT views it because if it takes one particular view of it that will have an impact on the idea of having a rainy day fund.  If it takes the view that the Government, several members and I would like it to take, it will be using it in the correct way, which is important.</p></speech>

I understood from the beginning, when nationalisation of the banks was required as a result of the financial collapse, that the position of the European Union that we might have to nationalise but at no point should nationalised banks depart from a commercial profit-orientated focus.  That has had bad consequences for mortgage holders.  I do not understand the logic of it.  I want to understand the extent to which this preference is imposed on the country.  I have no doubt that the Government wants to do that anyway because that is its ideological predisposition but I would like to know why the European Union favours the reprivatisation of the banks given that these institutions nearly bankrupted Europe and did bankrupt this country.  Having nursed them back to health at a terrible cost, Mr. Mart&iacute;nez Mongay thinks we should set them up to potentially do it all over again to us and that they should have the power to crunch on credit and not invest in particular sectors.  He said we need to invest in particular areas of infrastructure, which is great, but now the people who have all the money might just say they do not want to invest in that area or they do not want to extend credit.  What is the logic of that?  After what happened, it is a perverse logic that, having bailed these banks out, the preference of the EU is to reprivatise the banks.  I ask for an explanation please.</p></speech>

First, the treaties are totally neutral with respect to the ownership of the companies.  Nobody in the Commission, on the basis of the treaties, is suggesting that public ownership is bad.  This is not stated anywhere in the treaties.  On the contrary, the treaties say that wherever the ownership is, if the company is operating in a market, it should follow the market rules. The Commission is completely neutral with respect to the ownership.  It will not accept a public company receiving public money when a private investor would not put a single euro in it while the company operates in an open market because this public company would have a selective advantage with respect to the other companies operating in the market.  This is the basic rule.</p><p>There is no preference for any kind of ownership, but if public and private enterprises operate in the same market they have to operate on the same level playing field.  What happened with the banks, not only in this country but in other countries, was that we had a private company that went bankrupt.  A private company, such as a news agency, should go to the market.  In the case of the banks, since they carry systemic risk it was accepted that public money would be put into companies which were already bankrupt.  We kept rolling, thanks to public money, companies that should have disappeared from the market.  Public money is the taxpayers' money.  In some cases, and I do not mean all of the decisions made concerning banks, the Commission accepted putting in this public money, with the single goal of ensuring the company would go back to the markets in an independent way without the need for more support.  In some cases, and I do not want to enter into the specifics of each case, the positive decision by the Commission to allow the Government to put money into a given bank was made with the condition that the money should be recovered.  Who should pay this money back?  It is the bank and nobody else.  In my view, and perhaps this is more personal, the taxpayers have the right to get back the money they put into the banks.  This is why in some cases when the public money has done its work, which is to put the company back on its feet, and the company has recovered value, then this value should go back to the taxpayer.  These are the principles the Commission consistently applies to every member state.</p></speech>

At a previous meeting, we considered the Ombudsman's Nursing Home Casebook.  To help us consider this matter further, I am pleased to welcome the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, who is accompanied by Ms Jennifer Hanrahan and Mr. Tom Morgan.  I advise witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other documents submitted may be published on the committee website after the meeting.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now invite Mr. Tyndall to make his presentation.  He has already circulated a report to the committee so we would appreciate it if he could give us a ten minute summary of what he has already circulated.  </p></speech>

The last time we met, some of the issues around nursing homes came up as part of the consideration of a wider report - the annual report - and I undertook to do some additional work for members to draw together some of the specific issues around nursing homes.  I hope all members received copies of the general casebook and will continue to receive them post-GDPR.  Within that, each particular area is dealt with under a separate heading but I thought it would be useful to pull together a nursing home casebook.  We have hard copies here.  I know members have all had an opportunity to see it online but we also have hard copies that we can leave with members should members want them.</p><p> We have tried to highlight some of the key areas of complaint that are dealt with by my office.  Under the legislation as drafted, almost every nursing home is within jurisdiction.  A complainant might not be in receipt of fair deal funding but if the nursing home is in receipt of fair deal funding, that brings it into jurisdiction.  This means that virtually all of the 430 or so private nursing homes, as well as the public ones provided by the HSE, are now within jurisdiction.</p><p> Initially, take-up was slow, with only 57 complaints received in 2016.  The end-of-year figure for last year, which supersedes the 79 outlined in the casebook, is 93, which is still lower than we would wish.  Nonetheless, it gives us an opportunity to deal with issues.  It is worth noting that if a resident at a nursing home complains about an issue that affects other residents in the home, any resolution will not only benefit the person who complains, it will also lead to changes for all residents such that while the number of complaints is low, the benefits are wider than would otherwise be the case.</p><p> Members will have seen the articles in the newspapers over the weekend regarding additional charges.  The comment I made, which was repeated, was that people are being impoverished by the charges.  I will give some examples.  There were people left with almost no money.  This meant that those who are keen on their appearance had no money to buy the make up they would ordinarily have bought.  We heard of people being left with disposable incomes of &euro;7 per week, of people having less to spend than their grandchildren in terms of pocket money and of people running up debts because they cannot afford the scale of the additional charges.</p><p> I have highlighted this issue previously .  I am particularly concerned about security of tenure.  The contract of care is a standard template.  In essence, the nursing home does not have to provide any reason for terminating a contract of care.  We have seen instances of people going into hospital and, on discharge, being refused re-entry to a home and of individuals being threatened with eviction because their families complain on their behalf.  It appears that there is a major problem with the legislation and the contract.  It is not acceptable that a person would have no certainty as to their capacity to remain within what has become their home.  I have said previously that there is strong evidence to suggest that there are high levels of mortality following enforced moves for older people, particularly those with dementia.  Not having security of tenure is not only a threat to their mental well-being, it is a threat to their physical well-being.</p><p> People in nursing homes should be able to access health professionals in the same way as anybody else in the community.  The reality is that this is proving to be an issue for people complaining to my office.  If the people who complain to my office are experiencing this problem, one must assume that those in other homes are experiencing it as well.  In terms of advocacy, the threats to the capacity of somebody to remain in a home when people speak up on his or her behalf is one of the most serious issues that we face.  There is no simple solution.  Sometimes, family members can be unreasonable in the manner in which they deal with a home but it is this problem that needs to be dealt with and not the person's right of residence.</p><p> We welcome the increased expenditure available for supporting people in their own homes but the reality is we still have separate funding regimes.  In terms of our hospitals and the problem of people waiting lengthy periods in emergency departments for beds, there are people in hospitals who have no need to be there.  There must be a much more concerted effort to prevent people from becoming less able as a consequence of visits to hospital and to support them to become more able.  This is very good practice.  It is not that we cannot do it, only that we do not do enough of it.  We then need to provide them with the supports they need in their own homes.  Sometimes, the nursing home is the only option not because it is the best option - for some people it is a preference - but because the funding is not in place for an alternative.  This remains one of the issues that concerns us in terms of our work.</p><p> We are planning to do some outreach work this year.  There are 430 nursing homes and we cannot send staff to all of them.  When we worked with people in direct provision, we found that there were individuals prepared to talk to staff who, in turn, might not be prepared to submit written reports.  We intend to engage in some initial small-scale outreach to see if there are other issues that are not coming to our attention or if there are ways in which we could make ourselves more accessible.</p><p> I will be happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

However, I ask him to consider how the committee can support him in his work.  I understand that he has received a number of responses from the Department.  If there is anything he can suggest to us, that would be helpful.</p></speech>

They are here to discuss an issue that is of huge importance to us, as parliamentarians, in terms of our constituency work.</p><p>The increase in the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman in 2017 is notable.  I visit nursing homes in my constituency on a regular basis.  I want to acknowledge the level of care being provided by them.  The Ombudsman notes in his report that there are 122 public nursing homes and 458 private nursing homes across the country and that they provide care for 30,000 residents, which is a substantial number of people.  It is obvious from population demographics that we have a population that is going to age significantly over the coming years and, thus, there will be a greater requirement for provision in this area.  The likelihood is that complaints to the Ombudsman's office will grow in tandem.</p><p>The Ombudsman has acknowledged that his role is in respect of the &euro;1 billion in public money allocated to the nursing home care system, which is a substantial part of the health services spend.  It is right and proper not only that the Ombudsman should have oversight in this regard but that there is engagement with the Oireachtas in terms of probing that spend.  The issue of additional charges was highlighted recently in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>and by other media organisations.  The Ombudsman referenced that people felt impoverished by the charges for engaging in what one might consider to be necessary daily services rather than social activities.</p><p>Will the Ombudsman elaborate on that?</p><p> Is there evidence of gouging in the sector by certain private nursing homes?  The Ombudsman said that certain residents are left in a position whereby their grandchildren have more pocket money than they might from their pension income.  At the time, the Department of Health distanced itself from the matter and it falls back to the Ombudsman to deal with it.  The Department argued that it is a matter between residents and nursing homes because of the private contract that exists between the proprietors of nursing homes and residents.  Who is looking out for the resident and protecting him or her?  Is it a case that there can be intervention and an examination?  The majority of residents and families would be quite interested to hear from the Ombudsman today and it is one matter I would like to be addressed.</p><p>In the context of contracts of care, it is quite significant for the Ombudsman to state that mortality rates can and do rise as a result of patients being moved.  I have read the comments of the Ombudsman, particularly those relating to dementia care and the difficulties that nursing homes can face in providing adequate care.  We must be cognisant of those increasing mortality rates.</p></speech>

I have worked with Ms Patricia Rickard-Clarke on the adult safeguarding Bill and financial abuse is one element of this.  Deputy Cassells has asked questions about the scale of this and what might be the remedies.  There is also the matter of contracts of care and the fact that people are not secure in their beds when they go to hospital or they are moved around.  This can have significant consequences for people, especially those with dementia.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Tyndall" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018053000002#E00300"><p>I will start with the financing issue.  HIQA has made it very clear that nursing homes are expected to ensure that residents have access to adequate social programmes.  I have no problem with that and it is entirely appropriate.  It is clearly not covered within the contract of care and the cost of providing that programme is substantial.  We have looked in detail at the finances of homes and on some occasions we have turned back particular decisions because of huge rises in charges without an adequate explanation, or where there has been no capacity to explain what the charge is covering and adequately separate this from the cost of care provided under the fair deal scheme.  Ultimately, we must ask how much should be included in the funding of the fair deal scheme and what the contract should cover.  If the gap between the contract and the income is generally of a fixed amount for people on pensions and if most of that is to be taken up by the social provision by the home itself, leaving not a huge amount of choice for the individual, it means people have either no or very little disposable income.  That cannot be right.  It is not for me to propose a detailed solution to that.  My sense is that I would probably include more of that in the contract.  It is my instinct.  However, it is a matter in a sense for the political domain to find a resolution.  The problem will only get worse.</p> <p>  We looked at it and the comment made to me was that one would need to be a forensic accountant to understand exactly what is going on in some cases.  Staff time is spent on the social programme.  In the context of how contracts are constructed and so on, that is currently legitimate but it leads to blurring.</p></speech>

Care staff accompanying residents as part of the social programme have time charged for in that context rather than as part of the fee.  There are many of these issues.  There is nothing illegal or wrong about that but the outcome is wrong.  That is the problem.  It is not that people are gaming the system, so to speak, but that there is probably not sufficient funding going into each individual to cover what we regard as the basic necessities of life, which include some social element.</p></speech>

I have a bad example but I will give it any event.  There are people who cannot afford their cigarettes.  Some may suggest that they would be better off without them but nonetheless the example demonstrates how autonomy can be completely eroded in such circumstances.  The contract must be very specific about what is funded and there should be rules about the costing of other elements.  If there are isolated incidents where advantage is being taken - for example, where social charges might be used to fund other aspects of care - we can deal with that when complaints come to us.  We can make redress.</p></speech>

There is also the issue of adequacy of funding to cover that which is clarified.  Those elements are under considerations but Mr. Tyndall is not quite sure where the process stands.</p></speech>

Taking a human rights perspective on the right to a home, it is difficult to justify denying somebody a home at no notice.  It is a qualified right under the human rights legislation.  As Ombudsman, it also seems to me to be bad administration.  Whichever way we look at this, the contract should be as any private rental contract would be, with notice periods and some security built in so as to give some assurance.  One can understand that challenges are faced by the people running nursing homes and if security of tenure had to be given, there might need to be assurances about additional care if somebody became more dependent and so on.  Although I am not saying it happens, as it stands somebody could be evicted on a whim, which cannot be right.</p></speech>

There must be a balancing of that transfer and certain obligations owing to it.</p></speech>

I refer not only to today's publication but also to the fact that the role of the Ombudsman illustrates the importance of the office.  The perspective the Ombudsman brings, while challenging, is refreshing, for which I thank him in a very sincere way.  We can skirt around some of the sensitive issues, but it is important that collectively - whatever organ of the State we represent - we do so on behalf of citizens.  </p><p> It is completely wrong and unacceptable that there is no security of tenure for residents in their new home.  I agree with Mr. Tyndall completely in that regard.  I hope we can see full implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act which will lend itself to giving security of tenure.  I am interested in hearing Mr. Tyndall's view.  Notwithstanding that, we have to balance the competing interests of owners of nursing homes with those of patients.  The issue of security of tenure is one we should monitor continually and keep at the forefront of what we do.  In his letter to us today the Minister of State speaks about having had a meeting with Nursing Homes Ireland.  Is there anything the committee can do to provide a sense of security for residents?  </p><p> I concur with Deputy Shane Cassells on the additional charges.  The Minister of State has met Nursing Home Ireland, the Ombudsman and Age Action Ireland to discuss the issue.  Mr. Tyndall has said that perhaps solutions cannot be offered.  There must be solutions.  In any society, no matter how limited discretionary spending is, it is not good enough that there is a senior citizen with &euro;4, &euro;5 or &euro;7 to spend.  We are not supporting smoking or anything like it.  It says an awful lot about society.  I am curious that, in reply to us in advance of the meeting, the Minister of State spoke about exploring options and having a project team with the aim of making recommendations with an interdepartmental working group.  Has there been further action in that regard?  We would like to hear about it.  Perhaps we might invite the Minister back as a consequence of the Ombudsman's visit.  The Minister of State is proactive.  I thank Mr. Tyndall for being here and his presentation.  Some of the case studies are just silly; bad practice can be changed easily.</p></speech>

In general, we receive very good co-operation from Departments and agencies when it comes to dealing with complaints.  </p> <p>  I should have responded to something Deputy Shane Cassells said, as well about the good quality of care.  Most people's experience most of the time in nursing homes is positive.  I would not for one moment want to-----</p></speech>

We developed the model of complaints policy which is used by its members and which we have provided for all nursing homes.  We have helped it with training in that regard.  Most recently, Ms Hanrahan ran a webinar into which large numbers of nursing homes across Ireland logged for a training exercise.  Generally we have good links.  </p> <p>  Coming back to the issue of the contract, the contract should be modified to include security of tenure or at least sensible notice periods.  I suggest there have to be reasons for notice being given, that it cannot just be done, as it can be at the moment, without reason.  That is an important point.  In the end I think the contract probably needs to cover more of the areas HIQA identified as requirements.  The funding has to reflect this.  It is the only practical solution to the problem of leaving people with more disposable income.  We made an input early on into both of the processes that were under way, the process of revising the contract and the process of looking at the additional charges, but we have not had recent engagement on either.  That may well be because work is ongoing actively and we will hear about it when it has reached a conclusion.  I would not want to draw any inference from that.  One of the things I will say is that when processes are under way to make improvements, some of which reflect issues raised in our reports, as an office, we are always happy to engage in those processes and participate in groups.  I will give an example.  We are doing a follow-up report to A Good Death, the report on end-of-life care.  There is a working group in which the Department and HSE have been actively involved.  We have been engaged with the working group throughout.  We do not push out reports and leave them to sink or swim.  We are quite happy to engage and will do so again, if requested.</p></speech>

It seems that there is consensus in the committee to support the recommendations the Ombudsman is making on the contract of care and strengthening the rights of people, particularly when it comes to security of tenure but also in enumerating what the contract should cover and having adequate funding to cover them.  It might be possible for the committee to write to that effect in support of the Ombudsman's findings.  We probably have not had a lot of time to consider it and may not have time to consider alternative models of care.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has work in progress on the issue of home care.  I will make two suggestions.  The first is that the committee write indicating its support for the Ombudsman's position.  Second, given there has been an interregnum since the Ombudsman's representations to the Department of Health, we could ask the Minister to come back to update us on what is happening.  We endorse the Ombudsman's analysis of the contract, the issues related to security of tenure, particularly the additional charges, how they are provided for and their impact on people's disposable income and their ability to live a life with some volition.  The Minister of State might be able to talk to us about the alternative care models because that is the subject of the work under way.  Is there anything else anybody could suggest?  Writing as a committee and inviting the Minister are the two things we could do.</p></speech>

In our second session we will have representatives of the No Fry Zone 4 Kids committee; the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute; and the school of education, childhood youth and sport, faculty of well-being, education and language studies of the Open University.</p><p>I welcome Ms Maria Hickey, president of the Association of Teachers of Home Economics; Ms Maria Barry, the vice president of the Association of Teachers of Home Economics; Dr. Karen Matvienko-Sikar, who is a member of the CHErIsH organisation in the school of public health in UCC; Ms Amanda McCloat, head of the home economics department at St. Angela's College in Sligo; and Dr. Elaine Mooney, lecturer in the home economics department at St. Angela's college in Sligo.  They are all very welcome.</p><p>I also welcome members and viewers who might be watching proceedings on Oireachtas TV to this public session of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  I also welcome our guests in the Public Gallery and Senator Frank Feighan for joining us this morning.</p><p>I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses to switch off their phones or to put them into flight mode.  Putting them on silent will not stop phones from interfering with our communication systems which may affect sound quality.  It makes it very difficult for parliamentary reporters and people watching proceedings online to follow what we are doing.  I would appreciate if members and witnesses would do that.</p><p>I advise our witnesses that any opening statements they make to the committee this morning will be published on the website of the committee after the meeting.

We are grateful for the opportunity to present our submissions on behalf of our members who are home economics teachers.  I am the president of the Association of Teachers of Home Economics and my colleague, Maria Barry, is its vice president.  We represent 700 teachers and student teachers of home economics.  Being faced daily in schools with the health of our young people, we are acutely aware of the challenges that exist around overweight and obesity.  The fact that one in four children is obese is alarming.</p><p>This rising level of childhood and adult obesity is placing an ever-increasing burden on individuals and society.  We propose that home economics, as a school subject, is ideally placed in the context of the school setting to work towards addressing this alarming health issue facing our society.</p><p> The new junior cycle home economics specification starting in schools in September 2018 has a strong focus on health and well-being and will teach young people essential life skills in a practical way.  A key strand of the specification is food, health and culinary skills, which focuses on developing a healthy, sustainable attitude and positive relationship with food through practical, experiential learning.  The student will apply his or her understanding of nutrition, diet and health principles to adopt a healthy lifestyle and make informed decisions that impact the health and well-being of themselves as individuals as well as within their families.</p><p> Unfortunately, this is still only an optional area of study.  As a collective group of home economists, the Association of Teachers of Home Economics, ATHE strongly calls on policymakers to make home economics compulsory for all post-primary students in Ireland.  This would put the food literacy of our young people at the forefront of the agenda.</p><p> Home economics is the only school subject that teaches young people how to cook and prepare food, which are essential life skills for young people.  Being able to cook for oneself ensures a dependency culture does not develop whereby people rely on processed and takeaway foods.  Research demonstrates that if a young person can cook, it can have a positive impact on their health, diet quality and confidence.  Internationally, in countries such as Korea, Iceland, Japan and Finland, home economics is compulsory for students to junior cycle equivalent to teach young people nutrition and food skills.  These countries have superior health standards and prioritise home economics as a food education intervention.</p><p> The ATHE shares the view of the Department of Health that childhood obesity and health inequalities are critical issues that must be addressed.  Therefore, the ATHE recommends as vital the investment in making home economics a compulsory subject on the school curriculum for all students in their junior cycle school years.  Home economics is the only school subject on the Irish school curriculum that teaches young people food literacy and culinary skills.  It is critical that all citizens of Ireland have the food and culinary skills and knowledge to provide nutritionally balanced meals for themselves and their families.</p><p> I thank the members for listening on behalf of the Association of Teachers of Home Economics.</p></speech>

The CHErIsH study is a Health Research Board funded study focused on the area of infant feeding and childhood obesity prevention.  I am speaking today as a postdoctoral research fellow on the CHErIsH study, which is an interdisciplinary collaboration between University College Cork, National University of Ireland Galway, and Trinity College Dublin.</p> <p>  The first two years of life represent a critical window for the prevention of childhood overweight and obesity.  How, what, and when parents feed their child during the child's first two years influences children&rsquo;s feeding behaviours, preferences and subsequent weight outcomes.  Parents' feeding behaviours therefore represent important modifiable targets for childhood obesity prevention.  Primary care healthcare professionals such as general practitioners and public health nurses have frequent contact with parents of young children.  In Ireland, parents and young children currently have up to 24 contact points, such as routine vaccination visits, with healthcare professionals in the first two years of the child's life.  As such, healthcare professionals are in a unique position to guide and influence parent feeding behaviours to prevent childhood obesity.</p> <p>  To date, the CHErIsH study has conducted a number of studies to inform development of an evidence-based infant feeding intervention to be delivered in primary care in Ireland.  As a result of the findings of our research to date we have a number of key recommendations to inform primary care based infant feeding childhood obesity prevention strategies in Ireland.  I will now outline these recommendations.  In the content and foci of obesity prevention strategies, these strategies must focus on informing and training parents in accurate and developmentally appropriate responses to child hunger and satiety cues.  Early child feeding supports must include and acknowledge the importance of family and friends in infant feeding.  This can be done by developing family or community-based strategies and by providing information to parents about the role of family and friends in their infant feeding experience.  In addition, infant feeding must be considered as a process with changes over time for children and for parents.  Provision of support to parents by healthcare professionals for both positive and negative experiences, which can change over time, is important to promote healthy infant feeding and prevent childhood obesity.</p> <p>  With regard to delivery of infant feeding advice and strategies in Ireland, this must be done in a clear and consistent manner across healthcare professionals, using appropriate trustworthy resources.  Provision of adequate resources, training and capacity for healthcare professionals to deliver infant feeding interventions and strategies is crucial.  There is also a need for greater consensus and clarity regarding the role of healthcare professionals around infant feeding in primary care.  The CHErIsH research team is working with key stakeholder groups, including parents and healthcare professionals, to finalise our infant feeding intervention based on these research findings and recommendations.</p> <p>  I thank the members for their time and the opportunity to present to the committee.</p></speech>

I am the head of home economics and I am joined by Dr. Elaine Mooney, lecturer in home economics at the college.</p> <p>  St. Angela&rsquo;s College, is a college of the National University of Ireland Galway and delivers the only initial teacher education programme in home economics to masters level, educating third level students to become home economics teachers.  We welcome the consultation being undertaken by the committee and are most grateful for the opportunity to address the committee today.</p> <p>  As it is a core aspect of home economics, I will brief the members on food education and specifically the contribution of home economics as a post-primary school subject in addressing the issue of childhood obesity.  We believe that prioritising the study of home economics in post-primary schools for all students is one of the most effective health promotion strategies available to combat poor dietary choices and unhealthy eating practices and consequently, assist in achieving the aims of A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025.</p> <p>  Home economics in schools is a comprehensive programme which incorporates nutritional knowledge and practical culinary and food skills, underpinned by scientific theory.  It is taught within a whole of school approach.  It is the only school subject which teaches young people how to cook.  It develops students&rsquo; practical food and health literacy skills, empowering them with not just the nutritional knowledge but also the practical hand-on skills to integrate healthy food choices into their own daily eating habits.  Research indicates that learning to cook as a young person is positively related to cooking confidence, good health and diet quality in later life.  Notably, as ATHE has said, developing food, health and culinary skills is a key focus of the new junior cycle home economics specification.  Due to the practical nature of home economics, students engage in a critical way with food and health issues with an emphasis on the application of practical skills, including menu planning, shopping, cooking, health and safety, portion control, reading food labels, dietary analysis, food budgeting, and food waste.</p> <p>  Internationally, home economics is considered a key ingredient in the development of healthy populations.  In countries such as Finland, Korea, Japan and Northern Ireland, home economics is a compulsory component of the curriculum in junior cycle education.  Never has there been such a fundamental need for compulsory food education through home economics for all students, and never has there been a better time to allow this to become a reality with the new junior cycle home economics specification.</p> <p>  While the solution to the obesity phenomenon is multifaceted, education emerges as a clear area of access.  Home economics teaches young people practical and theoretical aspects of food and the basic skills of how to prepare food for themselves and their families.  Consequently, students will develop confidence in choosing, preparing and cooking food.  Home economics is a key ingredient in a recipe for a happy and healthy life.  It is time to wake up and get cooking.  I thank the committee for listening.</p></speech>

Before I open up the discussion to members, I ask the third level educators to outline quickly the changes that are being made in the junior cycle curriculum around the practical application of the teaching of home economics.  How will this propose to improve the ability of teachers to teach the subject and, it is hoped, bring a good level of retention within students?  This is for the information of the committee.</p></speech>

We have gone from 35% to 50%.  It is not just about cooking.  There is also the theory related to the dishes the students will cook.  They will compare the dishes to takeaway varieties and shop-bought versions.</p><p>It means that when they buy ingredients they will understand the information provided on food labels.  </p></speech>

The main strand is food, health and culinary skills, which aims to develop a healthy and sustainable attitude to, and a positive relationship with, food.  The strand marries together theoretical knowledge, practical application and scientific theory.  It means that students will be much more engaged in the practical application and will learn how to cook food.  The subject of home economics is taught as a life skill so it is very much about developing one's ability to cook food for oneself and for one's family.</p></speech>

I remember studying home economics a long time ago.  How many hours a week is spent on teaching home economics?  What proportion of the time is spent on sewing, cooking, etc?</p> <p>  Are the witnesses aware of studies on the link between studying home economics and improved nutrition for individuals?  Will the introduction of home economics, as a compulsory module in the junior certificate cycle, put pressure on the education system?   </p></speech>

That means there are now 200 hours allocated for the teaching of home economics.  The amount of time depends on the year.  In terms of the current junior certificate home economics course, one might have four class periods for first year, second year and third year with a class period being 40 minutes in duration.</p></speech>

Last year, St. Angela's College, Sligo, in conjunction with Queen's University Belfast, conducted an island of Ireland nationally representative sample research into cooking skills that was sponsored by <i>safe</i>food.  The results showed that those who were taught to cook as young children and teenagers had better cooking skills and a better diet as adults than people who had not received such training.  It was also revealed that they also had greater confidence when preparing home-cooked meals.<br/><br/>In terms of scientific evidence, the preparation of food at home is a key part of a multidisciplinary approach to tackling obesity implemented in other countries.  In addition, the scientific literature refers to what is called a nutrition and culinary skills transition, where people no longer have the same level of cooking skills as in the past.  Norway and Finland are two countries that exemplify best practice.  Both countries have integrated the teaching of these necessary skills into the curriculum because that is when they can reach more students, and at a relevant age.  </p></speech>

That jurisdiction has made it compulsory to study home economics up to key stage 3.  In the North, home economics is now taught as part of its learning for life and work programme because home economics is taught from a life skills perspective.  They have also introduced topics such as healthy eating, home and family life, and independent living.  Undoubtedly, there will be some challenges at the very start but these can be managed and overcome through the provision of adequate resources and facilities.  Like all health promotion, prevention is key as opposed to being reactive.  We need to invest in teaching young people, during their formative years, the skills of cooking, food appreciation and to encourage them to adopt a positive relationship with food, which is critical and lasts a lifetime.  </p></speech>

In most schools the double class period is used to teach practical skills in the kitchen such as cookery skills.  Textile studies is still part of the curriculum.  The single class period is used to teach theory.  Due to having an integrated skills approach, theory forms part of the practical class period but in general, kitchen time takes place during the double periods.  One would be hoping for an hour and 20 minutes as one's cooking time.  The practical examination lasts an hour and a half, with half an hour set aside for preparation beforehand.  In other words, for examinations students are allocated half an hour to organise themselves and an hour and half to cook.  However, students are more prepared for national examinations and one has more time to set them up.  The time of one hour and 20 minutes in school is good.  That is the recommended time and, as home economics teachers, we would push for that amount of time.</p></speech>

Those projects have focused on working with families from lower socio-economic groups to try to develop their skills.  We have taken a bottom-up approach insofar as we work with participants when developing the programme.  This involves menu planning, budgeting, shopping for food and helping people to develop skills of discernment.  We do all of this in order that they know the best choices to make and to take that into the kitchen and be able to make a healthy, budget-friendly meal with a minimum amount of ingredients.</p> <p>  We envisage that home economists would work with families in the community.  A similar model called the extension services exists in the US and Arizona, in particular, has a very strong extension service.  In that instance, home economists or family consumer scientists work with families that have been referred to them by public health specialists.  When, for example, a mother leaves hospital after having a baby, she is assigned a home economist who works with her and teaches her how to prepare foods for weaning.  Such basic skills, even from an encouragement perspective, are extremely beneficial.  Home economists can explain to families ways to budget, how to choose the best food when shopping, time management skills, how to plan menus and, in particular, how to provide proper nutrition etc. for their young children.  </p></speech>

The advisers have a very practical-based employment where they work with low-income families in conjunction with the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  The advisers go into people's homes and accompany the mothers or parents to shops to show them how to shop, describe what is a good buy and outline how to read food labels, etc.  There is a hands-on, practical approach to the teaching of life skills.  We would love to see the scheme rolled out to other health board regions.  The advisers also actively engage with pregnant teen mothers and teach them infant nutrition, how to wean a baby etc.  We would love to see the teaching of home economics move into the community.</p></speech>

They work with families, parents or mothers of students in schools, especially DEIS schools, to help them at home.  When we teach children how to cook in class the children, in turn, can take those skills home.  I often ask my pupils to bring me photographs of the meals that they have cooked.  There already is a small integration of the cooking skills that have been learned in school into the home.  There are home-school liaison positions available, particularly in DEIS schools.  My school offers skills to the parents on different mornings where they come into the kitchen or where different things happen.</p><p>It is happening at some level, but more could be done.  </p></speech>

My daughter is in second year, and I had better compliment Ms Murtagh and Ms Lohan, her home economics teachers.  The skill sets that children receive are the basis of education, and I welcome that the witnesses have said they would like to see home economics being made compulsory.  They have asked that this be the case and when they come before committees, it is important that witnesses tell us what they think would work.  That message has come from all parties today.</p> <p>  Ms McCloat spoke about facilities and resources, and cooking applications.  Can she expand on that?  What are the facilities like?  What sort of resources are required?  If it were to move to an all-schools approach, whereby all children in all schools were given the opportunity to acquire the life skill sets during the first three years, they would then bring those skill sets home.</p> <p>  Dr. Matvienko-Sikar spoke mainly, from a study point of view, about early years education.  Was a study carried out on mothers who breastfeed and the obesity outcomes for their children?  In terms of the 24 contact points relating to going back to GPs, we had a long discussion last week around measuring the weight of children.  Does she have a view on that?  Does she believe that is something that should be taken into consideration in earlier years?  Many people spoke about how, by the time a child gets to secondary school, it might be too late.  Should we be intervening further in primary schools in order that people know what a healthy weight is, how it is attained and the exercise that should be done?  </p> <p>  I seek the input of the witnesses on physical education in schools.  Studying home economics is one thing but does physical educational provision in schools complement it?</p></speech>

Some schools have two or three kitchens, which would be a basic room kitted out so that there are ten work stations on average.  There are generally seven to ten work stations in an individual kitchen.  In an all-girls school, there are usually two functioning kitchens.  Some of the mixed schools might also have two; it varies.  Some male schools have kitchens.  For example, I know that Summerhill College in Sligo has an excellent home economics programme and teaches home economics up to leaving certificate level.   It is a very strong subject in that school.  It has a fantastic new kitchen in its new build.  Some of the more traditional boarding schools for boys do not have the facilities.  We have found, particularly for some leaving certificate classes in the past, that those schools have joined up with an all-girls school in the area and have used the facilities there.  Opportunities are available.</p> <p>  To kit out a school with ten stations would cost approximately &euro;100,000.  That is a ballpark figure; the cost depends on the services available and what it would take to kit out the actual room.  There are approximately 700 schools, and we would have to find out how many schools actually have fully functioning kitchens.  We would have to work particularly closely with the schools for boys to find out how we could strategically and incrementally kit those schools out with kitchens.  According to the Department of Education and Skills criteria, kitchens are specified in the plans for all new builds of schools.</p></speech>

We were told that it would cost more than &euro;1 billion to provide the kind of facilities necessary to make it a compulsory subject.  I feel that it would link in with what the witnesses are trying to achieve.  Is there a model with which we could assess the cost of equipping existing schools, as opposed to new builds, across the country?  Perhaps the witnesses do not know of such a model.  I imagine it would apply to our older communities, rather than those schools built in the last five years or so.  It would be interesting to be able to plan the fitting out of schools with the necessary facilities, and to know what kind of figures we are talking about.  If home economics was to begin in primary schools what impact would it have in terms of the Department of Education and Skills and the school patrons being able to keep pace with it?</p></speech>

The evidence shows that children who receive age-appropriate nutritional education have better quality diets.  We are saying that the earlier children are taught food skills, the better.  We propose that modules of home economics be integrated into subjects that already exist in the curriculum, called SPHE, or social, personal and health education, in the primary school.  At the moment primary school teachers teach nutrition during that subject.  We have carried out island of Ireland research, funded by SCoTENS, the Standing Conference on Teacher Education, North and South, which looked at primary school teachers' experiences of teaching nutrition and food related matters on the curriculum.  Overwhelmingly the teachers would say that, of all information, it is the most relevant and most worthwhile, and the students enjoy it.  The teachers specifically said that to enhance teaching in that area, they need to teach practical food.  They called for classroom-appropriate resources as opposed to kitchen-appropriate resources.  It would not cost the enormous amount one might imagine, because the type of work the teachers would like to do would require tabletop appliances, a fridge, a hand-held blender or a microwave to enhance the experience in terms of active learning methodologies.  The teachers felt that it would be really worthwhile and would not involve huge costs.  Ideally, we would love to say that every primary school should be equipped with a kitchen, but that is not feasible.  However, it is very feasible to equip them with tabletop appliances.</p></speech>

To be fair to teachers in the national schools, they are already doing some of that themselves.  If they cannot do it in the classroom children are brought out into the local community so that they can experience harvesting and making soups.  I believe the suggestion the witness has made is very practical.</p></speech>

There is a considerable body of national and international evidence which links breastfeeding initiation and duration with later weight outcomes.  Our intervention is looking at early breastfeeding and the complementary feeding and weaning components.  We have conducted a number of focus groups in Cork and Galway, with both breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding parents to ensure a mixed group of people.  We have found that a number of the challenges that are faced by parents in terms of promoting healthy feeding and engaging in it with their children up to two years are the same challenges that have been highlighted by the other speakers here.  There are many practical issues, such as not knowing what to feed, when to feed and how to prepare the food for children, particularly around complementary feeding.</p><p>There are also challenges around cost across socio-economic groups, so it was not just about lower income parents.  We also noted this in a larger qualitative piece that looked at international evidence.  We synthesised a large body of international studies and found that across socio-economic groups people reported the cost of healthy feeding was a challenge.  There is also the time to prepare the food, particularly for working parents.  With respect to some of the propositions and recommendations brought forward today, if we can upskill parents or put in a preventative measure whereby parents come to this key juncture with skills, it would be useful.  This is the practical aspect of preparing food and knowing how and when is challenging for parents.  This is when they may engage in less healthy approaches.</p></speech>

That had not come up but that could be due to the region.  The parents we spoke to were positive about the supports for breastfeeding, and particularly websites such as <i>www.breastfeeding.ie</i>website, as well as public health nurses.  They felt that once they moved from breastfeeding to complementary feeding, the support and advice was less consistent.  In many cases, they did not feel it was there for them.  The supports were lacking irrespective of whether people were breastfeeding or formula feeding.<br/><br/>There was a question about waiting times in primary care practice.  It is something that we have spoken about, particularly with respect to our study site where we will pilot our intervention.  It will be particularly useful.  Based on the work done with healthcare professionals, particularly on strategies for obesity prevention in infants, the issue is the capacity of health care professionals to deliver any of these messages.  That relates to time, resources and when this would be possible.  I suppose the same issues arise in respect of weighing children at these visits.  It is an additional few minutes but it is a cumulative cost to the health service.  A study conducted by my colleague, Dr. Michelle Queally, using Growing Up in Ireland data, indicates that parents, particularly mothers of three-year-old and five-year-old children, tend to consistently misperceive their children's weight.  When children are overweight or obese, mothers in Ireland tend not to be as good at noticing, particularly when a female child has a high birth weight or a mother is of a lower socio-economic status or is overweight.  Having the weighing within the primary care setting and public health contact points is an opportunity for this early prevention strategy to be implemented.  Our research evidence supports that.</p></speech>

However, the nutritional side is the key.  We look at everything that is said but it is 75% to 80% about nutrition and 20% to 25% about physical education.  The home economics and physical education departments in most schools work well together.  There are healthy eating or health and well-being weeks.  There are many different activities.  Physical education is important but from our perspective, nutrition is even more important.  That is why we are calling for home economics to be a compulsory subject and be at the forefront in tackling the problem.</p></speech>

I have one question and it is open to any of the witnesses answer.  It relates to the removal of choice and making home economics a compulsory subject.  What difficulties do gender norms and stereotypes present for getting buy-in?  Making it compulsory does not guarantee buy-in.  There is a grain of truth in all stereotypes and while some are redundant, others are formed on the basis in the Constitution, which guarantees the woman's place in the home.  I say this as a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual, LGBT, community who understands that heterosexual people are often the biggest recipients of homophobia in schools and that "gay" is still a term of abuse in the playground.  Anything bar rigid masculinity could be identified as such.  Do we face a challenge in getting buy-in from all students and are stereotypes and gender norms an obstacle?</p></speech>

Current statistics indicate that of the 36% of people studying home economics, the majority are female.  That is not a reflection on the subject but more down to the fact it is often scheduled in schools against what would traditionally be perceived as "male" subjects such as wood technology.  If it was made available to all students, it would remove the stigma of a boy doing the subject.  With the new specification coming on-stream for junior cycle in September 2018, it comes from a life skills approach and there are no inflictions that males or females should look at a particular aspect.  Home economics teachers are conscious of the students in front of them and do not stereotype roles in the home.  By making it compulsory, the stereotypical notion of who should be studying the subject would be removed.</p> <p>  Japan has had compulsory home economics for males and females since 1989.  It had a traditional gendered, segregated society and it faced the same challenge of having males coming in to work with textiles, cooking, and learning about child rearing and development.  They overcame the challenge with the idea that everybody had to do it because it is important for everybody's home life, no matter what type of family.  It overcame the issue in 1989 and I am sure it is not insurmountable for Irish society to do so in future.</p></speech>

As Ms Barry noted, most students, including me, had a choice between a practical subject or home economics in first year at around the same time.  In the 1980s, I did not have any practical reason to choose the subject so I chose something else.  As the witnesses implied, being exposed to it through friends in secondary school, it is a subject I would not have minded doing.  I am fortunate in that I grew up in a house where both my parents cooked, predominantly my father during the week and my mother at the weekend.</p><p>That is possibly role reversal, but that is the way my family was.  I was very much involved in the cookery.  There is a great deal of pressure on parents to find the time to cook a healthy meal.  Many people, although not enough, do batch cooking.  People get home from work at 6 p.m. to 6.15 p.m. on a weekday and the last thing they want to do is all the preparation to produce food in a meaningful way for the family or for the adults.  It becomes an even bigger issue when adults and children need to be fed and one must plan ahead.  One of the worst aspects of parents being extraordinarily busy is that they have to consider what the childminder, the nanny or the childcare facility where the children go feed them?  </p><p> Based on my experience of the past couple of years, I have observed what it is that children are eating.  Often parents do not think about it.  People my think about in the car or on the train on the way home, but many people do not think about it at 4 p.m. when the minder is thinking about what she or he will feed them.  An important aspect of childcare is giving children that skill set.  Dr. Elaine Mooney referred to giving people confidence.  One of the major issues for me a busy parent is having the confidence to go into the kitchen to prepare something healthy for all to eat or instead pick up the phone or, worse, use an app, which is tempting and dangerous, to order food.</p><p> What are the practicalities of making home economics not only a compulsory subject at second level but introducing it as a more hands-on subject at primary level?  I agree that pooled resources in a primary school that can be lifted and moved into a classroom once a week or so makes sense.  How much it will cost is the question that must be asked but it is our job to address that.  From a practical perspective it makes sense.  I camped frequently when I was a child and I know how easy it is to use a portable kitchen, but it would not necessarily be wise to bring a gas cylinder into a classroom.  There are many options now and they are affordable as well, which is good.  How should this be resourced?  I imagine that, like most subjects, there is a shortage of home economics teachers throughout the country.  How can sufficient numbers be upskilled to get to the point where we are able to introduce compulsory home economics at second level?</p></speech>

We are the sole provider of home economics teacher education in the country.  We will take in 112 students next September who will qualify to be a home economics teacher.  In addition, we will shortly launch a professional diploma in home economics.  We are cognisant of the shortage of teachers and we will upskill out of field teachers.  If somebody is a registered teacher in another subject, he or she will have the opportunity in September to go to St. Angela's College for one year to qualify as a home economics teacher.  He or she will be recognised by the Teaching Council in home economics in addition to whatever subjects they may have.  That is a new development, but we are being proactive to respond to the shortage of home economics teachers.  We also have developed a bachelor of education in home economics, which we hope to roll out shortly as well.  We are being proactive and cognisant of the fact that there is a shortage of home economics teachers.</p> <p>  Teaching home economics is predominantly a female profession and home economic teachers avail of a number of types of family leave.  While a shortage is reported frequently, but it may be for a period of specific cover, for example maternity leave, short-leave, carer's leave and so on.  That is a challenge the profession faces in terms of providing teachers for those short-term periods of cover.  All our graduates last year, with the exception of two, went directly into schools to schools.  The two graduates who did not went on to study for a full masters programme.  We are keeping a record of where our graduates go.</p></speech>

Bearing in mind the role of the joint committee, we shadow many Departments, as we have found in the past few years.  This is another example of where we will cross into other Departments and make recommendations to other committees, which will then make recommendations to their line Ministers.  It is important for us to propose practical applications of what we have learned in these hearings.

The subject is well established in Japan, as it is also compulsory in primary school for two years as well.</p> <p>  I mentioned some of the challenges being faced in Northern Ireland in respect of teaching resources.  We have been proactive in trying to address that in the South.  We are engaging in a research project with Ms Mair&eacute;ad Davidson, who is my equivalent in the University of Ulster, into how they rolled out home economics to key stage three.  We will investigate some of the challenges and benefits perceived by teachers perceive.  We hope to have the outcome of that project in a few short months.  We will happily share that with the committee.</p> <p>  The buildings unit in the Department of Education and Skills uses a clear specification for school kitchens.

Home management advisers was mentioned by Dr. Mooney, a service that I did not know existed.  I thought public health nurses did this but the HSE has a team.

That would encompass the 24 contact points up until the age of two years and then there are additional contact points up until three years of age.</p> <p>  Under the Making Every Contact Count programme, the HSE is currently developing messages for healthcare professionals to deliver as well as healthcare professional training.  We link in with them in order that there is crossover in the messages we are developing to be delivered in primary care.  This means the messages delivered to parents are standardised.  The aim of the CHErIsH project is to examine the feasibility of delivering healthy infant feeding messages through primary care and to ensure the messages are consistent with the messages that are delivered through healthcare professionals.  We have crossover and links with the HSE.  </p> <p>  With regard to the home management advisers and more practical guidance, we have feedback from many parents that we have spoken to that the more practical aspects would be particularly useful.</p><p>What is interesting from our point of view is which aspects are sustainable on a larger scale.  Our focus at the moment is on trying to see what can be implemented at primary care level, while being cognisant that some of the resources parents require may be outside this.  We are trying to find a balance between the two whereby, potentially, parents could be provided with signposting information to additional, more practical resources, but the initial message would be delivered in the primary care practice.</p></speech>

The feedback has been that capacity and resources is one of the biggest challenges for healthcare professionals to deliver preventative, proactive rather than reactive messages.  The public health nurse network has been cited by the parents as being particularly useful, but there is an issue in respect of the level of trust and the relationships that exist between the parents and the healthcare professionals.  That is important, both for the parents and the healthcare professionals, in terms of uptake and engagement with the messages that are being disseminated.  The issue of capacity and resources is one of the main challenges cited by healthcare professionals.</p></speech>

We are looking for practitioners on the ground.  In other countries, home economists are to be found only in small numbers in the school setting.  They work with families in the community.  The ethos of our subject is to help families with their practical problems and to give them the skills to problem solve.  That is what true home economics is about.  In Ireland, we have it pigeon-holed into schools and few people refer to themselves as home economists.  However, we refer to ourselves as home economists because we see it as much more than just teaching in a secondary school.  We would like to move it out more into the community.</p> <p>  Over the coming weeks the committee will engage with other people from different agencies to examine different policy interventions which have taken place in other countries such as calorie posting on menus and front-of-pack labelling.  While these measures are effective, they are only effective if people are taught how to use them.  Students are taught in the home economics classroom how to read a label, what is the difference between calories in and calories out, and balancing the two.  We often call on the food industry to re-formulate products.  Home economics students are taught in the home to do recipe modification in order that they can look at a recipe and reduce the saturated fat in that or increase the fibre and reduce the salt.  Those are skills that we want every student to have in the home as well as managing their meal planning and cooking age-appropriate meals.  It is important to emphasise that these policy interventions in other countries have been effective because there have been adopted in the education system at the same time.</p></speech>

Some students skipped home economics class the day we were cooking because they could not afford the ingredients.  I assume that is still an issue today.  How is that addressed?  Does every school provide ingredients or do students still have to bring in their own ingredients?</p></speech>

I work in an inner city DEIS school and we provide all the ingredients.  In other schools, the students bring their own.  I have worked in both situations and I would prefer to provide the ingredients.  It is cheaper because I buy in bulk, I buy what I need and I do not buy extra.  However, it is time consuming to provide ingredients in school because it takes from the time in the classroom.  Ingredients have to be weighed and measured in class whereas if the students bring them, they will have them prepared, or they will have been taught the skills to prepare them at home, and they bring them weighed.  Both ways work, but it can be costly if they have not been listening to the teacher's advice.  We teach them how to buy ingredients in bulk, even down to unit-costing.  The bag of flour may cost &euro;2 but to make the dish it might have only cost 30 cent.  They learn that as part of the skills as well.</p></speech>

Has any work been done to liaise with Tusla?  The agency set up what are known as children and young people's services committees, CYPSCs, a number of years ago.  Those CYPSCs are starting to work with parents groups on nutrition and healthy eating throughout the country.  Most people learn some cooking skills in the home as well as in school and prevention is better than cure.  Is any work being done with Tusla and with the CYPSCs in this regard?</p></speech>

There was more of a culture around cooking when I was younger.  It was economically driven at the time, in that it was cheaper for a household to cook than to go out and buy ingredients or buy pre-packed food.  What role is the marketing of food products playing in the eating habits today according to the parents and children the witnesses have interacted with?  What effect is this having?  Is marketing superseding the economics of eating? Is the strong tailored packaging and marketing superseding the affordability of these products?  In the past, it was a given that a person would cook but that was on affordability grounds as opposed to health grounds.  People could not afford to eat out, or takeaways and fast food.  What have been the witnesses' findings in this regard?</p></speech>

Based on the national research we have done and international evidence, we have found that parents tend not to trust much the packaging on younger children's food products, particularly the age recommendations.  Many food packages would state that they are suitable for consumption from four or six months onwards, whereas parents know they should wait until the baby is aged six months and they have been given this advice repeatedly.  Whether people stick to that advice is dependent on a range of factors, but we consistently found that the parents tended to be less trusting of that type of food packaging.  However, many of the constraints that we have mentioned relating to time and cost lead parents to still buy and use those products because they provide a quick and easy alternative for them.  Parents tend to look through the ingredients list to identify healthy components. Returning to what the other speakers have said, however, the issue is whether they have the knowledge to interpret this information correctly.  We do not know if that is always the case.  The parents of young children engage in this inconsistently..</p> <p>  I am not sure of the position regarding adolescents..</p></speech>

We go through the labels with students and point out that someone could probably eat a normal chocolate bar because protein bars also contain large amounts of sugar.  We teach students that energy drinks give the amount of calories or sugar per 250 ml but the can might be 500 ml.  Students do not realise the can will have twice the amount of sugar.  We do a lot of work with junior certificate students that involves measuring out the sugar that a soft drink will contain to try show that labelling is not always true.  We teach them that what they read is not always necessarily 100% true.  Hopefully, when they look to buy well packaged and well marketed products, they will at least have some knowledge and skill background in interpreting what they read.</p></speech>

I can see Deputy Neville's point.  In marketing, the issue is more about reduced fat but people may not realise that the reduced fat product could have higher levels of sugar.  That is what we teach in the classroom.  The food industry must follow very clear labelling guidelines with regard to ingredient declaration and nutritional composition.  What we are talking about is teaching students the concept of a serving, what a serving size is and, more important, what a portion size is.  This is the perspective from which we are coming.</p></speech>

I am a dad to two girls, Amy, two, in cr&egrave;che and Jess, nine, in St. Kevin's primary school, Greystones.  In July 2013, a drive-through fast-food outlet applied for planning permission just 35 m away from an education campus of three schools, two primary and one post-primary, of 1,850 students.  A group of concerned parents and I came together to prevent this from happening, primarily because the location was completely inappropriate and unsuitable.  Over the past five years we have learned much about the planning process, the county development and how the proximity of fast-food outlets to schools can impact on childhood obesity.<br/><br/>Working with Wicklow county councillors over an 18 month period, a no-fry zone objective, RT 17 was adopted into the Wicklow County Development Plan 2016-2022.  The important point of this objective was that it included a specific distance of 400 m where no new fast-food or takeaway outlets could be built or operated in proximity of schools or playgrounds.  The distance was chosen based on the evidence gathered in studies over the past ten to 15 years, primarily in the US and Canada.  These studies show conclusively that obesity rates among schoolchildren increase by at least 25% when fast-food outlets are located within 400 m of a school, particularly in lower socio-economic areas.  Within that distance, schoolchildren have enough time to access these fast foods at low prices at break times.  Additionally, these junk foods are promoted heavily to target schoolchildren who are impressionable and have disposable income.<br/><br/>Our no-fry zone proposal received significant and credible support from leading healthcare experts throughout the country through written submissions, 58 in total, during the county development plan process.  These experts included the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland's policy obesity group, chaired by Professor Donal O'Shea and Professor Catherine Hayes; the Association for the Study of Obesity on the Island of Ireland, ASOI; the Irish Heart Foundation; the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, INDI; <i>safe</i>food; and the healthy eating active living programme in the HSE.  Many academics made submissions from DCU, DIT, NUI, TCD, UCC and UCD.<br/><br/>There is a need for no-fry zones.  No-fry zones around schools will reduce the rate of obesity by preventing easy access for schoolchildren to unhealthy foods.  They will reduce the direct, constant and targeted promotion of these junk foods to schoolchildren.  No-fry zones of 400 m around schools will ensure consistency in local planning when it comes to fast-food outlet applications and proximity to schools.  This is very much lacking today.  They will help reshape the local planning framework to reduce the obesogenic environment for our schoolchildren and in our communities.  This action was proposed in the Healthy Weight for Ireland Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025.<br/><br/>Obesity is not a local issue but a national one.  As happy as we are in Wicklow to have a no-fry zone, we believe strongly that such zones should be implemented around schools throughout the country as soon as possible.  No-fry zones will contribute to the health and well-being of children and are part of the overall solution to tackle childhood obesity.</p></speech>

In our longer submission we describe the contribution made by dietitians and the evidence to support the impact of nutrition interventions.  The Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute, INDI, is the professional organisation for regulated dietitians in Ireland.  There are 900 registered dietitians in Ireland and the INDI has a membership of 760.  Dietitians are the only health professionals who are qualified to give specialised clinical nutrition advice to patients.  They are qualified to degree or postgraduate level and have an extended period of clinical placement in recognised training hospitals.  The title of dietitian is also protected by legislation.<br/><br/>Good nutrition starts at home.  Prevention of childhood obesity starts before the child is born and involves ensuring that a mother&rsquo;s nutritional care is optimised because we know that maternal obesity has been found to be the most significant risk factor for obesity in children.  Mothers need to be supported to start breastfeeding and to continue for at least six months as breastfed babies are less likely to become overweight while babies who are weaned too soon are more likely to become overweight.  We also know that 80% of children who are obese between the ages of 10 and 14 will be obese adults.<br/><br/>We know that there is a link between childhood obesity and socio-economic position.  Dietitians are trained to be able to communicate with people from all areas of society and are skilled at explaining complex issues using simple, positive and motivating language.  They use these techniques to help children and their families to identify the reasons they are struggling to manage their weight.  Preventing childhood obesity involves both home and school life.  It encompasses supporting parents to encourage their children to be more active, eat more nutritious foods and reduce screen time.  It also involves working with educators to develop a curriculum that includes healthy eating and physical activity and that promotes positive body image.<br/><br/>Dietitians educate families, community workers and teachers in how to promote healthy eating habits, behaviours and attitudes to food.  They are also involved in very practical, peer-led cooking courses.  Dietitians have a role to play as part of a multi-disciplinary team in the treatment<b></b>of childhood obesity and can provide specialist nutrition support such as therapeutic diets and artificial nutrition following weight loss surgery.  All of this work is done by dietitians every day and we welcome the recognition that nutrition has a key role to play in so many aspects of health.  The HSE alone has over 120 strategic actions relating to nutrition across its various work streams.<br/><br/>We anticipate some challenges when it comes to delivering these, however, due to our low numbers.  There are 450 dietitians employed by the HSE, mostly delivering specialist care in hospitals.  A total of 144 dietitians work in the community.  In Ireland we have one dietitian per 50,000 of population but the international guidance is 1 per 15,000.  The national dietetic adviser at the HSE estimates that we need to recruit 80 dietitians per year into the community alone to deliver our national objectives.  We look forward to so doing and thank the committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

I am a lecturer in developmental psychology and childhood and a director of the centre for children and young people's wellbeing at the Open University in the UK.  I was formerly based at UCD where, in collaboration with colleagues at Queen's University and Ulster University, I carried out the studies that form the basis of my written submission.  Those studies were funded by <i>safe</i>food.  I still collaborate with colleagues at UCD, with the Irish Heart Foundation and also do work on behalf of the WHO.  I am here today in a personal capacity and thank the committee members for their interest in our work.<br/><br/>Systematic reviews have long since established that marketing exposure to unhealthy food and drinks influences children&rsquo;s food preferences, requests and eating and contributes to overweight and obesity.  International research shows that experimental marketing exposure increases a child's intake by 30 to 50 calories.  Given that an imbalance of between 40 to 70 calories per day can tip one into being overweight over time, it does not take much marketing exposure to have an effect.  Our research on the island of Ireland showed that by three years of age, children recognised over half of the food brand logos associated with unhealthy food items shown to them, and by the time they were five, they recognised almost all of them.<br/><br/>In 2010, the WHO recommended reductions in the marketing of unhealthy food and drinks to children and this was adopted by the World Health Assembly that same year.  A child rights perspective and the upholding of children&rsquo;s best interests as mandated in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child require states to support parents in relation to children's health.  All of the responsibility for children's health should not be put onto parents.  They cannot be expected to make healthy choices all of the time in an environment saturated with marketing for food products that nobody should be eating except as an occasional treat.  Our forthcoming WHO report on the implementation of those recommendations notes patchy progress including in Ireland. <br/><br/>Here in Ireland, the evidence gathered in the <i>safe</i>food study a number of years ago indicated that young children see upwards of 1,000 television advertisements for unhealthy foods per year.  This is in a climate of regulation and regulation compliant television, but there are weaknesses and loopholes in the regulations as they stand.  The new non-broadcast code is welcome in terms of establishing the principle that we should be looking beyond broadcast television, but it is voluntary, unfortunately, and it lacks defined monitoring mechanisms.  We are very concerned about how it is going to play out in reality.<br/><br/>Something potentially radical for children's health and well-being happened here last week with the profiling amendment to the Data Protection Bill, but we will have to wait and see how that works out in practice.  It is unclear how the voluntary code provisions on targeting on social media are going to play out.  Other forms of marketing beyond broadcast and digital affect children&rsquo;s eating, such as brand marketing and packaging, but are not regulated.  I have made detailed recommendations on same in my written submission and would be delighted to discuss those further.</p></speech>

I note that they were in the Public Gallery for the earlier part of our meeting so they will have an understanding of the committee's position.  I am very interested in the work done by Philip Moyles on no-fry zones, but I note that it is only in one area of the country.  Has the policy been rolled out elsewhere?  In terms of county development plans, would such a policy be difficult to enforce?  In terms of fry zones, one is not just talking about the traditional chip shop.  There are also fry zones in most service stations these days and they might get planning permission for construction quite close to schools.  That is my concern.  I know a lot about the good work done by Mr. Moyles through my colleague, Deputy Pat Casey.  If we are serious about tackling childhood obesity, should we as legislators be seeking the enforcement of similar policies in county development plans?</p> <p>  Advertising to children is a pet issue for me.  I believe that the broadcasting and social media codes should be reviewed.  The fact that children know brands by the time they are three, even before they know their ABCs, is very worrying.  The witnesses have given us a huge amount of data with which to work and many of their recommendations can be included in our final report.</p> <p>  Ms Feighan referred to breastfeeding in her opening statement, which I welcome because I believe it plays a huge role.  The promotion of breastfeeding is an under-resourced area in the context of women's health.  Ms Feighan also referred to curriculum development and I ask her to expand on that.  We had a discussion with home economics teachers earlier and we also spoke about physical education, but further curriculum development is crucial.  It is also important in the context of reducing screen time for children.  I ask the witnesses to expand on those points.</p></speech>

That is our expectation.  We would like to see no-fry zones implemented throughout the country, either as a result of all county councils being directed to implement them or as a result of all county councils taking it upon themselves to put it into the county development plan.  We went through quite an exhaustive process working with the councillors over an 18 month period, very much providing all of the information and evidence for them to say this was a good step forward and then getting the support of all the healthcare experts, as I mentioned earlier.  That is what made the councillors see this was the right step forward.</p> <p>  In Wicklow we started off with about six or seven councillors who supported this idea.  At the end of the 18 month process, we had an overwhelming majority of 25, which is great.  We have tried to engage with some other councils, but it is very much about trying to find councillors within councils who are interested in health and sharing what we have done.  It is a slow process and it is quite tedious.  Not every council updates its council development plan.  There are a couple in every year.</p> <p>  In some respects, we have done the groundwork in Wicklow.  We are the very first county.  The first time anything is done, it sets a precedent.  We went through a rigorous process in Wicklow.  We spent three months looking at the wording of our objective with ex-planners.  It would be much easier to show councils what we have in Wicklow and to replicate it in every other county.</p></speech>

Consideration of the no-fry zones must be done by the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  All the heavy lifting has been done.  There has to be very good work there that other county councils or the Department can take on board as a guideline.</p></speech>

At the moment we are contacting councillors.  I am passionate about this particular subject.  It would be much easier if all councils were made aware of a very positive initiative that has the support of the entire healthcare community.  The evidence is there and we have done all the work.</p> <p>  Our objective is concerned with what we do in future.  It will not impact on existing businesses.  It is about future applications.  At the moment it is primarily about outlets that are selling fast food, so it does not cover garages.  It is very much about fast-food outlets.</p></speech>

Some of those can be quite healthy, although not the bread so much.  If they deep fry them, it is a problem, but if they bake them, it is different.  One does not necessarily want to stop the local shop from stocking that sort of thing.  If it is a big brand takeaway, it is an issue.  It is a predominant situation now that there are fast-food outlets attached to or inside petrol stations and service stations.  That might be what Deputy Rabbitte was referring to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018053000002#N00700"><p>That is what I was coming to.  It is not just the branding of the chipper.  Unless everything in the deli is all salad, it will not be perfectly healthy.  I am thinking about the kids on their lunch breaks having a chicken roll with other ingredients.  That cannot be a healthy, balanced, nutritional lunch.</p></speech>

Those rolls are equivalent to four slices of bread.  It is not a sandwich.  It is two sandwiches.  I heard the home economics teachers mention portion size earlier.  It is a huge issue because even if it is breaded chicken, it is not what they should be having at lunchtime.  There are huge portions of meat.  The amount of coleslaw that goes on top is an issue.  It is very difficult to make the healthy choice in that situation.  One has to be educated to make the healthy choice.  I have concerns about that.  This is a great first step.  We need to think about the fact that food is cheaper now.  Unhealthy food is cheaper.  If children are going into a shop, it is harder to buy a piece of fruit, a healthier option or a small sandwich when for the same price they can get something that has probably twice the calories of an average child's school lunch.</p></speech>

There was no clarity about how close a fast-food outlet could be.  This was very much a first step to say we should target the main fast-food outlets.  In future, we would like to address the bigger picture.</p></speech>

He will need that but one will find that the children who are not doing any sport are buying it and then going home and spending a lot of time in front of screens.  They are the children who are at risk.</p></speech>

Sometimes in schools what canteens produce might not be the healthiest option either.  Rolls can be available and possibly the chicken might be brought in.  Portion size is an issue.  We have to consider what goes on inside the four walls of schools.  Do the witnesses agree with me?</p></speech>

There is work going on in the HSE around the healthy eating and active living programme in terms of rolling out the food pyramid.  New guidelines were developed last year.  A whole load of work goes into it.  One of those things is to encourage healthy vending.  The other is to encourage healthy school menus to ensure the nutrition that children get in schools is optimised.  A subgroup has been established to look at nutrition for children from birth to five years.  As part of the healthy eating and active living programme the curriculum is being developed to give guidance to schools.</p></speech>

It was delivered to lots of primary school teachers every year.  I taught on that module for a number of years and it was always registered dietitians who taught the module.  Unfortunately, that module has been stopped this year.  In recent years DCU took over St. Patrick's College and it became part of DCU.  From this year that elective is no longer available, which is disappointing.</p> <p>  When one does a bachelor degree in teacher education in St. Patrick's teacher training college in Drumcondra, in the final year there are a number of elective subjects.  There are options that students can choose from.  They include things like drama in the classroom and teaching Irish as an active language.  They are things where one can delve into an area of interest for the students.  The title of the module was nutrition in education.  Every year it was oversubscribed because students on the course are predominantly female and there is a lot of personal interest in the subject.  Teachers are also consumers.  They get nutritional information from Instagram and magazines.  Maybe they are not getting the correct nutritional information.  About 60 students attended that elective every year and it was taught by registered dietitians.  When I left, two other registered dietitians taught the elective.</p> <p>  The elective has been cut this year.  They were told that for funding reasons the nutrition elective was no longer available.  That was disappointing because at least the teachers coming out of it had good evidence-based nutrition training and were going on to teach children in primary schools.  That is where a lot of the learning is coming from.  We do not have the required number of dietitians to go into primary schools.  There are some who do community work and access schools but it is very limited.</p></speech>

The submission referred to three year olds recognising the brands.  They know brands better than they know ABCs at three years of age.  I talk openly about the big movie television slot.  We know who sponsors it and the time of the evening when it is on.  We know it is targeted marketing and we also know about the gimmicks being advertised to attract the children and how this puts pressure on the parents.  I believe there should be a watershed for some of that marketing and it should be after 9 p.m.  I am keen to hear the viewpoint on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mimi Tatlow-Golden" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018053000002#O00400"><p>Several points arise.  I agree absolutely with a watershed.  It was really interesting when we did the research.  We started with figures.  We got the data through the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on actual viewing times of young children.  They were altogether different from what people had imagined.  People thought young people were watching between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. at the weekends before their parents had got up.  In fact, they were watching across the day and a great deal of viewing is taking place beyond 9 p.m.  A watershed is the least we would need to put in place to achieve some effects.</p> <p>  What we saw in the study was that people were complying with the legislation completely but it was not reducing advertisement exposure.  We have seen this in other jurisdictions as well.  The reason is that the advertisers move to other times.  If they were advertising heavily towards children at one time, then they moved to the mixed audiences.  The idea was that it would not only be during the big movie time but at the times of big sporting events.  A major football tournament is coming up.  If I wanted to put money on it, I would say there will be a great deal of advertising that should not really be tied in with the heroes, high-stakes physical activity and all the excitement and emotion.  Psychologically, all of that gets transferred onto the brand.  There is a reason they want to advertise during these events &ndash; it is not only because of the large viewing numbers.</p> <p>  It is certainly about identifying when children are watching television and taking the advertisements out of those times.  It is sometimes considered politically unpalatable because those times are when many other people are watching television as well, including adults.  However, I believe we have reached the point when we need to consider how we protect children and future generations rather than considering whether we are facilitating certain kinds of marketing activity.  That is one point.</p> <p>  The other point relates to nutrient profiling.  This is where it gets technical and it relates to the way we decide whether something should be advertised.  It is a question of how we classify food and how we decide whether it is healthy or less healthy.  The model we use in Ireland is derived from the UK nutrient profiling model.  Studies have shown that model is very weak in terms of deciding on whether we should advertise certain products for children.  In the study, we used the World Health Organization nutrient profiling model that was developed subsequently.  It has been rolled out in Slovenia and other places.  We found that of all the food advertisements watched by the children, half related to unhealthy food because the children were watching at times not scheduled for children's programming.  However, when we classified the advertising by the WHO criteria, the figure jumped up to 75%.</p></speech>

There are weaknesses in the legislation.  The two key weaknesses I see relate to the definition of children's programming.  Really, we need to target children's viewing.  It is really about what a child is seeing rather than where the advertisements are being placed.  The other part relates to nutrient profiling.  If we are stricter in these areas, then we take more products out.  Something that came through strongly in the study was how many brands that we generally associate with unhealthier eating were leading with advertising for healthier items.  This might be a fast food company advertising water, carrot sticks or milk.  However, we know that when people go into those places, they have nuggets and chips.  The diet is completely different.  Some experimental evidence was produced by my colleague, Emma Boyland, in Liverpool.  It shows what happens when children view those advertisements with the healthy items.  Then, they are taken off to select things to eat.  They do not select the items advertised but rather the things the brand in question is generally associated with.</p> <p>  It is about understanding the whole ecosystem of the marketing and not only a specific advertisement.  The idea is to find where they are active in all the various areas.  It extends to brand marketing.  A great deal of advertising will be done using only a logo.  At this point, the logo is all a company needs &ndash; the logo is enough.  We have shown that at aged three years, children know what the logo is for.  Before children are speaking and before they know what it is called, they can bring a picture of the unhealthy item that the logo is associated with and put the two together.  As the Deputy noted, they are being reached before they know their ABCs.</p> <p>  Another thing strikes me from the talk today.  It has been really interesting to hear about the junior certificate.  We have a generational cascade that needs to be addressed.  The junior certificate students are future parents.  Food and food education in preschools need to be explored as well.</p></speech>

We had to get submissions in during the public consultation phase.  After the first public consultation phase all the information is collated and shared with councillors.  The chief executive officer then makes recommendations.  The recommendation of the chief executive officer to the councillors was that the objectives should be removed from the county development plan.  Alternatively, he recommended that if they were going to keep the objectives, then the distance should be taken out.</p> <p>  From our perspective, the whole idea of the no-fry zone was that we needed a distance set out.  There was a reason we found ourselves in this situation with a fast food application only 35 m from schools in Greystones.  The planning guidelines, although well intentioned, use terms such as "careful consideration" and "vicinity of".  They are open to interpretation and that is what happened.  There is a lack of consistency in planning at local level.  The chief executive recommended that the objectives should come out.  We countered that by providing councillors with all the information and the evidence we gathered from the studies in the USA and Scandinavia.  We supported this with all the submissions from healthcare experts.  The councillors could see that this was the right step forward and that putting in a no-fry zone of 400 m represented the minimum distance required for it to be effective.  It was disappointing to hear the chief executive recommend that the provision come out.  Luckily enough, the councillors showed leadership and took a courageous step forward.  It was the first local authority in Ireland to do so.  The councillors and Wicklow County Council were recognised at the Association for the Study of Obesity on the Island of Ireland conference two weeks ago for taking that step and setting the precedent.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, since we are now at a stage where we are getting a little publicity, people are contacting us.  I was contacted by a person in Skerries last week because an application has gone in for a fast food outlet only 270 m from a school.  A lady contacted me this morning to say that an application has gone in only 150 m from a school.  They are looking for us to provide our experience and the knowledge we have gained through the process.  That is great, but we believe we should not be in this situation.</p><p>It is very clear that if the planning guidelines were revised to ensure that no fast food outlet could be located within 400 m of a school or all of the county development plans were changed, there would be consistency in local planning.  We do not have such consistency now, which is very frustrating.  People do not want fast food outlets in certain locations because they might not be appropriate and they do not know what to do and they are trying to get interested parties together to fight it.  That should not need to happen.  The evidence is very clear that if one locates fast food outlets close to schools, one will see an increase in obesity.  Children are then exposed to targeted aggressive marketing.  We are in the middle of an obesity crisis and unless we start taking decisive clear action now, the problem will get worse.  </p></speech>

It seems to be very common that people are weaning children on to solid foods far too early.  I would like the dieticians to take the opportunity of this platform to explain the reason that children will develop. </p></speech>

Without doubt, the evidence shows that breast-feeding is the best option for babies.  Traditionally in Ireland, we have not had a culture of breastfeeding.  It is now becoming more well established.  The latest figures are that 58% of mothers are breastfeeding in hospital, so they will initiate breastfeeding.  That drops quite dramatically when the mum goes home.  Problems can arise in the first couple of weeks and support may be needed but the supports are not there.  There will be one visit from a public health nurse but there are no daily visits to help.  Unless somebody has a mum, a sister or a friend who has breastfed, very often women can drop breastfeeding at that stage.  We know that at three months, the number of mothers still breastfeeding are down to 36%.  The target is to try to get that number up to 40% at three months.  That is the first issue.  We know that is the culture in Ireland compared with Scandinavian countries, where the initiation rate of breast-feeding is 98%.  There is a significant distance way to go.  That is something that is really important.  We know that infants who are breastfed for six months or longer have a 50% less chance of being overweight or obese at the age of nine years.  The evidence has shown that outcome when these children are followed.  That is not only because of social class.  We know that breastfeeding mothers tend to be educated to a higher level and also tend to be from a higher socio-economic group, however, we need everyone to be supported in breastfeeding.  That is really important.  Breastfeeding comes first and then weaning.  Traditionally, I would imagine that all present were weaned at three months of age as that was what was done.  One now has grandparents suggesting that such children be given something to eat because they are hungry or are crying.  Following on from that, the advice was to start feeding the child at four months, but now the WHO has pushed weaning out to six months.  This is due to the maturation of the baby's immune system.  The baby's immune system is poorly developed when the baby is born.  The reason that a baby is born at nine months is that the baby's head size can fit through the birth canal but there is a great deal of maturation that still needs to go on once the baby is born.  That is why breastfeeding is the perfect food for babies.  Exclusively breastfeeding up until the age of six months is now advocated and beyond that, the introduction of complementary foods.</p> <p>  It can get confusing because the information on some packaging of baby foods will say the product is suitable for babies from four months.  The guidelines from the WHO first said that breastfed infants should be weaned at six months, but formula-fed infants were being weaned at four months.  That caused a lot of confusion.</p> <p>  The advice now is to reduce the risk of allergy, because babies who are weaned too early tend to be at a greater risk of allergy and are at a greater risk of being overweight and of obesity because they tend to be overfed.  Another issue is that breastfed babies stop feeding when they are full.  One has no idea how much they have had.  That may cause a bit of anxiety for the mother because she is worrying whether the baby has had enough but that allows the baby to develop his or her own sense of satiety, with the baby tuning in to when he or she is full.  They are developing their own signals of feeling full.  If a baby is on formula, one is anxious that the baby finishes the bottle.  The baby may be full but the mum is feeling anxious because the baby has not drained the bottle.  There are lots of cues and a lot more going on, which is really important.</p> <p>  We need to get more mums to breastfeed, but I know it is difficult.  When I look back on my own experience, it was the support of friends and the knowledge that I was doing the right thing that helped me to stick with it during the first couple of weeks.  After that, it can be plain sailing.  It is during the first few weeks that support for breastfeeding mothers is critical.  If we could get the breastfeeding rates up, it would be phenomenal for children's health and for mothers' health as well, because it protects against breast cancers and various types of ovarian cancers.  There are lots of benefits to the mum from breastfeeding.  I agree that breastfeeding and early weaning are critical issues.</p> <p>  Dieticians are trained and know the evidence base behind it.  It is not based on an idea or a feeling but on scientific evidence.  As for any access to dietetic support, public health nurses are trained and have some contact with dieticians in the community.  The issue is to get support for mums and that is really important. </p></speech>

I remember when I had my own daughter in 2005, there was a big drive on then to get mothers to breastfeed and there were supports in the hospitals.  I wonder whether there are support groups in the maternity hospitals, such as breastfeeding clinics?</p></speech>

The lactation consultants are a significant resource and are very beneficial.  The gap is around the appropriate weaning age.  One has the support at the initial stages but six months in, when it comes time to start weaning one's baby, the knowledge gap kicks in at that point.  The resources might not be there for the mother at that point.  The public health nurse might not be there.  The HSE has a programme, the Nurture programme, which is part-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies.  I am sure members have heard of it.  Part of that involves community dieticians training other healthcare staff to give evidence-based nutrition advice to support appropriate weaning and to support appropriate menu development and cookery skills for mums in the community, so that when a mother weans her baby, she is weaning him or her on to a good diet.  That is really important.</p> <p>  Last year we put in for nine community dieticians in the Estimates, one per CHO to support these programmes.  These are the kind of initiatives where &euro;500,000 makes a major difference when it comes to implementing these programmes.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of marketing and packaging of products for young children.  If one has to go to a shopping centre and bring the children, it is painful because everything is bright colours and novelty shapes.  Do the witnesses have recommendations on the packaging of products aimed at children?  Is it achievable in an Irish context?</p></speech>

I can think of some orange and cola drinks in particular.  They do not sell the sugar sweetened drink in Ireland any more.  They might have stock left but they are not importing or manufacturing it.  It had a very significant effect, never mind the secondary effect that it is a taxation measure that raises money to invest into other areas within healthy eating programmes.</p> <p>  As for what Deputy Mitchell said about packaging, is there a key to doing something about it?  We have done a lot in this State in terms of having been the first to introduce certain environmental measures. </p></speech>

I love to think of the smoking ban at these times.  I was here when it was introduced.  I am sure that everybody remembers the chat at the time, when everybody was saying that it will never happen; nobody will ever stick to it in the pubs.  Then there was that phase when everybody was smoking more because they were going outdoors to smoke, because the craic was outside.</p><p>It has radically changed the socialising environments for people who work there.  The sugar tax is a perfect example.  Legislators need to be brave and say that there are some things that matter too much to allow things to stay as they are.  A great deal of lobbying goes on and many economically threatening statements are made by certain interests warning of dire consequences.  My vision is that Ireland is a food island, and we should saying that we will make some radical changes to create healthy environments where we are not exposing children and their parents to marketing techniques, which we know are effective and lead them to dangerous practices.  </p><p> There are standard practices in Ireland, including the Friday night takeaway for a family.  The birthday of every child in school is celebrated; if there are 30 children in a class that adds up to many birthday parties over the year.  All the relatives are invited.  There is a press or a bowl in each house full of chocolate bars and treats like that.  That is not anybody's fault.  It is nothing to do with people not having enough willpower; they are surrounded by a normative environment which tells them to do this, to be nice and loving to their children and respond to their requests.  Children ask for many of these treats and that they are prompted to do so by marketing. </p><p> People will say that this is impossible to implement and that it cannot be done.  However, plain paper packaging is bring introduced for cigarettes.</p></speech>

Ireland started the charge.  We might have been the second country to introduce this but we were the first country to come up with the concept.  Australia implemented it more quickly than Ireland did.  The tobacco companies spent almost $500 million in their fight against plain packaging, which was a concept started by Ireland.  Even more amusing, the industry has dropped the fight and is no longer pursuing it.  Plain packaging is coming in shortly.  It goes to show that sometimes a brave step is required.</p></speech>

Smoking is easy to deal with; the advice is that people just stop.  With food people can have a little bit.  Who defines what a little bit is?  Is it a little bit with lunch and a little bit after tea?  Is it a couple of biscuits at bedtime and a treat at the weekend?  That adds up to many little bits.  It is difficult.  Plain paper packaging on breakfast cereals would be a interesting concept to explore.  One can imagine the push back there would be on that.  Some changes will have to be made.</p></speech>

It was just plain packaging.  There was a lot of that in my house when I was growing up.  Perhaps that was a good thing, but it is not as prevalent now.  We are tackling sugar sweetened drinks, but there are also high content sugar products.  We have to start looking at those, particularly confectionery - I do not want to name particular products - which includes chemically sweetened chewy bars.  They are not chocolate or nougat; I do not know what they are made of.  Kids are buying many such products which are clearly not good for them.  By eating one every day, it is not a treat, it is normal, as has been correctly pointed out.  I am as guilty as the next parent in caving at least once a day to requests for crackers, cookies or lollies.  It is an issue we should start addressing in a meaningful way because it has become endemic in the first world.</p> <p>  A tax on high sugar content should follow the introduction of the sugar tax for sweetened drinks.  I recall the outcry, when I was in my teens, about additives.  The witnesses will remember when we all became aware of what E-numbers were.  An additive called E123 killed people, and it was in many products.  However, it disappeared quickly.  We can run with our over the counter, weirdly shaped and brightly coloured confectionery, as Deputy Mitchell correctly pointed out, but I wonder where we should go on this issue because there are so many of these products.  Marketing and advertising are key.  That is why I was interested in what Dr. Tatlow-Golden meant by loopholes.  She was not referring to a loophole, but rather a lack of direction in the standards.  They are antiquated and old and they have been run through like a juggernaut by companies marketing their products.  It is the job of companies to sell the product.  If Ms Tatlow-Golden had a choice, what would the next step be?  What measure would have a significant impact on the outcomes for children brought up in this State?</p></speech>

The situation is inverted at the moment; the food pyramid is on its head in respect of what is advertised and so on.  There will be many steps along the way to achieve that.  Those steps can be picked off, one by one, or we can think about more achievable goals we can start with.</p> <p>  Relatively simple measures could be taken, which we recommend in the forthcoming World Health Organization, WHO, review, such as targeting what children are viewing rather than programming targeted at children.  We should seek to have a nutrient profile model that restricts the foods that are advertised even more than is currently the case, even with its cheese derogation.  There should be a statutory rather than voluntary code for broadcast marketing.  The current code launched by the Department of Health is voluntary, and all the evidence shows that voluntary codes are not as effective.  It must be well monitored and a transparent monitoring mechanism must be defined in advance.  There are many parts to the code, and questions have to be asked about how they will work in practice.  Brand equity characters need to be dealt with, which are the characters which are not brought in from another programme but which are associated with the product.  Companies are really wedded to those for obvious reasons because they are powerful marketing tools.  We need to deal with brand marketing, rather than just marketing for foods.  These are difficult issues to address because companies will say that they need to reformulate and that they need space to do that.  Hard questions need to be asked about them.  </p> <p>  Information must be provided in schools and preschools.  I asked the St. Angela's College representatives earlier whether marketing is part of the junior certificate curriculum, and they said that there was not really any but that there was space for teachers to insert it.  It would be nice to develop, and I will talk to them about that.  </p> <p>  Ultimately, two actions must be taken.  We need to understand that choices are not made by people standing in a vacuum; they are made as a result of endless influences.  We have to do away with the language of healthy choices and come up with a different phrase, because it implies that the individual, as an agentic person, whether child or parent, can make all these decisions themselves.  We have to have a whole systems approach to this.  The no-fry zone initiative has to be a part of it, but the entire system has to be mapped and tackled from all angles, because it affects the parents as well as the children.</p><p>That will keep us busy for a little while.</p></speech>

The chief executive reviews all of the objectives and then makes recommendations.  His recommendation was that the no-fry zone objective, objective RT17, should be taken out of the Wicklow county development plan.  If the councillors felt strongly that it should remain in the plan, he recommended that the distance of 400 m should be taken out.</p> <p>  We were clear with the Greystones councillors that if the distance was taken out, the zone would be meaningless.  Our perspective was based on all the evidence we had obtained through the campaign.  We would have been back to where we had been with the national planning guidelines.  They are well intended but the wording is vague and open to interpretation.  That is how there can be situations where a council can say that it has given consideration to how close a fast food outlet is-----</p></speech>

There may have been other reasons for it that I am not aware of.</p> <p>  The most appropriate step I can take is to recommend the next phase of improving the outcomes for children and young adults in respect of their eating habits and learned experiences.  We have not even touched on issues that the committee has discussed in recent weeks such as the provision of space for a new or recent mother to breastfeed her baby with an element of privacy.  I acknowledge that does not even bother some women, which is great, because it is important that society not only accepts but embraces and supports breastfeeding as much as possible because there are so many benefits.  That has been eloquently outlined.  It is also important for the outcomes of the children involved.  However, not everybody can do it.  There is always space for a good rounded product that will support a child's growth and build his or her immunity system.  </p> <p>  We learn about so many things - and the witnesses have highlighted this - where parents, grandparents or the older generation are influencers because they think it is right when in fact it is not.  I have two children at home and I have never asked somebody to let me be the parent of my own child.  I have, however, witnessed it being said by others.  Perhaps education is providing people with the self-awareness to say, "Let me parent my own child, thank you very much", to people, or something similar  When it comes to breastfeeding, any expectant mother watching this or anybody ever put under peer pressure not to breastfeed, should just ignore people because they do not know what they are talking about.  They may have the best will in the world but they are wrong.  I find that frustrating.  It has come up before and Deputy Mitchell has given evidence on this before the committee.</p></speech>

Like everything else, mentors are needed.  A young girl having a baby may never have seen anyone breastfeed, including her sisters, not her mum nor her cousins.  It would not be at the front of her mind and that is because it is not the norm yet.  Breastfeeding is only being initiated by just over half of women.  We need to work on that because people need to see something to think of something.  Education plays a huge role.  Two thirds of people in Ireland are overweight or obese.  A person who has a normal weight is in the minority.  Active choices have to be made to not gain weight.  I refer to marketing, packaging, buy one get one free and portion size.  It is easier to gain weight. A person just grazing his or her way through the day will be overweight.</p> <p>  We used to look to America when I was studying nutrition.  We saw pictures of portions and said that is American whereas now it could be Irish.  We have the same portion sizes and the same obesity and overweight rates.  It is not possible to drive everywhere, sit and watch television every night, eat all these large portion sizes and not put on weight and then be a drain on the health service.  Dieticians know this.  We have learned all of this, it is not new to us.  It is the environment we are living in now and we really need to take action.  That involves planning decisions, exercising, marketing, nutrition and education.  We have all said that.  It is great to get an opportunity to talk to the committee because making decisions that will impact on the health of our children is important.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Hugh Kane, chairman of the Department's oversight group for A Vision for Change, Dr. Fiona Keogh from NUI Galway, a member of the oversight group, and Mr. Tom O'Brien, from the mental health unit of the Department of Health.  On behalf of the committee, I thank everyone for attending.  The format of the meeting is that witnesses will be invited to make a brief opening statement and this will be followed by questions and answers.</p> <p>  Before we begin I draw the attention of witnesses to the position in respect of privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members should also be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they cause havoc here.  I also advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I invite Mr. Kane to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I recognise the work the committee has completed thus far.  The members of oversight group, including me, have read with interest the two reports published by the committee. </p> <p>  As I indicated during my previous appearance, the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and the oversight group share many of the same concerns.  The work of the oversight group has, in the first instance, concentrated on assessing A Vision for Change, our national mental health policy, to determine what changes are needed to this foundation to refresh it in today's context.  While the term of this policy came to an end last year, many of its recommendations helped to shape our current mental health system and remain at the heart of effective and appropriate mental health services.  With this in mind, it was important to take a considered and staged approach to this work.  In line with the oversight group work plan, consultation is taking place will continue in the coming weeks and feedback will be incorporated into the final report.  This approach is similar to that taken by the joint committee, which has heard from different stakeholders over the course of its work.  It is with interest that the group has observed the insights provided by the committee meetings.  Our group will consider the stakeholder feedback in our discussions as we deliberate on how best to include it as we proceed. </p> <p>  My purpose this evening is to share with the committee the work of the oversight group of which I am chair.  While I am sure members are familiar with the context within which the oversight group was created, I will nonetheless begin at the initial stages of the group.  A Vision for Change was published in 2006 and set out a ten-year policy framework for Ireland's mental health services.  It recommended that interventions should be aimed at maximising recovery from mental illness and building on service user and social network resources to achieve meaningful integration and participation in community life.  It was welcomed as a progressive, evidence-based policy which guided the development of our mental health services towards a new model of service delivery, one which would be service user centred, flexible and community-based.</p> <p>  A Vision for Change highlighted many areas which were in need of increased attention in the shift from a service with an institutional focus to a community-based service, and many of the recommendations are still valid today.  However, A Vision for Change came to an end in 2016 and preparations for a review and updating of policy have been under way since early 2016.  The initial step was the commissioning of an evidence-based expert review in September 2016.  This looked at the implementation of A Vision for Change and how future policy and services could be improved.  The review provides evidence to inform the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change, both in terms of international best practice and the experience obtained since the adoption of the policy.  It presents a broad overview and mapping of evidence and developments in the mental health area that are helpful in guiding policy development and practice in Ireland.  Coincidentally, the report was published on the same day as the joint committee was established in July 2017. </p> <p>  In October 2017, the Minister for Health established the oversight group which was tasked with producing a high-level policy framework setting out future service priorities.  I was honoured to be appointed by the Minister to chair the group.  In considering the appropriate membership, it was decided to keep the group small, efficient and inclusive of leaders in the area to ensure a clear focus on the task of producing a refreshed policy in a timely manner.  The oversight group, in line with its terms of reference, is overseeing the development of this refreshed policy for mental health, based on the recommendations arising out of the expert review and other relevant contributing documents.  Work is scheduled to conclude in December of this year. </p> <p>  The oversight group engaged in a detailed consideration of current policy actions and recommendations.</p><p>It established a number of subgroups to focus on specific areas of attention, including child and youth mental health, the mental health of the over-65 age group and examination of policy outcomes.  The outcomes subgroup focused on how outcomes can operate as a paradigm shift within the system to work better and more efficiently and to serve the service user in a better way, drawing from existing research and practice.  The oversight group has determined that its work will have a focus on developing measurable outcomes within an outcomes focused framework.</p><p> An ecological framework will also inform the refreshed policy.  This approach focuses on both population level and individual level determinants of health and interventions.  It is acknowledged in much recent research that health is determined by influences at multiple levels, such as public policy, community, institutional, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors.  An evaluation of the current context and how that relates to A Vision for Change and other current mental health related policies was also deemed necessary.  This document examines whether specific actions have been implemented and, if so, to what success.  The evaluation also examines whether specific actions have been implemented through other policies in this area and considers whether actions are still relevant if they are not implemented.  I understand this is the document the committee referred to in its second interim report.  A preliminary report has been received and is tabled for discussion at the next meeting of the group which takes place tomorrow.  Following this meeting, the researcher will be asked to finalise the report.  When this final version is received it will be shared with the members of the committee.</p><p> I also note that the committee has referenced engagement with the Department of Health as an area for action in its second interim report.  As mentioned in my letter to the committee last December, the oversight group agreed to report further to this committee when the initial part of our deliberations was completed.  As members will have seen in the oversight group's work plan furnished to the committee in March 2018, these deliberations have taken place mainly within the oversight group up to this point.  While we have not been in a position to share working documents, I reassure the committee of our shared goal and the oversight group's ongoing commitment to this goal.</p><p> We are currently engaged in a stakeholder consultation process and we have just left the first advisory group meeting this afternoon.  For this part of the process two half-day meetings have been scheduled - one today and the other, which was due to be held in June, will be in September.  At these meetings we will gather input from mental health clinical experts who currently work in front-line services and service user representative organisations.  It has been important to the group that the positive aspects of A Vision for Change would not be lost.  The group is attentive to its mandate which is to complete a refresh of A Vision for Change.  The oversight group is working on developing a framework document that will both guide the stakeholder process and assist the oversight group to work within a shared vision.  Stakeholder feedback received is extremely important to us and it is hoped that all relevant information received will inform the recommendations in the refreshed report.</p><p> While the final domains have yet to be decided, it is anticipated that the following five domains will be considered: social inclusion and recovery; prevention and early intervention; access, co-ordination and continuity; improvement and innovation; and accountability and transparency.  Outcomes and specific actions will then flow from these domains.  Enablers that exist will also be explicitly recognised, as it is important to note what has contributed to the positive aspects of current service provision in order to ensure it continues.  Wider public consultation is also set to take place in Dublin, Cork and Sligo in August.  All of this feedback will be incorporated into the work of the group, with the group ultimately producing "an updated draft policy framework which sets out current and future service priorities within a time-bound implementation plan".  The feedback from these stakeholder sessions and the working document mapping recommendations against current context, alongside any other completed items of work, can be provided to the committee once available.</p><p> The oversight group acknowledges the good work completed by the Oireachtas committee.  In several of our meetings it was agreed that the existence of the Oireachtas committee was a very positive development because its work would assist greatly in ensuring that the policy refresh would have political support.  The oversight group is clear that the terms of reference ask it to focus on refreshing policy.  Policy determines outcomes for individuals in need of mental health support and shares a vision of what good mental health outcomes should be.  This differs from the work of the joint committee, whose focus is on service improvement, staff shortages and funding.  There is certainly a role for both groups and working together will result in a real shift in prioritising mental health in government, resulting in positive changes in policy and service provision.</p><p> Once again I thank the committee for inviting us to today's meeting.  I will be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

Before I call on members for questions I will address a point Mr. Kane made which I find somewhat disappointing.  He stated:</p><blockquote>The Oversight Group is clear that the terms of reference ask it to focus on refreshing policy. ... This differs from the work of the Joint Committee, whose focus is on service improvement, staff shortages and funding.</blockquote> <p>I have to clarify this.  The committee's remit is not to be a sideshow to a process taking place within the Department of Health to decide the future of mental health policy.  In its terms of reference this committee is tasked with reaching cross-party agreement on the direction of mental health policy.  We are, therefore, the primary body in existence for setting this agenda.  Our task is to provide a vision for the future of mental health care in Ireland and we will do that in our final report in October.  To be clear, I view this committee's remit as encompassing the oversight group's remit.  We are not working in two separate areas.  It is important, therefore, that the oversight group's work feeds into our work and that we are fully aware of the group's activity and the information available to it.  Otherwise we might find ourselves at cross purposes, and the oversight group's efforts will not be fully effective if they cannot be adequately reflected in our report.</p><p>The procedure now is that members will have seven minutes each to ask questions and receive responses.  I will start with Deputy Harty.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify the status of the oversight group.  I have looked at the membership and I note it is not entirely a HSE group.  It is an independent group with people drawn from many disciplines, including members of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and Dr. Shari McDaid of Mental Health Reform.  It is quite a broad group, not just the HSE.</p></speech>

He can see that there is a little tension between this committee and what the oversight group is doing.  We are trying not to overlap to a great degree but at the same time there is a lack of communication between the two groups.  I wish to clarify where the oversight group is coming from because Mr. Kane said in his opening statement that we were doing two separate things.  Will he outline the separation of those two functions?</p></speech>

Our terms of reference ask us to report back to the management board of the Department of Health.  Regarding how the group was chosen, we were looking for people with competencies in the area of developing policy and people with an understanding of mental health systems and how management systems work.  We identified a group of people based on those criteria.</p> <p>  I was before the committee last October just as we were beginning our work. I regret, and it is unfortunate, that there is a sense that we are doing different things and that we are not on the same side in terms of what we are trying to achieve.  The particular work we were tasked with in our terms of reference was to review A Vision for Change and to come up with a refreshed version of it.  The focus of what we are doing is on the next period, being cognisant of what happened previously and what is currently happening.  Essentially, that is what we were asked to do in our terms of reference.</p></speech>

Will the oversight group produce an interim report on how it is progressing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Kane" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018053000002#C00800"><p>Probably not, although we will produce outputs as we go along.  There are some ongoing issues.  One is that we are a voluntary group and all of us have other day jobs.  That mitigates against us being able to get together as often and to do work as required, so that is a particular challenge.</p><p>The focus of work during our first three meetings was deliberating on this complex area of mental health and what would be a good way to approach the development of a refreshed A Vision for Change.  We spent a good bit of time deliberating, thinking about and discussing among ourselves the direction in which we would go.  </p><p> When I was here on the previous occasion, I noted that the oversight group decided to take an outcomes-focused approach rather than focusing on outputs and that we would examine the issue in the whole other context I outlined.  Considerable thought and deliberative time went into that.  As we are an independent group whose members are drawn from many different backgrounds, we engaged in a considerable amount of discussion to reach consensus and agree on the best way forward.  In respect of trying to write a report based on that kind of deliberative approach, nothing really comes out of that because one goes through a process and we work as colleagues, share ideas, argue the points backward and forward and move on.  That took a particular amount of time.  </p><p> We were anxious to establish the current status of all the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  We contracted an external group to do that particular task.  Obviously, when we were trying to determine what was in and out of scope in terms of the work we were doing, we felt this was a fairly key piece of work.  We received a draft report in at the end of February on that work.  This identified what was finished, what was not finished and why it was not finished, what else might be missing and whether changes had taken place in other areas that we needed to add to our work.  We decided to hold that piece of work while we moved on to developing the overall framework we are using to look at the development of policy.  Again, in looking at that framework, we spent a good bit of time looking at other jurisdictions that have used an outcomes approach and the places where it has worked really well.  A few moving pieces are starting to fit together.  We are at the point where we have a draft framework into which we can build a policy.  That is what we consulted extensively on today with the people we met.  We will work on that kind of framework.  Tomorrow, we must finish the piece of work with the consultants who carried out the work on A Vision for Change to identify the gaps and the final pieces that need to be done.  Once that is done, that becomes an output and, as I said, we will share that with the committee.</p></speech>

What are the barriers to implementation?  We have been through this with the Sl&aacute;intecare report and we have identified barriers to implementation.  What barriers has the group found in its deliberations?  We have looked at three primary areas, namely, primary care, recruitment and retention and funding.  Perhaps Mr. Kane would like to comment on that.</p></speech>

Before we looked at other issues, the fundamental question for us was what we were fundamentally trying to achieve in the mental health services.  That is what we viewed as critical and it is where we focused.<br/><br/>Part of the issue with A Vision for Change was that when one looks at the original report, the first four or five chapters were where much of the vision and future thinking were set out.  The final chapters focused very much on the resources and inputs required to deliver the report.  In our judgment, when one reads any reviews of A Vision for Change, one can see they tended to focus on the resource inputs rather than the other cultural issues or different ways of working that have been implemented.  That has been our starting point.  We have not looked at inhibitors <i>per se</i>because we have been trying to identify particular enablers within the system that will enable this policy to move forward in a particular way.  That has been the focus rather than inhibitors.  </p></speech>

The group meets once a month, which means it has held about six meetings in seven or eight months.  For something so important, surely the group making important decisions on refreshing A Vision for Change should not be voluntary.  How much did it cost to bring in consultants to help the group?</p></speech>

Within that, the route we have taken is that we think that a future policy should really be outcomes-based.  Internationally, there is strong evidence that this is a good way of bringing about fairly fundamental reform and change in services, particularly in terms of the people who access services.  In terms of our particular piece of work, we are building a framework for the new policy that will look at things like the vision we are trying to achieve and the values that should underpin that.  We are trying to identify the key domains and areas under which we would group the particular pieces of work.  Underneath that, we are trying to identify the key actions that need to be taken to deliver that.  We are looking for enablers.  This involves multiple stakeholders.  It is across Government and many different stakeholders.  One advantage of using a framework like this is that once there is agreement on the outcomes we want to achieve, we are able to approach other colleagues and stakeholders to see what actions they need to take to deliver on the outcome that has been agreed at policy level so there is-----</p></speech>

We meet every single week and we meet stakeholders who come before us.  We are meeting stakeholders with regard to primary care, recruitment and retention and funding.  To be fair to the Chairman and the clerk, every week, groups of people appear before us and we sit for two or three hours.  The oversight group is putting structures in place.  This is where I am somewhat disappointed.  I thought the committee would be given feedback from the work the oversight group was doing every month so that we could hook on to its framework from the stakeholders that were appearing before us.  Was the request that this group would give us a monthly report not one of our asks last November?</p></speech>

I appreciate everything Mr. Kane has said.  As I said, a clear blue light has appeared but it is a pity the committee and the oversight group are not working in tandem.  While we are very different, we should be feeding back from our stakeholders.  The Psychiatric Nurses Association, the Irish Prison Service and service users have appeared before us.</p><p>The committee is doing good work but the oversight group is not seeing any of that other than what it sees in the reports we produce.  While the group is beginning to meet stakeholders is it possible that we could marry the stakeholders together to ensure outcomes?  We work best when we are working together.  How does Mr. Kane think we can support this process going forward, and how can we enable the group's outcomes for the next number of months while this committee is in place?</p></speech>

The witnesses have access to the committee meetings every week and access to those who give testimony every week.  We are baffled as to why the committee cannot have an interim report from the oversight group.  I apologise to the Deputy for cutting in on her contribution, but perhaps Mr. Kane will answer her questions.</p></speech>

The group's initial discourse was based on a consideration of issues, especially when the group was forming.  The first three meetings of the group were about trying to clarify its focus and be clear about the approach we were going to take, how we were going to do the work and what our main focus would be.  This is an important process given the different stakeholders involved.  Writing about that process could mean a two-line report.</p> <p>On the other work for A Vision for Change we were delayed a bit when we went to do it.  We felt it was critical to determining the scope.  We have made a quantum leap at this point in so far as we have that work on A Vision for Change nearly completed and we have done an international trawl on outcomes.  We have developed a framework that we will be happy to share with the committee.  This allows us to start to hang the pieces together.</p> <p>  The consultation process we are engaged in looks at the framework and tries to find out from people what are the most important outcomes to aim for, how should they be grouped and what are the best actions to do that.  When we have this information, we will be able to slot in and use much of the information gathered by us and the committee in a way that makes sense to us all.</p> <p>  We were involved in a great deal of thinking and discussion around stuff, and trying to present that when nothing was emerging.</p></speech>

I understand why there would have been three meetings and conversations where the oversight group was trying to find its footing, no different to ourselves here.  Other than Deputy Harty, who comes from a medical background, we are elected representatives.  The group has work to do to be our enablers so the committee can give the group indications for outcomes.  If I have one request from today's meeting, it is that the oversight group would forward its reports to the committee.  Perhaps the committee could focus on who is coming before it.  Ultimately, we want the best workable vision.  We are with the stakeholders as they come before committee.  The oversight group has the knowledge that the committee does not.  The group must share that knowledge with us to ensure the best outcomes.  It might eradicate any tensions but we have to work together for the best outcomes, particularly for the next six months.</p></speech>

It is reasonably well thought out but it is a work in progress.  We will have a committee meeting tomorrow.  The work on A Vision for Change can be shared with the committee as soon as it is completed.  We have a draft framework that we would be happy to share.

Traditionally, a consultation process would start with an advertisement in a newspaper and written submissions would be made.  We were particularly interested in hearing from people and their families who are in services and who have used services.  This process is often not as accessible in the same way as access to professional groups.  The idea behind going around the State is to invite people who are from that background, because it is important that we hear their voices and facilitate that discussion, along with others such as professional people, and other organisations and agencies that work in the area.  We hope to consult based on our framework, to try to get some support and some grounded suggestions from people.  We had our reference group meeting today and we plan to meet again in September.  We will schedule to have these three meetings around the countryside to-----</p></speech>

Dr. Fiona Keogh is looking at me now and thinks that I want to know why Galway was left out.  However, I want to know why the locations were not chosen based on the CHO areas.  Why was it not broken down that way?  Why were only three locations use?  I ask this because we talk about A Vision for Change and how it failed in Galway and the closure of St. Brigid's Hospital.  I would love the oversight group to meet people in Galway to hear how the loss of that service has impacted the area.  How was the decision made to hold consultations in three locations?  Why could an additional four meetings not be held to make the process all-inclusive?</p></speech>

Sligo was to cover the north and north west, including Cavan and Monaghan.  There are transport links to Dublin, which facilitated the east.  The Cork meeting could cover the south.  We had a discussion about whether to go to Galway and, on balance, we determined that Sligo would work better because it was nearer.</p></speech>

They were forthcoming and gave us their time.  I ask Mr. Kane to widen the consultation to ensure communities are not left out.  Using three locations is too narrow.  That is not a criticism.  Reference was made to the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, but Galway is one of the areas that has the required 22 CAMHS beds.  That is still not enough but that process needs to be reviewed.  I ask that the oversight group would link in with the Chairman on this.</p></speech>

That was the only reason.  Part of our issue when trying to come up with a work plan is that the group was in its formative stage and while we could have filled out a sheet, we wanted to make sure that we came up with a plan that we felt we could achieve and which was workable for us.  This was the motivation.  We were not trying to avoid talking to the committee or to keep out of the limelight.  We were in a phase of deliberation and consultation.  Writing a report based on that would not have been particularly helpful to the committee.</p></speech>

I am a little bit cross with the Minister because A Vision for Change had been reviewed and has been refreshed.  What is the next "R" in this process?

I am disappointed.  We are not here to pick on the witnesses but when other members and I approached the committee's work with a vision and a mission.  This was to be an implementation committee and that is why we have focused on interim reports and I am disappointed.</p><p>It was my view at the time, and probably that of others, that by running two parallel committees, they would never meet in the middle.  That is what seems to have happened over the past several months.</p><p> In his opening statement, Mr. Kane stated that in 2016, A Vision for Change came to an end but it had not.  We have had reviews and the next one will be to sex it up but it will not provide answers.</p><p> Mr. Kane spoke about evidence-based proposals.  We have had so many stakeholders inform the committee that they have an evidence-based proposal, namely, the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  By the way, today is its birthday.  We had the life experts in the Seanad tell us how the system is not working.  Mr. Kane said he is currently engaged in a stakeholder consultation process.  We will have to move away from consultation to implementation.  The experts are telling us that it is difficult to access mental health services.  Fancy information campaigns on TV and so forth can be run, but I am hearing day in, day out on the ground about the difficulties people have accessing mental health services.  The first point of access, GP services, are swamped.  One might not even get to see a GP now.  We should not have have more of these reviews.  Instead, we should have a committee such as this to take the first six pages of a report's recommendations and implement them.</p><p> Mr. Kane said in his opening statement, "While we have not been in a position to share working documents, I would like to reassure the committee of our shared goal and the oversight group's ongoing commitment to this goal."  It is ongoing because there are two planes flying parallel to each other and will not meet.  It is like asking a bank manage to cash a "Thank you" note.  I am not being disrespectful to the witnesses.  I am angry and disappointed with the Minister.  I was excited at the start.  I believed that if we could work together and achieve something positive, the people who would benefit would be those who needed these services most.  While there has been excellent work done since the committee started, the subs are warming up on the other pitch and might never get a game.</p><p> First, we need to achieve access the services.  We will hear about lack of staff and recruitment and retention.  If that is the case, then we should roll out pilot projects.  We know where systems are working well and where there are problems in the State.  I was recently at a meeting in Tipperary attended by 200 people who were protesting about the lack of availability of mental health services.  Up to 220 shoes were displayed at the meeting, each one representing somebody who had taken his or her life since 2012.  That is in one county.  Surely, that is a red flag and there should be some pilot scheme to address this.</p><p> Mr. Kane referred again to evidence-based proposals.  We have heard from all the experts and documents have been published.  Can we not ask the Minister to take a different view on this?  Can we not have an early intervention system to deal with a problem in a certain area of the country and then roll out it out in other areas?</p><p> There is a high incidence of cancer in certain areas which are then targeted.  There are high instances of youth suicide in certain places which are targeted.  In Dublin as many mothers and young women are dying by suicide as fathers and young men.  Surely, that has to be red flagged.  I am aggrieved that we keep talking about coming up with a plan but it is then claimed more evidence is needed.  The evidence is available.  We are heading towards a major crisis in mental health services.  There is a shortage of up to 500 staff in the system.  There will be 1,700 retirements in the next five years but there is no plan to replace them and begin a recruitment drive.  I do not mean to be condescending but I am trying to flag that we must be realistic.  If this is not working now, can we start thinking outside the box to implement a system that will work instead of just talking about it?</p></speech>

A service is operating every day that is reforming, making changes, supporting people as best it can and responding to issues.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about implementation.  The work with which we have been tasked is to design a mental health system that better meets the needs of the people.  That is what we are struggling with.  At the same time, we know there are challenges and issues every day that the delivery system is operating on.  Our work has a future focus on what might be a more efficient or effective way of delivering.</p></speech>

I am not trying to be disrespectful.  The oversight group and the committee are trying to predict and plan for the future.  We can predict that in the next five years there will be a massive shortage of staff.  In five years, we will ask how did it come to this and how can it be addressed.  Can we not nip this in the bud?  Can we investing in GPs and primary care now in order that in five years we may not have to provide for a crisis in secondary or acute care?</p></speech>

We have work to do on workforce planning, as well as on access to primary care.  I accept there are significant operational problems in the system.  As we are not involved in the day-to-day management and running of the service, we have been asked to take a different focus.  There are people working hard on the points the Deputy mentioned every day of the week.</p></speech>

I am blue in the face, however, from talking about documents which go nowhere.  A Vision for Change is 12 years old.  Psychiatric nurses were excited when it was first launched because we had an input into it.  However, it was realised it was just used as a fiscal scalpel towards services and not the rolling out of up to 70% of community services.  How can this be refreshed by the oversight group if its recommendations were never implemented in the first place?</p> <p>  I get disheartened because the issue rolls on with report after report with no action.  When we established this committee, we said it would be a committee of action.  However, it is just rolling on with talk and reviews.  I apologise if I seem to be giving out but it is frustrating and action is needed.  Earlier the Seanad debated the Seanad Public Consultation Committee report on children's mental health services, which was produced under the stewardship of the Chairman and we called for her Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2016 to be enacted as soon as possible to stop children being nursed in adult psychiatric units.</p><p>It is possible but there is no political will to do it.  That is an action that is doable but we are not even getting timelines.  There are lots of barriers but there is a significant amount of legislation that could be enacted.  I am sorry for ranting.</p><p> Professor Harry Kennedy from the Central Mental Hospital was here last week, along with witnesses from the Irish Penal Reform Trust and others.  He was of the opinion that we should scrap A Vision for Change but I disagree with him.  I do not think we have the right to scrap what is a decent document that requires implementation.  He believes the document does nothing to address the issue of prisoner mental health, the rise in psychosis among prisoners or the fact that our prisons are becoming our new mental institutions because of the closure of so many long-term mental health facilities.  I asked Professor Kennedy to be proactive and to write to the oversight group for A Vision For Change.  I also urge the oversight group to write to him.  He is a very able individual with some very useful ideas.  However, I urge the oversight group not to take up his idea of scrapping A Vision for Change and starting again because we do not have the luxury of the time to do so.  </p><p> A lot of research has been conducted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in collaboration with the Psychiatric Nurses Association, whose members have on-the-ground experience.  A study was published in recent years which showed that 73% of the recommendations in A Vision for Change had not been implemented.  I was very cynical when the oversight group was set up because I thought it signalled more of the same.  I hope that the oversight group is using the evidence provided by the aforementioned study as guidance in its work.  </p><p> I was quite impressed with the oversight group's work plan, which is just like the care plans that are drawn up in hospitals.  It identifies the problems, the objectives, the dates and how we will get where we want to go.  I would love to see all of the boxes filled out and ticked off.  There was a suggestion that five town hall meetings would be rolled out across the country, which I welcome.  I recommend the use interactive materials at those meetings and urge the oversight group to invite questions from participants and to get their feedback, either directly or through applications like Mentimeter.  It is important to reach out to as many people as possible.  Most importantly, I urge the group to hurry up and to carry out its work quickly.  </p></speech>

That is on our radar and I am glad to hear that Professor Kennedy has raised that matter with the committee.  We hope that our framework document will become fairly comprehensive over time, with a lot of detail included.  The document should have a beginning, a middle and end and we hope to take that approach.  In terms of our consultation, anything that we can do to make it smarter or better will be considered.  I thank the Senator for her suggestion in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018053000002#G00500"><p>I am dismayed at the lack of progress because every day that passes is another day during which people who need it do not get support.  We had fantastic presentations on prisoners and mental health from a range of different people recently. They described the scale of the mental health difficulties for people who are locked up, who have no safe place to be and who cannot escape their surroundings.  It was quite shocking.  Every time this committee meets a new group, we are shocked.  We had members of the Traveller community before us and were shocked at the statistics that they presented to us.  We listened to people who spoke about human trafficking and were shocked at what they told us.  These are not ordinary, small problems.  They are huge problems and the scale of the challenge cannot be overstated but the sense of stasis is overwhelming.    I have a number of specific questions on the work plan.  Action 8 refers to reducing the over reliance on prescription medication by increasing investment in counselling and talk therapies.  The response refers to the HSE having commenced "a service improvement initiative".  When one hears such a response, one feels that the issue of talk therapies has disappeared into a black hole.  The document refers to access to talk therapies being examined where clinically indicated.  We already have evidence and know that talk therapies are valuable in terms of helping people to address problems.  When I worked with the Simon Community in Cork we had walk-in therapy sessions with approved counsellors.  We did not get a penny for that service from the State but provided it using fundraised money.  We did not commence research with a view to producing a report.  People were coming to the sessions and disclosing historic abuse issues that they needed to address.  We did not tell them that they had to get sober first.  If they were inebriated on the day in question, we told them to come back the next day.  That service is still in place.  Simon did not wait for reviews or examinations.  I want a commitment from the oversight group that it will move forward on action 8.</p> <p>  In the context of action 22, the rate of mental ill health and suicide among Travellers is exponential, shocking and a disgrace to us all.  Again, we do not need more reports on this.  I see that nine grade 7 mental health service co-ordinator posts were created.  Are those posts all filled?  Are all of those co-ordinators in place?  They were being recruited in October 2017, as I understand it.  While to me, that is a bee in a bear's belly in terms of addressing the issues, I wonder if even that much has been done.</p> <p>  Given the exceptionally high rates of mental ill health and suicide among Travellers, including young people, the &euro;1.5 million in dormant accounts funding is no more than crumbs from the table.  While it is welcome, it is nowhere near the kind of concerted, mainstream effort and funding needed.</p> <p>  Action 27 refers to integrating mental health supports into the health programme for victims of human trafficking but once again we have mention of a review.  We are talking about people, mostly women, who have been trafficked into this country and who have experienced enormous trauma.  We had a presentation recently outlining the experience of trafficked women in particular.  What needs to be reviewed?  </p> <p>  While I accept the bona fides of the witnesses here today, it seems that we are dealing here with a cesspit of bureaucracy that is disconnected from reality.  We saw the same with CervicalCheck, where good people in the system were disconnected from real people.  Part of our job here is to listen to people and to connect with them.  The oversight group does not seem to be able to respond in a way that is not about reviewing or kicking the can further down the road.  I ask the witnesses to provide further details on actions 8, 22 and 27.  I also ask them to provide details on training.  Training is referenced in the work plan but how many people are receiving training?</p></speech>

It was fairly moving, as one might imagine.  We accept the witnesses have major challenges ahead in their work.  I am not long on this committee.  There is a credibility issue with the work being done because of the work already done but which has not been implemented.  That is a problem.  We are picking up from the groups coming in that the structures seem to be all over the place.  There does not seem to be great co-ordination.  Services seem to be dependent on where a person lives, so if gaps exist, something needs to be done.  I hope that is on the agenda.  It is wrong that if a person lives in a particular area, that person cannot access services.  The Ireland that allows such things should be gone, as far as I am concerned.  Similarly, if I do not come from a wealthy background, those services should still be available to me and my family.</p> <p>  Where do many of the families looking for that help go?  It is the biggest problem we face.  They normally go to politicians like us and we are probably the worst people to go to.  Some will go to their GP and so on but there is a gap in the knowledge.  These are simple problems such as who to contact at a service level.  The answers are not available to us so if they are not available to us as elected representatives, how can they be available to Joe Citizen?  These are the simple issues that could be life-changing for people.  I wish Mr. Kane well but as well as anybody like him on a committee, there is a major responsibility on the Minister to explain why the recommendations of predecessors were not carried out.  Before taking on a new role, Mr. Kane must be clear in his own mind that he is not wasting time and ticking boxes in the same way.  This committee is sitting down and coming up with recommendations but I hope they will not sit on a shelf.</p> <p>  This is not an attack but I am looking for a sensible way forward.  I hope more committees will adopt such an approach.  I am interested in Mr. Kane's views.</p></speech>

It is interesting as one of the pieces of work we commissioned was an examination of A Vision for Change to see what has been implemented, even partially, and what is still relevant.  We thought it was a fairly fundamental starting point for our work and it is something we have just completed that will be helpful.  All of us on the committee are interested in trying to make a difference and do something.  It is why we do this.  No more than the members, we get a bit frustrated and we want action for many reasons.</p></speech>

I take the role of independent chair very seriously and I want to ensure bias is not in the room, as much as possible, and everybody's voice is heard and contributions are valued.  No matter what group of people I bring to the room, we all have a bias.  As chair, my role is to be aware of potential bias and if somebody makes a point that I see as coming from a position of bias, I must challenge it.  There are many very strong and talented individuals in our group.  It will be open and challenging.  We will not have stuff going through on the nod and there will be much dialogue, discussion, disagreement and arguing of points.  As independent chair, we will evidence our independence and thought process in such a way.</p> <p>  The purpose of the work today and over the summer is to test some of the ideas in the process.  Just because somebody works or does not work in the HSE should not lead to the person being branded as not being an independent thinker.  As chair I can say I have a fantastic group of colleagues who work really hard and go the extra mile.  There are certainly enough people in the group to ensure that if there is a bit of bias, it will be sought out.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, who is assistant national director in community strategy and planning division with responsibility for services for older people.</p> <p>  I have provided a briefing note with my opening statement that outlines the current position and the actions being taken by the HSE to improve the current service model and to support the work of the Department of Health on the planned legislation and regulation of this service.  In this context the focus of my opening statement will be on some of the key issues involved.</p> <p>  The HSE National Service Plan 2018 provides for a little over 17 million home support hours to be delivered to 50,500 people at any one time within a budget of &euro;408 million.  This includes the support provided through winter measures for 1,170 people requiring discharge from acute hospital care to a value of &euro;18.2 million.  A further initiative saw 324 people being provided with home support services in the context of the recent adverse weather with a value of &euro;5 million in full-year cost.</p> <p>  Home support services for older people funded by the HSE are provided either by directly-employed home help staff or by voluntary and private providers who have formal arrangements with the HSE to deliver the services.  The type of support that is provided includes personal care and, where appropriate, essential household duties relating to the people's needs to maintain themselves in their own homes and communities.</p><p> With the approval of the Department of Health, from 1 January 2018 the HSE moved to a single funded home support service which combines home help and home care package services into a single service, namely, the home support service for older people.  For service users, the public and the health system, the services will be easier to access and easier for the public to understand.  Through the streamlining of application processes, there will be a requirement to make only one application and decision for home support services for older people.  Service users will also be facilitated to move to changed levels of service as their assessed needs change without the need for an additional application process.</p><p> Intensive home care packages are funded separately within a budget of &euro;9 million.  The service is being delivered to approximately 235 people at any time.  The majority of these people have been diagnosed with dementia and, therefore, have extremely complex needs.  They require bespoke combinations of services  based on their specific care plans.  Without such services, these people are more likely to be admitted to long-stay residential care.</p><p> There has been a significant investment of &euro;112 million in home support for older persons over the past three years.  However, demand for such services continues to grow as the population of those aged over 65 years increases.  As of 31 March 2018, there were 6,458 people assessed and approved for home supports, both new and additional, who were put on a waiting list for services.  The vast majority of these people reside at home.</p><p> The Department of Health is engaged in a detailed process to determine what type of home support scheme is best suited for Ireland.  This process will consider the future design of a scheme as well as the licensing or regulation requirements for these types of services.  The HSE welcomes this development and supports the introduction of future legislation in this area.  The demand for home support and its importance, as an alternative service to long-stay care, has grown considerably in recent years.  Similarly, the type of home support that is now required to meet the needs of the population is a more person-centered personal care model rather than the more traditional home help service of earlier years which was centred around household duties.  The development of this new service model, which is grounded in the national standards for safer better healthcare and which is sufficiently flexible to meet the more complex needs of an ageing population, brings with it challenges of ensuring that all providers are in a position to deliver a quality service and one in which the workforce is trained and competent to undertake the required duties.  As a result, standards of care supported by appropriate regulation are necessary to ensure that such quality care is provided and maintained and that governance and oversight are at a level to deliver this service safely and to the satisfaction of the recipients.  The regulation needs to ensure that providers can quality assure services to demonstrate that they meet the service users' individual needs across a range of headings such as, for example: the training and qualifications of staff undertaking the home support duties; the policies of the providers to deal with person centred care; the safeguarding of recipients of care; and the reliability of provision and suitability of the service.</p><p> The absence of a legislative-based scheme in the area of home support has been challenging given that the qualifying criteria for such services can only be based on the needs of the person.  There is no legal basis underpinning the scheme or means testing.  Also, account is not taken of other circumstances when deciding upon provision.  In the development of such legislation it will be important to ensure that there is equitable access and a firm funding basis for a new home support scheme.  We must also ensure that the requirements to have a timely and flexible approach to address the recipient's needs is maintained.  In legislating for home support, cognisance must be taken of other legislation that has already been enacted, particularly the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, so that there are no unintended consequences that could arise and that people are clear as to which scheme applies to their particular needs.</p><p> The HSE employs 6,300 home support staff in all areas outside of the great Dublin area and Wicklow, which includes the community healthcare organisations of CHO 6, CHO 9 and parts of CHO 7, and County Clare.  In recent years, the HSE, working with staff and their trade union representatives, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, has implemented a comprehensive modernisation and improvement programme to better meet the needs of service users and the staff delivering the services.  The details of these arrangements are outlined in the briefing note I have provided.</p><p> Section 39 grant-aided providers of home support services have traditionally provided supports with household tasks.  However, the majority have evolved over the years to deliver personal care as well as essential household duties in line with the changing needs of older people.  These providers are independent operators and they employ staff directly.  The HSE has worked closely with the voluntary sector to develop and consolidate the sector in order to ensure that appropriate, sustainable and well-governed models of service which meet the needs of service users are implemented.</p><p> As service provision has expanded, including via the emergence of private providers, the HSE has developed appropriate specification and standards for the delivery of services with an increased focus on person-centred care and support grounded in the national standards for safer better healthcare.  As part of this process, the HSE has engaged in a formal tendering process for home care services that are renewed periodically.  As well as ensuring value for money, these arrangements have also assisted in preparing the sector for future regulation of services and for the anticipated implementation of a national statutory scheme for home support in due course.</p><p> The HSE recently commenced a tender process for home support services to replace the 2016 tender arrangements.  The relevant documents were published on the Government's tender website.  As the specific details for the tender process are only available to those who express an interest in participating in the process and given that the process is live, I am not in a position to go into specific details on the matter.  However, I have provided an overview of the overall tender process and arrangements in the briefing note submitted.</p><p> The tender arrangement for 2018 will provide for the introduction of a consumer-directed approach to the delivery of home support as an additional mechanism of service delivery.  This approach will facilitate clients to choose - and to have more of a say in respect of - the days and times of service delivery.  Clients will have the opportunity to contact a number of approved providers in order to consider the services on offer.  To ensure quality of care, providers must be included on the approved provider tender list set up following the tender process and they must not charge rates in excess of the agreed tender rates.  Furthermore, the provider and the client must have regard for specific requirements identified in the HSE assessment of need.</p><p> In 2016, the HSE established a forum involving representatives from the - National Community Care Network, NCCN - the for-profit sector - Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI - and the HSE to discuss home support service issues and to inform the sector of future developments.  The forum has been a useful mechanism over the past two years for the sharing of opinions and addressing concerns.</p><p> The HSE is also recruiting staff to create audit teams across the nine CHOs.  These teams will have the skill set to audit service provision and ensure that the tender service specifications required of successful providers are being implemented.  An audit team is being appointed in each CHO, with an initial focus on external providers.  Thereafter, the teams will support HSE direct service provision to improve quality standards.</p><p> A capacity review was conducted by the Department of Health.  It identified that demographic changes during the period up to 2031 will see the population of those over 65 years of age increase by 59% and that of those over 85 years of age increase by over 95%.  The scale of these demographic changes, linked to the Sl&aacute;intecare recommended shift to community-based services, indicates that the scale of service developments required for home support will be in the range of between 70% to 120% by 2031.  Meeting these service development targets will require forward planning in order to ensure the availability of the workforce required to deliver the quantum of service and facilitate the training requirements of the workforce to deliver on the service standards, as well as the funding mechanism required to support it in the context of a new scheme.  There is a need to ensure that the oversight requirements necessary for such a comprehensive shift of service to the community is achieved safely and with the additional supports in primary care and other services that will be required.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018053000002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting HCCI to address the committee.  My name is Ed Murphy and I am a director of HCCI.  I am joined by my fellow director, Mr. Ed Crotty.  Ms Orlaith Carmody is our independent chairperson.  She sends her apologies for not being present.  She is fulfilling a long-standing engagement abroad.</p><p>Home and Community Care Ireland, which was established in 2007, is the representative body for private home care providers, with more than 70 members, employing an estimated 12,000 home carers and providing care to more than 20,000 clients.  Some of our members are locally owned and managed home care providers and others are Irish branches of established international home care franchise organisations.  As a consequence, some HCCI members have a network and exposure to international best practice.<br/><br/>HCCI is governed by a board of six member directors and an independent chairperson.  One of the greatest challenges facing our economy is our ageing population, as Mr. Healy said.  Every 15 minutes someone in Ireland turns 65 and every 30 minutes someone turns 80.  In light of the health service struggles with long hospital waiting lists and the Government&rsquo;s stated policy of removing bed blockers by promoting more care in patients' homes, there is an unprecedented demand for home care services.  According to the ERSI report, Projections of Demand for Healthcare In Ireland 2015&ndash;2030, demand for home care will increase by 50% in the next 11 years.  The Department of Health acknowledges that it is unable to keep up with demand.  Approximately 4,600 people are on waiting lists for home care, including new applicants and those waiting for additional hours.<br/><br/>While the fair deal scheme obliges the State to provide nursing home places for eligible people, home care is allocated on the basis of resources, which means many people take up a nursing home place because they cannot afford or access home care.  This issue was highlighted in the 2017 RT&Eacute; documentary, &quot;We Need to Talk to Dad&quot;, by broadcaster Brendan Courtney.  A poll carried out by Am&aacute;rach Research in light of the documentary found that 85% of people wanted to be cared for in their home.<br/><br/>On care workers, we estimate that 40,000 people are employed in home care across the public, voluntary and private sectors.  However, the sector is facing enormous problems retaining carers.  Owing to working conditions and a lack of professional respect we are faced with the impossible task of finding 25,000 new carers as a matter of urgency.  There is a global crisis in home care, with a recent BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; programme suggesting that 1 million new carers will be needed in the UK over the next five years.  This is confirmed by our partners in these markets.  Home care in Ireland is facing a crisis and urgent steps need to be taken now.  Currently, there is no regulation in the home care industry.  In the absence of regulation, HCCI is the only body that submits to independent auditors and operates a self-governing framework.  The HCCI approach is based on providing a fully managed, relationship and outcome-based home care service to every client who needs it.  Every client is professionally assessed and monitored on an ongoing basis.  Every carer is Garda vetted, trained, insured, managed and supervised, thereby ensuring the highest standards of care for the client.  In addition, HCCI believes it delivers value for money to the taxpayer and is committed to continuing this practice.<br/><br/>The immediate concerns of the industry, as identified by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, are a lack of regulation and standardisation of home care services throughout the country, which are urgently needed to safeguard the most vulnerable members of our society.  In light of this, HCCI is calling for the following measures to be adopted.  First,  we would like home care be provided on a statutory basis, mirroring the legal entitlement to funding for long-stay care available through the nursing home support scheme.  Second,<b></b>we would like the establishment of an independent authority, such as HIQA, to implement regulation and standards and to drive quality and safe delivery of care to home care clients.  Third, we would like a change to the current<b></b>HSE commissioning procedures to allow care workers operate a workable block weekly schedule, with travel costs included<b>.  </b>Many carers also need support from the Department of Social Protection.  Currently, if carers work just half an hour or one hour per day, as often occurs under current commissioning practices, they lose their full daily social welfare entitlement.  The rules regarding social welfare entitlement need to be seriously examined.  Fourth,<b></b>we would like the introduction of a national register of trained and qualified home care practitioners, which protects both carers and clients.  Fifth,<b></b>we would like the current budgets for nursing home care and home care to be combined.  This would enable the HSE to offer expanded home care packages to clients and the opportunity to live independently in the dignity and comfort of their own homes for as long as possible.  Sixth, we would like nationwide implementation of client-directed home care, CDC<b>.  </b>This has been successfully implemented in many countries and would involve offering a monetary contribution towards an individual&rsquo;s home care needs, allowing him or her to choose a provider, public, private or voluntary and to also choose their own person-centred health care plan and schedule, which gives much greater satisfaction levels, as evidenced abroad, and is a proven way of getting people out of hospital quicker.  All these points are expanded on in HCCI&rsquo;s position paper, which members will have received, and is additional reading material to this presentation.<br/><br/>HCCI stresses that recruitment and retention of workers is in crisis in the home care sector.  We welcome the opportunity to offer insight and to co-operate in bringing urgent change to bear on the legislation, regulation and commission of home care services to significantly expand the workforce.  We thank the committee for the invitation, which is particularly timely as the 2018 HSE tender for home care services is live.  Should these services be renewed under the existing arrangements, none of the recommendations we have set out to provide governance and significantly raise standards of service to vulnerable clients will be implemented for the next few years, thus deepening the crisis.  As public representatives, members need to be aware of this and do all in their power to prevent the situation from worsening.  Every citizen who is ageing, or who has a care requirement, should have the right to remain with dignity in his or her own home for as long as possible, which is what we, and every Oireachtas Member, would expect as a minimum standard for our own parents or loved ones.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Conor McCarthy.  We represent professional carers working in the industry.  We thank the committee for choosing to focus on the regulation of future planning in home care provision.  HCA and Carers Ireland was established in 2016.  We are a platform for professional carers and health care assistants to provide support, enable dialogue and share the experiences that they face every day in seeking to provide quality service.  This has proved to be an essential platform in combatting the isolation that many carers feel when working in this sector.  Currently, we have just under 16,000 members.</p> <p>  In 2011, the Law Reform Commission, LRC, recommended regulation of home care, and we are happy to support movement in this regard.  We believe a sector providing care needs to be regulated by an external body.  Our home care sector is in crisis.  Professional carers are leaving the sector every day, with precious few being attracted to replace them.  This exodus is reflected in the increasing waiting list for home care packages, which currently stands at more than 5,000 people.</p><p>Carers are used inefficiently, as they often work with several providers and cover large geographical areas, resulting in them spending large amounts of their time travelling rather than being with the clients.  Considering the demand coming down the tracks, the situation is even more worrying.  The recent ESRI report on the future demand for healthcare predicted an increase of more than 50% for home care over the next 12 years.  The recruitment and retention problems, which both the for-profit and not-for profit sectors are facing, together with their inability to meet demand, have many serious consequences for people needing care and for our health sector in general.  First, the high turnover of carers that providers are experiencing has serious consequences for the quality of care they provide.  Continuity of care is one of the principal tenets of quality home care and if the carers for people are changing every few months, the quality of care will be seriously affected no matter how much supervision or governance is in place.  Second, if we do not have capacity in home care, this increases the pressure on our hospitals and results in more delayed discharges and a huge drain on the health budget.  It also pushes more families towards residential care under the fair deal scheme, which is generally not their first choice.  Most people's first preference is to continue living independently at home for as long as possible.<br/><br/>The reasons for the severe shortage of carers in the sector are many, but there are two principal ones.  The first is poor employment conditions.  On average, professional carers are paid &euro;11 per hour for contact time with clients while many get no travel expenses.  This appears to be a pittance given that providers are generally charging &euro;26 per hour for their services.  While we understand that there are costs to be covered, these margins are excessive and are putting too much money into the pockets of the providers.  They say that the HSE needs to change how it commissions care for them to improve carers' employment conditions.  This is just passing the buck.  The published accounts of many of these providers show a high return to the owners in comparison with what they are paying their carers.  The required change has less to do with HSE commissioning and more to do with profit.<br/><br/>The second reason is that there is little guarantee of work.  Most working carers are on if-and-when contracts.  This means carers have no guarantee of work and no visibility of earnings to allow them live a normal life where they can plan ahead for holidays and mortgages like the rest of society.  These type of contracts enable providers to treat their most important asset, their carers, as a variable cost to be turned on and off at their whim.  With increasing waiting lists for home care packages, there is no lack of demand or worry about where the next client will come from.  What is the justification for not giving carers guaranteed hour contracts?<br/><br/>To address the capacity crisis and make caring an attractive career, the employment conditions of carers, principally their pay, must radically improve first.  This is not so much a need to increase funding but rather to ensure that more existing funding goes to front-line workers and not to the company owners.  A happy, well-rewarded carer is the best guarantee of quality home care provision.  Providers will not give up their attractive profits easily and, therefore, they must be encouraged to do so.  Unfortunately, the recently published HSE home care tender missed an opportunity to insist on a minimum wage for carers who provide HSE-funded care.  In the absence of this, why can we not have a joint labour committee for home care that sets and regulates what carers should be paid?  Another way of encouraging providers to treat their carers better would be by giving clients the choice of either a commercial provider or directly employing their own carer using the same State funds in a tax compliant manner.  Providers talk a great deal about governance and supervision issues when discussing carers working directly with families, but they forget to say that because of their poor record in retaining carers, their supervision is carried out on a different set of carers each time.  Continuity of care is perhaps the most important component of delivering quality home care.<br/><br/>Second, many carers are limited by our rigid social welfare system and are prevented from taking on more hours for fear of facing a sharp drop in benefits.  Why can we not make the system more flexible and move from one that only considers the number of days worked to a total hours-based system, and which tapers the drop-off in benefits in order that carers are encouraged to take up more work?<br/><br/>Third, carers must be paid for travel time as well as travel expenses.  We must enact in Irish law the European court's ruling in the Tyco case whereby mobile workers with no fixed place of work such as carers are paid from the moment they leave their homes.  Carers should also be paid for the wear and tear on their cars.  These changes would encourage care to be delivered locally.<br/><br/>Fourth, the number of 30-minute visits to those cases where there is a compelling clinical reason must be limited<font color="#008250">.  </font>Currently, 30-minute visits are used to spread the home care budget.<br/><br/>Finally, the training and upskilling of carers must be funded.  Currently, providers do not pay for carers' training.  Carers are expected to fund their own training.  The State must set up a fund to pay for carers who wish to upskill and progress their careers.  The fund should not be channelled through providers but directly to carers themselves.  Carers need to be able to see a pathway of career progression through upskilling.<br/><br/>In summary, regulation in home care provision is overdue.  External monitoring is required to ensure standards are met.  Caring should be made a more attractive career, which will allow the sector to participate fully in the overall health sector.  The power of providers must be rebalanced in respect of carers.  The best way to do this is by the HSE truly valuing front-line workers by ensuring more funds find their way to the carers and offering choice to families regarding the care they receive.<br/><br/>I welcome any questions from members.</p></speech>

Before calling on members for their questions, Ms Metcalfe raised the 2011 LRC report.  On foot of that report, I published the Health (Amendment) (Professional Home Care) Bill 2016.  It has been debated in the Seanad and has gone to the Department of Health for its consideration.  I understand the Department intends to deal with the legislation but I am not sure of the timescale.</p> <p>  A number of members have indicated that they wish to ask questions and I will call three at a time.

They are welcome.  We are all singing from the same hymn sheet, which is that it is important that people remain in their homes for as long as possible.  I acknowledge the work done by carers, both those who are paid to do it and the family members who provide care out of love.  It is important to remember all of them today and to acknowledge their work.  It is also important that carers are looked after in order that they are in better form and better health to care for the people for whom they provide care.</p> <p>  Ms Metcalfe said that professional carers are rapidly leaving the system.

Why are systems not being put in place more quickly to ensure the health service can cope with this?  Staff turnover is high.  Can this be addressed as a matter of urgency, especially as it has been advised that continuity of care is of the utmost importance?</p><p> Mr. Murphy has advised that 25,000 additional carers are needed without delay.  Where did he get that figure from?  What efforts are being made to regulate this sector?  What are the immediate differences between the work ethics and practices of private and public sector workers?</p><p> Mr. Healy has cited figures pertaining to the services that are offered.  Other speakers have highlighted alarming deficiencies in the system.  Is there a big disconnect here?  Given that intensive home care packages are treated separately, is it wise to combine home help and home care packages?  At a time the demand for home care services is increasing, surely additional investment in this vital sector is needed, particularly as it brings about savings for the taxpayer and takes pressure off the hospital system.</p><p> The Acting Chairman has alluded to the 2011 recommendation of the LRC that there should be regulation.  In the opinion of the witnesses, what has been done to achieve this?</p></speech>

There seems to be broad agreement on the need for regulation, although people might differ on the details of the implementation of regulation.  All three bodies have said that regulation is needed.  If I understand the HSE correctly, that is under way.  However, it needs statutory underpinning.  The first of the three issues about which I would like to hear the views of the HSE officials is the question of conditions, pay and retention.  Do they agree that the current wage is too low?  What does the HSE pay directly employed carers?  How does that compare with the private sector wage?  Do they agree that there is an issue with retention?</p> <p>  My next question relates to public access.  It is obvious that waiting lists are high.  Would the witnesses be able to provide some figures with regard to the increases in waiting lists over recent years?  I would be particularly interested to hear about the equality or inequality around the country.  Is the mismatch between supply and demand growing?  How does it fare by geography?</p> <p>  We have heard evidence from the other two bodies with regard to costs and efficiency.  It sounds like there are big opportunities to use carers more productively.  If we ask a carer to drive a long distance to provide half an hour of care in one house, before asking him or her to drive a further long distance to provide another half an hour of care in another house, that is not a clever use of that person's time.  I ask the witnesses to give their views on that statement.  Do they agree that we have a big opportunity to get this right?  If we use carers more efficiently, as part of that we will make their jobs more rewarding.  I imagine it is deeply frustrating for a carer to spend half an hour with someone and then have to drive a long distance to spend another half an hour with someone else.  Will the officials give the committee an indication of how much money is required?  It has been suggested that &euro;408 million, along with an additional &euro;9 million for the intensive packages, is needed.  How much money is required to meet current demand?  How much money would be needed in next year's budget to get these waiting lists down to zero, or whatever low amount is a normal amount within the system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018053000002#J00800"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  I would like to ask about the extent to which the HSE can become involved in ensuring there is a supply of trained personnel for caring purposes.  The public and private sectors both provide the service in different formats.  To what extent have comparisons been made between the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of service from both sectors?  To what extent is this monitored?</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to comment on the merging  of the budgets for the nursing home and home care sectors.  I assume that will cover the administration of both private and public home care providers.</p> <p>  Is any vetting done to assess the suitability of people who come into the caring sector?  A nurse or a former nurse will be trained and will have a vocational commitment.  What efforts are being made to assess people who are coming into the public and private sides of the caring sector for the first time?  I ask that question because I want to ascertain how much job satisfaction is going with the job.  If the person who is providing the service is satisfied with his or her job conditions, he or she will be in a better position to provide a satisfactory service.</p> <p>  I have asked about costs, efficiency, effectiveness and quality.  I also want to know about the comparisons that have been made and about any matters that become obvious in the course of service provision.  Where do the majority of staff come from now?  Where does the HSE get its home care staff?  From what walks of life do they come?  I am aware that people of different nationalities are available and helpful.</p> <p>  A valid point was made about social welfare.  There should be a meeting of minds.  Those who hold responsibilities in both of these areas should certainly meet to ascertain the extent to which the provision of this service can be dovetailed with the maximisation of the availability of people who are on part-time social welfare.  This can be done effectively, efficiently and without overlapping.</p> <p>  It is important for the regulations that apply to the public and private sectors to be equal.  The same standards must apply to the quality of the people providing these services as well.  There much be some consistency in remuneration.  If we expect the job to be done by one group on the cheap, and in a different way by another group, we will create discontent.  If people feel aggrieved in the workplace in the course of their work, they will not provide the service we desire.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the degree to which the provision of public and private services is affecting the demand for places in private and public nursing homes or public hospitals that cater for people in this age group.  To what extent has it been noticed that this is happening?</p></speech>

The first question that was asked related to why carers are leaving the sector.</p><p>Carers are staying in Ireland, from what we see from our members.  They are leaving the sector and may be moving on within the HSE because they see it as a better role which is better paid.  They are leaving to go where they can get full-time contracts with better prospects which allow them to pay their rents.  A lot of them are leaving because as the economy is growing a lot more jobs are becoming available.  They are seeing jobs advertised which pay &euro;14 or &euro;15 an hour.  There are better conditions.  There are many reasons they are leaving.  The biggest things is if-and-when contracts.  People cannot plan their lives if they are working if and when they are wanted for work.  The other thing is that carers are expected to use their own transport to drive from one client to the next.  They get no expenses for it.  Some carers say their entire wages go on their car.  They have nothing left to live on after they have paid for their cars.</p><p> One thing that has come to light recently with many carers is they are applying for a lot of jobs.  They are preparing themselves.  They are going for the interview.  They have to pay for their Garda vetting when they go for interview.  It usually costs around &euro;20.  Then they go for induction training and they have to pay for that also.  That will be taken out of their wages when they start working.  A lot of them are not even getting a job after all of that.  Why are employers putting carers through all of that?  What is the reason for it?</p><p> One of the other big things is communication.  There is very bad communication between the carer and the employer.  That comes up with us time and again.  It is one of the biggest things.</p></speech>

I will go to Mr. Ed Murphy now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.416" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018053000002#K00900"><p>The question was about where we will get 25,000 carers.  Ms Metcalfe has covered a number of elements of it.  In terms of where we will get them, changes in social welfare rules would mean somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 people could be brought back into the sector.  In the agricultural sector, there was a possibility of being able to get more people into the country.  About 30% of carers are foreign nationals.  We need to open up the possibility of getting more into the country and we need to make it easier.  There is no question about it.  That will certainly increase the supply of carers.  Ms Metcalfe made the point about how commissioning done at the moment with half-hour shifts or one-hour shifts and no pay for travel is an issue.  It is a job that should be attractive and wonderful.  The people doing the caring are wonderful people.  I agree they are not being valued in a number of cases.  They are not being trained properly in a number of cases.  They are not being supported in a number of cases.  Regulation is very necessary to make sure all carers are properly respected.  More training and support is required.</p> <p>  Home care has a vital part to play in the overall healthcare continuum.  In other countries, home carers are moving up the ranks in terms of providing healthcare, but that needs training.  If, with the aid of technology in the home, not only home care but home healthcare is provided, that can greatly influence and contribute to the overall healthcare system, but that needs investment by providers, companies and the HSE.  It will give better jobs to carers.  To go back to Ms Metcalfe's point, with current commissioning of half-hour and one-hour shifts and travel, there are huge inefficiencies and it does not allow block contracts which would keep more people in the industry for longer.  That is very important.  Regulation in all its forms is very much required.</p></speech>

I am based in Dun Laoghaire and we have about 100 carers working for us.  I will make a number of observations.  There has been talk about the contracts for carers and the way carers are employed using flexible contracts.  Many providers offer guaranteed hours, including us.  Not everyone is treating it the same way and most probably do not.  We certainly offer that where it is appropriate.  It is important to remember that many carers want to work in a flexible way.  Caring suits people who have 20 or 30 hours a week to give.  They may not want to work in a nine-to-five type job and that is why they are carers in the first place.  It is important not to lose sight of that flexibility.</p> <p>  In our company we pay for training and the QQI qualifications.  We also pay for carers to come to induction.  They are a number of clarifications.</p></speech>

Deputy Murphy O'Mahony mentioned a number of things.  It can be gleaned that there is a challenge for us in maintaining and developing the workforce into the future.  That is the biggest challenge.  One of the underlying issues over recent years is that we have invested &euro;112 million on the public side over the past three years.  We have increased the workforce.  There is &euro;408 million.  About &euro;200 million is the HSE.  There are 6,300 people working for us as an employer and we are running home care services.  The private sector runs about &euro;120 million of that, which is about 30%.  The voluntary sector is about &euro;80 million of that.  We have been growing the sector in recent times but we have come close to full employment in Ireland and therefore we are now in competition with many other businesses like McDonald's, community hospitals, the health sector generally and private providers.  There is competition for care staff.  That is a significant issue.</p> <p>  A lot has been done by the HSE itself and I have set that out in my briefing note.  Working with the trade unions and under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission a lot has been done to develop the contract, to make the job more fulfilling for the staff and at the same time to bring the standard up to FETAC level 5 so that the care for the individual is good.  That is important.  There is a challenge facing us.  We have to work collectively to try to address that challenge into the future.  Looking to 2031, we could require between 70% and 120% growth in home support when we take account not only of the needs of home support itself, but the shift to primary and community care called for in Sl&aacute;intecare.</p><p> That will require significant resources.  It will also require proper training and investment.  This also plays into the regulation.  We are all agreed that there should be regulation, as Deputy Donnelly has said.</p><p> Deputy Murphy O'Mahony specifically asked about the regulation.  The Department has indicated that it is preparing the ground for regulation.  It is receiving consultation on the statutory scheme, regulation and licensing.  The Department has responsibility for driving that.  We are supporting the Department, and it is actively engaged in that.  We expect that over the coming months it will have the output of that ongoing consultation.  That will be valuable in addressing how we move forward on regulation.</p></speech>

One other important piece is the forum we established, which I referenced, consisting of representative organisations such as the voluntary sector organisations, the private sector and the HSE.  Mr. Fitzgerald chairs that process.  We have been working with those groups collectively to address many of these issues and to see how we can work collaboratively, each within our own remit, to progress this over time.  That is an important thing to say.</p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Donnelly on the conditions of employment, obviously there are different conditions in the three components of the sector to which I have referred.  As an employer, the HSE pays rates of around &euro;18 to &euro;20 per hour.  There are contracts.  Deputy O'Reilly will remember from a previous role that we spent several years working with SIPTU to improve the conditions for HSE workers in the sector.  Significant progress was made on that over a period of years, with the benefit of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, as it is called now.  There is still more to be done on that, but in my briefing note I have referenced the progress that has been made, which is significant.</p> <p>  Part of what Deputy Donnelly was saying was that there must be a balance.  On the one hand, we need a flexible service that is responsive to the needs of service users - the people we are serving.  If we do not have a contract that works for the staff as well, however, we will obviously run into difficulties around continuity of service and so on.  It is important strike that balance.</p> <p>  On the private side, we tender for services.  While there is not regulation, we have set out a standard of care that has to be achieved.  I have referenced that and the themes that we use.  Those themes are drawn from the national standards for safer and better healthcare outlined by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  We are drawing on what we hope will be the regulated system in the future, and we reflect that in our contracts with private providers.  We set a standard that has to be delivered.</p></speech>

We have been formally maintaining a waiting list for between a year and a half and two years, collected throughout the country.  It is ever-increasing and currently has just under 6,500 people on it nationally.  A question was asked about whether it varies from one area to another.  It does, somewhat.  The north side of Dublin city, community healthcare organisation, CHO, 9 has one of the largest waiting lists at approximately 1,400 people.  The Galway, Mayo and Roscommon area is at a similar level.  There are also waiting lists in the urban areas.  West Dublin, CHO 7, has significant waiting lists, as does CHO 8, which covers an area from the midlands up to north-east Dublin.  They are the largest.  However, they are all carrying significant waiting numbers.</p></speech>

We are collecting information on people who are waiting for new service, that is, they have no service at the moment.  We are also collecting information on people who are seeking additional service.  We are combining those figures for this purpose.  Different levels of resources are available from one location to another.  The other piece of it is that provision takes a different format from one location to the other where assessment processes are concerned.  They are factors that might be considered in a scheme that would bring some kind of co-ordinated approach.</p></speech>

On a positive note, we are quite successful in doing that.  We are talking about providing this type of service to individuals in their homes, sometimes twice or three times a day, at a very high level of personal care in many cases.  At any given time we are supporting 50,500 people.  That is a fair representation of it.</p> <p>  The second piece is important.  Over recent years, as we have assessed of the number of people who, due to demographics, may require additional places in long-stay care, we have not seen that reflected in the number that end up going into long-stay care.  One of the factors supporting that has been the increase in the funding provided for home support in recent years, particularly during those key months in winter when we target people who are coming out of hospital after an acute spell and require home support.

The nursing home support scheme is a stand-alone scheme and has been so for a number of years and has worked its way in as a model of service of support of people needing long-stay care.  It supports 23,500 people with high-level requirements at any given time.  The point we would make is that we would like to see a scheme that would be an alternative to that, an attractive scheme, that would maintain people in their own homes.  They would be two quite distinct schemes but they would have to work closely together.</p></speech>

The waiting list of 1,400 in CHO 9, which is my area, was mentioned.  I would be interested in the witness's view as to whether the unacceptably long waiting list in CHO 9 has any relationship to the drop in the number of nurses in the community because since 2007, we have seen a significant drop in the number of nurses in my area.  It is a parochial question but it is a broader issue.  Is there any relationship between the cut in the number of nursing staff and other staff in the community and the length of the waiting lists for home support?</p> <p>  I would like to make a broader point.  There is a registered recognised trade union that represents home helps and home carers but it is not here.  An opportunity should be afforded to it, as the registered body, to speak on behalf of those workers.  I understand it has written to the committee.</p> <p>  I have a particular view on this matter and, as Mr. Healy alluded to, I had some involvement in representing home helps before I was elected.  My view, which is formed from talking to people in my family and in my community, is that the people who are availing of this home care want to be cared for by people who are being treated decently.  These people need care and they want to stay in their homes but they want to know that the people who are caring for them are treated with some dignity and respect.  When we have representatives of the private sector coming in and saying they want changes to the social welfare rules, that, to me, speaks to a race to the bottom as regards terms and conditions that I do not think is helpful for the development of a service that we all agree needs to be developed.</p> <p>  In respect of the terms and conditions of employment, and Deputy Donnelly asked a question on this, I have a view as to what is enforceable.  Maybe Mr. Healy might be able to elaborate a little more as to what is enforceable as regards the contract.  There is no joint labour committee, JLC, for home carers, but there is an accepted rate for the job.  I would argue that it should be the rate struck by the HSE.  My understanding is that is a million miles from the rate that is paid in the private sector.  Maybe we could get some information on the difference.  In terms of the contract the HSE has for outsourcing work - the two witnesses will be very familiar with my views on this - there is nothing specific in the terms and conditions on it other than that which is set down in legislation.  The only obligation on private sector employers who are clearly in this business to make money - that is their responsibility - is to pay the minimum wage.  As long as they are doing that, they are fulfilling the terms of that contract.  Are there any plans to put some terms and conditions in it that would be helpful to the workers?  I have never heard any value-for-money argument advanced that convinced me in terms of directly employed versus privately provided home help services being better value for money.  If I am wrong on that and if the value for money argument can be made, I would ask that the witnesses might elaborate on that.</p> <p>  I am interested to know if anyone has undertaken any kind of a survey of the workers, about whom we are talking, and what the results of it are.  Ms Metcalfe, as a representative, might outline in what capacity she represents workers.  What are the rules of the association?  How do people feed into the organisation and how does that representation work?  It would be helpful to me, as a former trade union official, to understand that.</p> <p>  On the variation in the provision of service, there is clear variation geographically.  Maybe Mr. Fitzgerald is the right man to answer this question but is there any correlation between where carers are directly employed, or are predominantly directly employed, or where the service is predominantly outsourced?  Is there any link in terms of this geographic variation?  This is a small country, and an even smaller State, so there should be some sort of uniformity of provision.  However, there does not appear to any uniformity of provision.  We are interested in understanding what the rationale for that is and where that comes from.  The witness might be able to provide us with some insight on this.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the time I spent representing these workers.  One of the things we were resisting at the time was a reduction in the call-out.  It used to be an hour, which was seen as the minimum.  Then it went to 30 minutes.  As I was exiting that area, there was talk of a 15 minute call-out being introduced.  Can all the  witnesses advise what is the shortest call-out service that is offered by them and give an explanation?  Quite frankly, if it is anything less than an hour, I would like to hear an explanation as to how they think that is actually going to provide a service to an elderly person.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy Durkan's questions about the difference between that which is provided by the private sector and the public sector and the budgets, it makes no sense to me that the budgets would be separate because then it would almost be like a target to be reached rather than basket to take from.  Has anybody any figures on the proportion of women in carer jobs?  I used to be a carer when I was a student in Tullamore hospital and my memory of it was that it was nearly all women in the job.  I refer to the &euro;11 an hour wage and the correlation, which seems very apparent to me, with people working within the childcare sector, that is, that this is a vocational job and people should, out of goodwill, work with somebody and be his or her person of contact on a daily basis.  This seems disrespectful to the career of caring and to those people providing the service.</p> <p>  Perhaps the private providers will outline where that margin from &euro;11 to &euro;26 arises.  While I understand there are operational costs with a business, it seems excessive that the gross would be &euro;26 and it would net down to &euro;11 for the employee.  Can we have some figures on what that margin goes towards?  If it is not providing cars or expenses, I would like to know where it is going.</p> <p>  Has any proper qualitative analysis been done on the outcomes for people in their homes in terms of consistency of care?  If a person receives home care for 15 minutes or a half an hour every day of the week and it is provided by a different person each day, has there been any sort of analysis done on?  It seems logical that it would have a negative impact, especially on older people living alone, where a new person comes into their home every time.  It would appear to be very disruptive.</p><p>It would also lead to a reduced standard in care because while many carers are not authorised to administer medication, they do check if it has been taken.  There is a huge responsibility on the carer in building a relationship with the client.  Have the organisations undertaken studies on the negative outcomes for the patient of a lack of consistency in service provision?</p><p> On the issue of a separate budget, I am concerned as to why private companies would want it.  Deputy Durkan asked about the difference in pay between the private and public sectors, which I do not believe Mr. Fitzgerald answered.  When I was doing the job 15 years ago as a student, for me it was a well-paid job.  I am sure those who are doing the job now are doing so to fund mortgages and their families and so it is probably not a particularly well-paid job in comparison with other professions.  Deputy O'Reilly spoke about the minimum time for a visit, such that carers only have time to stick their heads in the door and check a person's pulse.  To my mind, this is the opposite of the word "carer".</p></speech>

I commend all of our carers and those who provide home help on the work they do throughout the country, including in my community.  This is a battle we have been fighting since 2010 when drastic cuts were made to home help hours.  Previous to these cuts, we had a very good system in which people were employed by the HSE, paid a proper wage, and service users knew what they could expect.  Why did the HSE break a system that was working?</p> <p>  Allowing people to be cared for in their home is vital.  It should be a priority for the HSE.  The resources being allocated to this service and the manner in which it is being operated and privatised, however, does not speak to that.  There is an imbalance between the words that are being spoken and the manner in which carers and home help providers are being treated.  I live in a rural area, where I regularly see carers running from one client to another for half an hour.  It is ridiculous.  One could not make this up.  A junior certificate student would fail if he or she wrote that type of prescription to deliver home care, especially in rural areas.  It is bizarre.  Has any analysis been done on the cost to the HSE of providing one hour of home help via a private company?  What is the saving to the HSE per hour in not employing carers directly?</p> <p>  There are 6,450 people waiting for services, which is crazy.  The cost to the HSE of providing each of them with, say, four hours of home care per week, even if provided through the private system at &euro;26 per call, would be &euro;670,000.  Has the HSE requested this funding?  This is not all about numbers.  I know of a 79 year old man who is soon to be discharged from hospital.  His wife has dementia, chronic pancreatic cirrhosis of the liver, diabetes and chronic arthritis.  They have been told they are not a priority case.  This couple is among the 6,450 people on the waiting list.  This is so wrong.  The funding necessary to provide all of them with services must be made available.</p> <p>  Does the HSE propose to return to the one-hour service?  Staff recruitment and retention is a problem because of the if-and-when manner in which services are being provided.  The one-hour service is not satisfactory to the person delivering it and it is certainly not satisfactory to the vulnerable person that a carer would not have even have time to speak to him or her.  Reference was made to an audit and it being a priority issue.  I agree that there need to be standards and proper training, but the HSE is not running an army.  My concern is that we will have more layers of management, governance, audits and so on and no carers to provide home help services because people will not be willing to do it.  It is not the case that we have full employment because unemployment across Mayo is at 30%.  What formal communications has the HSE had with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection around working patterns in this area.  Currently, when a person does even one hour per day, his or her social protection entitlements are messed up such that he or she cannot pay the bills and so on.  Who in their right mind would be home carer?  It does not add up.</p> <p>  There are many other questions I would like to ask but it is difficult to answer questions in batches because one cannot develop the answers.</p></speech>

The HCCI is one of the private providers working with the HSE.  We work for people who come to us privately, as many providers do, and we also do work on behalf of the HSE.  In our case, approximately 40% of our work is done privately.  Like Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Healy, I would not know what other providers pay, be they not-for-profit, voluntary or HSE providers.  The HCCI recently carried out a survey of its providers nationwide.  The rate of pay within our company is &euro;13.80 per hour.</p></speech>

As I said, the HCCI rate is &euro;13.80.  On top of this, we pay PRSI, bank holidays and annual leave.  In all cases, a nurse will assess a client before we go in and on a quarterly basis thereafter.  We also have costs around insurance, quality control and office administration.  The average cost of efficient administration of an office for any organisation would be in the region of 30% to 32%.</p><p>In our case, in terms of a contribution to profit and further investment, we are running at a figure in the area of 6% to 8%.  In the past year, to be efficient in our scheduling, customer relationship management and telemonitoring systems, our organisation has spent over &euro;1 million on technology to be more professional and efficient, as well as to provide for better transparency and accountability.  The HSE, rightly, requires us to be accountable for every hour we use to ensure there is good value for money for the taxpayer, etc.  We have the technologies in place, but they do not come cheap.</p><p> We are in a position to pay more and offer better conditions of employment.  It could be the same carer doing work for the HSE, but we may use him or her for a private client.  If it is a private client, we can offer better conditions of employment such as group hours, not if-and-when contracts, and pay for transport because we are in charge.  With respect, in the HSE's case, it has to get the best value for money.  If it is not paying transport or whatever else, it is difficult for us to do so.  In the case of a private client, we are totally in control, particularly of the travel part of contracts of employment.  The average shift with a private client is three hours.  In many countries the shifts can be two, three and four hours.  It is a different ball game when we are in control in dealing with private clients.  Accordingly, one of our genuine recommendations, having seen it in other countries, is the provision of client directed home care.  That is where we give the client the choice, but it is not only the client.  Up to 70% to 80% of the people making decisions on home care for, say, an 83 year old client are usually the sons or daughters.  We give them a choice of provider, whether they want to use the HSE, a voluntary, not for profit or private care service.  I do not mind which provider it is.  They should have a choice of provider and care plan.  One must ensure it is a care plan which suits them.  It should not involve a half-hour or one-hour shift or the carer being at the home at 9 a.m. or 11 p.m.  They should be given a choice not only of care plan in terms of what, when and how it will happen but also of schedule.  If they do not like a provider, they should have the chance to move to another one when and if they want.  Consumer-directed care is implemented in many countries.  It gives group carers a chance to reduce transport and cluster carers and clients on the same street or in the same area.  It gives us flexibility and adaptability we can use with private clients.  That is difficult to do in the case of the HSE.</p></speech>

We support carers in all sectors.  We saw that there was a gap where carers did not have support.  It is a place which provides for open dialogue and support for people who would otherwise be isolated.  Many of our members are already members of unions, meaning that it is outside our remit.  Many of them tell us that they frequently make 30-minute calls.  They have to assist an elderly person to get out of bed in the morning and bring him or her downstairs to have breakfast.  Naturally, the person needs care - he or she may have mobility issues - and his or her needs need to be met.  Carers are extremely stressed because they know that they will only be paid for 30 minutes, but they will be with the person for longer.</p> <p>  We carried out a survey among our group.  Some 44% of carers said they were unhappy with their current employment conditions, while 46% felt unsupported by their employer.  We believe, from direct feedback, that there are far too many issues with in-home care services.  Regulation and everybody singing from the same hymn sheet are definitely needed.  The minimum rate is a big issue.  We said &euro;11 an hour, but there are many who are only earning &euro;10.</p></speech>

We flag this issue frequently.  The population is ageing and the number of those aged over 85 years is increasing at a significant rate.  The dependency levels of those whom we are maintaining in the community are far higher than they were.  That is a good point and what we need to develop.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report stated we needed more of it.  In the nursing home sector there are private, voluntary and public providers.  In this sector it will be the same.  The HSE accounts for over half of service provision, while the private sector accounts for 30%.  We will require the three components of the sector to work collectively to maximise results for service users.</p> <p>  We do not specifically survey care staff, but we carry out a survey of all HSE staff periodically.  Home helps and home care assistants would be involved.</p> <p>  Deputy Kate O&rsquo;Connell asked about the separation of the budget.  There might have been some confusion when I was replying to Deputy Bernard J. Durkan.  We are not talking about separating the home care budget.  Instead, we see the home care budget being separate from the budget for the nursing home support scheme.  Nursing home residential care is different and has its own requirements.  There is also a large private sector involvement in it.  It is a Vote in its own right, on which we have done a significant amount of work.  There is confidence in the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform that it is a well managed service with good controls, as well as good identification of costs and so on.  On the home care side, we have a single resource and budget for all home care services, whether they be private, public or voluntary.  It all comes from the same budget.</p><p>Deputy O'Connell may have thought we were saying we would separate the home care budget, but I do not think that is the case.  I will ask Mr. Fitzgerald to deal with the question on outcomes and how it is linked to our audit and so on.</p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh expressed a concern that we were in some way breaking a service that was working well.  That certainly is not our view.  What the public looks for in the service has changed.  Private sector offerings emerged and the private sector is very much part of the system now and the public want to use it.  The public wants to have choice.  In many locations there are home care offerings from the HSE, the private sector and the voluntary sector.  Members of the public want the capacity to have the choice.  It is not that the HSE went out looking for the private sector to become involved.  It was more the case that the private sector become involved and developed offerings the public was interested in using.</p></speech>

People want to be cared for in their home.  I have not yet met a person who expressed an opinion on whether or not the care is private or voluntary.  Half of the people do not know if it is a voluntary sector, private or HSE service.  The witnesses know my view on this, which is that the HSE cut back on the services and allowed the private sector to come in to take what it has now become.  Mr. Healy and Mr. Fitzgerald are two people who are directly employed and I would fight just as hard for their jobs as I would for directly employed home helps.  A vacuum was created deliberately.  Mr. Healy said people want choice but I have never heard anybody say that.  They want to be cared for in their own home, but they do not say they want the choice of home care provided by-----</p></speech>

For example, 80% of the residential care system is provided by the private sector and 20% is provided publicly.  In this sector we currently provide half of the service.  It is significant for us and Members of the Oireachtas, in considering what will take place in the period until 2031, that the population is ageing and the demographic is increasing.  We will have to work collectively.  The HSE set up the forum with the voluntary and private sectors to work collectively to develop the service in the way that will be necessary.  This is an important part of the response.</p></speech>

As Mr. Murphy stated, apart from our funding of the public system for which we use private sector providers to deliver on behalf of the public system, the private sector is also providing private services directly to families.  That is separate from our provision.  In those cases we try to dovetail services as best we can.  We have gone to tender on three occasions and on each occasion we have improved and developed the service as part of the tender.  On this occasion we are moving towards the consumer-directed approach, which is similar to the systems in place in other jurisdictions, to which Mr. Murphy referred, under which service users are given a greater say on how the service is delivered.  This includes giving choices on times.  At times our service offering can be very fixed.  We are trying to increase the level of choice through the tender so that individual service users can choose times that suit them, their families and the wider circle of support available to them.  This will be a feature of how we must work and we are trying to move into this type of model as we go forward.</p></speech>

While much criticism is made of the service, when we asked our professional staff who call up the requirements for service from a care plan perspective, they were anxious to retain the 30 minute service.  There are circumstances when a 30 minute call is absolutely appropriate.  We certainly would not condone a 30 minute call for a service that would take one and a half hours to complete, or trying to shoehorn a one hour call into 30 minutes.  With calls that require toileting people, ensuring they are eating their meals or meal supervision, or that they are up and about their business, a 30 minute call is very much appropriate.  It is also very hard to do.  Private and voluntary providers and directly provided service providers do not always want to engage in a 30 minute call because it can mean it is a call to be done within their patch or their area.  We try to use it this approach as judiciously as possible, but it is an absolute requirement as per our own professional staff.</p></speech>

Even though people wanted us to increase the minimum call to one hour, our staff was anxious to retain the half hour call, specifically for the reasons I described.</p> <p>  The issue of multiple people visiting a house to provide the service was raised.  This occurs when the carers available change and new staff have to be introduced, which is not good from an outcome perspective.  It is true that this is not a good approach and we expect our care staff and providers to minimise the need to do that.  We are anxious, however, from a best practice perspective to ensure the person receiving care knows a number of carers because there will inevitably be times when carers are on leave or sick leave.  For maintaining the relationship between the person and the carer it is sometimes better to have a number of people involved rather than having people becoming dependent on one carer.  This is another aspect.</p> <p>  On the main question on what differences regulation might bring compared with the current regime.  One of the main issues is to be able to say, through our own tendering arrangements with providers and our own provision of services, that it is all quality assured and to a standard.  We will need regulation to do that appropriately and we will all have to comply with it.  The Senator raised the concern about audit teams and further levels of management.  Our audit teams are not for the purpose of increasing management but to ensure that, as a forerunner to regulation, we can say what type and quality of service are being delivered by all providers.  This is done through surveys and oversight of the services currently being delivered by providers.  We cannot get away from the whole issue of having proper oversight of personal care.  This is a significant issue and the more personal care we provide in people's homes the more we have to be satisfied that there is good governance and good clinical oversight of providers, and that if issues arise, they will be identified and addressed.</p><p>We cannot give that assurance today in the absence of regulation.  I do not believe any of the providers, voluntary or private, can say that to that degree either.  The history of bringing in regulations - as Mr. Healy alluded to - shows that we have to be clear that it is not just to shrink the service to a size we are comfortable with.  We have to maintain the flexibility and the good parts of the service, which are really important.  We are going into the homes of people and delivering services.  We are guests.  It is not the same as residential care, and we have to have a regulation that reflects that type of service.  </p></speech>

If the requirements of that person changed and there were further additional duties required, an increase from half an hour to one hour, or whatever length of time was required, would certainly be put in place.  There are certain aspects of the care plans that only require half an hour.  There were many discussions around having a minimum of one hour service, but people felt that half an hour was quite adequate in many circumstances to meet the specific requirements of certain people.  The visit might just be a drop in to help a person go to the toilet, to make sure he or she has eaten or has taken his or her medication.  It also serves as an oversight or supervision of the person, to make sure the person is getting on with his or her business for the day.  A half an hour is adequate for that.  My own mother gets the half hour visit every once in a while, and it absolutely fits the bill for her needs.</p></speech>

We pay the rates that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sets for public pay.  It controls public pay policy and we implement what it decides.</p> <p>  Competition law dictates the private side of things.

We currently deliver 50% of the service.  Furthermore, the tendering process we engaged in did not cut services but actually increased them.  We engaged with private contracting during the tendering because, in the greater Dublin area, we were introducing a far higher level of homecare packages.  We were trying to implement homecare packages.  The HSE does not deliver homecare in the greater Dublin area; it is done through the voluntary sector.  We went to tender, and both the voluntary sector and the private sector compete through a tendering process.  It was not done in the context of cutting services but rather in the context of extending services.  Homecare packages have been funded, and over the last three years there has been an increase of 112 million hours.  The service is now expanding.  At the beginning of 2008, when the economic downturn came, there was definitely a contraction of service, but it was not related to the introduction of tendering.</p></speech>

I understand where Mr. Fitzgerald is coming from.  Home and Community Care Ireland carried out a survey of both our clients and our carers and found that 96% of clients said they would rather not have 30 minute shifts, and 98% of carers said they do not want 30 minute shifts.  We have to think of the clients, of course, but we have to think of the carers as well.  It is extremely difficult to achieve.  There are travel costs, and within the HSE tender there is no automatic right to get travel costs to cover 30 minute shifts.  It is not catered for in the tender.  Carers and clients do not want it.  I would contend that if the 30 minutes was extended to 60 minutes the carers will always find something to do.  It might be personal care, housekeeping, meal preparation or medication reminders.  There is always something to do in a 60 minute visit, and I am very concerned that we will not be able to retain and recruit carers.  The 30 minute shift makes it too difficult.  We are not respecting the carer, which is really important here.  Sending them around on 30 minute shifts is killing the industry.</p> <p>  Choice is also very important, as Deputy O'Reilly mentioned earlier.  Even in the current system there is no choice.  The client does not have a full choice of the provider he or she uses.</p><p>I am very happy if someone is given a full choice as to whether to use a private provider, a charity provider, a not-for-profit provider or the HSE.  Currently people are not given the choice.  They are told that the HSE will do it and if it cannot do the weekends, it will do the weekdays and give the weekends to someone else.  The client does not have full choice over the provider being used.  I do not care who is the right person to do it as it may be internal to the HSE, the local charity or a private entity; let the client and family decide.  It should be the local provider and somebody who may have looked after a neighbour or friend.  If the clients are happy, that is what matters.  Let somebody working two doors down finish with Mrs. Murphy and go to Mrs. O'Connell.  It is the right way to do it, whoever that person is and wherever the organisation is.  It can be private, public or whatever.</p><p> Travel allowance is needed.  There are many problems with carers and clients.  The HSE has tried to bring in many incremental improvements for all the right reasons.  Home care can become a far more vital part of the health care continuum.  We might forget about all the issues we have to say we can bring the hospital to the home and train our carers to almost become medical in nature.  We can pay them more and provide a more vital service to older people, GPs and the health care continuum.  We have the technology to include in the home care package that will not only allow us to look after a person when we are in the home but also enable us to monitor and manage the person's health and well-being when we are not in the home.  It could become part of a consumer-directed care package today.  We could monitor people 24 hours per day rather than for an hour or half hour as we are currently doing.  It is a limited service that we are giving and I am worried that home care is the poorer relation in the health care system.  We can do so much better and there is such an opportunity for home care to provide a far more reasonable, cost-effective and vital part of the health care continuum, with the possibility of upskilling carers and introducing technology.  We could make a significant difference to health care overall in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is impossible to go to somebody's house and assist him or her with going to and from the bathroom or sitting down in a chair within 30 minutes.  I know with elderly people that when I knock on the door, say hello and have a conversation, time is always ticking.  They like to chat and the carer might be the only social contact for the whole day.  I represent carers today and they want rid of 30-minute calls.  We had somebody discussing this only the other day in Westmeath.  The person was driving six miles to go to a client to provide 30 minutes of care and then six miles home again.  The person did it in the morning, at lunch and at dinner time.  Some people are doing those types of half-hour calls and getting &euro;11.50 per hour.  I know not all companies are paying that rate but many are.  They are paid &euro;5.75 for the 30 minutes, which is quite bad.</p> <p>  The carer is the front-line worker and the person representing the HSE or whatever company in the community.  People do not go into caring just for the sake of it and they are naturally very caring before starting that work.  They invest in themselves and do their training.  All carers must have the required training stipulated by the HSE before they are allowed to go near clients.  It is always carried out, to my knowledge and from what members are telling us.  There is no point in trying to implement new training for carers if we are not going to deal with drastically improving the conditions for existing carers.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the more than 6,000 people waiting for care.  I mentioned earlier the people waiting to get jobs so is there something we can do?  We know many carers looking for work so why are so many clients waiting for care when carers are looking for jobs?</p></speech>

I can only say that our professional nursing, home care and home support managing staff are very clear about this requirement, although it might be difficult to provide it in a day's routine.  If the half hour makes the difference in maintaining somebody at home, it is what we must do.</p> <p>  I will not go over the ground again but it is incumbent on all providers, both voluntary and private, to attract people into this service provision, as we will need them in future..  The HSE will certainly work with them in this regard.  From the HSE perspective, where there is a directly provided HSE service, we retain the right to provide those services.  If people are refusing to provide services, the only provision might come through the HSE.  The direct provision is there and our intention is to maintain direct provision.  That said, we want providers for choice, and that has worked quite well in other spheres, such as in nursing homes and residential care services, etc.  It is important.</p></speech>

It needs to be external to the direct provision of the people running the service.  There should be regulation in due course.</p><p>A really significant aspect for the committee is that when the Department completes its consultations, the development of the legislation and regulation in this sector and the establishment of a scheme will be very significant undertakings.  Part of what we are trying to emphasise is that we will have to maintain the flexibility of the system in this one, as well as developing a statutory scheme.  If it is to be made statutory and if regulation is to be implemented, the flexibility of the home care service is significant.  I agree with what Mr. Murphy and other colleagues said.  We are all agreed that it will be a cornerstone of the continuum of care.  It is going to be really important and it is very timely.  We support the work of the Department in developing this but it will require a lot of close attention to get it right.</p></speech>

I know the Department is working on this.  However, I hope that, in the context of the work relating to that draft legislation, there will be consultation with our witnesses.  They are the people who operate at the coalface.  I am also talking about the home care workers.  One of the other issues raised was about people who are in receipt of social welfare and their difficulties.  They want to make a contribution but they are restricted in what they can do.

We are joined from the Policing Authority by Ms Josephine Feehily, chairperson, and Ms Helen Hall, chief executive officer.  We have Ms Karen Shelly, assistant principal, in the Public Gallery.  The witnesses are welcome and we thank them for engaging with us on this proposed Private Members' Bill.</p> <p>  I have to remind members once again that under the Salient Rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I draw the attention of our witnesses to the position regarding privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Before bringing in our witnesses, I will first invite Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, as the Bill's sponsor, to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.543" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018053000002#D00300"><p>I thank Ms Feehily and Ms Hall for coming in.  This will be short because the legislation under discussion is concise and made up of only three sections.  It is useful to have the Policing Authority representatives before the committee because the purpose of the legislation is to give greater powers to the Policing Authority in respect of its supervisory role over An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  Like most legislation, this comes out of an occasion or event of political controversy.  You will remember, Chairman, that in March 2017 there was significant public concern about the fact that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na announced at a press conference that approximately 1 million false breath tests were recorded on the PULSE system and that approximately 1,500 wrongful convictions were secured in the District Courts because of errors made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That was a significant issue and it had serious consequences.</p> <p>  From a policy perspective, one of the infuriating aspects of that issue was that no one outside of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appeared to have been apprised of these facts.  We know that the discrepancies in the intoxicant checkpoint data were known of within the force as far back as 2014.  We know that a working group was established within the force to investigate the matters in July 2015.  We know that the group reported the discrepancy in November 2016.  However, these issues did not come into the public domain until March 2017.</p> <p>  The first purpose and primary policy objective of section 2 of this legislation is to try to ensure that senior management within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be obliged to bring issues of significant importance to the attention of the Policing Authority.  Moreover, the purpose of section 2 is to impose an obligation on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inform the Policing Authority about any matters that required an internal review, audit or examination of the functions or operation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that were requested by the Garda Commissioner, deputy commissioner or any assistant commissioner.</p> <p>  The benefit of this measure in the context of the breath test crisis is apparent.  The Policing Authority would have been informed at the time the issue first became apparent.  The Policing Authority would have been able to accompany and advise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of the importance of this being put into the public domain.  It would also have prevented the Garda from deciding of its own accord when to go public on the issue.  I believe it would be of benefit to the Garda.  More important, it would be of benefit to the public interest.</p> <p>  We have seen during the past two years the issues in respect of the homicide review, which is ongoing.  If a requirement was imposed on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to inform the Policing Authority about significant audits ongoing, then the homicide review would have been commenced with the knowledge and awareness of the Policing Authority.</p><p>I do not believe we would have found ourselves in a position where the Policing Authority had to extract, sometimes successfully and sometimes unsuccessfully, information from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of the homicide review.  It will be interested to hear the views of the Policing Authority on the requirement provided for in section 2.  </p><p> In section 3 I seek to amend section 62 of the principal Act by providing powers allowing the Policing Authority to remove a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if it is the opinion of the Policing Authority that a member&rsquo;s conduct or continued membership is undermining public confidence in the force.  It is extremely difficult to remove a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as it is to remove any member of the public service, which is as it should be.  However, because the Policing Authority's role as a supervisory body is not only to supervise An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but to ensure there is public confidence in the force, it would be of benefit if this power, which we expect to be used infrequently and in exceptional circumstances, was provided to the Policing Authority.  </p><p> There is sometimes, unfortunately, an assessment in the public mind that the Garda does not deal with wrongdoing or incompetence within the force effectively enough.  I know it is the function of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, to deal with complaints from members of the public in respect of the force.  However, if the Policing Authority had the power to remove a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in exceptional circumstances, it would improve public confidence.</p><p> Section 4 was originally a proposal contained in a report of the joint committee published in 2016.  It seeks to extend the powers of the Policing Authority in the manner proposed by the committee's report.  The section would give powers to the Policing Authority in order that it can supervise the functioning of the Office of the Garda Commissioner and the discharge of the functions by the Commissioner.  I believe Deputy Mick Wallace put forward a similar proposal previously.  Obviously, this will not result in a member of the Policing Authority sitting in the Garda Commissioner's office every day.  It would be of benefit, however, if there was some recognition of the enormous role played by the Garda Commissioner.  The Policing Authority should be regarded as a co-partner, not in investigations or operational matters but to ensure there is awareness of and transparency in the crucial work carried out by the Garda.   The Bill also empowers the Garda Inspectorate to make unannounced visits to Garda stations, which is also a useful provision.  Currently, visits from the Garda Inspectorate must be announced.  This is like a school knowing an inspector is coming; it will make sure the best students are ready and the best teacher is presented.  </p><p> These are the proposals in this short Bill and I am very interested in hearing what the Policing Authority has to say about them.  I assure Ms Feehily and Ms Hall that I am not sensitive or proprietorial about the Bill and I will not be offended if they believe it is rubbish.  I ask them to inform the committee if parts of the Bill need to amended or if there are other parts where the Policing Authority's functions could be assisted by the Oireachtas passing laws.  The exclusive responsibility for making laws rests with the Oireachtas, rather than the Policing Authority, but it is important for us to be aware of the practical impact our laws may have on the Policing Authority if they are passed.  </p></speech>

Having reviewed the Second Stage debate, I can thank the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who indicated it would be good to hear from the Policing Authority.  As such, I thank the Minister for the invitation to appear.  Having said that, we are happy to help if we can.<br/><br/>There were several references in the course of the debate on Second Stage to the obligation on the Policing Authority, under section 62(O), to issue a report within two years on its effectiveness and the adequacy of its functions.  The most useful opening remark I can make is to refer members to that report, which was sent by the authority to the Minister on 22 December 2017.  It was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in January 2018 and is published on the authority's website.  The report made a range of observations and I will pick them up when commenting on the various sections.  That is why I am positioning my remarks in the context of those reports.  We make an overall assessment on our effectiveness, which I will not read it out verbatim in order that we can get down to business now.  However, we stated that we considered our functions broadly adequate for the tasks assigned to the Policing Authority in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, although frequently they are cumbersome, overly circumscribed and inefficient.  Subsequently, the authority made a submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing, which is also published on our website.  <br/><br/>The reason I reference those two documents is to make clear to the committee that we know we have a limited brief and limited powers.  We welcome additional powers but in respect of this Bill, our view is that we would welcome broader powers.  In the submission we made to the Commission on the Future of Policing, we noted the importance of accountability and consent policing.  We indicated that the architecture is unnecessarily complex and crowded, with much duplication.  The Garda believes there is too much oversight and accountability but we do not agree.  All of the functions exist in the architecture should continue and ambiguity and duplication need to be reduced.  This is relevant to one of the sections because one of them risks introducing more complication.<br/><br/>Our report noted that one of the significant barriers to the effectiveness of the Policing Authority was the challenge of overseeing the performance of an organisation while the head of that organisation is accountable to somebody else, in this case, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Secretary General of the Department.  This has been a barrier to our effectiveness and has created serious confusion in the public mind.  In the context of being a regulator, allowing the regulated body to have two places to go leads to a risk of gaps in oversight.  That is relevant to parts of the sections in the Bill.  We proposed to the Commission on Future Policing that it be placed beyond doubt in statute that the Garda Commissioner is the chief executive, the <i>de facto</i>employer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and independent in the performance of his or her functions in respect of policing and security.  The structure should be such that the Commissioner is clearly the chief executive and operates alongside an oversight body.  Currently, the oversight body is the Policing Authority but this may change after the Commission on the Future of Policing reports.  That is also relevant to the Bill.  <br/><br/>As I note in the conclusion of my statement, I hope the reports we sent to the joint committee gave it a sense that while the Policing Authority would welcome new powers, it would welcome even more a better defined overall architecture, clearer expectations of oversight bodies and a better understanding of the limitations of oversight in the current statutory framework.  Some parts of the Bill are very clear.  However, we believe that other solutions are available in respect of other parts and that it is not clear how certain parts would fit in to the existing architecture.  I will be happy to go through each of the sections, as Deputy O'Callaghan did, if that would be helpful.</p></speech>

We stated in our report that if we had been given some start-up time before commencing operations, the authority would have been more effective.  If this Bill, or a version of it, is enacted, we ask that a commencement order is put in place to give us time to prepare before starting to exercise new functions.</p> <p>  On section 2, members are well aware that the authority has had difficulties with spontaneous notifications.  We discussed this issue the last time I appeared before the committee.  We find the sentiments of this amendment very welcome and we very much wish and expect to be informed of the items listed in the section.  The risks with the section arise because it is highly prescriptive.  I find this to be a weakness of Department of Justice and Equality legislation generally.  When legislation is prescribed in micro detail, it creates a problem where an issue arises that falls outside the prescribed detail.  I have in mind the example of what would be known in the Garda as an evaluation.  If an evaluation initiated by a chief superintendent found something outrageous, everybody could fold their arms and say they do not need to tell the Policing Authority.</p><p>Our preference, which was in our section 62(O) report, was a simple amendment to section 41(a).  Section 41(a) states that the Garda Commissioner shall keep the Minister and the Secretary General fully informed of matters such as the preservation of peace, protection of life, "significant developments that might reasonably be expected to affect adversely public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na", and two others.  The Deputy mentioned the breath test issue.  The remarkable aspect of that is the Garda told the Department of Justice and Equality; it just forgot to tell us.  If the authority is in the same line, whereby if the Garda Commissioner has to tell the Minister something he or she also has to tell the authority, it might be a simpler and more comprehensive-----</p></speech>

That is what we recommended in our report on our powers.</p> <p>  Section 3 is probably the most problematic for us.  I refer to my comments about the architecture.  First, the authority understands the Deputy's point that it is critical for public confidence that there be an effective mechanism for investigating misconduct by employees of the Garda.  We believe there are significant deficiencies in the current system for disciplining members, and we set out our perspective in our submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Our key points were: the process for investigating and conducting discipline in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be subjected to a root and branch review having regard to whether it accords with best practice; there is a worrying number of successful appeals and reviews of the outcome of its disciplinary process on procedural grounds - worrying in terms of the Garda's capacity to use the regulations it has; the regulations should be reviewed to ensure the system for investigating complaints and internal discipline accords with best practice; consideration should be given to certain disciplinary tribunals being held in public because it is a mark of the integrity and independence of disciplinary processes in many professions and in many policing services outside Ireland.</p> <p>  In any review of the discipline regulations, we submitted that further consideration should be given to the range of sanctions set down in the regulations.  In particular, there is a sanction called "advice", which would not appear to be a sanction at all.  That appears twice in the regulations.  We made a significant submission to the commission.  It concluded with questioning whether the existing model facilitates independent and robust decision-making, includes the necessary supports, by which we mean legal advice, human resources and specialist knowledge in Garda headquarters, and whether it is the subject of appropriate management information to facilitate organisational learning.</p> <p>  With that in mind and in view of what I said about the architecture, we were not clear about what this section would achieve.  It appears to be a copy of section 14, under which the Garda Commissioner may dismiss on summary grounds with the consent of the authority.  That generally happens when the facts have been established beyond doubt and, in our experience, arises following criminal prosecution and conviction so the facts are not at issue.  This section appears to give us a parallel role in the same cases, which worries us.  Another set of cases also come through the discipline regulations.  We are looking at potentially three different opportunities, and procedures and processes, for a dismissal to arise.  It would have to be rationalised between those three for it to be safe.</p> <p>  I take it from the Deputy's remarks that this would be used sparingly and that he meant cases where the facts were not in doubt.  This appears to be a type of summary section.  If this was to be used in circumstances where a criminal conviction had not been achieved, the authority would have to establish the facts.  We would require another range of powers to give effect to this.  We would need powers of investigation, which would have to be similar to those of the Garda, a compelling power on the Garda Commissioner and GSOC to give us access to information, and an appeal system.  We would need to have a great deal of machinery that is in the discipline regulations.</p> <p>  Finally, we are concerned at the introduction of the Government's consent to the dismissal.  When the authority was established, there was a definite effort to take as much as possible away from the Government in the statutory framework.  We would be concerned that if the appeal from the authority was to the Government, it might reintroduce a politicisation that would be unhelpful.  Our preference would be, and Mr. Justice Charleton spoke about this when referencing the Morris tribunal, that the entire disciplinary process be examined from top to bottom.  The acting Garda Commissioner told us recently that he was starting that process.  There has been preliminary engagement with the Workplace Relations Commission with a view to starting some work in that regard.  A bigger change is needed.  Section 3 could complicate this and reintroduce the Government in a way that might not be helpful to the overall statutory framework.</p> <p>  With regard to section 4, I return again to the architecture.  It would be helpful to understand better how this would fit with section 26 which sets out the Garda Commissioner's functions, bearing in mind that the authority's view is that the Garda Commissioner should be the chief executive.  The Garda Commissioner has a range of functions to direct, carry on, manage and generally control the administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and so forth.  If he or she is directing and controlling, where would oversight fit in without being conflicted?  On the supervision provision, I would like to better understand what the words "supervise" and "Office" mean in that regard.  There would have to be some definitions because the Garda Commissioner is an office with 16,000 people in it.  It is an office in that sense.  There would also have to be some definitions for supervision.</p> <p>  Section 4(1)(ab) states "establish policies and procedures ... which shall be binding ...".  Does that mean the authority would be the body establishing all the policies or just an occasional policy, for example, the code of ethics?  If that is the objective, it must be clearer; if it is not the objective, there is a problem with section 26.</p> <p>  Section 4(1)(ac) refers to "cause to be published and made accessible to the public all sections of the Garda code..." and so forth.  I have no problem with that but there is a more direct route through a provision which simply directs the Garda Commissioner to do it, rather than putting us in the middle.  Why would we be causing something to be published when the Deputy could insert a direct provision directing the Garda Commissioner to do it?  We would be happy to position ourselves as an appeal mechanism, which would be more appropriate to oversight.  Where the Garda Commissioner decided something could not be released we could be the body somebody could approach to take a view on it.  The other option, which is in our submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, is that freedom of information legislation should be extended to a broader range of Garda functions.  In that event, and probably most appropriately, the appeal against non-publication would be to the Information Commissioner.  There are other ways to achieve what is in the subsection.  We do not see the need to include the authority there, causing something that we do not own to be published.</p> <p>  Again, I need to understand better what is meant by section 4(1)(ad) to "review the adequacy and appropriateness of the policies ...".  We review some of the policies from time to time on a thematic basis.  That is in our remit.  However, if this provision states that our main job, day in and day out, should be to review, that is a different task.  It could be done but I have to wonder how it would fit with the Garda Inspectorate's functions having regard to our views on duplication.  The Garda Inspectorate is reviewing policies and procedures all the time.  I need to understand that provision better and then perhaps we can help.</p><p>Finally, on the inspectorate, I agree with the Deputy that the idea that it has to announce its arrival does not make any sense.  We are clear in our submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland that a strong, independent inspection function is an essential part of the overall architecture for policing.  We are not sure, by the way, that this section is needed but that is a matter for the Oireachtas and the inspectorate itself.  We are not sure why the inspectorate cannot just do it without a power.  That said, having a power that puts it beyond doubt is always helpful.  That is my recitation on the four sections.</p></speech>

In a general sense, as I said on Second Stage, I am very much in agreement with the overall thrust of the Bill.  Much of it overlaps with the submission that Sinn F&eacute;in made to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland, particularly with regard to spontaneous notification and the section on unannounced visits by the inspectorate.  I am also supportive of section 4.  The only question I have, which I also raised on Second Stage, relates to section 3.  A comprehensive answer was provided in terms of the architecture and structure of the Bill but I would like an answer on the principle behind what is intended.  Does Ms Feehily agree that the Policing Authority should have the power to remove members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  If so, in what circumstances should that apply?  Should it apply to all ranks or only to senior ranks?  The Policing Authority, which is not an enormous organisation, could be overwhelmed if all ranks were included, albeit that any removal would be in exceptional and serious circumstances.  I have an open mind on this but perhaps it would be better for the authority to focus specifically on the senior ranks within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

The authority's view is that the optimum structure is that the Garda Commissioner is clearly the employer and above that there is an oversight body.  The model in most other countries is that the role of the policing authority or oversight body in the context of removal is confined to the senior ranks.  Most commonly, it is confined to one or two of the most senior ranks.  If the Garda Commissioner is to be in charge and held accountable for running the organisation then he or she has to be clearly the person who is in charge of the disciplinary processes, including dismissal.  The Commissioner then needs to be seriously held to account for using those powers appropriately.  That is why we referenced in our submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to the worrying trend of losing cases on procedural grounds.  That is a problem for any employer and the Commissioner needs to be able to explain why An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is losing cases on procedural grounds.  The short answer is that any oversight body that might come after the commission should only be involved in the dismissal of those in the most senior ranks.</p> <p>  In terms of Deputy  &Oacute; Laoghaire's other question, section 14 of the current Act refers to a summary dismissal.  This is where the Garda Commissioner does not go through the full bells and whistles of the disciplinary regulations and does not put in place a disciplinary tribunal.  That can only be done safely when the facts are not in doubt.  It is useful to have a body like an authority consenting in those circumstances to make sure that a Commissioner does not run away with himself or herself in choosing a summary dismissal option.  We can see a function for an authority to consent to something that the Commissioner has done in a summary situation because the power to dismiss someone without a disciplinary tribunal is a significant one which should be used sparingly.  </p> <p>  In the current statutory framework, we could do that using an interpretation of section 13, if needed, for the ranks between superintendent and Assistant Garda Commissioner.  That is provided for and we could engage in a summary dismissal where the facts are not in doubt.  There is a page of actions we would have to take and they are all set out in the section but we think we have the power, if that was the intent of the provision.  In future, however, we should be confined to the top layer.</p></speech>

Unless the architecture in terms of the role of the Minister, the Government and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality is resolved, there is no point in giving the Policing Authority a power related to the Commissioner where the Commissioner's personal accountability is to someone else.  It could not be done legally so the entire architecture issue must be resolved.  The appointment and the dismissal must go together.  There is no other legal, safe way to do it, although I am not a lawyer.</p></speech>

Ms Feehily mentioned a broadening of the powers of the authority.  What is her ideal fit in terms of the policing architecture that we have currently?  The Garda Inspectorate appeared before us last week and it had its own ideas on the matter.  The authority has made a submission to the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  We cannot have different approaches going forward if this is to function.  The legislation has to fit.  How far would Ms Feehily like to see the authority's powers extended?</p></speech>

Whether those functions or powers are given to the Policing Authority or to some other body is not the primary issue.  The functions of oversight, public challenge, accountability, inspection and complaints must be provided for.  They can be divided six different ways but they all have to be there.  It has to start with sorting out the legal position with regard to the Government and the Minister.  We can like all we want but there is no point in us liking something.  There are strong legal views, for example, that because policing is part of the Executive branch there should not be an authority.  If that is the position, there is no point in giving us additional powers.  We do not want any more half powers.</p> <p>  The Secretary General is explicitly cited in the Act but we have to start by resolving where the Government, the Minister and the Department of Justice and Equality fit in.  Then we can work out how to organise the pieces that are left.  If the existing infrastructure is retained, whereby accountability on all matters continues to be to the Minister, I am not sure that there would be space left for three bodies because we are tripping over each other a bit.  We all have review and research powers.  The plea we made in our submission was less about designing the boxes and more about the fact that the functions must be there but need to be rationalised to remove duplication.  The public is confused at this stage.  We get letters every day addressed to the Garda Inspectorate and it gets letters addressed to us.  Some people think that the Policing Authority is the appeals board for GSOC but it is not.</p><p>We are not.  oversight, which it must do, has a parallel set of meetings with the guards.  Quite frankly, I feel sorry for the guards who have to run between the four of us.  The Policing Authority would like rationalisation but first it must be clarified where the Government and the Minister fit in.  The authority's view is that their role should be as small as possible, in terms of public confidence.  If it was as small as possible then it would be much easier to decide how to package the other functions.  </p></speech>

They have preliminary engagement with the Workplace Relations Commission to help them with it, and I think that is a good idea.  We plan to share our views with the Workplace Relations Commission, when they get going, so that they can see what we think we are seeing, in terms of the regulations.  The disciplinary regulations, like lots of other things in this realm, are very detailed and prescriptive, which is why they miss a step quite often.  They are not like any discipline code.  There is a code of practice on disciplinary procedures, which is in place, under the Workplace Relations Commission.  The regulations do not look anything like that.  They are quite different.  The range of penalties are very strange, to my eyes.</p> <p>  As there is no individual performance management system in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they use discipline to do things that in another organisation would be done in a performance management context.  That is why, under the discipline code, one will find oneself with a penalty called "advice".  Such a term belongs in a performance management system where one can have a chat about one's performance and be given improvement and development advice.  A penalty called advice should not be one of the options available under disciplinary regulations, in my opinion.  The review is at a very preliminary stage but because the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has engaged professional help I hope it will move along.    </p></speech>

In terms of the cervical smear controversy, one of the disadvantages was that there was no board in the HSE that could step in and call for the matter to be dealt with immediately.  It is a similarly situation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when the breath test issue and homicide figures were examined.  In those instances it would have been beneficial to have a board that could call for the matters to be resolved or dealt with in a particular way immediately.</p> <p>  I have a big question, which is one for policymakers in the future.  I get the impression that Ms Feehily thinks the Minister should not have an overly supervisory role.  Am I wrong?  I believe that she thinks the Policing Authority should be the entity to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Commissioner report, and that the Minister should get out of the way.  It is a very big question, as I know she is aware. </p></speech>

The Minister for Finance.  That is not to say that there was not work done at an official level, particularly around the time of the Finance Bill, budgets and so on.<br/><br/>The upshot of that is there is a huge support structure for that function in the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is because of that it is critically conflicted, which was stated in our submission, in terms of where it fits <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>also being responsible for the oversight bodies.  The Department is one of the oversight bodies but it duplicates the work of lots of the other oversight bodies.  Where is the Minister?  The Minister, certainly, but the Government always, have a place in terms of strategy, policy and direction, and must have an exceptional power of direction, without question.  It is the level of granularity that is exercised and runs in parallel with what we are supposed to be doing that creates gaps.  We are also concerned about the potential for a gap in oversight because the Minister is the only place that owns both security and policing.  What is in the middle?  If there is architecture that looks at security and another that looks at policing then how does one manage that intersection safely?  How do we know what the Minister knows and, conversely, how does the Minister know what we might have seen in our oversight?  It is not that I see no role.  I absolutely respect that there will always be a role, and has to be a role for Government, in policing - it is a political act.  It is about the day-to-day operational management and we believe that should be as much reduced as possible.</p></speech>

I think there is general agreement between what is proposed and the Policing Authority.  I note and agree with her that it probably is too prescriptive.  Sometimes legislation is better when drafted broadly so as to encapsulate a lot of events as opposed to a number of limited ones.  I detect that there is general agreement about spontaneous notifications.</p></speech>

It would be on the basis of facts that have been established.  I note that Ms Feehily has stated that this appears to be a repetition of a power that is available elsewhere and seems to be without statutory justification.  </p> <p>  In terms of section 4, I am conscious that when I speak about the section that I am not just advocating on behalf of myself.  The committee has also made a recommendation to this effect.  The reason I am looking at the provision online is because I did not print a hard copy of the Act.</p><p>Section 4 states that the Policing Authority would have powers to supervise the functioning of the office and supervise the discharge of functions by the Commissioner, and establish policies and procedures for the Garda which will be binding on all members.  That is like the code of ethics and calls for the Garda code and Garda operational policies to be published.  I note what Ms Feehily says that there is ambiguity as to what specifically will be covered by her supervision of the discharge of the functions of the Commissioner but does she see any benefit in the same way as a chief executive will sometimes have a chairman working close by, even non-executive, to having supervision of the functions of the Garda Commissioner's office?</p></speech>

What is the office that we would we be supervising and is it the same function that we have at the minute of overseeing?  Is it just that the office needs to be defined or is it more intrusive supervision?  One way or another the statute will need to be clear what the office was that was different from our oversight of the organisation and on the issue of supervision versus oversight, and how we would make sure we were not conflicted.  Those are our concerns but there cannot really be any difficulty with the notion of better oversight given there is acceptance for the principle of an oversight body.  It is about how it fits.</p> <p>  The policies and procedures need to be more specific to make it clear that it was not our job.  If it was our job to establish all the policies and procedures then we would be the Garda and we would not be an oversight body so there needs to be some redrafting there to carve out what is intended.  There is reference to the assistant commissioner but I think it should go straight to the Commissioner.  Where does occasional review fit with the inspectorate?</p></speech>

I wonder whether dealing with the Bill in question is a priority and efficient use of our time given that we have other legislation and a fairly comprehensive work programme.  Various Members across the political divide have other issues they want to see on the agenda.  I wonder, therefore, whether it is a priority at all.</p></speech>

At that time, 35 community transport groups around the country were funded under the programme to deliver the services.  While services are open to the general public, older people and people with disabilities have traditionally formed the core customer base of the programme.  </p><p>In 2012 the National Transport Authority, NTA, was assigned responsibility for management of the rural transport programme as part of new arrangements for integrated local and rural transport approved by Government that year.  A restructuring of the programme was announced in 2013.  The aim of the restructuring, which followed a value-for-money and policy review of the programme, was to ensure a more efficient and effective delivery structure that maximises integration with other State-funded transport services and to make the programme a sustainable part of the public transport system.  As part of the restructuring the rural transport programme, which now operates under the LocalLink brand, 17 LocalLink offices were established from the 35 rural transport groups previously delivering the services under the programme.  The NTA contracts the services and the 17 LocalLink offices manage the services in their respective areas on behalf of the NTA.  The NTA, with its national remit to secure the provision of public passenger transport services, is best placed to ensure that LocalLink services are developed and integrated with other public transport services.</p><p>Since the organisational restructuring was completed in 2015, the focus has turned to optimising the services provided within the available funding.  In 2016 the Local Link offices began a review of services in conjunction with the NTA.  The review is looking to ensure that services are meeting the needs of communities in rural areas and identifying gaps in the provision of services across the country.  Arising out of the review and with an increase in my Department&rsquo;s funding for Local Link services since 2016, 50 new services have been introduced to the network.  These include regular five, six or seven day per week bus services as well as demand responsive services.  Key features of these services include greater integration with existing public transport services and better linkage of services between and within towns and villages.  The review also identified the need for community transport services targeting the needs of specific service users from a social inclusion perspective.  Accordingly, the NTA has provided funding to Local Link offices in 2016 and 2017 for once-off community transport services across a number of categories, including age-related, youth, integration and culture and education. </p><p>I am aware of how important the Local Link services are to people living in rural areas.  The difficulties in accessing social activities in rural areas in the evening and night-time, has been a particular concern for me and the Government.  I therefore set about bringing together key stakeholders to explore the issues involved and to try to come up with practical proposals.  I hosted meetings in September and November last year, attended by representatives from the Vintners Federation of Ireland, Insurance Ireland, the Irish Countywomen's Association, the Irish Farmers' Association, Irish Rural Link and the NTA, among others.  Arising from that dialogue, I tasked the NTA with examining the potential to extend existing LocalLink services and proposals I received in this regard from Deputy Martin Heydon.  The NTA sought the views of the 17 LocalLink offices in terms of the various ways that the rural transport programme is seeking to address unmet transport needs in rural areas during evening and night time hours.  Proposals were also sought in terms of addressing these unmet transport needs going forward.  The NTA on 27 February 2018, issued a funding call for applications from all 17 LocalLink offices to deliver a range of trial evening and night time services.  The deadline for receipt of applications was Friday, 16 March 2018.  The NTA received proposals for 50 such services from 12 of the Local Link offices by the deadline.  No applications were received from the five Local Link offices for Galway, Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon, Mayo, Clare or Limerick.  </p><p>Having appraised the applications received, the NTA approved funding for all 50 new services on a six-month trial basis.  The services comprise 20 extensions to existing regular public transport services and 30 demand responsive services across 19 counties.  They will add 188 new trips per week to the network of rural transport services nationally, and will run on average from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. typically on Friday and Saturday evenings.</p><p>While a public procurement process must be undertaken for the 30 new demand responsive services, the NTA plans to have all 50 services operational by mid-July 2018 running until December 2018 on a trial basis.  The total cost of funding these services for the six-month period in 2018 is &euro;450,000.  The NTA will monitor usage patterns and trends on the services over the trial period.  The results of the trial will be assessed and the continuation of these services will be considered in the light of those results and the availability of funding in 2019.  That figure of &euro;450,000 may rise because there were five that did not apply but may have applied since.  In that case it will rise proportionately.  </p><p>I should add that the NTA has engaged with the five Local Link offices which did not submit applications for funding and has invited them to submit applications with a revised closing date of Friday, 1 June 2018 on the same terms and conditions as applied previously.</p><p>I acknowledge the help I received from Deputy Heydon and from the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, in getting this initiative off the ground.  I also thank the NTA and the Local Link offices for their work in developing the new services.  I am grateful for the general welcome for this scheme from large numbers of people, particularly in rural Ireland, as well as in these Houses.  As members know, this is a pilot scheme and it should be given a chance.  Of course, it is not a final scheme but is something on which we must build.  We will have to make judgments on it at the end of the six-month period.  At the moment, the general welcome it has received in rural Ireland is very gratifying.  This is just the beginning of a recognition of and a solution to the problems experienced in rural society.  We want to address those problems in a very serious way, not just now but also into the future.</p></speech>

A lot has been done in recent years to improve rural transport.  The development of Local Link, which grew from 35 different rural transport groups, has made a noticeable difference on the ground.  While we could always do with more, that has made a significant difference.  The important issue now is to market those routes to increase the numbers using them.</p> <p>  I was very disappointed to hear that no applications were received from the five Local Link offices for Galway, Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon, Mayo, Clare and Limerick.  I am sure there is a reason for that and was glad to hear that the Minister had invited them to submit applications, with a revised closing date of Friday, 1 June.  Have any applications been received?  I would be very concerned if applications had not been submitted from what are very rural areas.  Have any applications been received so far?  The deadline is only a few days away.</p></speech>

If the NTA does not receive applications from the remaining offices by this Friday, it should leave it open to them to make late applications.  It would be absurd not to do so if they wanted to make an application.  It would also be absurd if they did not want to make an application.</p></speech>

Any new service is to be welcomed and while I am not going to start off on a critical note, I do have a number of questions on this new service.  What additional funding has the Department given to the NTA this year to roll out the pilot scheme?  The Minister said that the pilot scheme will cost &euro;450,000.  My information is that this is to come from existing resources as opposed to new or additional resources.  My colleagues asked why five Local Link offices did not apply.  My understanding is that the timeframe was very tight in terms of when expressions of interest were originally sought.  Organisations had less than two weeks to put together a comprehensive proposal on the routes they would be able to roll out.  I ask the Minister to confirm that was the case, and if so, does he believe that a two-week timeframe was adequate?  To be fair to these Local Link offices, they are trying to continue on with the work they are doing, providing services in their areas.  I know that only one application was made in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath because of the tight timeframe.  People were unable to do the necessary preparatory work that would be needed to put a business case forward on rolling out a greater number of services.  In my constituency, which is very large, the only routes that have been identified are between Ballinalee, Granard and Longford two evenings per week, with the last bus departing at 11 p.m.  I appreciate that the Minister is not from rural Ireland but-----</p></speech>

A pilot, however, must be designed in such a way as to give a scheme the best chance to work.  Many people in rural Ireland would only be contemplating going out at 10.30 p.m.  They are working on their farms and have family commitments, as do people everywhere else.  If one is in rural Ireland and one goes out to socialise before 10.30 p.m. there will not be too much going on, so cutting off the bus service at 11 p.m. may prevent the scheme from working as well as it possibly could.</p> <p>  The Minister has said that he will review the scheme within six months.  What metrics will be used in that review to determine success or failure?  We need to know now, not at the end of the six months, the key tests in terms of whether this is deemed to be a success or a failure.</p> <p>  The scheme is welcome on the routes that have been identified.   The Minister said that he met the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Irish Countrywomen's Association, which I welcome.  He criticised others for proposing to meet the vintners on this issue but he met them.  Did the Minister consider a community hackney service because these buses are not going to go down byroads or cater for the settlement patterns in rural Ireland?  Many people in rural Ireland live next to secondary roads, byroads and boreens.  How are they going to be able to access the buses?  Perhaps rolling out a community employment scheme would work better.</p><p>What I had in mind was a scheme whereby if a local person was prepared to work on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, the person could retain social welfare benefits but at the same time would have the opportunity to earn or supplement the benefits money by providing a much-needed service in the locality.  That would have had a greater impact in fighting isolation and ensuring that people would have access to a service on a weekend night regardless of how isolated or rural the location.  This is something the Minister could consider now as part of the pilot scheme.</p><p> This was introduced as a result of the Minister's proposal for the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, which is still meandering its way through the D&aacute;il.  Is there any reason or rationale that this is coming so late to the debate?  Since the Minister has been 18 months debating this issue, I would have thought this pilot scheme would have been front-loaded.  Then, provided the debate has concluded within the coming days or weeks, we could have been running not a pilot scheme but an actual scheme that had been tried and tested.  The pilot should be completed and the full scheme should be in place.</p></speech>

The announcement was on 27 February.  The applications had to come in by 16 March.  We are talking about a period of two and a half weeks.  Deputy Troy is right to suggest that it is a little tight.  That is a fair point.  The period has been extended until 1 June for anyone who did not apply.  That is quite a considerable extension.  We received 50 applications.  There was no indication of dissatisfaction with them in respect of the timing.  I am only speculating but I believe there may be one or two of those who were left out or who did not apply who may have found the timetable too tight.  That is why we extended it.  I believe we should continue to be flexible about it and that is why it is a pilot scheme for six months.  The idea is that over the six-month period we will make changes or the National Transport Authority will make changes or suggest changes.  There will probably be new routes or services that will be considered and the Local Link groups that made applications will probably be welcome to change their applications during that period as a result of the findings.  If there are gaps, I imagine the NTA will be more than happy to fill them.  This is not only a pilot.  It will also teach serious lessons about where routes are right or wrong, where the demand is, where society is benefiting and where it is not.</p> <p>  The timetable is tight.  We were keen to get it in for the summer season.  There are procurement delays of several weeks for one or two of these routes.  We want to do it as quickly as possible.  It is an urgent problem.  My guess is that if we had said the window was six months, then people would have asked why we could not do it in two or three weeks because the summer season needs the service.  We will certainly consider further applications during this period and representations will be considered seriously.  We want this to work.</p> <p>  I listened to what Deputy Troy had to say about people going out at 10.30 p.m.  If that is true and there is a need for the service at 10.30 p.m., it may present some logistical difficulties.  I have no operational role in this but I would urge the NTA to look at the possibility of people leaving after 10 p.m.  If that is necessary, if it is the reality that people go out, if there is demand for the service and if it will help people and reduce loneliness, then we should consider it.  We have to be reasonable about that and we should certainly consider it.</p> <p>  Deputy Troy asked about the metrics after six months.  The NTA has said that it will look at this over six months.  The authority has not spelt out what the metrics will be.  This is not a commercial operation and it is not in place to make money.  The main metric of this, as far as I am concerned, is to reduce the difficulties of society in rural Ireland in getting together and with connectivity with regard to the loneliness that many people experience.  The idea is to improve the quality of people's lives.  That is the metric I would urge those involved to use when they are judging whether it is working.  Obviously, if it is not working in certain areas or if no one is using it, then it would be a consideration.  The major consideration, however, should be the improvement to people's quality of life.  That is the most important thing.  Society should benefit and society must connect.  That is the most important metric.</p> <p>  I gather the idea of a community hackney has been tried before and there was little take-up.  I will come back to the Deputy on that point, but I think there was little take-up when this was tried before.  From memory, I recall there were ten hackneys used nationwide.  It was only a small number.</p> <p>  Many of the extensions will be demand-responsive units.  This means they will go down lanes and various places that are not regular routes to collect people.  I understand 30 of the 50 are demand-responsive and therefore they will be flexible.</p> <p>  The final question from Deputy Troy related to the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill.  The Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill and this measure were not conditional on each other.  They are completely separate.  Rural isolation is one problem.  Drink-driving is a completely different problem.  If there is a connection, it is in the sense that people can go to the pub and come home having had two pints or more without fearing in any way that they will be stopped or breathalysed for committing an offence on the way home.  If this improves the willingness in that regard, that is  fine, but they are not in any way conditional upon each other one way or the other.  The drink-driving Bill will go through the D&aacute;il in the coming weeks and this will be initiated in the coming weeks, but regardless if one goes through and the other does not, this measure will go through anyway.</p></speech>

This was alluded to by the Minister and Deputy Heydon.  The two are happening together.  There was no talk of this measure before the Bill.  That is a fact.  We are codding ourselves if we are not being honest about that.</p> <p>  I am glad to hear the Minister say that the metrics will reflect a social service to improve the quality of people's lives.  That is welcome.  I will come back at a later stage and remind the Minister that he said as much.  Many of the social services within Bus &Eacute;ireann and the public service obligation routes have changed in recent times.  Commercial realities applied in certain instances.  I welcome the fact that this is not a commercial reality and not based on commercial realism but on providing a social service within our community.  We should encourage people to use it in the coming six months to ensure there is a far greater roll-out of this scheme after the six-month period.</p></speech>

I was glad to hear him speak of improving the quality of life and talking about connectivity between rural and urban areas.</p><p>I smiled when I heard that because that was the argument many of us made against the proposals to put some Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus routes out to tender.  That is exactly what it is about.  Perhaps the Minister will heed what he himself has said when it comes around to the next batch of routes he intends to outsource.</p><p> My questions are on the breakdown of the funding and how it is going to operate.  I am also curious about how the pilot scheme will be monitored.  I do not believe the Minister said anything specific about how it would be measured.  Perhaps he could clarify that.  I asked whether this would be a door-to-door service as opposed to a collection point-type service on main routes, and I was glad to hear that it is going to be a door-to-door service.  If a person is living in a village, he or she can access the local community hall for social activities or the local pub, but the people who live up the lanes and the boreens are completely isolated.  For this reason a door-to-door service would be good.  I presume a phone line will be set up which those wishing to avail of the service can ring to schedule collection.</p><p> I could not believe it when I saw that the service would be operating until 11 p.m. at the latest.

If the bus is beeping outside the pub at 11 p.m. and a person has just walked in, it is hardly worth his or her while.  Will the Minister give consideration to that?  People generally go out much later in the evening, particularly if they live in a rural area, so 11 p.m. does not really suit the purpose of the scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.654" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018053000002#E00400"><p>The Deputy asked about funding.  Deputy Troy asked the same question earlier and I did not answer him.  The funding will come from the current resources of the NTA.  There will not be an additional charge on the Exchequer for the current funding of the pilot scheme.</p> <p>  I do not blame Deputy Munster for asking operational questions.  I would do the same if I was in opposition.  I am not responsible for answering such questions.  I know that the Deputy would like answers to her questions, but they should be addressed elsewhere.  If she has any difficulty getting those answers, I presume I will be able to get them for her.</p> <p>  The NTA will measure this, and I have asked if it will carry out an interim report after three months.  It has agreed to do so.  I want to monitor the situation very closely and see how it is operating.  I am not going to tell it exactly how to measure it because it has experts on routes and services who will do that work.  This will alleviate rural isolation.  That is the criteria.  This is being done to ensure that people are happier, more comfortable and have better social lives in rural Ireland, and to recognise that the problem needs to be remedied.  If we were spending millions on one route, the Deputy would be quite right to come to the committee and say that we are wasting money and that there has to be a balance.  The thrust and motivation behind this is not commercial at all, however, but rather to make people happier, to ensure they have better social lives and to ensure they are better connected.  I am not saying that it will be done at the drop of a hat, but ultimately we want to reduce rural isolation.  That is the metric we should use.  Where there are new routes which are doing that, we should continue them and extend them.  Thirty of the new routes are going to be demand-responsive, meaning that the service will call to the doors of customers in certain circumstances to make sure that they can get out.  That is a pretty demand-responsive action.</p> <p>  I take the point Deputy Munster made about closing times. I am not very good with pub opening hours.  If pubs close at 11.30 p.m. and the last buses are before that time, people's ability to enjoy themselves as others can is probably reduced.  I will ask the NTA to consider that when the pilot scheme concludes and consider whether there is a demand for the service to go on later.  I believe that is reasonable.  Deputy Troy mentioned that issue as well.  If that is a difficulty, it can be examined. </p></speech>

This is a pilot programme, and I am informed, to quote my sources, by Deputy Michael Collins that there are two links in the pilot programme in County Cork.  If there were to be a comprehensive service for the county, the Deputy believes that 35 to 40 routes would be required, which is approximately 20 times what is available under the pilot scheme.  Those 35 or 40 routes cannot be put on a pilot programme, but if it is successful, if indeed it does combat rural isolation and the service is rolled out to as many people as possible, there will be a big expansion of the programme.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that the cost of the pilot is &euro;450,000.  Five of the 17 areas have not made applications and are not part of the programme yet.  If this is going to be an effective service for significant numbers of people in rural Ireland, a year after the pilot programme the price could spiral to &euro;10 million, &euro;15 million or perhaps more.  The NTA has not received extra funding for the pilot programme.  The Minister said that there was no additional charge to the Exchequer.  It could not reasonably be expected to go beyond the pilot programme from within its own resources.  Will the Minister indicate what his position will be in terms of extra funding for next year or the year after if the pilot programme is successful to roll out the programme to the maximum number of communities?</p></speech>

There are three.  That might change the calculations mentioned by the Deputy but it does not change his point.  I am not sure on what basis the Deputy is saying that 35 services rather than three would be required, because the local links were invited to make whatever applications they wanted to the scheme.  There were no limits at all and we received only three applications from the local links in Cork.  That does not mean there is not an appetite for more.  There might well be, but they were invited to apply and there was no cap put on what they could ask for.  Every single application throughout the nation was accepted.  There were 50 applications and all 50 were accepted.  We are fulfilling and satisfying the appetite for the service that we can find.  We cannot expect the NTA to go to local link services and tell them that they need more.  The current allocations represent what has been sought by the link services.</p></speech>

If it works in some areas then other areas may see the opportunity and cash in on it.  That is fair enough and actually a good thing.  I am not disputing the &euro;10 million to &euro;15 million but it is speculative.  If the NTA says extra funding is needed in future years because there is an appetite for more services, and that is justified, I will be happy to seek further resources for this scheme - if I think it is working.</p> <p>  There has been an increase in NTA funding in recent years and also an increase in Local Link services.  Over the past three years, it has gone from &euro;12.2 million in 2016 to &euro;14.25 million in 2017 and &euro;14.99 million - &euro;15 million - in 2018.  The trend is going up.  If this scheme is working, I will be happy to seek fresh resources specifically for it.  </p></speech>

It is, as other speakers have said, a positive initiative.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, in his statement said that one of the key features of these services is greater integration with existing public transport services and better linking of services between and within towns and villages.  This does not go anywhere near breaking the back of the problem arising from the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act.  The Minister has said this is a trial scheme.   What parameters will be used to measure its success?  Will it be that no more pubs have closed or that there are fewer reported cases of mental ill health in rural Ireland?  I refer to how can success be measured.</p> <p>  The Minister also mentioned he met various interested groups from rural Ireland including the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, ICA, and the Irish Farmers Association, IFA.  They all suggested alternative solutions.  The IFA proposed the provision of DIY alcohol test units - breathalysers.  I asked the Minister about that in a parliamentary question and I thank him for his reply.  He mentioned the issue of costs.  However, if we take into account the number of rural facilities within the country and those that will be greatly affected by the impending legislation, this &euro;500,000 could be used to give each of those publicans the breathalyser machinery.  It is expensive.  The Minister quoted a cost of &euro;500 a unit in his answer to me.  If the publicans had the machines, however, they could supply the refills.  It is not for a legal determination, it is only for guidance.  That initiative could let people know if they are drinking and driving within the current laws.  </p> <p>  I am talking about people drinking a pint or half of a glass of wine.  I will be blunt about the Minister's proposal - he is creating a binge drinking bus.  That will be the effect.  Once people know the bus exists, it will be like they are off to a stag party.  The bus will bring them from A to B and back home again within a defined period.  Myself and my colleagues who oppose this amendment were not talking about people going out for a session.  We were talking about the social drinker, a person who calls to his or her neighbour on Christmas Day, who goes down to the local after a day in the field or working in the factory or stops in when passing by on the way home.  We are talking about people having a courtesy drink or a glass of wine with their meal.  I welcome the initiative but it is not hitting the nail on the head from our perspective.  I reiterate my two questions.  What are the measurement parameters for success and will the Minister consider funding the cost of breath test units for public houses and let them be responsible for them?  They would not be legally-binding machines; it would just be for guidance.  That can save lives as well.  </p></speech>

I am not going to do that and I will tell Deputy O'Keeffe why.  The problem of rural isolation is not exclusively about getting back and forward to pubs.  Deputy O'Keeffe suggests that money - if I understand it correctly - would be better spent on giving publicans breathalyser test units so that they could breathalyse their customers.  That fails to recognise that the problem of rural isolation is much wider.  It misleading to suggest it is only about going to pubs.  He knows rural Ireland better than I do but people get involved in all sorts of social activities in rural and urban Ireland that are not pub orientated.</p> <p>  Social life does revolve around the pub in part, but other people go to play bingo, to dances, to sports events and to charities and fundraisers.  These buses will transfer them from one place to another while doing those things.  It is insulting to suggest that rural life is exclusively centred on drinking.  The pub is a centre of social activity, and it should be recognised as such, but people do many other things to get together which are not in any way related to alcohol.  These buses will facilitate both of those types of people.  We cannot spend all of this money exclusively on providing breathalysers for publicans.  People who do not drink and engage in other activities should be facilitated as well.  </p> <p>  On the question of metrics, the idea is to connect communities, get people together, let them have a social life and visit their friends.  It is as simple as that.  They cannot do that at the moment.  The measurement - as I said to Deputy Troy and Deputy Munster - will be whether it brings people together, reduces rural isolation and improves the standard and quality of life of people in rural Ireland.  That will include people going to pubs, sports events, bingo and those visiting friends.  It is much wider that just drink.   </p></speech>

I am delighted to see he has been reading up on the background to rural Ireland with his mention of bingo buses.  I call Deputy Michael Collins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018053000002#F00500"><p>There are two types of services.   One is the day to day Local Links rural transport services.  It is second to none in most cases.  I have no qualm with those services.  The daytime service in west Cork is well laid out, excellently managed and delivered to many people suffering from rural isolation.  However, the proposed new service being piloted is doomed to failure before it starts.  It is a city mindset not a rural mindset.  The Minister said there are three areas in County Cork.  I understood there were only two but I will not argue with him.  He has the facts and figures in front of him and I do not.</p> <p> However, &euro;200,000 was announced initially.  A transport service manager would have to be realistic.  There would be no point looking for funding to cover the entirety of County Cork - the biggest county in Ireland.  It could cost &euro;400,000 to deliver that.  There would be no point putting in &euro;400,000 worth of required services when the operator is only going to get &euro;200,000.  That amount rose to &euro;450,000 but that caught the managers off balance.  They did not have many of the areas covered.  It does not matter if it is &euro;200,000 or &euro;450,000 - we must realise Cork is a huge county.</p><p>I can only speak on behalf of County Cork.  In fairness, the two or three services the Minister named should be welcomed.  I am not going to discredit any new service going to a community, but I have to reflect the reality as it stands on the ground.</p><p> A connection from Kinsale through to Clonakilty, which I would expect would take in Timoleague, Ballinspittle, Kilbrittain and any areas like that, is welcome.  I would be quite happy to welcome that.  Connections to Banteer, Rockchapel and other places are welcome.  However, what is going to happen to the people in Adrigole,  Eyeries, Allihies, Castletownbere, Kilcrohane, Ahakista, Ballydehob, Schull, Goleen, Union Hall and Glandore?  I could go on naming the areas in County Cork that are not going to get any services for about a week.  Is the Minister saying that the people who suffer from rural isolation should stay at home?  When one looks at expenditure in the Department, one sees that &euro;1.3 million was spent on evaluation for a sustainable transport service to Eachl&eacute;im.  If the Minister is spending &euro;1.3 million on something like that, why is he not spending a little bit more than &euro;450,000 on County Cork?  That amount will not facilitate the provision of a proper service.</p><p> Another problem arises in the context of the time limits of 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.  The Minister says he sat down with the vintners and the IFA.  I do not want to be insulting, but if he sat down with them, he must have had earmuffs on.  Common sense would tell him that  coming home at 11 p.m. is not suitable for any farmer.  Farmers are just going out at that time.  The IFA representatives definitely did not open their mouths to the Minister.  I doubt they were given any chance to offer a viewpoint.  The only reason the Minister is bringing the scheme forward and providing and the extra money is that we pushed for rural-proofing.  Initially, he did not look into rural-proofing this Bill.  However, we he was compelled to do so in the context of the programme for Government.</p><p> I do not think the Minister meets many farmers.  He says he is from a rural place.  Maybe there are farmers there; he should go out and talk to them.  When they have milked their cows - some of them have 60, 70, or 150 animals - fed their calves and carried out their work around the farm, they are lucky to be home at 9.30 p.m.  By the time they wash and get out, it is 10 p.m.  When they travel to the local community, whether to visit the neighbour or go to the pub, they will be lucky to be there at 10.15 p.m. or 10.30 p.m.  They will then have to be ready to go home at 10.55 p.m. It is not going to work.  This reflects a city mindset.  In the city, one goes out at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.  People in the city wonder if we are crazy in rural Ireland.  They say we do not go out until it is time to come home.  However, those are the facts.  The fact is that a farmer is in the same situation whether it is a Friday or a Saturday night.  The same applies to fishermen.  They work late.  They work long hours because sometimes their season is short and they have to take advantage while they can.  There are others who go to mass at 8 p.m. and go out for a nice sociable drink afterwards.  That service is not going to meet their needs.  Coming home at 11 p.m. is a joke.</p><p> This is designed to fail.  That is the plan here.  The Government intends to be able to revisit this service and claim that no one uses it, although no one will use it because it is no good for rural Ireland.  However, the Minister should go ahead if he thinks this is going to work.  I will be back to tell him again that he designed it to fail.  If it was meant to work, I would welcome it.  I want to see a service that lasts.  The Minister is not inventing the wheel, he is reinventing it.</p><p> I remember being involved in a community council in Goleen with Ms Sue Hill, who the Minister may know.  She was involved in the Mizen Tourism Co-operative Society.  We came up with a rural bus scheme to work at nigh, and we were able to run it effectively.  However, we were trying to run it on voluntary funds.  The then Minister for Rural, Community and Gaeltacht Affairs introduced the "booze bus", which was unfortunately called the wrong thing.  Again, it ran out of funds.  The bottom line is, the service needs to be better supported.  Forget about sixpence reviews, we can do the review here and now.  If the Minister wants it to run properly, we will tell him how to run it.</p><p> I am worried that many transport service companies were put off applying for routes that would cover as many areas as possible when they saw the initial figure of &euro;200,000.  It rose to &euro;450,000, by which time many had submitted their applications.  Perhaps they applied again.  I hope they did.  To be honest, I find it difficult to believe that this will tackle rural isolation because people will find its operating times difficult.  Moreover, I refer to the areas in County Cork that it covers.  I estimate that 35 or 40 services would be needed to cover some of the areas I have mentioned.  The Beara, Mizen Head and Sheep's Head peninsulas are huge and nobody has covered them.  That is where rural isolation takes effect.  One can look at the age profiles in the census.  As one goes farther into the peninsulas, the age profile increases.  That is rural isolation.  Somebody did not do their homework when writing this one.  They are not servicing the areas where real rural isolation is suffered.  Some areas may be covered by taxi services.  These areas in rural Ireland are not.  I rest my case.</p></speech>

He cannot expect me to agree with it.  He says that this is doomed to failure.  It seems to me that the wish is father to the thought.  He does not seem to want to give it a chance, and that is not in the interests of the people he represents.  This is not doomed to failure.  This is directed towards a great success for rural Ireland.  The Deputy says that a lot more could have been done for Cork.  I wonder why Cork did not apply for more when we called for applications.</p></speech>

We will not accept that it is doomed to failure.  I also said quite plainly, before the Deputy spoke, that I am very happy to look for more resources if this scheme looks as if it is going to work or if it needs expansion.  After the pilot scheme is over, I expect that the Deputy will join the link group in his area and that significant applications will be made.  I look forward to the latter.  That is the attitude I expect from him.  We are trying to do things for his constituents.  This will benefit his constituents.  He says it is only in a small way but what is wrong with that if it is a start?  Why does he not take this on board and see how it works?  Yes, it is not enough.  He wants a bit more or a lot more.  However, the template may well work.</p> <p>  In six months, when the pilot is over, I expect the Deputy not to say that he was right and that it was doomed to failure.  He has already given a hostage to fortune by saying it is doomed to failure.  This means it will be difficult for him to back down.  However, I expect him to say that it could be improved, that he would like the scheme to be expanded or that he would like more buses provided in different areas.  He has already mentioned all of those areas - Allihies, Schull, etc.  That is a perfectly legitimate argument to make, but I expect him to make it when this pilot scheme is over.  I would welcome that.</p> <p>  The Deputy says that he pushed for rural-proofing and that is why this happened.  I say to him that this happening has nothing whatsoever to do with him.  I have to say that.  I ask him not to claim credit for something for which he should not claim credit.  This came from other sources, other places, where - patently and obviously - there was demand.  The Deputy should not claim credit for a scheme which he then says is doomed to failure.</p></speech>

I have also been in political life for many years, albeit for a shorter period.  If this initiative works, I will praise the Minister here, just as I have praised how rural transport works.  The Department is funding rural transport.  If something works it works; if it needs tweaking it needs tweaking.  Tweaking is needed now.  Six months from now will not be the time to put this right.  If the Department is going to look after the people of rural Ireland and wants to be seen to be doing so, it should realise that 11 p.m. is no time to be thinking that people should come home after being out, regardless of whether they are visiting friends or having a drink.</p> <p>  The Minister allocated &euro;200,000 initially .

He is now trying to say the extra Rural Link runs have nothing to do with the road traffic legislation he is trying to push through the D&aacute;il, which will isolate so many in rural areas.  Both Minister and Deputy Heydon stood up in the D&aacute;il and said the initiative was to counteract rural isolation.  This was a reactionary attempt by them when we proved to them that they gave no recognition at all to rural-proofing in the Bill, which is going to isolate so many in rural areas.</p> <p>  I welcome any extra transport in rural areas but the Minister cannot have it both ways.  He and Deputy Heydon said in the D&aacute;il that the initiative was to help to offset the rural isolation they were causing.  One of the routes in Kerry, from Castlegregory to Cloghane-----</p></speech>

I have to start again now.  One of the services in Kerry that the Government made such a hullabaloo about was to take people from Castlegregory to Cloghane to a card game one Tuesday in the month for ten months.  Clearly, this is not any part of the pilot scheme because the Minister is saying the pilot scheme is for six months.  The initiative I am referring to is for ten months.  It is something that Rural Link was doing in any event.  I welcome it, however, and I welcome the fact that the people of Cloghane are being taken to Castlegregory.</p> <p>  While these routes are welcome, some of the people in the small villages are saying that if one takes people from a village to a town, one is hurting the village further.  The Minister is kind of blaming the Rural Link services for not making more applications or more expansive applications.  The Department said &euro;200,000 would be available nationally.  The Minister is all over the place now looking for this and that.  When the service providers were asked about this, they knew the context and the areas in question.  When the Minister gets a few more notes, I will talk again.</p> <p>  When the Department advertised or asked the local services to make submissions, the latter knew that, nationally, &euro;200,000 was not enough.  They also knew the extent of the problem.  Consider the circumstances if one were to service areas such as the Black Valley, Lauragh, places off the Ring of Kerry, Sneem and the vast areas around it and Glencar.  There is a mention of the latter.  Regarding the servicing of Glencar, &euro;200,000 would not service the area back to Caragh Lake and over to Glenbeigh and down into Cromane.  A sum of &euro;100,000 would not be enough for that area on its own.  The service providers knew that.  They have other things to be doing besides pandering and trying to make some kind of case to the Minister when they know they will not get the funds they require.</p> <p>  The Minister is saying that the Department will roll the scheme out further after six months.  I put it to him that it will roll it in.  Why is the Department not honouring the agreement on transport to the central schools?  When the Government closed down schools in 1956, it gave a commitment that it would transport people's children into the central school in Kilgarvan regardless.  It was to be free transport but that is not the case any more.  The Department has put barriers in the way such that there must be ten children in order for a run to operate.  The families in rural places cannot produce children like that.  One must produce another child or another two more to ensure that the bus service remains in place.  That is the honest truth.  The Department cannot fund the transport services it is supposed to be providing.  Therefore, it is hard for me to believe the Department is going to give endless money to help the people who will be isolated in rural areas.  They will be isolated.  They will be left at home.</p> <p>  The Minister alleged that my argument was to benefit my own pub.  The fact is that people go from house to house.  They have to travel three or four miles to a neighbour's house.  The done thing was to give a fellow a drink.  They cannot even have that now.  That is the truth.  They will be isolated in their homes.  They will be like a rabbit inside a burrow afraid to come out because the fox would catch it.  The same scenario will feature in rural Ireland.  People will not be able to go out to have just the one drink.  The Minister should forget it because his rural transport initiative does not go far enough.  I welcome whatever is in place that the Minister might have had something to do with but I know he had nothing to do with the service from Castlegregory to Cloghane.</p> <p>  The trouble is that the Minister thinks he is from rural Ireland.  My advice to him, bearing in mind that I will not take him around, is that he should get his Fine Gael colleagues to take him down to Kerry.  He will not do it in a day; he might do it in three weeks or a month.  He should take his summer holidays in Kerry in order to see what he is actually doing to the people there.</p><p>The  Minister is now admitting that there is a problem.  This follows our vast representations in the D&aacute;il Chamber outlining to the Minister how it will adversely affect people.  If the Minister thinks this will satisfy rural proofing, it will not.</p><p>When the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill is passed there will be no more mention about extra funding for rural transport to help people in their rural and isolated places down the narrow roads two, three and four miles into the lonely valleys.  Massive sums would be involved to meet the requirements following the Minister's devastating Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017.  The Minister does not have it, and if the Department had it, I do not believe it has the liking to give it to rural areas.  It is more likely to be given to Dublin and to the bigger towns and cities, which is the aim of the Project Ireland 2040 plan.  The Government is forgetting about rural Ireland.  I am sad that this is happening day in and day out.  I put it to the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il Chamber yesterday; he did not know what a demountable home is.  I do not believe his Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government-----</p></speech>

A great deal of good work has been done with the Local Link service.  I have seen it first-hand.  I might disagree with my colleagues on many issues but one issue that needs to be reviewed is the six p.m. to 11 p.m. service on Friday and Saturday nights.  Many years ago I had a pub and there was one man who came in every night at 8 p.m. and he went home at 11 p.m.  After some six months he returned to England because when he went home most of his neighbours were going out at 11.30 p.m.  I do not believe the six p.m. to 11 p.m. service will work.  I do not know how the Local Link administrators arrived at these times.  Perhaps 8 p.m. until 1 a.m. might work, but flexibility is needed.  On Friday or Saturday nights, people will not go home at 11 p.m.  As a person who once owned a pub, I found it harder to get people out of the pub than to get them into it.  I am not sure if the local buses are needed after 11 p.m. but this needs to be reviewed, if it is helpful.  Otherwise there are many positives in the proposal and I thank the Minister for the positive work he has done.</p></speech>

He has made a perfectly reasonable request.  This is a pilot trial.  I shall ask the National Transport Authority, NTA, to examine the times in response to what Senator Feighan and others have said today, which is fair.  How the NTA responds is up to it but if extending the hours reduces rural isolation further then it should consider this seriously.  That is a perfectly fair suggestion.</p> <p>  Deputy Healy-Rae's questioning of our motives is unreasonable.  This measure is a genuine attempt to tackle the curse of rural isolation.  It is probably not perfect - and this is why it is a pilot - but if it works we are very happy to build on it.  I do not welcome some people saying it is doomed from the start.  It will help in a small way to start, perhaps not be as much as the Deputy would like, but if it works in a small way there is no reason why it should not work in a bigger way.</p> <p>  I emphasise that rural isolation is a problem and the Deputy should take this seriously.  It is a problem that is represented in this House by many Members, including Deputy Heydon, as mentioned by the Deputy.  Drink-driving is a separate problem and we are not here to discuss that.  This measure and the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017, to legislate on drink-driving, are not connected, although they work in parallel.  The drink-driving Bill would be through the D&aacute;il by now if it was not being delayed and filibustered by the Deputy and others.  The Deputies have a right to do that but they should think about the consequences of what they have been doing and how serious it is for certain people and families.  We should consider one problem at a time.  Today we are discussing rural isolation.  Shortly, we will be in the D&aacute;il to speak on the Bill to legislate on drink-driving.  I appeal to the Deputy to cease the kinds of antics he has carried on with regard to that Bill because that will have serious consequences for people.</p> <p>  The Deputy said that I should go to Kerry.  I spent two days there not so long ago.  I met many Deputies and I sent a message to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  I asked him if he would join me at various venues in Kerry and I received no response whatsoever from him.  I was, however, grateful to be taken around Kerry for the two days.  The guy who took me around Kerry for the two days was Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.  It was a useful experience.  I learnt a great deal about what was happening on the ground in Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's county.  I am grateful to his brother for taking the time and trouble to bring the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport around Kerry.  I met with publicans and all sorts of groups, because he had me run off my feet meeting people.  This trip informed me a great deal about what we are doing here today and we are acting accordingly.</p> <p>  I regret that the Deputy could not join me while I was there, although he was in Kerry at the time.  It might have been of assistance if he had joined me; other Deputies did.  It is all very well coming up here and making a lot of noise but when I was in Kerry, it would have been helpful to meet.  I shall be in Kerry again soon and I invite the Deputy to join me and to show me what he is talking about in order that we can address these problems together.</p></speech>

I thank two people in particular, Fr. Gerard O'Connor and Fr. Pat Condon in Waterford and Tipperary who led it nationally and came up to the transport forum.  The rural transport system is doing well in the limited areas where it is provided.  I must declare I am a board member of Ring a Link, which operates in Tipperary, Carlow and Kilkenny.  The Minister mentioned that on 27 February 2018 the NTA issued a funding application to all 17 rural links to arrange a trial of evening and night services.  The deadline for receipt of applications was 16 March.  The NTA received applications for 50 services from 12 local link providers.  The figures here are vital and Deputy Collins was trying to deal with it.  I am on the board and we meet once a month.  It is very onerous and it is a voluntary board.  We have an excellent manager, staff, team, drivers and people sub-contracting.  We are busy trying to keep afloat and trying to manage with the funding we have.  The sum of &euro;200,000 for the country would not do one county or half a county.  That is the point.  Why would they apply and waste their time?  All of the application forms are huge.  They have to be able to stand up and be accurate and viable.  If there were &euro;2 million the Minister would have received a flood of applications.</p> <p>  I graciously accept what the Minister said to Senator Feighan about looking at the 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. service because it is ridiculous.  I know this from experience.  Ring a Link offered set routes one Christmas.  We are demand responsive and pick up at the door.  It is an excellent service but the Christmas service did not work out and it needs to be very different.  There is a pattern of people who want to socialise or visit people; it is not all about the pubs.  The Minister said everything is not about the pubs, but during the talks for Government I attended a pub, out of hours mind you in the early morning and through the back door, for a meeting with the residents and business people of Stepaside.  The Minister uses pubs when he wants to also, so he should not be bemoaning that fact.  Publicans pay wages to their staff and they pay rates.  They do a lot of work.  This funding is paltry in the extreme.  As I said, if the Ring a Link service got it we might try to put on three or four extra routes. </p> <p>  Many areas in the Minister's Department are running amok and Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned the &euro;2 million that has gone to consultants and on incidental issues while the Minister is giving us a paltry &euro;200,000.  In the D&aacute;il during the debate on the transport Bill, the Minister and Deputy Heydon welcomed a representation from Fine Gael.  Somebody operating under the auspices of the Minister spent &euro;2 million trying to link the public services card to driver licences.  To his credit the Minister pulled it, but &euro;2 million was wasted on a nonsense scheme.  There are millions for everything not to mind Dublin where there are billions for everything the Minister is announcing.  He talked about going to Kerry and he visited Tipperary and I thank him for that.  I brought him around and, in fairness to him, he looked at a lot of things, but he needs to be brought out much more to understand what goes on in rural Ireland because he does not know.</p> <p>  How are the board, the NTA and TII treating rural transport link groups and other voluntary bodies?  All of the stakeholders were brought to the meeting mentioned by the Minister, including the IFA.  The usual suspects are brought in and half the time the decision has been taken before they come in and the Minister knows this.  He knows what happened with the statutory instrument regarding the test for tractors.  Again, to his credit, the Minister revoked it when he found out it was done without any consultation.  The stakeholders come up here from their day's work.  Most of them are volunteers and what are they coming up for?  They are coming up for consultations that are finished before they get here.  It is an insult.  This has to change with regard to rural Ireland.  I am a passionate supporter of rural Ireland.  It is my duty as I represent rural Ireland.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned rickshaws.  He did not mention sulky racing, which is causing bedlam in my county and many other countries.  I have a Private Members' Bill, which the Minister could have asked me about and examined to see whether he could bring in aspects of it if he is so interested in saving lives.  There are ten year olds going around the main roads riding donkeys with no licences, no reflective jackets and no safety measures of any kind, but the Minister refuses to look at this.  We also have animal cruelty.  There were two horrible incidents in Tipperary where two horses were left for dead last week, one in Clonmel which thankfully recovered, and another incident last Friday morning.  The Minister would not look at this but he presents us as rural representatives in favour of drink-driving, which is something we are totally not.  The mental health issue in Tipperary is savage.  It has never been more acute.  We have a mental health services Bill, and what the Minister is doing by taking these measures is feeding into it.</p> <p>  The Minister has said we are delaying the Bill.  We are delaying it but the Minister delayed it by recommitting it and now he will have to recommit the judicial appointments Bill also.  He is a man who does not know what he is doing.  He is not in control of what is happening.  I have been here for ten years and I have never seen Bills recommitted but because the Minister has made, in the words of an Attorney General, such a dog's dinner of the Bill it has been recommitted.  It is a pig's mess, a slop. </p> <p>  This year is no good to us.  We are ready to take up money at Ring a Link with our manager, Jackie Meally, to try to offer some type of service to the people I represent in Ahenny, Faugheen, Kilcash, Ninemilehouse, Ballingarry, Killenaule, The Commons, Emly,  and Cullen in south Tipperary.  We also have Soloheadbeg and Hollyford, Newcastle, Burncourt, Skeheenarinky, Kilsheelan, Annacarty, Cappawhite, Drumbane, Holycross, Upperchurch, Newtown, Dolla and Templetuohy.  We do not have services there either.</p> <p>  We have three or four five day a week services in fairness.  We put on extra Christmas services some years ago when we got some extra money from the Department and it is all accounted for.  One night we spent two hours at a board meeting trying to reconcile a &euro;20 underpayment to Pobal for an audit and rightly so.  That is the type of accountability we have for &euro;20.  The Minister can spend &euro;1.3 million on a US company that knows nothing about Ireland; he can spend &euro;500,000 on incidentals and he can spend &euro;2 million on a hamfisted effort to try to force people to have their public services card linked to their driver licence.  Then the Minister added in L-plate drivers, which will totally isolate young people.  It will deny them work and educational opportunities.  Anyone here in Dublin tonight will fall over taxis and buses.  There is also the Luas and the DART.  I do not begrudge the people here anything but we are entitled to some modicum of service.  The &euro;460,000 would not operate the logistics.  We have a very sophisticated service in Carlow and Kilkenny, and I invite the Minister to Kilkenny to Ring a Link's headquarters for the three county project to see the booking service.  It is capable of doing an awful lot more but we need funding.  The &euro;460,000 would not organise the logistics for the 50 schemes because they need manpower to be operated.  It is very sophisticated.  There are tracking devices with which one can find people standing on the road if it were operated properly.  It is exceptional equipment, funded by the Department in the main but with a lot of hard work from voluntary boards.  We must respect these voluntary boards, the volunteers, the paid staff and the bus contractors.  This is like sticking a Band-Aid on a finger that has been cut off instead of going to have a serious operation in hospital.</p> <p>  With regard to the L-plates, the Minister will criminalise young people.  They are applying for their tests but they have to wait-----</p></speech>

A lot of colleges of further education have evening courses.  I am making the point it is so discriminatory against rural dwellers.  I will be going to a different building in this town to make sure it is stopped because it is discriminatory against people I represent and I will not stand for it.</p><p>The Minister can laugh if he likes and make little of it.  Several buses pass the Minister's house and he can get a taxi in a minute.  I tried to get a taxi last Sunday night at 12 midnight.  The pub closing time was 11.30 p.m.  The taxi driver brought me and a friend three miles.  He left me there for two hours until he finished all the local runs.  I had to go ten miles but in fairness, he brought me home at 2 a.m.  That is the type of service we have.  We do not have these services in rural Ireland.  Taxis are touting for business in Dublin and are in each other's way.  I brought the Minister down to Tipperary to examine other issues as well - for example, the issue of rail crossings.  I raised the issue of seat belts on buses in the interest in child safety.  It is all relevant but to provide &euro;460,000 for a service like this is an insult.  I am not saying it is doomed to fail; it is not.  It will help a small area but the number of services are only the tip of the iceberg.  I know what I am talking about; I have been a board member of Ring a Link for 20 years.  I know the services we have and the money we get every year, which is roughly &euro;1 million.  We are providing day services.</p><p> We have the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  Mr. John O'Brien and Mr. John Esmonde lost their lives off Helvick Head but who is policing the waters, the pleasure craft and everything else?  Their boat was turned upside down and they were killed.  A proper investigation was not carried out by the Garda or by the Minister.  There are no answers for the families of those two young men.  There are many other areas of safety.  Deputies Collins and Healy-Rae and others who are passionate about rural Ireland should not be attacked and it should not be said that we are filibustering for the sake of it.  We are filibustering in regard to this legislation because it is bad.  The legislation is wrong, it is discriminatory against rural dwellers and it will never be right because the Minister will not listen to anyone.  The main reason for the delay is that it was recommitted.  The Minister made a hames of it and a dogs dinner of the other one.</p></speech>

I have engaged with the Minister over the years and I thank him for coming to Tipperary.  I am not saying he should know everything about rural Ireland or that I should know everything about Dublin, because I do not.  It is a broad brief.  Money, however, is being wasted.  The Minister railed against quangos but the quangos he has under his remit, including the RSA and others, are bloated.  The Minister railed against them all his life but is now defending them.  He is providing &euro;1.5 million for consultants to examine the logistics for rural travel.  This is a patent and disgraceful waste of money.  This expenditure should be raised at the Committee of Public Accounts, and I might raise it with it.  A further &euro;500,000 is proposed for incidentals.  Money is flush in this Department.  I know the Minister does not have a driver and he is prudent in that regard, but what about the waste that is going on under his nose?  It is scandalous.</p> <p>  The proposal of a paltry &euro;460,000 would not manage the system, never mind run it.</p></speech>

I have made it absolutely clear that this is a pilot scheme.  There is money allocated for Local Link in Tipperary, which the Deputy should welcome.  The Deputy should also welcome the fact that if that works, we have promised that we will look at expanding it.  This is only a start.  We are prepared to try this and the Deputy should be prepared to try this as well.  I wish he would join with me in saying that we should give this the benefit of the doubt and that if it works, we will increase it if more resources are available.  That is what rural isolation needs; it needs connectivity.  Cities, towns and villages need connectivity.  That is what this is an attempt to do.  It may not be as fast as the Deputy would like and it may not be to his taste but that is what we are doing.  It is not the tip of an iceberg; it is an honest attempt to address the problems which the Deputy undoubtedly finds in his area.</p> <p>  I do not want to address the committee on subjects like going to a pub early in the morning for a cup of coffee, as if there is some sort of secret about it.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The Deputy and I went to a pub at 11 o'clock in the morning.  That is absolutely fine; there is nothing wrong with that and no big revelation in that.</p> <p>  I am puzzled sometimes when people claim to be the voice of rural Ireland, which Deputy McGrath does.  The majority of the voices of rural Ireland I hear welcome this scheme.  They are saying it is not enough and that they want more but they want to see if it works and that they want it to work.  Sometimes I wonder if those who claim to be the voice of rural Ireland really have the support of all of rural Ireland.</p> <p>  In that context, I welcome the fact Newcastle in County Tipperary voted "Yes" in the referendum.  Clonmel voted "Yes", Tipperary voted "Yes"-----</p></speech>

As it happens, this discussion is extremely timely.  In recent weeks, I indicated I would make a decision on the preferred policy approach to the issue of rickshaws before the end of this D&aacute;il term and I intend to do that.</p> <p>  Like many members of the committee, I have deep concerns about public safety with rickshaws and their activities on our streets.  All of us have seen these vehicles.  Complaints range from blocking footpaths and forcing pedestrians onto the road, weaving recklessly in and out of traffic, paying little or no heed to the rules of the road and breaking red lights to driving the wrong way up one-way streets and transporting passengers with little care for their safety.  Collisions have also occurred.  A National Transport Authority, NTA, survey found that 57% of rickshaw passengers reported accidents or near misses, which is a shocking, stark statistic, but there is much more.</p> <p>  While it is accepted that many in the rickshaw industry have no involvement in criminality, it is a fact that over the past 18 months, 154 rickshaw drivers have been arrested under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, which deals with possession of a controlled drug for sale or supply, while operating as a rickshaw driver in the Pearse Street district alone.  This is not tolerable.  The Garda is committed, focused and doing great work to tackle drug pushing and address criminal threats.  My Department also has an important part to play as we decide the optimal regulatory approach for rickshaws.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, I asked the NTA to undertake a public consultation last autumn.  My intention was that this would inform the regulatory impact assessment which must be undertaken in the context of developing new legislation.  More than 4,800 responses were received, reflecting a keen level of interest and concern.  The NTA consultation process reaffirmed many of the concerns that had been raised with me, including issues such as dangerous behaviour on public roads, lack of lighting, no insurance, illegal use of rickshaws in pedestrian zones, obstruction of buses and blocking of taxis from taxi ranks.  It also found concern about the lack of a transparent fare structure, with 44% of passengers in the survey reporting issues with rickshaw charges.  It seems that passengers are sometimes led to believe that one fare is to be charged but when they arrive at their destination, it turns out that the figure quoted was per person, rather than for the journey.  Such behaviour is obviously unacceptable.</p> <p>  I will now address Deputy Munster's amendment.  I am well aware that many members have been converted as regards the need to take action about the activities associated with rickshaws.  We all have the same concerns about safety on our streets and protection for passengers.  When Deputy Munster put forward an amendment to the Road Traffic Bill that would give suitable powers to the NTA to regulate rickshaws, the D&aacute;il was in agreement and I accepted the amendment, which the House passed.  It was unfortunate that I was unable to commence the provision, which is now section 31 of the associated Act.  However, it was wise to heed legal advice indicating there would be a real risk attaching to any regulations made under the section.</p><p>The risk was considered unacceptably high with a strong likelihood of the regulations being challenged and ultimately struck down in the courts.<br/><br/>Despite this setback, I have made it clear on many occasions in the D&aacute;il that I have always shared the concerns relating to rickshaws and that I am actively taking steps to address these.  The NTA public consultation was one important element of this process.<br/><br/>I also instructed my Department to conduct international research and consider regulatory models in other EU member states' cities and to engage with a range of stakeholders like the NTA itself, the RSA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council and others in the local authority sector.  Considering the legislative options was always going to be the most critical step.  It was also an extraordinarily complex one which few had anticipated initially.<br/><br/>It is clear to me that the choice is between a full and effective licensing regime and complete prohibition.  Retaining the <i>status quo</i>is not an option.  In relation to the public consultation, I must admit that I was surprised when the majority, at 54%, supported an outright ban.  Introducing regulation was favoured by less, at 38%.  In any case, a full analysis of both options was needed.<br/><br/>Any new regulatory regime for rickshaws would have to focus on public safety and consumer protection.  To do this effectively, new legislative provisions would be needed in the areas of: driver and operator licensing, vehicle registration and licensing, rickshaw roadworthiness involving an NCT-style test, motor tax, fares regulation, regulation in the standards of service, and offences and penalties to allow for proper enforcement.<br/><br/>All this would lead to better customer experience and an improvement in the management of safety for passengers, as well as for other road users.  Rickshaws are arguably meeting a certain niche demand which is not being met by the traditional public transport services.  According to the survey, 38% want to retain them.  Regulating would allow rickshaws to continue in operation, contributing a fun and vibrant aspect to city life.<br/><br/>However, significant resources would need to be invested.  More administration and enforcement resources would be needed in the NTA and the Garda, possibly also in the RSA.  Implementing a full licensing regime together with enforcement would come at a substantial cost to the State - all for a relatively small number of vehicles.  It is estimated by the NTA that there are 1,000 rickshaws in Dublin.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest concern for me is the challenge in defining the rickshaw vehicle in law.  The rickshaw is driven on the public road.  This means, if we want to regulate them, that we first must amend road traffic legislation.  Since there is extensive litigation under that legislation, we must be exact as to how we define a vehicle.<br/><br/>As the committee will be aware, there are different types of rickshaw &ndash; some are pedal powered and some have a motor.  The NTA advises that pedal powered rickshaws can easily be converted to motorised, in fact, within minutes, by attaching a small motor to the back axle.  The motor can be removed just as quickly.  One actually can change the creature within a few minutes.  All this means that any new legislation for rickshaws will need to be developed with extreme care.  Of course, the new regime will bring benefits but it will be costly to implement, and it may well prove difficult to enforce in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>Allegations of dangerous driving by rickshaws, illegal movements in pedestrian zones and fears about public safety are growing all the time.  A ban on rickshaws on the public road would deal comprehensively with these concerns.  It would be a significant step forward in managing the risk for public safety.<br/><br/>New legislation would be needed but enforcement of a ban should cost significantly less than implementing a full new regulatory regime.  We would still have to define the rickshaw vehicle in law, and provide for detention powers, but this would involve a much simpler piece of legislation.  Enforcement should also be less resource intensive - the NTA would not need extra staff and garda&iacute; could be empowered to act decisively when coming upon a rickshaw on a public road.<br/><br/>After a transition period, it seems likely that rickshaws would disappear from our streets.  I am aware that some members of the public would be inconvenienced and it is true that with a ban, our cities could miss out on the sense of adventure and fun that rickshaws can bring.<br/><br/>I am conscious also that there are compliant people who earn a legitimate living from these services and that a ban would have an adverse impact on them.  A small number of operators reported in the survey that they have invested in significant numbers of rickshaws and there are also many drivers who work part-time in the sector.  Impacts would all have to be carefully weighed.<br/><br/>As this issue was raised first by members of this committee in the D&aacute;il, I do not want to take a decision before seriously consulting what they have to say.  It is not an issue, as far as I am concerned, that will be politically divisive.  It is merely something on which we can combine to address and resolve.  If members here today have suggestions which we have not thought of in the Department and have not been thought of by the NTA, the Garda any of the other stakeholders or the operators themselves, let us have them and let us include them because the complications in addressing this issue have been somewhat surprising and it has not been as simple as it seemed it was the day that I accepted Deputy Munster's amendment in the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>Equally, I am conscious of the intentions of the D&aacute;il as expressed in the adoption of Deputy Munster&rsquo;s amendment.  I share deep concerns about the hazards of rickshaws.  Regulation could be effective if implemented using comprehensive and tight controls, but this would come at a cost.  Given the very small proportion of the market being served by rickshaws, the preferred approach would be to opt for an outright ban.  It is believed it will achieve the desired outcome of improved public safety at a proportionate cost for the taxpayer.<br/><br/>However, this option is not entirely without obstacles.  My officials are engaging with the Office of the Attorney General to consider the blockages which might arise with the preferred approach, including how best to weigh and balance private interests in the context of the public good.<br/><br/>Members here will say that legal advice causes delay.  It always does, but I will not introduce a law which is subject to challenge because then, rightly, I would be told I had rushed it in circumstances where it was not essential.  I know that I need to be clear, not only that the right decision is being made but that it is being made in the right way and that it is legally viable.<br/><br/>Once consultations with the Office of the Attorney General are complete, I expect to be in a position to finalise and announce my decision before the end of this D&aacute;il term.  In the meantime, I wish to put the rickshaw sector on notice that, whether by regulation or prohibition, the days of indulging a reckless activity that appears to be running amok are coming to a close.</p></speech>

If the Minister banned them, would that have implications for those who have been legitimately investing in them?  Would they have a claim for compensation for loss of earnings or loss of income?  The Minister need not answer these questions now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.751" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018053000002#P00500"><p>I think I can answer that.  That is one of the issues which the Attorney General is considering.  I do not know everything the Attorney General is considering but there are two issues which obviously come to mind.  The first is the ownership of the property and the right to the ownership of the property and whether it has implications for those owners, and whether compensation would have to be paid or whether we can even do it in those circumstances.  The second is the issue of the people's right to work.  To be depriving them of a living has possible constitutional implications as well.  Those two matters are being considered.</p> <p>  They also have human implications as well.  There are obviously people earning a legitimate living driving rickshaws and presumably doing all the right things, and what we do not know is how many are doing that and how many are not.</p></speech>

It is clear that both he and his Department have given this issue thorough thought.  I welcome what he has said about it and that he is putting the operators and drivers on notice.  It is clear that he is close to making a decision and I appreciate him consulting us, particularly Deputy Imelda Munster who proposed the legislation.  In politics people might forgive the making of a wrong decision, but they will not forgive not making a decision.  It is incumbent, therefore, on the Minister and the Department to make a decision on this matter which has been ongoing for quite a few years.  Rickshaws pose a danger to the public.  It is clear from the National Transport Authority survey, in which 57% of people said they had been involved in either an accident or a near miss, that rickshaws are a danger to the public.  If this statistic was related to any other mode or means of public transport, for example, taxis, we would have representatives of all of the taxi associations before us in the morning.  The figure of 57% for persons who were involved in an accident or a near misses cannot be understated in any way.  The issue is incredibly serious and it does not even start to take into account the issues exposed by Conor Lally in <i>The Irish Times</i>and the RT&Eacute; investigations and expos&eacute;s about the widespread dealing of drugs from these vehicles.  It is clear to me and the public that something needs to be done about it.  Some 4,800 responses to the public consultation process is a remarkable number.  On the breakdown of the data, in his submissin the Minister gives one subcategory - that 54% favour an outright ban, whereas only 38% favour some form of regulation.  That gives a total figure of 92%.  I presume the remaining 8% favoured retaining the <i>status quo</i>.  Is that right?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.758" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018053000002#Q00600"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.759" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1304" speakername="Noel Rock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018053000002#Q00700"><p>On the other questions, would it be possible to supply us with a breakdown in tablular format of how people responded to the other questions in the public consultation process?  It would be appreciated.  It is clear to me that if 92% favour a change, it breaks down 40:60, with 40% wanting regulation and 60% a complete ban.  I wonder what the 40%, or 38% overall in the survey, would say if the Minister only gave them a binary choice between a ban and keeping it as it is?  It is clear that regulation would be fraught with unforeseen difficulties with regard to rights of property and of the individual to work.  As it stands, on the challenges the Minister sees and the length of time we have devoted to the issue, is the Minister in favour of a ban?  Would he prefer the Oireachtas to proceed in that manner?  Would he prefer to see further related amendments to the Road Traffic Act?  It is clear to me that regulation for such a small industry which would be fraught with difficulties that the Minister has outlined and which I have reiterated would be deeply impractical.  I have never been to another European city, or any city, where I have seen rickshaws operate in such a haphazard manner which puts passengers and pedestrians in danger.  This issue is raised frequently in my constituency office and clinics.  It is of concern to the wider public.  In politics we often talk about resolving the bigger issues of housing, the health service and so on, but what would it say if, after two and a half years of this D&aacute;il, I were to go back to people and say I could not even tackle the issue of rickshaws in Dublin city centre, given that 57% have reported that they have either been involved in an accident or a near miss?  Time is of the essence.  I would appreciate hearing the Minister's personal thoughts on whether we should proceed in a more wholehearted manner towards a ban, as opposed to tinkering with the idea of regulation any further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.760" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018053000002#Q00800"><p>The Minister has said he does not want to be accused of rushing any legislation.  In his over two years as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport he has brought forward two Bills.  Therefore, no one will accuse him of rushing legislation.  He can relax on that score.  As far back as 2013 Dublin City Council tried to bring forward by-laws for rickshaws and we are still discussing the issue.  In December 2017 my colleague, Deputy Imelda Munster, and I brought forward an amendment to the legislation that was going through.  On 14 December 2017 the Minister said: &quot;I appeal to the Deputies to withdraw their proposals at this point to allow the NTA to develop a comprehensive response and to introduce legislation under the right Act to regulate rickshaws.&quot;  The Government tried to vote down the amendment, but, unfortunately for the Minister, or fortunately for those who were trying to have regulations introduced, we won the vote on it.  Two months later I asked the Minister how plans were coming on for the regulation of the industry and the timeframe for commencing the regulations.  He replied: &quot;I share the Deputy's concerns about the need for regulation of rickshaws, but it would not be appropriate to commence Section 31 of the Road Traffic Act 2016 before (1) the legal position is clarified and (2) I have considered the NTA's proposals on an appropriate and robust regulatory framework for rickshaws.&quot;  I asked again on 16 May 2017 and the Minister said: &quot;I share the Deputy's concerns about the need for regulation of rickshaws and I hope to finalise my consideration of both the legal advice and the NTA proposals shortly.&quot;  In July 2017 I again asked how things were coming along again and the Minister said:</p><blockquote>I am proceeding with the drafting of the Heads of a Bill to provide for a new Part to be inserted into the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 exclusively for the regulation of rickshaws.  The approach will, amongst other things, ensure that the relevant interactions with the existing legislative framework under the 2013 Act for small public service vehicles (taxis, hackneys and limousines) are properly integrated; the definition of 'rickshaw' will encompass all known types of rickshaw, in particular the most prevalent type of rickshaw in operation which has an electric motor which provides assistance to the person pedalling the rickshaw, and the principles and policies will be set out in primary legislation as to the matters which the NTA may provide for in regulations, thereby giving the NTA the necessary powers to regulate.</blockquote> <p>That was in July last year.  At the beginning of this year, on 16 January, I asked how things were coming along.  The Minister replied that it was his intention to progress the drafting of the heads of a Bill without delay.  It is evident that there has been much procrastination within the Minister's Department.  Meanwhile, both he and Deputy Noel Rock are right that there have been many unfortunate instances, that there has been criminal activity and that people have been put at risk by the lack of action by the Minister and the Department in prioritising this work.  I am not convinced that an outright ban is the correct way to go.  There is merit - judging by his replies to me in the past 18 months, the Minister thought there was merit - in bringing forward legislation.  Last night on Wikipedia I looked at information on rickshaws.  The first use of the term dates back to 1879.  That is how long they have been in use across the world.  If one looks at the section on their use in the 21st century, it states, &quot;The 21st century has seen a resurgence in rickshaws, particularly motorized rickshaws and cycle rickshaws ... They are increasingly being used as an eco-friendly way of short-range transportation, particularly in urban areas&quot;.</p><p>Rickshaws are being used for tourism because of their novelty value as an entertainment form of transport.  Rickshaws and trishaws are used in most large continental European cities, including Vienna, Copenhagen, Paris, Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Budapest, Milan, Rome, Amsterdam, Oslo, Krakow, Saint Petersburg, Barcelona and Valencia.  There are huge opportunities in this regad and the Minister's approach is lazy.  What interaction has he had with the authorities in the cities where rickshaws are regulated?  Without doubt, they need to be regulated.  Operators need to be vetted and insured, the vehicles need to be roadworthy and operators need to be complaint in paying their tax as self employed people.  There are many people, particularly students, who see them as an opportunity to supplement their incomes.  An Irish company, Ecocabs Ireland, has invested in 12 eco-friendly cabs which are certified roadworthy, safe, fully insured and create employment for 20 people.  The Minister needs to go back to the drawing board and to bring urgency to address of this issue.  We know from reports in <i>The Irish Times</i>and from the RT&Eacute; &quot;Prime Time&quot; expos&eacute; that there are practices that need to be rooted out but we know also that there are huge opportunities here.  If people had to pay a licence fee for such vehicles, that yield would cover the costs associated with same.</p></speech>

As mentioned by Deputy Troy, many countries have managed to regulate rickshaws.  They enhance tourism and the experience for tourists, with a huge increase in take-up at weekends.  They are an additional form of transport for students and so on.  Many countries have managed to regulate rickshaws.  Is the Minister saying that there is no expertise within his Department to do this or that he cannot be bothered to regulate by amendment of road traffic legislation, as per the amendment put to him 18 months ago?  As I said, this problem has been on the radar for a long time but up to now nothing has been done.  The Minister has come up with every excuse under the sun not to regulate.  Following on from his opening statement, it appears to me that he is leaning towards an outright ban of rickshaws.  That is the wrong approach.</p> <p>  The Minister has not updated the committee on the outcome of the public consultation.  He stated earlier that he has instructed his Department to conduct international research and to consider regulatory models in other EU member states but he also did not bother to furnish the committee with that analysis.  Will he supply a copy of those documents?  The amendments put forward by Deputy Troy and I sought to bring about regulation of this area.  The Minister's argument for banning rickshaws is based on safety issues such as that they block footpaths, weave in and out of traffic, do not have proper lighting and are not insured, particularly for passengers.  However, the reason for these issues is the lack of regulation.  Rather than regulate, the Minister is taking the lazy option of banning them.  If other countries can regulate, so can we.  The Minister needs to try to keep up with other countries.  If it is the case that the expertise in this regard is not available within the Department then the Minister should say so.  Otherwise, it appears he is just not bothered to regulate.</p> <p>  As I said, my amendment sought to regulate rickshaws, which would deal with the safety issues.  Other Deputies are of the same opinion.  We are asking the Minister to regulate them.  Also, there are jobs at stake.  If there are 1,000 rickshaws, then, unless they are in people's gardens filled with bedding plants, there are 1,000 drivers.  That is a conservative estimate.</p></speech>

For example, rickshaws are being operated in Cork.  Earlier this year, 19 rickshaws were seized as part of a Garda operation, conducted jointly with the Revenue Commissioners.  There are three options open to us: first, we can allow the current situation to continue; second, we can heavily regulate the trade;, and, third, we can ban rickshaws.  The first option is a non-runner.  In a survey of people who have been passengers on rickshaws, 57% indicated that the rickshaw had been involved in an accident or a near-miss, which is an incredible statistic.  Approximately 44% of those surveyed reported a lack of transparency regarding charges, with people being told a price for a group only to be told later that the price quoted was per person.  As I said, the first option is a non-runner.</p> <p>  On regulation, the Minister has pointed to the volume of work and cost involved in this regard, which I accept are points that need to be weighed.</p><p>Rickshaw drivers are in competition with taxi drivers to a certain extent.  One could talk about a level playing pitch, with regulation for taxi drivers and rickshaws.  This would involve up to 20 things, one of which is public liability insurance.  Some 57% of rickshaw drivers have had accidents or near accidents but not many have public liability insurance so it is an absolute must.  An NCT-style system whereby drivers would have work permits is also an idea.<br/><br/>It is legitimate to ask whether regulations to bring about a level playing pitch would cause the rickshaw industry to collapse.  I would ask whether the industry was only able to be operated on the basis of exploitation, cost-cutting and dangerous practices.  Examples from other countries and cities where the system works have been provided.  However, we are talking about Ireland - specifically, Dublin, Cork and other places.  If there was serious regulation, I would question whether the industry would be able to survive.  That might point towards the idea of an outright ban and we would be open to a discussion on this idea but there are issues with that too, the main one being employment.  It concerns me that no figures have been produced as to the number of people employed in this field.  From the number of rickshaws, it would seem the number employed is more likely to be in the thousands than the hundreds.  It is not full-time employment in the vast majority of cases and it involves the sort of a money a student would have to assist them as they go through college.  For a lot of the people who do the work, however, I am sure it is the money which pays their rent.  If they did not have the income, they would not have the rent and it has unintended, knock-on consequences in that regard.<br/><br/>We would not be prepared to entertain the idea of a ban without some significant provision being put in place in the way of alternative employment, compensation or other measures for people who rely on their job as an income.  The <i>status quo</i>is a complete non-runner and while we are open to discussing regulation, we would question whether the industry would collapse if it was too serious.  We are also open to discussing an outright ban but a serious issue is how to cater for the people who do the work in this industry.</p></speech>

Having said what I have just said, the rickshaws do provide competition and, with the big urban areas becoming more pedestrianised and having more one-way traffic systems, people find that rickshaws provide a good service.  Taxi drivers are doing their best to compete but using a rickshaw to get from A to B can save a third of one's time, although they are not cheap.  I will not be looking for an outright ban but I will support previous speakers who called for regulation and legislation.</p> <p>  Rickshaws are also a tourist attraction and we need competition.  In central Dublin, the Luas gets the right of way over Dublin Bus at St. Stephen's Green.  The one-way systems and pedestrianised roads are an issue for taxi drivers.  Rickshaws have to be catered for but I believe that legislation should be put in place.  A ban on rickshaws would be like taking the jaunting car tour operators out of Killarney and rickshaws have become synonymous with our major cities.  Legislation should be put in place for safety purposes.</p></speech>

I am not in favour of an outright ban and I believe a middle ground can be achieved.  Unless we get to the middle ground, however, I would understand where the Minister is coming from on this matter.</p> <p>  I have always believed that local councils should be able to regulate jaunting cars.  There were issues with the number of horse and cart vehicles around the Guinness factory in my area.  Eventually, councillors came up with a regulation as to where they would park and what standards would apply, although we were told that this was not for rickshaws.  The Minister mentioned the variety of rickshaws but the only ones with which there is a road safety problem are those which are cycled because the motorised ones are covered by the Road Traffic Act and drivers have to have insurance and all the other safety elements.  This may not be the case with converted bikes, however.</p> <p>  Rickshaws are also vehicles for hire and that should mean a different approach.  There are regulations around taxis, which cannot just go out and ply their trade willy-nilly.  People complain to me about rickshaws ripping them off but I tell them not to pay them as they have no right to look for money.  If a person gets into one and the driver is wiling to bring him or her around the city, he or she can get out and say "Thanks a lot".  It is just hard luck on the driver if the person does not pay because there is no commercial contract if a driver does not have a licence to ply his or her trade in this city.  They are street traders and every street trader has to have a licence.  I am a firm believer in a licensing regime and that a regulation system will pay for itself with the costs of registering a vehicle and having an NCT each year, as well as applying for a licence and sitting the driving test.</p> <p>  It is up to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to stop what we saw on RT&Eacute; lately.  If that means harassing those who are illegally transporting drugs around the city in rickshaws, so be it.  Taxi drivers have complained for years about the joint social welfare, customs, immigration and garda patrols targeting them so why should those who break the law not also be targeted?</p><p>That should have been done on an ongoing basis, which might have addressed some of those who have become involved in these activities.  </p><p> If the Minister wishes, from a health and safety perspective, I would have no problem in supporting him in banning rickshaws overnight as long as regulations were put in place very soon thereafter.  I have seen the amendment which we were told could not be implemented.  The Department was supposed to come back with an alternative but that was many months ago.  My own joint policing committee wrote to the Minister and the NTA to try to ascertain when it could act on this because it is an issue in my area.  I have dealt with a number of people who have been injured in accidents involving rickshaws.  There is absolutely no comeback against drivers or owners because there is no way to identify them.  There is no registration number on the rickshaws and those involved in these accidents disappear as quickly as possible.  One woman broke her arm when a rickshaw toppled over, its wheel having come off.  The driver simply legged it and left the rickshaw there.  There was no way of contacting him or even determining if he was the owner of the rickshaw.  There is no mechanism for chasing up drivers or owners.</p><p> The Minister said in his opening statement that this is a major resource issue for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the NTA.  Kevin Street Garda station, one of the stations in the city centre that would cover a lot of the areas in which rickshaws operate, has 46 fewer garda&iacute; than ten years ago.  Even with the recent increases, that station only got an extra three garda&iacute;.  The Garda station itself is brand new and looks brilliant but there is nobody in it because very few garda&iacute; are based there.  I accept that this is not the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It may be under his control in Stepaside but not in this context.  That said, he should ask the Minister for Justice and Equality when he will provide additional resources, not just to city centre Garda stations in Dublin, but also to stations in Cork, Galway and Limerick which also have a problem with rickshaws, to enable them to tackle the illegal activities in which some drivers are involved.</p><p> I am reluctant, given their quirky contribution to tourism, to ban rickshaws.  It is something that people do when they go abroad.  I do not get rickshaws in Dublin because I know my way around and I walk but some people enjoy them.  We should consider regulating them.  When rickshaws first came on the scene in this city, they were sponsored by a company - I think 7 Up - and they were all a standard size and the drivers wore a uniform.  Rides were free, with the option of giving a tip to the driver.  The rickshaws were basically mobile advertisements.  That is something that could be looked at again in the context of regulation.  Perhaps rickshaws could carry advertisements as a way of generating funding.  Dublin Tourism could use to them to advertise different attractions in the city and the same could apply in Galway or Cork.  They could also be used by local authorities rather than just for commercial advertising.  </p><p> I am very concerned about the state of some of the vehicles that are plying their trade, day in and day out.  What goes in this city, particularly at weekends, must be addressed.  We have regulated other public service vehicles, including horses-and-carts.  We can address both aspects of this.  We can tackle the problems while allowing the positive trade to continue.</p></speech>

Before I invite the Minister to respond, I have a few points to make myself.  The first problem is defining a rickshaw.  If we want to ban it, we must define it.  When is a rickshaw not a rickshaw?  Whatever way one defines it, one will find that others will have a different construction.  It is hugely important, if we go down the road of regulating them, that we are very clear about what we are doing.  We must know exactly what the cost will be.  We must determine the number of users, which we do not know at present.  We do not know how many rickshaws are operating at present.  We know the problems they are causing and we also know about the good things they are doing.  There is a balance to be struck here and I welcome the fact that the Minister is here today to listen to the views of committee members on this issue.</p> <p>  If a significant number of rickshaw drivers have been convicted of drug-related offences, that is very serious.  However, if drug dealers have rickshaws taken from them tomorrow, they will resort to bicycles or other modes of transport to deliver illegal drugs.  The issue is the demand for drugs.  In that sense, banning rickshaws will not change the fact that drugs are being dealt on our streets; it will just mean that the vehicles by which they are delivered changes.  </p> <p>  A lot of those driving rickshaws are students and others on low incomes who are trying to make a few extra shillings, which is both good and healthy.  We must bear that in mind.  We may be talking about up to 1,000 part-time jobs which is very important to the economy.  The economy benefits from rickshaws but not from those drivers who are breaking the law, including those who are on the road without insurance and who do not adhere to proper safety standards.  Clearly that must stop but we need to know more.  We also need to look at the rickshaw industry internationally to determine best practice in terms of regulation.  We must find out and learn from the experience abroad.  Obviously, similar issues would have arisen in other jurisdictions.  If we ban them today, they will be replaced tomorrow by something similar.  That will not solve the problem.  There could also be huge costs involved in compensating owners if rickshaws are banned.  Issues have arisen regarding the legal cessation of other activities which involved huge compensation pay outs.  </p> <p>  In terms of dealing with cowboy operators, I would not have a problem with insisting that rickshaw owners and drivers have tax clearance certificates and go through the other due diligence processes that apply to taxi drivers.  As I said, I welcome the Minister's willingness to come before us to discuss these matters.  Would it be possible to designate specific routes for rickshaws initially?  Would it be possible to confine them to the area within the canals, for example?  Where are they most prevalent and where is the greatest benefit to tourism to be found?  I would imagine it is within the city's core.  There are ways and means of addressing these issues.  I now invite the Minister to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-30a.775" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2018053000002#T00300"><p>There is an awful lot there.  I will try to address points in the order they were made but may end up jumping around a bit.  I thank everyone for contributing to this discussion.  We have heard completely differing views, which is what I expected, as well as different suggestions as to how we deal with this issue.  The deeper one delves into this, the more complications one finds.  There are individual and property rights involved here which must not be breached.  There are other issues which are simply a matter of right and wrong but above all, there are the dangers that these vehicles pose to the public, with which we must deal.  While there is no single, right solution it is principally a matter of public safety.  We must find a way to secure public safety, which is endangered at the moment, without causing hardship to those involved in legitimate activities, as a large number of operators undoubtedly are at the moment.</p><p>There are a lot of tangential arguments such as the drugs issue which was touched on by &quot;Prime Time&quot; and the article by Mr. Conor Lally which highlighted the problems which have to be recognised, and we cannot just skirt over this.  If these vehicles are providing some sort of a channel for drugs, that has to be addressed and recognised and I think that any member of the Garda would say anecdotally that they are doing so because they made 157 charges in that respect.  It is a difficult problem and I understand the frustration of those who say it has taken longer than it should, and they are right.  It has taken too long and much longer than I intended.  The day I accepted Deputy Munster's amendment I intended it to come into law there and then.  It is quite unusual for a Minister to accept an amendment from the Opposition but I did it with the clear intention of sorting out this problem there and then.  It became apparent over a period of a few months that it was not as simple as that and that there were real legal difficulties in what was proposed which could have ended in disaster.  That is what we are trying to avoid.  There have been different aspects to this as time goes on which have frustrated it.  Some of them are legal, some of them are interventions elsewhere, but we will get it right and that is what is important.<br/><br/>Deputy Rock asked what my instinct was and because of the evidence of the NTA survey, my own experience and other evidence from many stakeholders, my instinct was that the best option at the moment, not the ultimate solution because there is no ultimate solution, is that they should not be operating, certainly not in the way they are, and the most sensible way to stop that is to prohibit them.  If regulation is a more practical and not too expensive solution, we will actively consider that as well.  My guess is that the majority of people in the committee are talking about regulation.  I am not sure which way the D&aacute;il would go on that but the great value of this discussion is that I do not want to introduce a measure into the D&aacute;il which will be defeated.  That is something I will not do, that would be foolishness and would frustrate the process of enhancing public safety.  That is why what the committee members say today is very valuable.<br/><br/>I refer to the issue that Deputy Rock raised.  I agree that I have to bear in mind the fact that that consultation, which involved more than 4,000 people, came in fairly decisively, 54% to 38%, that the people involved wanted these rickshaws banned.  That is the reality and we have to take that into account.  I take into account what Deputy Rock says and it is serious but only 38% want the <i>status quo.  </i>That means it is urgent and it has to be done as quickly as possible.  There is public dissatisfaction which is shared by members of the committee.  The <i>status quo</i>will not stay for any longer than is necessary.<br/><br/>I refer to public consultation.  I am not hiding that from anybody.  I will have the public consultation document from the NTA circulated today or tomorrow, if that is all right for everybody.  That is no problem at all.<br/><br/>I refer to the final question from Deputy Rock.  My preferred option on balance is that there is not a continuation of what is going on at the moment and the cleanest way to do that is to ban them, but I am conscious of what Deputies Barry, &Oacute; Snodaigh and O'Dowd said as well that there are people in legitimate employment there and it is a serious measure to take to put them out of a job because of what is going on there.  Maybe they have alternatives and there are other factors at play but that is something that I am conscious of, not just because of the constitutional right to work or possible constitutional right to work but because to take people out of a job is a dramatic thing to do and not something I want to do.<br/><br/>I have a couple of figures here about the employees.  There are around 1,000 rickshaws in Ireland.  I do not know how many are in Cork but nearly all of them are in Dublin.  A total of 53% of the operators said they worked part time.  Full-time stood at only 15% but it is very difficult and this is one of the problems about delay, because we are working in a world of late-night activities and people who are not easy to trace.  It is very difficult to get statistics and the NTA figures, which are presumably the best ones we have at the moment, are gathered in those circumstances.  Those people are not working in a normal working environment so sometimes it is difficult to trace who they are and to gather information on them.  Until we have information which we can rely on as credible, it would be foolish to rush into decisions and I simply will not do that, despite the frustrations of some others.<br/><br/>Deputy Troy wants to regulate and when he says that he blames me, the Department and others for that, which is fine.  I accept that it has gone on for much longer than I wanted it to but there has not been any delay on the part of Departments.  Rather it has been due to a lot of complications which I hope I have explained, one of which is that the NTA wants to regulate them and the Department wants to ban them.  That is very healthy but it means that both decisions have to be considered very carefully and there is no reason that sort of debate between the NTA and the Department should not be going on.</p></speech>

Deputy Munster said that jobs are at stake and she is right.  Of course that is an important consideration.  It is a consideration high on my priorities.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry referred to the question of putting the sector on a level playing pitch with taxis.  That is an idea I would not rule out but I am unsure how it would work in practical terms.  I am unsure whether there is competition between the operators at the moment because rickshaws operate on a short-term basis.  The average journey is ten minutes and the average price for a rickshaw is &euro;15.62 for a fare.  I do not think they are competing.  Taxi drivers regard them as a thorough nuisance because they are in the way, they take up the taxi ranks and they may be taking short-term business from the taxi drivers.  Taxi drivers regard rickshaw operators as unfair competition because they are not licensed or insured and they are not obliged to do all the things taxis have to do.  It may be a possibility to put them on a level playing pitch but they are somewhat different creatures.  I take the Deputy's point about employment but I remind the committee about what I have said.  According to the NTA survey, 15% appear to be full-time.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the Garda figures.  They are pretty telling.  I am unsure how far I am allowed to go with them, but I have some detail on the status of the 154 incidents.  Some 41 cases have been convicted and 11 were struck out or dismissed.  A total of 17 bench warrants have been issued, 46 are ongoing before the courts and 30 are waiting analysis.  A total of eight people cannot be located.  Drugs seized include all the usual drugs, like cocaine, ecstasy and so on.  Given the number of convictions and cases before the courts as well as the number of cases struck out and dismissed, there is obviously a serious problem.  That has to be considered when we are making a decision between regulating and banning.  It is only a consideration but obviously it is a big problem.</p> <p>  I wish to respond to what Deputy Barry has said.  I took a trip on the rickshaws myself not long ago late at night.</p></speech>

They charged me &euro;10 from Georges Street to St. Stephen's Green on the first trip.  The driver certainly broke traffic lights willy-nilly.  It was not comfortable.  When I asked for the price on the return journey, however, the operator said it was whatever I liked, which was an extraordinary response.  The person broke virtually every rule in the book.  The rickshaw was going on the footpath along St. Stephen's Green at great speed and then over the pedestrian crossing on red.  The operator treated red lights as if they did not exist and drove on the tram lines.  Then, when I got out, I walked down Wicklow Street and there was a rickshaw travelling the wrong way up a one-way street.  My experience of this is that-----</p></speech>

He referred to competition in the market.  I am unsure about the competition argument because he was referring to taxi drivers competing with these people.  I am unsure about the competition argument because they do such a different job.  I gather that the maximum time taken is approximately 30 minutes.  We can see this in the survey data as well.  On the whole the rickshaws undertake short journeys that taxis would not do.  Taxis are not driving up footpaths the wrong way either.  I think the competition argument does not really apply.  I had a meeting with stakeholders the other day that was attended by a large number of taxi drivers.  They were vociferous about the rickshaws.  They maintain the rickshaws are dangerous, they get in the way, they are not licensed or insured and so on but they are not competing directly with taxi drivers.</p></speech>

The local council argument is interesting, and we have looked at it.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh will be aware of the fact that they use by-laws in Galway to do that and I gather it worked.  We have looked at that and we are going to talk again to those responsible.  Dublin City Council, of which Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh was a member for a long time, had maintained rigidly in writing that this is a national issue and the council does not want to handle it.</p><p>We cannot funk it if the authority refuses to handle it, but we will speak to those people again before we make a decision to see if there is any possibility of them using the same type of by-laws.  The council is saying it is a national issue and it will not do it.  We cannot immediately expect a local authority to use by-laws to regulate rickshaws and we have legal advice that its by-laws would not extend to this level of detailed licensing.  Certainly, it would not have powers to seize a vehicle for enforcement.  There are obstacles to that.  It worked in Galway but Dublin appears to be very reluctant and the authority has indicated it will not do it.</p><p> Enforcement has been mentioned and it is a problem.  There is no point is saying it is not.  The road traffic corps is being increased and it will improve fairly rapidly this year, but it is behind.  Enforcement has been a problem for some time and it has been a problem for the corps in enforcing drink-driving laws as well.  It is being remedied but it has been a problem.  The Chairman is right in that one of the problems with any legislation of this sort, whether the vehicle is to be regulated or banned, is defining the vehicle.  These are not defined in law at all currently and there is a switching between them being bicycles and motorised vehicles, which is very unsatisfactory.</p></speech>

I cannot speak about Cork but the activity in Dublin centres on the area around St. Stephen's Green.  That goes to Camden Street, Harcourt Street and that particular area.</p></speech>

They only go for a maximum of 30 minutes and that would be exceptional.  They only go around a small area with nightclubs, pubs and other places of entertainment.  The activity is confined to that area.  One of the reasons there has not been many fatal accidents is because it is such a small area and some of it is pedestrianised.  They use those pedestrianised areas as well.</p></speech>

I referred to the list from Deputy Troy.  These vehicles may legally operate inside London as stage carriers under the Metropolitan Public Carriage Act 1869.  They can also apply for hire on any street in greater London charging fares per passenger.  Outside London there are pedicabs that are classified as hackney cabs.  There is clearly some regulation, although probably not enough.  We have none here.</p></speech>

Taxis have onerous responsibilities and must comply with certain regulations.  We should apply at least the same to plying this trade.  In particular, there should be Garda vetting.  There should be nobody with a history of the offences that some of the people have who are working with these rickshaws.  The Minister mentioned there are people with bench warrants issued because they probably cannot be tracked.  Others have been convicted of more serious crimes but are rickshaw drivers.  They should not be able to ply this trade.</p> <p>  Compensation has also been mentioned.  The vast majority of rickshaws are not paying tax so they would not be entitled to much compensation.  Much of this is done on the black market.  I would not shy away from this just on the basis of compensation if the decision is to ban it outright and approach it with regulation afterwards.  I look forward to seeing what comes from the Department in the very near future.</p></speech>

I appeal to the Minister to accelerate these efforts and make a decision.  I suggest he goes with the proposal of the National Transport Authority, NTA, with regulations being introduced.  It is the best way forward.  Further procrastination is not on.</p> <p>  The Minister wishes to progress pre-legislative scrutiny for the amended Railway Safety Act.  I read somewhere recently that it has been brought to Cabinet for approval.  There is no disagreement or issue with this.  I cannot see any reason for this not to be supported.  I question the priorities of the Minister to a matter like this.  I tabled a parliamentary question and not one person has been found in breach of the Act in the past five years.  What are the priorities when with rickshaws we have no regulation or legislation in an area where there is a priority need to introduce regulation?  The Minister seems to have a focus in bringing forward proposals that might look good but in reality are not making a major difference.</p></speech>

I do not want to let that go.  I point out to the Deputy that for the second time he has miscounted the number of pieces of legislation I have introduced.
