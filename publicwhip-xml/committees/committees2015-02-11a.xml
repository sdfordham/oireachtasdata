    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015021100002#A00600"><p>I thank the Chairman and thank him for the invitation to appear.<br/><br/>I should say at the beginning that I speak for myself and I do not speak for the ESRI.  I will attempt to respond to the questions, which I was asked, on a range of economic issues. <br/><br/>Over the period 2001-07, in a wide range of publications, together with my colleagues, we repeatedly warned about the dangers posed for the Irish economy by the growth of a property market bubble and of the need to use fiscal policy to defuse the situation.  If the advice on fiscal policy had been followed, Ireland would probably have escaped much of the damage that was suffered over the recent crisis.  However, we did not draw the connection between the growth of a property market bubble and the risks to the financial system.  In 2008 in our medium-term review, we<i></i>failed to foresee the impending financial collapse.  The review had a short shelf life because six weeks later we published the quarterly economic commentary which carried headlines that Ireland was in recession.  I am afraid its shelf life was short.<br/><br/>I was asked questions about the economic recovery of the 1990s.  Having spent the 1980s dealing with a major budgetary crisis, the economy entered a period of rapid growth in the 1990s.  The ground had been prepared by a very substantial improvement in competitiveness and the restoration of order to the public finances in the 1980s.<br/><br/>There were a number of underlying strategic factors in the Irish recovery.  These included the completion of the EU Single Market which was particularly important for us at the end of 1992.  In addition, there was the effect of investment in education,  because Ireland had lagged behind the rest of northern European for a long period.  Finally, the rising participation of women in the economy was important.  These factors helped to produce a sustained rapid period of growth in the 1990s.  <br/><br/>Due to the fact that growth was fuelled from outside of Ireland, it resulted in a substantial movement into a current account surplus of the balance of payments.  That meant that savings were enough to fund investment.  We did not need a capital inflow to the banking system to fund the very rapid growth because we were living within our means.  <br/><br/>A significant part of the growth of the 1990s represented a catch up on the rest of the EU 15.  There is an interesting article by Cormac &Oacute; Gr&aacute;da which was published in the ESRI's quarterly economic commentary which brings this matter out.  The interesting thing about Ireland was that bad policy, over a very long period, managed to keep us down.  Then we had a recovery in the 1990s which acted as a catch up to probably where we should have been otherwise.<br/><br/>By the end of the 1990s, and into the first few years of the 2000s, the catch up phase was completed and the rate of productivity growth slowed rapidly.  While exports continued to grow, domestic demand began to rise quite fast.  People reacted to their higher living standards by spending more on consumption and, in particular, investment in housing.  This rise in domestic demand was further fuelled by stimulatory fiscal policy which going back to the medium-term review of 1999-2001, and so on, we felt was unwise and a fueling of an already very rapidly growing economy.  Rising expectations saw a gradual disimprovement in competitiveness due to wage inflation which adversely affected exports.  The current account of the balance turned negative.  </p>  <p>         I expressed serious concerns about the nature of fiscal policy, in particular in 2001, but it was probably only in 2003 that growth really began to outstrip the potential of the economy, giving cause for real concern.  The bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2002 took the steam out of the economy, which we were worried about in 2001, and that postponed the turning point.</p> <p> I was asked to say something on the external policy environment.  With the advent of monetary union in 1999, the ECB took over control of monetary policy so that interest rates were not set to meet the needs of individual economies.  They were set as they are today to meet the needs not of Germany but of the EU economy as a whole.  Monetary union also facilitated the free movement of capital, as anticipated.  It reduced the risk premium, which is the cost of capital.  In the 20 years between 1979 and 1999, Ireland paid 2% more on average than Germany, controlling for everything else.  There was a risk premium which meant investment was more expensive.  We were less competitive than Germany.  That risk premium disappeared with monetary union.  Prior to monetary union, Ireland and Spain had probably under-invested in housing as we had a higher cost of capital than in countries like Germany or France.  Given the demographic profile, we needed to invest in housing.  In permitting a more rapid adjustment to the housing stock, the lower cost of capital was beneficial.  However, it was the failure to appropriately control this surge in investment which eventually proved fatal.</p> <p> Monetary union had its benefits, but it required governments to act differently.  In our case and in the case of Spain, governments did not act differently.  When the property boom got out of control in the period 2003 to 2007, the intensity of the investment went well beyond domestic savings and the counterpart to the deficit was the inflow of funds through the banking system.  The demand for credit to fund investment ran well ahead of the ability of the banks to meet from their own domestic funds.  However, it proved easy and cheap to borrow additional funds abroad.  In the period before monetary union, a constraint on such expansion might have been the exchange risk involved in such borrowing but the experience of EU countries outside monetary union shows that a change in the world economy had taken place.  This was partly due to US policy and meant that cheap money was available not just because of monetary union.  Estonia and Latvia were not members of the eurozone, but they suffered exactly the same experience of a massive property bubble fuelled by very large investment through the banking system of very cheap money.  One should not blame monetary union as it was a worldwide phenomenon of cheap money which governments and central banks failed to manage appropriately.</p> <p> The turning point was 2003, but one can argue about it.  The current account of the balance of payments was in deficit that year, though the size was small, but wages had been rising rapidly for a number of years and the loss of competitiveness was beginning to take a toll, notwithstanding that it was not yet that serious.  House prices in 2003 returned to growth at more than 10% a year and the demand for credit was outstripping the ability of the banks to fund it.  One began to see the banks borrowing abroad in the inter-bank market to fund the expansion of credit.  The demand for housing, however, had a real basis in terms of the rising population.  House completions at nearly 70,000 were running ahead of the actual increase in population and there was no sign of the rate of increase in house prices slowing.  An important factor driving that was what I call the "user cost".  People expected house prices to rise in future which made buying a house much better than renting because rents would go up.  That proved self-fulfilling and produced a bubble effect.  Over the period to 2007, the current account deficit ballooned reflecting the fact that domestic savings were not enough to fund the investment boom.  We had to borrow from abroad, which resulted in increasing vulnerability for the banking system and a rapid rise in household indebtedness.</p> <p> It is impossible to identify when the bubble became irreversible.  The last chance to stop it without disaster was probably in 2006.  By the end of that year and moving into 2007, house prices were far above their equilibrium level and collapse became inevitable.  I have provided the committee with a detailed appendix which I will not go through here.  It shows that the dangers were apparent, even if disaster was not certain.  One further factor which aggravated the cost of the collapse was the fact that the building and construction sector was like a tumour which grew and grew, squeezing the rest of the economy.  Fortunately, it turns out not to have been cancerous and we are getting over it.  However, real jobs were squeezed out in the rest of the economy.  This contrasts with the situation in the UK, which also had a property bubble.  However, they did not allow any building so that when prices collapsed, there was not a collapse in a large part of the economy.  The expansion of the building sector in Ireland meant that it had to bid resources away from the rest of the economy.  This was done through inflation which made the rest of the economy uncompetitive.  This killed off a significant number of firms and jobs in the exporting sector.  These jobs did not seem important at the time and nobody noticed they were going in the absence of news headlines, but they have proved crucial.  We really need those jobs today.</p> <p> I turn finally to the policy response.  The dangers the economy faced as a result of the over-inflation of house prices, the build-up of debt and the loss of competitiveness in the economy were foreseeable and foreseen.  The build-up of the bubble could have been prevented by appropriate fiscal policy or by appropriate prudential action by the Central Bank and the regulator, or both.  Either one of these policy instruments, if appropriately deployed, could probably on its own have prevented disaster.  Both together would have prevented disaster.  On fiscal policy, I note that from 2001 onwards in many publications, I and my colleagues pointed to the need to tighten fiscal policy.  Instead, in an economy that was growing strongly and well above potential, fiscal policy pumped money into the economy in six out of eight budgets.  There is a graph which shows this.  When the economy was growing rapidly, successive Governments pumped money into it, which greatly aggravated the situation.  If instead the Government had run a deflationary fiscal policy, as we recommended repeatedly, and built up a substantial surplus, it would have taken the steam out of the housing market and reduced pressure on the labour market.  The case of Finland is instructive.  Having experienced the same disaster we did only 20 years earlier, it ran up a current government surplus of 5% to prevent a repetition.</p> <p> In addition to operating a much tighter fiscal policy in the 2001-07 period, I recommended using specific fiscal instruments to take the heat out of the building and construction sector.  We recommended getting rid of all building incentives and, possibly, taxing mortgage interest payments.  The UK Treasury visited us and published a paper in 2003 which said that if the UK joined monetary union it would need to use fiscal instruments to manage the housing market.  The Treasury recommended using stamp duty, but the problem with that is it would lead to higher household debt.  My feeling was that taxing mortgage interest payments would discourage people from taking on debt.  As people would end up with lower debt, it would be a better instrument.  Either way, one could have used fiscal instruments to take the heat out of construction.  A further result would have been a smaller balance sheet in the banking sector.  If the building sector had not been allowed to grow and fewer houses had been bought at lower prices, the banking sector would not have been vulnerable.</p> <p> I will not go into banking regulation and macro-prudential policy in detail.  It was the other instrument which could have been used.  There were a range of ways the Central Bank and the regulator could have stopped the growth in credit, as demonstrated by research from within the Central Bank itself by Kieran McQuinn and Gerard O'Reilly.  They wrote a number of papers on how credit growth is important in fuelling house prices.  If the credit channel had been choked off in 2003 to 2007 by the regulator, it would have halted the rise in house prices or, at least, achieved an appropriate moderation.  Policy instruments were available.</p> <p> By 2007, it was probably too late to prevent a major crisis from occurring in 2008.  However, if urgent action had been taken in the form of a tightening of fiscal policy or regulatory action, it would have reduced the subsequent damage.  It would have reduced the indebtedness of the household sector by stopping the boom earlier.  If people who bought in 2007 had not bought, they would not be in difficulties today.  The bloated balance sheets of the banks would have been smaller.  However, if policy makers ever considered such action, which I do not think they did, they might have decided that bursting the bubble deliberately in 2007 or early 2008, with serious consequences, was much less attractive than hoping for redemption by delaying action.  It became politically difficult even at the best of times to take action once things had gone that far.  If any action had been taken in 2007, it would probably have left a smaller problem to be dealt with.</p></speech>

Is this an accurate description?  Will Professor FitzGerald describe the ESRI&rsquo;s functions, how it is funded and the nature of its advisory role to the Government?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015021100002#C00200"><p>The ESRI was founded in 1960 to provide independent advice to the Government.  Professor Joe Lee in his <i>Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society</i>, commented on the fact that universities were not producing useful research at the time.  It was an initiative led by Dr. Ken Whitaker, the then Secretary of the Department of Finance.  To guarantee its independence, he sought funding for it from the Ford Foundation.  He told me that he discovered that the person responsible for funding in the Ford Foundation served mass in a church in New York.  He went to mass and nobbled him after it to get the money for the ESRI.  For the first four years, it was totally independent of the Government.  That was the intention of both the Government and the Secretary of the Department of Finance.<br/><br/>The ESRI is legally a charity.  The Department of Finance took over giving it 100% funding when the Ford Foundation money ran out in the middle 1960s.  The ESRI was about 80% funded by a direct grant from the Department of Finance until the late 1980s.  Then there were pretty dramatic cutbacks, as we know, and the ESRI chose to survive by looking for research contracts from the EU, other Departments and so on.  Today, approximately 30% of its funding comes from grant-in-aid from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the other 70% coming from a range of sources such as public research funding from the EU, SFI, Science Foundation Ireland, Departments and public bodies, with a limited amount from the private sector.  The ESRI insists on publishing everything it does without censorship.  The private sector is not generally prepared to fund public good research.<br/><br/>The ESRI is governed by a director who is responsible to a council.  The council is not appointed by the Government but co-opts its membership.  Until the late years of the last decade, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance was always a member of the council.  It is now an assistant secretary from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Central Bank Governor has generally been a member.  There is a range of people broadly representative of civil society.  The council is not appointed by the Government, a provision which is there to ensure its independence.<br/><br/>The Department of Finance has been party to these ground rules.  Generally, it has been good to deal with.  It understands we kick them and they grin and bear it.  There are times when things have been less happy, however.</p></speech>

Since 1987, I have been involved in these medium-term reviews.  Initially with my colleague, John Bradley, through the 1990s we were jointly responsible for it.  Since 1989, I have been the lead author but with other colleagues.  It has been published every two or three years.  It uses a range of tools to understand how the economy behaves and to look in a longer term context over several years at what are the strategic issues and how policy can produce a better outcome.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the fact we do not know what the future is going to bring, we always publish a range of scenarios.  This always poses problems for the media.  We tried producing two scenarios and it asked if it was the higher or the lower.  Then we tried producing three scenarios and it asked is it the middle one.  The rest of the world has difficulty dealing with uncertainty just as we do.  Since 1987, we have developed the Harmonised Econometric Research for Modelling Economic Systems, HERMES,  model and have a range of other tools we use in undertaking the work.</p></speech>

It is quite an expensive process, costing approximately &euro;250,000 or more in terms of resources.  As it is funded out of the grant-in-aid, it means it would be impossible for the institute to publish one of these reviews every year.  We were offered funding by a large bank in the late 1990s to sponsor it but we certainly rejected that.  The review is independent of the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  Part of the quality control process in the ESRI is that it is reviewed by anonymous referees not involved in the institute.  On policy relevant research, we tend to send it to interested bodies which could spot problems or come up with suggestions.  We have always sent it to the Department of Finance and we always get comments back from it.</p></speech>

We decide what we are going to do.  Over the years, the Department has always had problems with it.  The Department&rsquo;s comments come in two kinds.  There are the really useful technical comments.  Over 30 years, there are people in the Department who discover inconsistencies.  There are very few other people outside who can do so and it is very useful.  Then there are political comments.  We know and they know they are political comments.  We ignore them but they have got to say it.  Over most of the past 30 years, the Department knew the ground rules and that we would ignore them.  In the last decade, the Department became a little grumpier when we did not accept its political views.  The ground rules are there in that it can say what it likes and we can say what we like.</p></speech>

There were various rows in the past about this, particularly in the 1970s.  If the research is of academic quality and does not libel anybody, it will be published.  It is like a university.  The director or the council may not like what has been said in a report but it vindicates the right of the researcher to publish the results of his or her research which has been peer-reviewed and is of quality, even if they do not necessarily agree with it.  For example, if a professor in Trinity College Dublin says something, the provost is not expected to answer for that.  In the public mind, people believe the ESRI thinks.  The ESRI does not think.  It is its researchers that think.  The ESRI corporately does not take responsibility but it does take responsibility for the quality of the research and that it stands up academically.</p></speech>

Given the ESRI&rsquo;s level of expertise in the Irish economy, why does he believe the financial risks due to the commercial and residential property bubble were not factored into its forecasts?</p></speech>

Instead, in both quarterly economic commentaries and medium-term reviews, we prefer to rely on research.  We are uncomfortable with moving too far away from research.  We had not done research on the financial sector since the late 1990s when Patrick Honohan left in 1998.  Our area of expertise, one in which we had done a lot of research and are the experts, is fiscal policy.  We concentrated on that channel.  As I indicated earlier, if that channel had been operated properly, we would not have got into the mess.</p>  <p>  We were conscious there were problems, however.  I wrote to the Central Bank in February 2006 about an issue.  I contacted it again in March or April 2007 about my concerns.  If one looks at the 2007 April spring quarterly commentary, we did mention the financial risks.  </p>  <p>         In addition, we mentioned this in papers back to 2004 in the Dublin Economics Workshop.  While we were conscious they were there, because we had not done research, we did not go into detail on that.  Looking back on it, had I even looked at the data on the balance sheet of the banking system, I would have known there was a major problem.  I would not have needed a lot of research to conclude it was not just fiscal policy.  I feel that I made a serious mistake in not looking at the data on that.  I suppose a lot of people relied on the fact that the Central Bank had the biggest number of economists doing research.  As they were doing research on that area, were we to go out seeking funding for such research, the response would have been the Central Bank was doing it.  The lesson for the future is that there is a need for two people or bodies to undertake research on any given area.  However, what happened is a cause of regret.  It is not because we were told not to, rather it is why I did not look at the data, as it would have stood out.  Even though we had not done research, I think I would have said something on it.</p></speech>

We were conscious of the fact there was a problem but made a call that Ireland probably would escape it.  We were totally wrong.  If we had known there would be a financial collapse elsewhere, then we would have known there was going to be one here.  The way we operate when doing our forecasts is that we do not forecast for the rest of the world but take scenarios drawn up by the IMF, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London, the OECD or whatever and then plug them into the model.  We plugged it in and as nobody expected a financial collapse, we therefore did not get one in Ireland.  However, that is a cop-out.  We should have seen the problem.  As for Anglo Irish Bank, we may have discussed the problem at the quarterly editorial meeting in April of that year.  One thing I learned is one does not say a bank is going to go bust or one will be sued for libel.  However, that was not the reason.  It was just that we concentrated on what we did well and did not open our eyes to a wider horizon.  We then published in May but by June, it was clear that disaster was on the way.</p></speech>

However, the organisation or the authors of its reports did go on to draw firm conclusions.  For example, in the 2008 medium-term review, its authors wrote:</p><blockquote>The fundamentals of the Irish economy are sound.  Even if the immediate future may prove quite difficult, the resilience of the economy is such that, if properly managed, it is likely to return to healthy economic growth in the medium term.</blockquote>  <p>That was published in May 2008.  Can Professor FitzGerald explain to members what, in his view, were the fundamentals about which the ESRI was talking that were sound at that point?</p></speech>

Actually, on that, I think we were right.  When the IMF came to town in late 2008 and in 2009, it said the economy was broken and would never recover.  In particular, it stated that lasting damage would be done to the tradeable sector, that is, the export sector.  Were one to plug in the right numbers in terms of the financial sector, the model we had of the economy actually explained what happened to the real economy and we can see the real economy is recovering now.  However, what it did not see was the catastrophic damage done by the financial collapse, in which one had a dramatic fall in output.  I believed then that the economy would recover from whatever happened and I think that actually is what is happening.  Nevertheless, that does not excuse the fact that we did not see the financial collapse.  We published an article in 2011 in which we considered how the economy's behaviour was in line with previous behaviour, if one put in the right external numbers into our way of understanding the economy.  In an updated medium-term review in 2010, we published a high and low scenario for Ireland out to 2020 on the basis that the real economy was not broken and that the business sector would respond in a recovery.  It actually now looks as though the outturn for the decade will be somewhere between our high and low projections from 2010.</p></speech>

The sector that produces goods and services was sound and has recovered.  However, we know that the disaster has had a huge impact on the economy and consequently, not seeing the unsound nature of the financial sector was a bad mistake.</p></speech>

I assume Professor FitzGerald would suggest that a properly functioning banking system is one fundamental of the economy.  Can he explain to the committee why the ESRI came to such a conclusion in May 2008, given what was happening and what was known about at that time, such as the share prices in banks, investor confidence and what the markets were saying?  Why did the ESRI reach such a strong conclusion?</p></speech>

One was if the world had a normal type of recession or slowdown and the other was if there was a financial collapse.  The world not having a financial collapse was what all the forecasts we were using were suggesting.  None of the major institutions on which we relied - we did not have expertise in that area - were suggesting a financial collapse when we put the thing to bed in March or April 2008 and we relied on that.  While we did include a scenario in respect of liquidity constraint, it was much too mild.  We should have seen there were two possible scenarios.  However, in May, after the publication of the medium-term review, I attended a meeting of the organisation of which I now am president in Europe and what I heard there from the other economic institutes in Europe suggested things were substantially worse.  There was a particular presentation by an economist from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London which looked at how a financial collapse in the United States could ramify to Europe and would have a much more dramatic impact.  Immediately after the publication, I became aware that the rest of the world was contemplating matters being much worse and then, six weeks later, in a quarterly economic commentary, we stated we thought there was going to be a recession and that it was clear we were wrong.  We took numbers from outside which proved to be massively wrong and relied on them and did not contemplate the other outcome, which unfortunately, we now know happened.</p></speech>

In July 2000, <i>The Irish Times</i>reported that changes to a draft of the medium-term review were requested by an unnamed official in the Department of Finance.  These were in respect of strong criticisms made of then proposed single regulatory authority.  In 2003, <i>The Irish Times</i>again reported on perceived Government influence on the medium-term review of the national development plan, stating that a recommendation to the effect that spending on the national road programme be left unchanged was replaced by a recommendation that it be increased.  Can Professor FitzGerald outline to the committee whether unnamed officials within the Department of Finance, for example, in respect of the 2000 report, requested changes to the medium-term review?  Were such requests acceded to?</p></speech>

However, I have checked my own records and refer to the period between 27 September and 2 October 1999.  </p>  <p>         On behalf of the United Nations climate change commission, I was in Warsaw to examine Polish compliance with the climate change protocols.  I was telephoned by the director of the institute while I was in Warsaw to say that the Department of Finance had been jumping up and down about a particular article.  I discussed it with the director and it seemed to me that the Department's comments were political and should be ignored.  I checked this and note that the first set of chapters of the medium-term review were finalised, on my machine in any event, on 1 October 1999.  Some time between then and 15 October, we published the medium-term review.  Unfortunately, I was not able to check that date with the ESRI.  The author changed the text to meet the Department of Finance's suggestions, or made some changes, and when I came back I discovered this had happened.  We had put the thing to bed.  However, what John McManus in his story did not realise was the role <i>The Irish Times</i>played in this.  A few days after we published on 15 October, all of the things that had been taken out were published in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  It was a very perceptive article on the serious mistakes that were possibly being made in separating the Financial Services Authority.  The material found its way into the public domain and it should not have been taken out.<br/><br/>My memory of the discussion with the director and of the director's view was that the author had just left the institute.  I was not in a position to talk to him when I came back from Warsaw and I had other things on my mind.  That would be most unusual.  On that medium-term review, we received a letter after publication from a senior official in a different public institution saying the ESRI had committed treason in it.  I think the word used was &quot;treason&quot;.  That was because we had suggested that corporation tax should be raised from 12.5% to 15% or 17.5% between 2011 and 2015.  The official asked that we withdraw the medium-term review.  That is my memory.  There was a much more normal Department of Finance reaction.  The Department was copied on that correspondence and my memory is that the director told me it telephoned him to say, &quot;Ignore that&quot;.  It was not normal.<br/><br/>The Department of Finance comments appeared to me to be highly political and it would not be something normal.  I outlined before how I would respond and it would be left to me to respond.  It would not come from the director.  It would be left to the authors.  If the Department of Finance makes good points, I take them on board.  It normally does.  If it makes political points, I do not.  It is the same with other bodies to whom we send the material as well.</p></speech>

I am surprised I was upfront in any criticism there.  In terms of interaction with the Department of Finance, there would have been much closer discussions.  There was a cultural change in the Department of Finance in the last decade.  It became more concerned about the politics of things and less interested in the technical detail.  I would have had less interaction.  Also, I was getting older and having been in the Department of Finance up to 1984, I would have had lots of friends.  On that, we published an article in 2001.  I went back last night and looked at the 1999 medium-term review because of the issues I heard the committee was going to raise.  Even then, we were critical of fiscal policy, which is what the Deputy is talking about.  The fiscal policy was most unwise and it fuelled the problem.  If we had a sensible fiscal policy, we would not be where we are now.</p></speech>

Relations would have been frosty and the Department would not have wanted to come and talk to us about this.  To my knowledge, there was no discussion prior to the guarantee.  Subsequent to it, the Minister came to meet people in the institute.  I have here the dates, which were 14 January and 20 March 2009.  I may then have met the Minister on 5 October.  I met him with David Duffy on 11 February 2010.  Finally, I was at a meeting with the Taoiseach, the Governor of the Central Bank and Minister for Finance, at which many officials were present, on 16 October 2010.  </p>  <p>         In the meetings with the Minister in 2009 we concentrated on issues other than the financial sector because we had not done research on that area.  One area that did feature was our research on the public sector pay premium which the Minister discussed with my colleagues who were experts in that area.  There was a range of issues in that the discussion was in our area of expertise, fiscal policy, how we were to get out of the mess.  I specifically remember that when he raised the issue &ndash; and he was interested in our advice on the financial sector &ndash; we said he should talk to Patrick Honohan in Trinity College, he was the expert on that.  That happened either at the meeting on 14 January or on 20 March 2009.</p></speech>

I became aware, partly through the assistance of the Irish ambassador there that there were many Irish investors who wanted to invest a lot of money in property in Poland.  My concern was that they would have leveraged, borrowed, large sums from Irish banks, gone to Poland, and, using that as equity, leveraged again.  My concern in particular was that one Irish bank had a major bank in Poland and that Ireland could be exposed unduly through this form of investment so I wrote to the regulator about that.</p>  <p>  My concern in March&ndash;April 2007 was that I had done work with banks providing them with macro-economic scenarios, stress scenarios, where things go really wrong - it is ironic that we did not heed our own advice on this &ndash; in the period 2005 to early 2007.  We gave them macro-economic numbers.  What they did with them after that was their own business.  I was concerned that the stress tests undertaken by the Central Bank were not onerous enough.  They examined a fall in house prices but did not take account of the fact that a lot of other things would happen at the same time.  They were not using a model to do this.  I contacted the Central Bank about my concerns in that regard in 2007.</p></speech>

It may not actually have been treason.  I heard only last night that this would be brought up and I have not had access to the letters involved.  There have been occasions when people have contacted us and I have been very annoyed and I would certainly do the opposite.  Nobody tells me what I am to do in my report.  It is my responsibility.  The director does not say, "You can&rsquo;t say that".  It is for me to decide.  I was furious and the director was furious.  We had not come across this before.  My memory is that the director said that he was telephoned by a senior official from the Department of Finance to say this was over the top and to ignore it.  If people come in with their studs up it does not make one happy.  It makes one more inclined to do the opposite.  Points are much more likely to score and nudge one when people make reasonable arguments and one says on balance maybe they have a point.  When people do that kind of thing it does not go down well, especially when one is independent and free to choose.</p></speech>

The ESRI is probably the largest economic think tank in the State.  I looked for the analysis of the nation&rsquo;s banking sector collapse.  There seems to be very little analysis by the largest economic think tank of the &euro;100 billion collapse of the Irish banking sector.  Why is there little analysis of that nature when one considers the size of the collapse in the Irish economy?</p></speech>

Research takes time.  The ESRI does quality research.  That cannot be done in three months.  It takes probably a year to do a research project.  The Senator could look at the research coming from my former colleagues now on matters such as credit for SMEs and a whole range of papers on micro-economic data.  The Central Bank has also done excellent research so that our understanding of the problems posed for this economy by the banking crisis and the failure to resolve it quickly is much better.  We will not re-do what the Central Bank is doing.  My colleague, David Duffy, has done papers on negative equity.  A great deal of research is coming out now.  The ESRI woke up and said it had to look at this but it did not want to duplicate what the Central Bank is doing because it is doing very good research now.  We have done a great deal of research on this and try to bring it together in the medium review.</p>  <p>  In that review one of the scenarios we examined was where the rest of the world did okay and we did not exploit the opportunities.  I have forgotten what we called the scenario, the wasted opportunity or something because the banking system was not put right, it looked to us that the problem in the banking system could damage the economy but that was at a macro level.  At the same time many of my colleagues are doing research at a micro level and saying it could be a real problem for SMEs although the research suggests that until recently SMEs and credit were not constraining the Irish economy.  The problem was that people did not want to invest but our concern in the 2013 medium term review was that the recovery might not be as strong as it could be or might be delayed because the financial system was not available to finance the economy.  Post 2008 the Senator will see a lot of research done by the institute, which is relevant and encapsulated in a range of publications.</p></speech>

He has done a preliminary job on that.  It would be interesting, using the models because the models are valid if certain adjustments are made to them, to do a counter factual, to go back.  I have retired.  If somebody wanted to ask me to do it I might do it.  There is a lot of work to be done where one has to go back and replay, using appropriate models, the last decade and say, if one had run appropriate fiscal policy how high would interest rates, tax rates and the surplus have been.  It would be instructive and would be valuable to do.  Over the rest of this decade and it is an issue for the next Government, it may be necessary to move to a large surplus if the recovery is vibrant to stop the economy overheating towards the end of the decade.  We need to understand that.  That is a very interesting research project and will require significant resources to look and see what might have been.</p></speech>

It would be less for that because a new model is being developed, Cosmo, which has the best of HERMES - all these acronyms - in the Department of Finance with the co-operation of the Central Bank.  I think they are working on a financial sector for that model which would make it particularly suitable.  It is a major research project over a number of years and one is talking in terms of major resources.  When that model is ready, which I think will be this year, I am not sure whether the financial sector would be integrated into it but that is the tool one would want to use.  I would wait until an appropriate tool is ready, but research takes time if it is to be done properly.</p></speech>

It looks as if the State, instead of losing money, is going to get something back.  There was much concern when it was set up - this is taking me a bit beyond what I expected - that it would be used to recapitalise the banks, to make life easy for the banks.  We now know that, if anything, it was a bit tough on the banks.  The discounts that applied to the assets were appropriate or maybe even bigger than necessary.  I think it has helped in terms of the recovery and sorting out the problem.  The concerns which were expressed when it was set up have turned out to be totally wrong.  Partly because of that, because NAMA wanted to do a good job, the criticism was that it would be kind to the banks, it made sure it was not kind to the banks.</p>  <p>  It is not my area of expertise.</p></speech>

In a paper on budget perspectives 2012 or 2013 - I have updated it since - I looked at the approach taken in Ireland and the approach taken in Spain.  I think we got it broadly right.  Basically, we under-promised and over-delivered whereas in the Spanish case it over promised and under delivered.  We have done roughly the same and got to roughly the same position.  What makes Ireland different is that the outgoing Government decided to take a pessimistic view of the public finances, three months before the election in its paper of October-November 2010, and set targets which have been difficult to reach but were politically possible so that the incoming Government was handed a plan that was deliverable within target every period.  By contrast, in the Spanish case what happened was that the outgoing government continually raised the bar and promised it would get the deficit down to 3% even faster, something the incoming government finds it is impossible to achieve.  People say Ireland meets its targets and Spain does not.  It mirrors what happened in 1986, 1987 and 1988 where the political system across party boundaries delivered a resolution which produced a better adjustment for Ireland.  The bailout in terms of the plan was an Irish plan developed by an Irish Government.  The troika bought into it and said it was okay.  The incoming Government said it did not like features of it and the troika agreed that so long it stuck to the broad parameters it could change it.  That is what has happened.</p>  <p>  I can go a lot further down this route but it would take the committee a long way from where it wants to be.</p></speech>

The comment in regard to the amount of &euro;33 billion was that "This large addition to the national debt is manageable and in no way threatens the solvency of the State."  What is Professor FitzGerald's opinion on that statement with the benefit of five years' hindsight?</p></speech>

In 2010, NAMA took the first tranche of loans from the banks at a discount and that suggested the hole in the banking system was &euro;33 billion.  We relied on the Central Bank's judgment in this regard.  However, over the summer and into the autumn it became clear that the hole in the banks was going to be much bigger and we ended up putting &euro;64 billion into the banks.  We relied on Central Bank numbers.  If we had known it was &euro;60 billion we would have been talking about bailout, but we did not.  That was an issue on which we would have needed inside knowledge to know how big was the hole.  We knew - we would have talked about that in the summer 2010 update of the medium term review - that it would have been conditional and we would have recognised that we did not know the answer on that. The State had funding which would have seen it through to a number of years if it had been only &euro;33 billion but when it became clear that the amount was &euro;64 billion then a bailout became essential.</p>  <p>  In terms of the debt, as it has turned out, because the interest rate is so low, the burden of the debt is substantially lower than we anticipated at the time.  The debt interest is much lower than we had anticipated because an exceptionally favourable deal was done on the promissory notes where, basically, we are paying no interest on the &euro;25 billion.  In regard to the debt interest payments, it is what one pays on the debt that is important where the interest rate is low.</p></speech>

I said that if I believed what I said, I would sell my house and rent it back.  I went back and Eithne said to me, "It's our house and we're not selling."  I was in deep trouble and have been very careful ever since that it is our house.  We did not sell.  When I heard that the Senator was interested in that programme, I looked at it again.  It was a very good programme that set out the risks.  If one looks at the quarterly economic commentary published at the same time, it said that there was a serious risk of housing crash and a risk to the financial system.  Up to 2008, we got it right.  You are in the eye of the storm and on the edge of a precipice.  There are two outcomes - one, you fall over the precipice and the other, you pull back.  We picked the wrong one.  It goes back to the questions that were asked earlier.  If the rest of the world had not collapsed, we would have come through.  In the eye of the storm, you do not see what is going to happen in the future.  That programme was good.  It reflected the thinking and publications of the ESRI and the concerns we had in that regard.</p></speech>

We are researchers, not policy makers.  In respect of my own publications, I have concerns about endlessly repeating the same mantra in a number of areas.  For almost 25 years, I have been saying that I am really concerned about global warming, that we should do something and that a carbon tax is the answer.  I feel people say, "That's FitzGerald rabbitting on again".  I felt the same with regard to my concerns about the housing problem.  We felt isolated and felt that until "Future Shock", people did not take this seriously.  I am not a politician, I have chosen to be a researcher.  If you start campaigning and join the process, one side or other of the political process will say, "You would say that anyway".  You would be devalued.  It is important for me over my career to have established myself as independent of politics and not to campaign for or favour a particular side.  It has been complicated over the years, with a wife and a father in politics.  There have been headlines in newspapers saying, "FitzGerald criticised father" or "FitzGerald at war with wife".  It has been particularly important for me but in respect of the institute generally, if you become a player, you are campaigning and your research will be devalued.  Most of my colleagues and I examine our consciences if there is a headline that is about us rather than our research.</p></speech>

He used the analogy of a tumour in respect of how the property market and the banking sector had spread throughout the economy.  How did such a tumour go undetected by the ESRI on the basis that it produced reports for the Department of Finance in 2003 on the national development plan, where it was very critical of the growth in the property sector, and a follow-up report in 2006, where it said exactly the same thing?  Professor FitzGerald took part in the Kenmare conference in October 2004 and followed it up with "Future Shock" on RTE in April 2007.  He used the same term on both occasions.  He said that the economy was out on a limb due to the property market.  With the benefit of hindsight, why did the tumour of the property bubble and the banking stream of funding go undetected by the ESRI?  Why was it not highlighted in the 2008 medium-term review report, considering that up to April 2008 taxes were behind by &euro;700 million, and &euro;1.2 billion by May 2008, we were running a deficit of &euro;3.6 billion and taxes in all areas were behind?  Why did this tumour go undetected by the ESRI in such a hugely significant report as the medium-term outlook report in 2008?</p></speech>

We could not have been more explicit about the dangers.</p></speech>

There was a very good article by Professor Morgan Kelly published in <i>The Irish Times</i>between 25 and 31 December 2006 on the housing market dangers.  I contacted him, told him that I felt we were considered to be cranks on the issue and that it was great to have another academic coming out and saying there was a danger and asked whether he would submit an article to the quarterly economic commentary, which he did.  It was refereed and published in June 2007.  I felt we were isolated and that people were not listening.  People just did not want to know.  There was an interesting interchange between my father, Garret FitzGerald, and Richard Bruton on the election results programme after the 2007 election.  If my memory serves me right, my father, who was very concerned about the state of the economy and competitiveness, asked Richard Bruton why Fine Gael did not campaign on the dangers to the economy and the reply was that Fine Gael had used focus groups and people did not want to know.  My father wrote an article in June 2007 on that issue.</p></speech>

Objectively, why does the 2008 report read as if things were normal and we were in for a soft landing?  Why does one not get that sense of impending danger in terms of the property market and the fiscal situation for Ireland?  If the ESRI is independent and was highlighting all these issues that came up in the media in terms of comments made by Professor FitzGerald's late father, which were correct and very valid at the time, why when we read the report, does it not reflect that commentary?</p></speech>

Professor FitzGerald made reference in his statement to the fact 2003 was effectively where we took the wrong route.  Looking back, he said that he highlighted to the Government over successive periods that particular measures should be brought in to control the housing sector.  In 1998, and I remember the time, mortgage interest relief for rental investment properties was disallowed and, basically, was removed.  Then, in 2002, it was restored.  Why was mortgage interest relief restored for investment properties from 1 January 2002 onwards, when it had been removed for the previous four years?  Did Professor FitzGerald highlight that to the Government in reports?  On the face of it, this links into 2003 and it was a pivotal fiscal policy decision by the Government.

We recommended getting rid of mortgage interest relief and taxing mortgage payments in 2001 and again in the 2003 medium-term review.  If one looks at the media report in <i>The Irish Times</i>- I think it was after the 2005 medium-term review - they asked us what instruments we would use, and we said we would get rid of all tax reliefs and we would introduce a property tax, and there was a whole range of measures.  This happened repeatedly.  My fear was that I was seen to be campaigning on this issue.<br/><br/>The ESRI, not just me, has research going back to the 1990s on why property tax is a good idea.

The council generally tries to have a trade unionist-employer representative balance as well as somebody from the voluntary sector.  I am not sure who is a member now.  David Begg was, as was Donal Nevin for a long period.  I cannot remember, but Deputy Higgins has information on the membership.  There is an internal process within the institute under the director but the council does not have any say and does not want a say in what the ESRI publishes because it would conflict.  They are there to vindicate the independence of the institute, not to hamper it.</p></speech>

Has he felt a pressure to play down bad forecasts because of the nature of the system, the volatility of the capitalist marketplace or, for example, a fear that a bad forecast might frighten the horses and cause shares to fall or something like that?  Does that feature?</p></speech>

I suppose we all live in society and I suppose, subliminally, there may be an effect but, certainly, in terms of any overt pressure, because of our independence, the danger is we will over-react to it.  Over the last decade, much of our time was spent saying, "You may think things are going well but actually there is a danger there".  That was the continual refrain.  It was not popular politically to say that but we said it.  To give the political system its due, it continued to stump up the money for the ESRI's grant and did not try to use that to influence us.  We have never felt pressure to modify what we say.</p></speech>

She displeased the Gods.  Did the ESRI in any way feel like a Cassandra of the modern period and that, if it was too blunt as to the dangers in regard to what was happening then, like poor Cassandra, the political and economic Gods might seek to take revenge in some form?</p></speech>

In the 2005 medium-term review, if the Deputy had asked me at the time, and I think a journalist asked me, what probability I would have put on a housing price collapse, I would have said a third, but by late 2006 and early 2007, it was at least a half.  However, in terms of pressure with regard to the 2005 medium-term review, my feeling is that it did not go down well politically.  </p>  <p>         We did not have any interaction with politicians or the Department.  </p> <p> There is one instance where I do feel there was upset but it was probably at a high level in the Department of Finance and possibly not with the Minister.  It was in our 2006 report for the Department of Finance where we said, "You have got to take money out of the building construction sector, it is dangerous".  The high level in the Department of Finance was unhappy with our conclusion. </p> <p> I presented the results at a seminar, on at least one or two occasions, with the then Minister, Deputy Cowen.  He knew we disagreed but as a politician he knew people disagree all the time.  I did not feel that he was upset but there was, I know, upset with our conclusion.</p></speech>

In the 2005 medium-term review wages were mentioned 86 times, mostly demanding wage restraint.

It is that the labour market produces an outcome or it is an outcome of a market.</p>  <p>  In terms of the growth in wage rates, this was not a moral statement that workers were getting too much or trade unions were looking for too much.  I suggest the Deputy looks at our analysis.  We said the economy was growing too rapidly and the housing market was growing and expanding.  As I said earlier in my statement, in order to get the resources to build, and let us remember 14% of the economy was housing but it should have been between 5% and 6%, the Government had to bid resources away from elsewhere.  How does one do so in the labour market?  One raises wage rates.  The outcome was a rise in wage rates which crowded out jobs.  I mentioned we were destroying jobs - jobs in DELL and other jobs were going.  The problem was not that people were looking for too much money.  The problem was the building sector was too big and that put inflationary pressures on the economy, which was unwise.   </p></speech>

There was a whole range of things such as the inefficiencies and the problems in the building sector.  The builders did well.  Economic theory tells one that with a fixed factor the people who will make a load of money will be property developers and the owners of land.  The failure to deal with this matter was a very bad mistake.  We have had tribunals on this issue.  It is where big money was made and the matter should be dealt with.</p></speech>

At the same time, he referenced Professor Morgan Kelly of UCD and articles he wrote in December 2006 and then in 2007.  The articles he wrote predicted that a huge crisis would be due to what was going on in Ireland without the international crisis.  I ask  Professor FitzGerald to comment on Professor Kelly's article dated 28 December 2006 in which he said:</p><blockquote>If, however, we look at what has happened to other small economies where sudden prosperity and easy credit drove house prices to absurd levels, we should be very worried indeed.</blockquote>  <p>Then he mentioned the potential for house prices to fall by between 40% and 50% and a collapse of the housing building industry.  He referenced Finland and continued:</p><blockquote>With low interest rates, and loans available for the asking, house prices soared.  Then, as the Soviet Union collapsed, unemployment rose and house prices started to fall, creating problems first for builders, then for homeowners, and finally for banks.  But why can't we just have our soft landing, where prices stay fixed or rise slowly for a while?  Definitely not: a soft landing is not so much unlikely as contradictory.</blockquote>  <p>On construction, he continued:</p><blockquote>In Ireland, if and when the fall occurs, it will be from about 18 per cent of all national income.  We could see a collapse of Government revenue and unemployment back above 15 per cent. </blockquote>  <p>He concluded:</p><blockquote>Pilots define a soft landing as one that you can walk away from.  Looking at the collapses in Finland and The Netherlands and the building bust in Arizona, Ireland could be heading for what they call CDIT: controlled descent into terrain.  You are happily descending through cloud, thinking yourself at a safe altitude, until suddenly you smack into a hillside.</blockquote>  <p>The article was published on 28 December 2006.  Some of those views were repeated in the medium-review article of 2007.  Should it have been clear to people like the professor and others, not to mention the Government and other pillars of the establishment, that a disaster was in train?</p></speech>

It was so good that I got on to Professor Morgan Kelly and asked him to say it again in an article for the quarterly economic commentary, and he did.  I asked him to do so because his article was repeating what we had said in the medium-term review in December 2005 where we looked at a fall in house prices of one third which would give rise to unemployment rising above 11%.  Since 2005 and up to the end of 2006, house prices continued to rise so I felt it was sensible.  It was great the he was coming out and somebody else was making the running on this.  I said to him that I would like him to submit an article.  He did so and we published his article with which I totally agreed.</p>  <p>  In the spring 2007 quarterly economic commentary, my colleagues talked about the risks to the financial sector, so we got it right.  What is interesting, under FOI, and this may come up later - is it in Nyberg or under FOI - is the reaction of the Department of Finance; they saw it and they rewrote it for the Minister, saying the ESRI expected a soft landing where we said there could be a soft landing.  There could have been but we were uncertain because one cannot know the future.  The mistake was 2008 for six weeks.</p></speech>

I want to start by referring to a couple of previous answers he has given.  He spoke earlier about how he noticed a cultural change in the Department of Finance in the last decade of his time in the ESRI, and that some of its observations had become more political.  I am interested to know whether, after the economic collapse, he noticed a change in that attitude again, or whether it remained like that.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance is a completely different place.  They have got a load of economists who are doing interesting work and they are publishing it.  It is in the public domain in articles in <i>The Economic and Social Review</i>.I have worked with them on a number of things.  It is fun, they are encouraged to think outside the box.  It is a very different world.  I enjoyed working in the Department in the 12 years I was there.  There was a team of very good economists and we were encouraged to disagree and so I think we have seen a cultural change back to a Department of Finance which I think is doing a good job.</p></speech>

It was brought to my attention that there were a very large number of people with economics qualifications in the Department of Finance at the time but that was not the problem.  I have worked in the Department of Finance and it is one thing having a qualification and another being a practising economist.  It is a culture where you talk together, you disagree, and that was the kind of culture I had grown up in.  I learned much of my economics in the Department of Finance but the numbers working in the area were very small.  I suppose it was symptomatic of the culture - one of the reasons I left the Department of Finance in 1984 was that I was told if I wanted to be promoted I had to stop being an economist and go and do something different.  I wanted to be an economist, so I left.</p>  <p>  The HERMES model of the Irish economy was developed as part of an EU contract originally in the late 1980s, which my colleague John Bradley won.  The results were published in a book by North-Holland - one of the best academic publishers - edited by the European Commission in 1993.  Two of the authors were Department of Finance officials so they participated in this area.  They continued to use it, but then the Department cut back the resources in that area and by the end of the decade was relying totally on the ESRI to do that kind of work for it, so that the Department put a much lower priority on work on economics.

Politicians do not particularly want to deal with us - we are not necessarily helpful to them.  It is not a marriage made in heaven although it is not divorce either.  After the publication of the investment priorities report, I did at least one meeting with the then Minister for Finance, former Deputy Brian Cowen, explaining our point of view and he explained his point of view.  He was not somebody who was going to take offence or whatever.  He was very good to deal with, but that would have been just at one meeting.  Even as a civil servant - I was a junior civil servant - one almost never got to see the Minister.  I am trying to think about whether I met the Minister for Finance.  I did meet Brian Lenihan on a number of occasions and I have itemised when I did so, but I do not think I met a Minister for Finance as part of a specific meeting otherwise in the 30 years that I worked in the institute.</p></speech>

He said that 30% of the funding now comes directly from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER.  In the period leading up to the collapse, 2003-08, the ESRI produced a property index in conjunction with one of the banks, Permanent TSB.  Can I ask the nature of that arrangement with Permanent TSB?  The index ceased to exist until it was resurrected in 2013, I think, now in conjunction with Allied Irish Bank.</p></speech>

I would not have been the person making the decision on it - it would have been the director who decided - but we definitely did reflect on whether it was wise to associate the ESRI's name.  There was a risk but we felt it gave us access to data and provided data to the wider public that was of value and that it overcame the risks.  I am not sure whether one would do that again, but it certainly I think it did produce a lot of good results and produced information which would not otherwise have been available in terms of monitoring the housing market.</p></speech>

I was in Finance, John Bradley was in the Central Bank - he moved to the ESRI.  In the late 1980s, John won a contract from DG12 to develop a model of the Irish economy and it was to be models of each of the EU 12 economies done by contractors.  That result was published in a peer-reviewed book published by North-Holland with the editor being the European Commission.  It was published along with the models of other economies.  </p>  <p>         There were various problems with the contract, partly because the person doing the German model did not deliver and one cannot have a model of Europe without Germany.  We and the Federal Planning Bureau in Belgium have continued to develop and use the HERMES models.  John Bradley, my colleagues and I published a series of articles in a range of peer reviewed journals, which published the background to it.  The book was also peer reviewed.  There are probably approximately 20 or more peer reviewed articles in academic journals on parts of the model or using the model.  During the past four years there has been one on the effect of the corporation tax change in economic modelling, one in the <i>Journal of Environmental Planning and Management</i>on carbon taxes, two in the <i>National Institute Economic Review</i>, one of which examined fiscal policy over the past decade and the mistakes made.  There are many.  Finally, a peer review of the ESRI by academics from outside Ireland and some Irish experts is published on the website, and is very favourable in its assessment of the ESRI's macroeconomic work.</p></speech>

My former colleagues in the ESRI are developing a follow-on model which will include most of the key aspects of HERMES and the intention is to have a financial sector sub-model.  Although we had a banking model in HERMES, after the data changed completely in 1999 we did not pay much attention to it.  The users rather than the model were at fault.  A model never produces the right answer.  Giving a model to a person who does not understand it is like giving a box of matches to a child.  It is dangerous.  The model has taken account of X, Y and Z but produces a wrong answer because it has not taken account of the financial sector.  A model is a tool.  It does not produce an answer.  The person using the tool produces the answer.</p></speech>

The Senator will see in the appendix the list of publications over a continuous period.  There was personal frustration which I tried - I think successfully - to cover up.  The reason I mentioned the interchange between my father, Garret FitzGerald, and Richard Bruton was that it illustrates the fact that the people of Ireland did not want a change.  The information was out there.  The ESRI's 2005 medium term review was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>and <i>Irish Independent</i>the following day.  People could not have missed what we were saying, yet they went ahead and bought houses and the Government went ahead as if there was no tomorrow.  The Taoiseach expressed strong views about doubters at some stage in the period 2005 to 2007.  I am not a politician.  The members are the people who can answer this.</p></speech>

I sat through a series of papers in Warsaw which showed a dangerous situation developing in the Polish market.  Through the Irish ambassador, I then met a number of people and heard Irish developers wanted to buy the Villanova suburb of Warsaw for billions of euro, and it scared the wits out of me.  It was not something in which Irish banks should have been involved and that is why I was concerned and wrote to the Financial Regulator.  I subsequently talked to somebody in AIB.  My concern was AIB might be in a double exposure situation.  Whether it was correct or not, somebody in AIB told me that one of the areas of concern was whether mortgages were denominated in Swiss francs or euro and that the bulk of mortgages in Poland were denominated in Swiss francs.  There is a problem given the way the Swiss franc has gone.  I had a number of concerns.  In the report we did for the European Commission as EUROFRAME, we referenced this and in the report published in spring 2006, I did an appendix - it is on the website in the public domain - about the concerns about both the Irish and Spanish housing markets.  When we presented the report, the European Commission did not quibble with me about the Irish situation but brought in a Spanish expert to say Spain was not as vulnerable as I suggested.  It was part of a process whereby information came my way and I was concerned.</p></speech>

If you get worried about that, then you should not be doing public policy research.  However, your impact is longer-term and, over time, it may build up, and people may take account of what you do.  Working in the Department of Finance, you are part of a process and, even if you think the Government is mad, you may feel that, at the margin, you can see you have influenced things.  When you are in an ivory tower like the ESRI, you publish the research and you never know whether anybody pays any attention to it.  It is a different mindset where you publish the research and your concern is whether it is good quality research and whether you are right.  Generally it is, and, occasionally, as I have mentioned, it is not.  That is your concern.  As a citizen, you would like to see public policy sensible in Ireland and the fact it is not followed is a frustration, as a citizen.  As a researcher, you should not get too hung up about it or else you will want to become a player.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015021100002#P01500"><p>We rebalanced our income stream because they cut the direct funding.  Direct funding is low in the ESRI - if you look at the best in Europe, the Central Planning Bureau is wholly funded - and there are advantages and disadvantages to the funding model.  The advantage is that the policy output and policy relevance of what we have done has been doubled or trebled since we were totally funded.  The productivity increase in the institute over the last 20 years is dramatic.  We are funded to do research on energy and it is policy-relevant, whereas if you are an ivory tower with money to spend and you decide what you are going to do, some of the time you will indulge yourself and do things which might not be of great use to policy.  So the funding model has an advantage, but the disadvantage is there are areas that fall through the cracks that are not funded.  The funding of macroeconomics would have been very limited and the funding of the financial research undertaken in the 1990s came from banks.  They stopped funding it, however, and it would probably have been a major problem if the funding was still coming from banks in the last decade.  They would not have continued to fund because you would have been saying there is a real problem and the banks would have been upset.</p>  <p>  I think the model is too much in contract and in block grant whereas the untied funding should be substantially larger.  Looking at other institutes across Europe, a 50:50 model would be a better model.  It would combine incentives to be policy-relevant with the independence to pick areas that nobody else is interested in.  For example, the ESRI was a leading area of research on poverty over the last 20 years but there has been very limited research funding for poverty, so staff have got to move on to other areas, and there are areas like demography that nobody wants to fund but which I think are important.  There are cuts.  When you are recommending cuts to the rest of the country, you cannot turn up and say: "We are special".</p></speech>

There is a quote that reflects a lot of what we have been talking about this morning from the IMF multi-country report published just last month on the housing recoveries in Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain.  It states:</p><blockquote>Asset prices and other financial variables can help improve estimates of potential GDP.  Most methodologies for estimating potential GDP do not incorporate information about unsustainable credit developments, housing bubbles, interest-rate movements, and other financial developments that can result in longer-term deviations of GDP from its potential trend.  One way to improve estimates of potential GDP is thus to broaden the set of variables that a multivariate filter takes into account to add such additional information.</blockquote>  <p>Does that not summarise a gap that we are now trying to address and, indeed, the crisis the committee was set up to investigate?</p></speech>

There is a body of research on this.  It was what you would expect but the problem is that the methodology is inappropriate.  It is just taking the current EU methodology for establishing structural deficit and potential output, which is wrong and inappropriate for Ireland and gives the wrong answer.  Adding in the financial variables, you may get a better fit but it is not going to come up with the right answer so I think there is a problem with this simplistic approach to estimating potential output.  I can go down this route.  I published an article in April of last year on this with my colleague, Edel Bergin, but it is taking us rather far from what Senator Barrett is talking about here.  It is a very technical issue as to the filters and how you do this.  I am happy to go down this route but it may take the Senator rather far from his remit.</p></speech>

Professor FitzGerald said the single currency and monetary union required governments to behave differently.  Can he expand on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.214" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015021100002#P02000"><p>The Senator asked me a technical question and now he is putting a very different question, which is whether you should take account of what is happening in the financial sector.  Of course you should, but when Senator Barrett talked about potential output, and when he is quoting from the IMF, that is a technical issue, which is different.</p>  <p>  To understand how the economy operates, you should actually take account of what is happening in the financial sector.  I mentioned earlier the papers by Kieran McQuinn and Gerard O'Reilly in the Central Bank, a number of which showed that credit was very important in terms of explaining what happened to the housing market.  One of the problems, of course, is that that was a single equation, or small model, and credit is itself endogenous.  You need to embed it in a larger model in order to understand the full role.  That is one of the things the ESRI is working on in collaboration with the Central Bank in developing the CoSMo model to include the financial sector.  However, just because a particular model does not have the financial sector does not, as I said earlier, excuse you from looking at that.  It is a very important part of the economy.  The HERMES model does not have the financial sector in it but we have used it to very good effect since the crisis to look at what is happening in the Irish economy because we bring our own human capital, our own understanding of the role of the financial sector, and add it on to the model.  The question of formalising that in a formal model takes time.</p></speech>

It is clear from the literature before monetary union, people were barking up the wrong tree about the problems of monetary union, not just in Ireland but elsewhere, that one needs to use fiscal policy to manage housing market bubbles.  I published the paper in 2001 and the Treasury came over to discuss the issue with us because at the time there appeared to be an outside possibility that they might join.  They published a paper in 2003 saying one may need to use fiscal policy to manage the housing market in particular.  Yes, it is a new feature of monetary union.  In terms of speaking with my German colleagues at a number of conferences in Germany people were jumping up and down saying their monetary policy was too lax and they could have a housing market bubble in Germany.  My answer was that it need not have a bubble if it did the right thing on fiscal policy.  I said they could control this in Germany and not to worry about the fact that there were low interest rates.  I think we have learned.  I am trying to pass on this understanding to my German colleagues and elsewhere that under monetary union there are different rules but one can manage an economy and one does not have to run into a crisis.</p></speech>

As a result of knowing the Senator would raise the issue of the 1999 medium term review, even going back to then and in each medium term review onwards, we raised this issue until it was too late in 2008 when the damage was done, that there was a need to use fiscal policy in a different way.  In terms of the economics literature, the use of fiscal policy to manage the cycle had gone out of fashion, as the Senator is probably aware, saying fine tuning is not possible.  This is not fine tuning, this is stopping disaster by using fiscal policy differently.  Hopefully we have learned our lesson.  It is something which need not have happened but did happen.</p></speech>

I said: "Look, at what we have done in the medium term review with a 30% housing price crash.  You can pay us to do more if you want, but I think that is probably enough to give you."  Also it was consistent with unemployment rising to 11% and so on.  They said they would go off with it.  What they did with it, I do not know but as far as I can remember, this initiative did not come from the AIB team, this was coming from somewhere higher in the bank.</p></speech>

We did macro-economic scenarios.  The difference compared to what the Central Bank and so on was doing was that we used a model, so it was consistent.  One did not get a housing price crash and no change in unemployment; one got a housing price crash, unemployment going through the roof and Government revenue collapsing, all coming together which is the way to do it.  That was my concern.  It was not just the Central Bank.  It was interesting doing something similar with a British owned bank.  The Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority, FSA, had a similar inappropriate approach to stress testing.  I also learned from a third bank where we provide macro-economic scenarios because one of the scenarios it wanted to look at was a liquidity crisis.  I should have paid more attention to what I learned from that bank because it was one of the factors that provoked the crisis.</p></speech>

The reporting was out in the open.  It was not that our reports were a secret.  Over the decades in the institute we felt we had a duty to communicate our results to the wider public.  We do not conduct reports for the Department of Finance, we do them for the people of Ireland.  The press conferences are very important and the press has been extremely helpful.  Some of them, great journalists such as Brendan Keenan and Paul Tansey, would always explain better what one was trying to say.  The reporting was very good.</p></speech>

I could not find the file on what the Department said on that particular medium term review.  I do not remember much kick back from it.  In terms of doing a medium term review, we produce a draft set of numbers and send it to a large number of people, not just to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank but to other organisations to get feedback.  We then get feedback and revise our numbers.  When we talk to IDA Ireland and it says it has a real problem bringing in firms that should colour what we do.  We would have discussed it in advance but I cannot remember a particular kick back from the Department of Finance on that one.</p></speech>

In that, you were worried about the over-ambitious national development plan and a series of consequences for the economy.  You already mentioned the over-inflated building sector.  This was all reported in the media.  You said, I think, that the Department of Finance was both upset and cross.  You mentioned that you had spoken to the Minister but it was not coming from the Minister.</p></speech>

It was coming from the top.  I do not have access to the Department of Finance files but the team working on this, the experience - I said I wanted somebody from the Department of Finance to ride shotgun with us, to go to all the meetings with everybody else because we learned a lot from it and I also felt they would too.  The members of the team working on it worked very well and I think they were happy with the result although they may not necessarily have agreed with all of it.  It was at a more senior level in the Department - my understanding was that they were unhappy.<br/><br/>There is other material on this.  Harry McGee, in <i>The Irish Times</i>in October 2012, had two pieces where he got information under freedom of information.  When we did the 2003 report and said that building construction was too hot and that money should be taken out of the sector, I got the impression that the Department of the Environment was unhappy with it, although I did not get that impression in 2006.  What we now know as a result of the Harry McGee stories - or maybe Peter Nyberg, but I think it was Harry McGee - is that the Department of the Environment wrote to the Department of Finance in 2005 about its concern and the then Minister of State, Noel Ahern, the former Taoiseach's brother, got on to Finance to say his Department was concerned about the dangers.  Within the Administration - I had heard this independently from the Department of the Environment - they were concerned about the issue.  They did not disclose that in our meeting with them but they took action and said they also were worried.</p></speech>

We had a very good relationship there.  There would be nervous Nellies somewhere - I probably used an inappropriate phrase - and there are different people in the Department of Finance.  What I do know is that it was at senior level, the concern about the 2006 report.  Whether it was shared below or whether there were diverse opinions within the Department I do not know.</p></speech>

There was now a feeling at the top that you did not want to disagree or present difficulties, that the culture had changed.  They seemed to be more concerned about the institute.  They would always have said, for example, we were wrong on some aspect and they would express disagreement but one would know it was political.  You know they are playing a game and you are playing a game, they have got to do it and you ignore it.  However, they seemed to take it more personally, which surprised me.  Where normally in my experience with Department of Finance officials the impression was it was accepted we had our job to do, that we were independent and could advise a course of action was unwise but that if the Government wanted to take such a course then the officials would have to act accordingly.  Some of them seemed to buy in to what was happening in a way which was out of character with the past 30 years and out of character with what happens today.  This is an impression based on limited interaction with the Department but much more research would need to be done on this before a judgement could be made on it.</p></speech>

The mistake in the 2008 one - we did not know where the economy was going and we made a serious mistake.  There was more limited interaction with the Department and it came back with comments which were grumpy and - as I mentioned, that is probably an inappropriate phrase - but which were not that useful.  They certainly were not telling us, "You are to say it is going to be a soft landing".  There was no suggestion, that was our mistake, unforced, my mistake, unforced.</p></speech>

There may have been a discussion about the problems in Anglo Irish Bank but what I do know is that the 2008 summer quarterly called a recession and I think the Department was not that happy with the use of that phrase.  However, we were probably much too mild in the use of it.</p></speech>

He said such a loop will provide a voice to take either pro-cyclical or counter-cyclical decisions on the economy in terms of over-heating or relaxing it and so forth.  Given your engagement with Deputy Murphy, Professor FitzGerald, do you believe that information loop was effectively working during the period of, say, 1999 to 2006?</p></speech>

When I was in the Department of Finance in the period 1972- 84, one put one's views on paper and there would be a paper trail which would indicate if the boss was in agreement or not.  What was more, in the 1977-79 period when we were very concerned about what was happening, not only did one go on paper but one took a photocopy of a file in case the file disappeared to make sure there was a paper trail.  The Wright report says there were verbal warnings but could not find a paper trail of officials saying they had given a warning.</p>  <p>  For me as a civil servant - it is the opposite of "Yes, Minister" - the job was to come up with the right answer, tell the Minister what the right answer was, and then the Minister would decide and one would implement the Minister's decision even if one disagreed with it.  That is the way I was trained.  However, it was on paper and a paper trail was kept so that one may be accountable, say, to this committee and one can show what was said.  That does not appear, from the Wright report, to have been part of the culture of the Department.  We also know from a number of freedom of information requests - I have details somewhere here, not by us but that appear in the paper, and also from the Nyberg commission - that the Department on a number of occasions amended what junior officials had summarised the ESRI as saying, to possibly say something that we had not said going up the line.  That greatly concerned me.  When I was in the Department one did not do something like that.  There might be disagreement but it would have been on paper.  </p>  <p>         That is my reading of Nyberg and what has come into the public domain.</p></speech>

It is kind of ironic.  They felt it was necessary to do a proper stressed economy.  One needs a model to do that properly and AIB approached us to ask if we could do it.  I said, "Actually we have done it already, here it is and you go off and use it".  What happened thereafter is something the Deputy will have to ask AIB, but it was interesting.  It was not just among economists in AIB that there was concern.  It was at a more senior level.</p></speech>

It becomes much worse if unemployment goes through the roof and Government revenue collapses with the Government then having to tax the hell out of the economy.  That is a far worse scenario.  What they were doing was just picking a housing crisis and unemployment independently, the reason being they did not have a model.  To do the scenario properly in a way that is internally consistent, one needs a model of the economy.  The only people with a model of the economy were in the ESRI.</p></speech>

Professor FitzGerald makes a strong criticism of fiscal policy and I want to tease out that with him.  Looking back at the budgets for 2005 to 2006, inclusive, the forecast in terms of a general government balance was 0.8% for 2005, 0.6% for 2006 with the outturn for that year being better at a 2.9% surplus, and the projection for 2007 was a 1.2% surplus.  What should the Government have been doing at the time?  Professor FitzGerald referred to Finland and a 5% of GDP surplus.  Is that the territory the Professor believes the Government should have been working within?</p></speech>

It is instructive for anyone to look at the manifestos of the time.  Some might characterise it as a contest of who could give away the most.

Was there something approaching a national consensus that low tax, high spend was the way to go and that the model was sustainable?</p></speech>

In terms of the reaction to it, people said, "You are quite mad.  Politically this is impossible."  It is one of the reasons that at a European level, central banks have been made independent.  It is extremely difficult for governments to raise interest rates to do exactly this.  That was one instrument.  There are other instruments.</p></speech>

It is important to have a debate on this issue now.  We do not need an instrument now, but by the end of the decade we may need something.  One could use property tax.  The other instrument, which we continuously recommend, was that instead of increasing investment, the Government could have cut back its own investment.  What we said was, "If you want to undertake this investment programme, you're going to have to tax the hell out of the building industry to make space, because you can't have any more building."  There are a range of different instruments.  Reading through the media reports on the 2005 medium term review, I think I was asked what instruments and I listed a range of possible instruments that would have had some effect.</p></speech>

The point about joining a monetary union is that one sets monetary policy for the union.  I mention in a footnote in my initial submission that Ireland suffered quite seriously from the effects of German unification in 1990.  The economy was taking off in 1989 into the first quarter of 1990, then there was German unification.  The German Government spent as if there was no tomorrow, telling the people of Germany that all the infrastructure investment would cost them nothing.  German fiscal policy was thoroughly stimulatory.  The Bundesbank then raised interest rates and the problem was that it was raising interest rates to deal with the German problem and the rest of us had to take its interest rates.  The great thing about monetary union is that it is set for Europe, not for Germany, or not for Ireland.</p></speech>

The rate of inflation in Ireland is too low now, but the purpose is to manage the rate of inflation across Europe and anchor it.  The ECB has done a good job in that regard.  Other things one would use interest rates for, and make it appropriate for the Irish economy, are fiscal instruments.  That is my point, that a monetary union-----</p></speech>

Professor FitzGerald talked a lot about how fiscal tools could have been used.  Given these constraints to do with monetary policy, would it be fair to say that fiscal tools need a longer lead-in period?  For example, if one devalues a currency or puts up or down interest rates, that is pretty immediate, but for fiscal policy to have real effects in the day-to-day economy, we need a longer lead time.  The policy would have to be set now to achieve an outcome in three, four, five or eight years time.</p></speech>

The ECB has said that with its quantitative easing policy it hopes by the end of 2016 to get the inflation rate back to where it should be.  It is about a two-year lead time, whereas fiscal policy would have a much more immediate impact.  The problem with fiscal policy at the European level is that it is not co-ordinated.  What should have happened was that, yes, we had to raise taxes and cut expenditure dramatically, as did Spain, but the rest of Europe - France, probably Italy, Germany, Netherlands - should have stimulated the economy.  That is what should have happened.  The problem is that all the fiscal rules that have been put in place are about making sure that debt is repaid.  None of them is about co-ordinating fiscal policy.  Also on rules, one of the reasons we got into a mess was that we had the Stability and Growth Pact.  In dealing with the EU Commission and the IMF in the run-up to the crisis, in 2004-06, they would come and visit us and I would tell them they needed to give the Government a speeding ticket.  Their answer was, "We can't give them a speeding ticket because they're obeying the Stability and Growth Pact."  Be careful of rules.</p></speech>

There was a very detailed section in the model as a result of what happened in the 1980s.  Models are developed for particular purposes, but they are one of many tools.  We used quite a number of different models in our research.  The fact that the model did not have an operational banking sector did not mean that in using it one would not take that into account.  We have used it very successfully since 2008.  While we do not have a fully developed banking sector in the model - we bring a model in our heads or an informal model on paper - that is not the problem; the problem is with the users.</p></speech>

Does the fact that the ESRI is dependent on other sectors for 70% of its funding, rather than core Government funding, compromise its ability to give the attention and focus to the economic outlook that is necessary for a Government to take cognisance of it?

If there was more money available, there would obviously be more research, but that is a matter for the State.  When we were arguing about cutbacks elsewhere, we were not saying, "You should massively expand research in that area."  That is for others to decide.  If the political system wants to recommend the undertaking of more research in that area, it would be very welcome, but to campaign on our own behalf would not have been wise in the past.</p></speech>

He also said that if the ESRI had foreseen the financial crisis, it would have been factored into its assessment of Ireland.  Is he a subscriber to the view that were it not for the international crisis, the banks would have been sound?  The reason I ask this question is that a number of witnesses who have come before the committee, including those who have authored reports on the banking crisis, say very clearly that it was a home-grown crisis and that the international financial crisis recognised the crisis here at an earlier stage.  If the rest of the world had not collapsed, does Professor FitzGerald believe we would have come through?</p></speech>

At the time, if we had run it with a collapse in the rest of the world, we would certainly have seen it.  I also said this was a cop-out because the numbers were available.  We might have come through if the rest of the world had not collapsed; that is possible.  Looking at the numbers now, we were in a really dangerous position, even without a collapse elsewhere and it is very possible that there could have been a collapse.  The world economy had not collapsed on 17 March when Anglo Irish Bank was in difficulty and the ramification could have been that we had a really serious problem.  The odds are that we would have had major difficulties even without an international collapse, but the international collapse triggered it.  It happened much more rapidly.</p></speech>

What does a term such as "come through" mean?  Let us focus on Anglo Irish Bank.  In the absence of an international financial collapse does Professor FitzGerald think Anglo Irish Bank would still be trading?  Does he believe its losses which we know are in the region of &euro;34 billion would have crystallised, regardless of an international crisis?  What does he mean by the term "come through"?</p></speech>

It might have happened a bit later, which could have been worse; it could have been an even bigger bubble.  I cannot say for certain as I am not infallible, but the odds were very strong that there was going to be a big problem.</p></speech>

I hope he will provide details of that individual for the committee at a later stage in order that it can follow through on that matter.  He also said in his opening statement that the ESRI had not drawn a connection between the growth of the property market bubble and the risk to the financial system in 2008.  Can he help me to understand how the ESRI did not draw the connection between a property market bubble and the risk to the financial system in 2008, yet in 2006 it was developing robust stress tests for the banks?  How can both statements coexist?</p></speech>

I just go back and say I made a mistake.  We were not ignorant of the fact that there was a major problem, but I just thought we might escape it.  When Deputy Higgins read what I had said, the tone rather made me cringe - the tone of certainty that we would get out of it.  We got it wrong, but there was a lot of information that there were problems and we were concerned about the issue.  It is just that I plumped for and said we would get out of it without a crisis.  Going back to Deputy Pearse Doherty's very useful clarification of what I had said, looking at it now, we were not going to escape unchallenged.  I do not think I have fully answered his question.</p></speech>

I suppose it was partly because I had not taken it any further than macro-economics.  I made it clear that I was not getting involved with the banks in their own internal workings; I was not a party to what they did after that.  The fact that they were concerned did raise concerns for me, but in 2008 I thought we would escape the worst of it.</p></speech>

Did Nationwide UK also fund ongoing research?  Did the Irish Banking Federation, NAMA and AIB fund research?  If that is the case, what proportion of research is funded by financial institutions?  Does Professor FitzGerald believe there could be any suggestion of capture as a result?</p></speech>

There is a range of these surveys which are sponsored or where data are provided in the case of Permanent TSB, but that is not really research; it is data collection where we are happy to work with other bodies.  The NAMA-Irish Banking Federation situation is different.  There is a housing research programme and we are happy that a public body and the banks are involved as we feel they balance each other.  There is a steering committee involving the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We feel that once there are enough different funders, as well as a broad public remit and an understanding that we can and will publish without censorship, this works well.  </p>  <p>         We feel that the input, the suggestions that they have made, have been helpful.  There is a working paper of mine now which is funded as part of that.  We feel that it has worked well and if it does not work, then one gives up on it because the funders have got to understand that one is going to do one's own thing.  In the energy area we would have a lot of different funders in there, which means that nobody can call the shots and it works well.  One gets good suggestions talking to people in the outside world.  Living in an ivory tower, it helps.</p> <p> So if one gets it right, it can work.  What the institute has done is maintain its independence throughout.  One does not get into bed with one particular, especially private-sector body - one would be concerned about that - other than on data collection.  We felt that influencing one on a formal statistical calculation of what the sum of the numbers are on house prices is not something which-----</p></speech>

There would be the index and then they would publish their view of the index and if necessary we would publish a different view.  We published our view on the dangers of the housing market, which were very different from what the banking sector was saying.  So it did not compromise our independence, but I suspect what the Deputy is talking about is a report published by PTSB using the joint index, rather than a joint report.  I could be wrong in that because I am not familiar with it.</p></speech>

We can see from Professor FitzGerald's reaction that when somebody picked up the phone to express dissatisfaction with an ESRI report, he was furious.  He touched upon it earlier when he said that the former Taoiseach - I presume he means the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern - between 2005 and 2007 was very strong in his criticisms of anybody who had things to say that were negative towards the Irish economy.</p>  <p>  Is there a different method of influence?  If one takes the ESRI medium-term report in 2005, the Davy report by Rossa White in 2006 and the RTE programme in which Professor FitzGerald participated in 2007, is there a different way of influencing people who are either fully employed by the State, be it the regulator's office, Central Bank or the Department of Finance, or part-funded by the State?  With that latent influence, if one says something that is perceived to be against the economy or against the workings of the economy, a different version of influence applies.  I ask Professor FitzGerald for his opinion on that.</p></speech>

If a number of people were looking for a job in the public sector, one says, "Oh, well if you-----", but, no, Ireland does not work like that.  There is a groupthink where everybody thinks the same.  There are serious problems with that especially in a small society, but latent influence, I am not clear that there is any.  There will be overt influence which may or may not work; I do not think it does work.  The influence which does work is when people come up with evidence which suggests a different conclusion.  One's job is, even if one does not like the evidence, to go off and assess it, and change one's mind if the evidence is different.</p></speech>

From what we know now, once one had a - perhaps - collapse then in the property market, one was going to have a banking problem.  It would have been substantially smaller.  The earlier the bust happened, the better from our point of view.  It is a judgment; I have not done research on this.  My feeling is that sometime around then it became irreversible and the costs were going to be very significant with the benefit of hindsight.</p></speech>

I am happy about that, but I do not have a monopoly of wisdom.  The ERSI does not have a monopoly of wisdom.  In Germany, I have worked with five big institutes there - it is a much bigger society.  The problem is their economies of scale.  The institute does a very good job.  When it was much smaller it was not as effective.  It was set up because the universities were not producing useful research.  We see now, say, the Nevin Institute - that competition is really good.  How many research institutes of that kind one can support in a society is a problem.</p>  <p>  Looking at, say, the Netherlands, the central planning bureau, which I think is the best in Europe, is in a dominant position, a monopoly, and they do a great job, but they are very conscious of the fact that they are in a responsible position.  In the ESRI in the 1980s, one would publish something and nobody might notice.  It has become much more of a responsibility when the media are going to take everything very seriously.  It probably means that one is a bit more careful in what one does, which is probably a good thing, but in a small society, like Ireland, one is not going to have a multiple set of think tanks.  I cannot think of any other country the size of Ireland or even larger which would have multiple ESRIs.  However, one does need competition and one always needs to be aware that one does not have a monopoly of wisdom.</p></speech>

That would increase an already heavy burden of repayments on ordinary working people who are buying homes, leaving aside the speculators, the portfolio assemblers, etc.  </p>  <p>               Did you consider that perhaps those who were making massive profits on the other side of the equation were the ones who should be hit, in order to hit speculative profits etc.? </p> <p> Finally, considering construction grew to almost one fifth of the economy, accounting for hundreds of thousands of jobs, was consideration given to the fact that the banks involved, the companies and the developers had massive economic power?  Is it healthy for social ends that such power would exist in a few hands?  Should that power not be in public ownership and under democratic control.</p></speech>

The problem is that where too much money is chasing too few houses, the money may be taken off the property developers and given to the State - which is a good thing - but we would still have the household sector massively in debt and exposed and the banking system which is funding it exposed.  Therefore, taxing the profits was not going to prevent a bubble.  It might have meant that some of the benefits of the bubble would have accrued to the State rather than to private individuals, but to stop the bubble, we need to stop people buying houses.  That is the only way to do it.</p>  <p>  There are different ways of doing that.  My preference for a tax on interest payments is that it would make it more difficult for people to take out large loans.  They would not be able to fund them and would end up less indebted.  However, if we increase stamp duty, which is the mechanism suggested by the Treasury, people might end up more indebted.  I am not hung up on a particular mechanism, but we need some fiscal mechanism to take money out of the property market.  Taxing the profits will not do that.  It will transfer the benefits from private individuals to the State, which would be great, but will not prevent a bubble.</p></speech>

Also, why should the State confer large value on individuals just by a decision to rezone?  There is an incentive for bad behaviour as a result.  I totally agree with the Deputy that the profits from rezoning should be taxed, but that would not have solved this problem.</p></speech>

My question goes back to AIB.  Early in 2006, senior economists within the AIB group approached Professor FitzGerald in regard to information on his analysis on the Central Bank stress tests and the professor subsequently had a meeting with them.  I am asking the professor to put that on one side of the equation.  On the other side, we have September 2008 and the night of the bank guarantee - on which the professor was not consulted - when senior people from AIB said they might have a liquidity problem, but they did not have a capital problem.  Discuss that two and a half year period, when things would not have improved from an AIB point of view.  Professor FitzGerald has indicated to the committee that the board may have had concerns at the start of 2006, such concerns that it came to him, but then, two and a half years later, when the crunch came, it appeared to say something different.</p></speech>

This was relevant as that is where the market would stop funding the banking system and the money.  That was useful information, which should have helped build a picture of the dangers to the system.</p>  <p>  On what the banks knew, I am very interested in the committee's work and I hope it can tell me.  It looked to me as if there were people in AIB who were worried.  How was it, when there were people in AIB who were worried - and probably people in the other banks - things turned out they way they did?  I am waiting for this committee to answer that question.</p></speech>

They should have been in operation.   Up until 2009, I was uncertain as to their extent.  First, I had not checked the legal powers of IFSRA and the Central Bank.  One of my concerns about the banking crisis was the extent to which competition coming from foreign banks outside of Ireland drove Irish banks to do stupid things to hold their market share.  One of the things I was not sure about was whether the Central Bank - I now know what powers it has and it has powers in this area - had power to regulate the banks.  It could say it had powers to regulate AIB, because it licensed AIB, but did it have powers in regard to Ulster Bank or Bank of Scotland (Ireland)?</p>  <p>  I asked Axel Weber, then governor of the Bundesbank, when he was in Dublin whether Europe needed more co-ordination.  His formal answer was, "You just get on to the Financial Services Authority, FSA, in London and tell them what to do."  </p>  <p>         Talking to him afterwards, it was clear that while that was the theory, had the Central Bank taken action it might have run into difficulties with the FSA saying it was being mean to British banks and it was a competition issue or whatever.  Although I do not know how it would have operated in practice, they should have done it.  Had they protected our banks, the ones that landed in our laps, we would not have the problem we have today.  It was a failure of regulation.  It is unclear how it would have operated in a world with banks from different countries with different regulators.  That is why the achievement of European banking regulation is a great leap forward.  I know that we failed, and that had we taken action we could have stopped it, but I am not sure of the details of how, precisely, it would have worked out.</p></speech>

The Government should encourage diversity of opinions.  Undertaking research across a wide range of areas of the economy is important.  Models need to develop continuously.  Although we will soon have a model of the financial sector, the next problem to hit Ireland will be something different.  How do we know what it will be?  We should not be too reliant on the past and should think outside the box, and this is one area in which we have failed.  I do not know what will be the next major policy challenge.</p>  <p>  In fiscal policy, I am concerned that we lack the infrastructure to sensibly operate the rules we have put in place regarding the management of fiscal policy and structural deficit, and which are embedded in the Constitution.  As long ago as the early years of the last decade, the Department of Finance said the current EU methodology for calculating the structural deficit and potential output was an unwise method.  Although the methodology was telling the Government it was doing a great job and should continue to stimulate the economy, the Department of Finance still said it was a bad method.  Whereas the European Commission is now saying Ireland has a substantial structural deficit and needs more cuts, my assessment, using my methodology published last April, is that we are in structural surplus and do not need further cuts.  However, in the medium term, using an appropriate methodology, we may find ourselves in the next five years having to run an increasing surplus because there is a chance we might get rapid growth, moving beyond potential output.  There is a need to improve our methodology and we have put forward a methodology for assessing fiscal policy which is better than what is there.</p>  <p>  The European Commission officials accept that the methodology does not work.  In 2010 and 2012, I was at conferences in Amsterdam and Brussels, and at the Amsterdam conference my colleague spoke about this problem, that the methodology is inappropriate.  The European Commission official became furious, not because my colleague had said the methodology was wrong but because she had said it was a Commission methodology.  The official's view was that it was an EU methodology and that, although the Commission implemented it, he agreed with us.  In monitoring fiscal policy, we must develop more appropriate methodology that will give the right answer.  There is a danger that in the short run it may tell us we need &euro;2 billion more in cuts when we do not, and that in the long run it may tell us to stimulate the economy when we should take money out of it.  I have suggested a methodology.  I do not have a monopoly on wisdom and it is open to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the Department of Finance and the ESRI to develop an alternative.  We need better guidance for the future in light of the mistakes of the past.</p></speech>

I read the transcript of last week's proceedings with the HEA and found it very interesting.  I thank the committee for the opportunity for myself and colleagues to address it here today.  By way of brief introduction to the proceedings, we are here to talk about the impact of the universities and higher education more generally and the challenges and opportunities facing the sector in regard to its future impact and sustainability.  We surfaced and debated many of these issues at our international symposium, to which the Chair referred, 21st Century Universities.  I thank the clerk for his attendance at the symposium on behalf of the committee.  Time precludes us from going over all the ground covered on that day, but we will address the main themes.  I should say that matters have progressed since the symposium following the commencement of the work of the expert group on the future funding of higher education, chaired by Peter Cassells.  That group produced the first of its background papers and recently held a highly interactive consultation session with a wide range of stakeholders including enterprise, the trade unions, regional authorities and higher education.  Where relevant we have drawn on the evidence from the background paper that was presented for that initial consultation.  There will be two further consultations, I understand, as the group progresses its work.<br/><br/>Our testimony to the committee is structured as follows: following my own presentation where we will address the sustainability and future challenge aspects, my colleagues, academic affairs director Lewis Purser will talk about human capital impacts in conjunction with Sinead Lucey, who is our international education manager.  Then, Dr. Larkin and Qiantao Zhang will address the economic impact of higher education, a piece of work they have been doing under the Tionchar project.  It is good to be able to report on the positive financial and human impacts of higher education.  No aspect of human endeavour is perfect and in any event, in a world where change is endemic, we must constantly strive to progress and to improve.  What we aim to show here today is a snapshot of the outputs and the impacts of higher education.  To secure those outputs and impacts we need inputs in the form of talented and motivated students and staff and we need the appropriate financial and regulatory environment.<br/><br/>The legacy of experience of higher education during the economic crisis as we face into a period of economic growth leaves us with a number of challenges and conundrums that I will talk about.  The first of these is summed up by the intersection of the movements of student numbers and staff numbers.  According to the Cassells expert group, the higher education participation rate has been relatively steady over the last years, and any future rise in the higher education student cohort will be driven primarily by growth in the primary and secondary school population.  High birth rates in Ireland over the last 15 years have led to a very substantial increase in the numbers going through the school system.  Both increased numbers, and an increased retention rate at second level, result in projections for second level enrolments growing from 338,000 in 2014 to a peak of some 405,000 by 2025.  As a result, the latest projections suggest that by 2028 the number of new entrants to higher education will increase by 29% over 2013 levels.  We have charted that out in our background submission.  These projections are based on participation rates remaining constant at 56% over the period.  The relevant chart is included in our submission.<br/><br/>While new entrants into higher education have increased, core staff numbers have fallen in consequence of the employment control framework.  The net effect of this - of rising student numbers and decreasing staff numbers - has been a change in a negative way in the student to staff ratio.  Pre-crisis, the ratios in Irish universities were already on the high side by international standards at circa 1:16 or 1:17 on average.  During the crisis, ratios have increased quite significantly from 1:20 to 1:23 in the universities - that is an increase in the ratio and a deterioration of 12%.  These are very significantly higher - and I would just pause on that figure of 1:23 - than the OECD average which stood at 1:14 in 2012.  To put this into context, the president of UCD, Professor Andrew Deeks, has remarked that in comparison to his former university, Durham in the UK, he had the same staffing complement there as he has here, but UCD has ten thousand more students than Durham.<br/><br/>I mentioned the word conundrum and this is because this change represents a gain in efficiency in pure statistical terms, but it also has implications for quality and for sustainability in terms of the long-term ability to support such large class sizes.  This evidence suggests that we have a sustainability problem now arising from the ratios which needs to be tackled.  This is before we get to the matter of future demographic impacts which, if nothing is done, would push the ratios very significantly higher, given the scale of increase in the student population that is projected.  It should be noted also that the projections referred to are based on holding participation rates steady at 56%.  All things being equal, improving access from socio-economic groups that are currently disadvantaged would increase participation rates further and further increase enrolments.<br/><br/>I will now briefly address the funding context for these developments.  The expert group paper sets out the current annual funding of public higher education institutions which unsurprisingly is in decline since 2007 - 2008.  Despite an increase in the student contribution of &euro;1,925 or 233% &mdash; from &euro;825 in 2007 - 2008 to &euro;2,750 in 2014 - 2015, total income per student decreased by 22% for the higher education system overall.<br/><br/>Increases in student contributions along with general reductions in overall State funding have resulted in a steady reduction in the proportion of total recurrent funding for core activities of higher education institutions funded by the State.  That reduction is from 78% in 2008 to an estimated 64% in 2016, because there is a further decrease in our allocations in the estimates for this year.  This compares to an OECD average of 68%.  For universities specifically, the core recurrent grant allocated to universities declined by &euro;261 million between 2008 and 2014, a decline of just under 53%.  When we look at the fall in the unit of resource, which includes not only the core grant but also fee income, the unit of funding went from &euro;8,734 in 2007 - 2008 to &euro;6,970 in 2013 - 2014.  The cumulative decrease in the unit of resource in this period has been in excess of 21%. <br/><br/>Looking at university funding in an all-island context, we recently undertook a comparison of the unit of resource per student in an IUA university <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>a student in one of the Northern Irish universities.  For the academic year 2014-15 the funding per undergraduate student in a typical non-lab discipline - that is, arts, humanities and social sciences - is &pound;7,997 in Northern Ireland or approximately &euro;10,663 at current exchange rates.  That compares to &euro;6,876 in an IUA university &ndash; a difference of 55%.  We understand that the Northern universities would not consider themselves to be particularly well funded by UK standards.<br/><br/>In addition to that, we should also mention the matter of capital funding. Capital funding for universities effectively ceased in 2008.  That was partly as a result of the need to build new schools at primary and secondary level for the demographic bulge that was happening there.</p><p>Over the period of the financial crisis, apart from the run out of some Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions, PRTLI, investments, there has been no capital investment of any significance in universities.  When one takes planning and build time into account, that means that even with a decision to start funding capital in universities now, it would take a number of years for funding to come on stream and we could be looking at virtually a decade of no capital investment.<br/><br/>Dr. Larkin will mention in his presentation that methodologies for evaluating economic return do not deal with the matter of efficiency.  In that regard, I have already commented that our system is highly productive and while productivity and efficiency are not entirely the same thing, they are sides of the same coin.  In regard to the efficiency of operations and costs to the State, one of the significant features of recent years is that universities have grown non-Exchequer income.  That income, excluding research, has increased by 24% from &euro;695 million in 2008 to &euro;865 million, helping to offset the significant reductions in public funding.  Total income, excluding research, per staff member has remained largely stable, increasing marginally to &euro;155,000 while non-Exchequer income, excluding research, per staff member, has increased from &euro;71,000 to &euro;93,000, an increase of almost 30%.  Staff are doing significant amounts to improve the non-Exchequer financial position of universities.  Significant work has been undertaken on shared procurement under the aegis of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP.  Significant internal changes have also taken place, including a revised academic contract and a performance management and workload allocations system but more needs to be done on the HR toolkit to ensure the competitiveness and efficiency of universities is maximised.  I know that Mr. Bowman spoke about that last week in the context of the generation of overseas income.  <br/><br/>Finally, regulation is important for the purposes of financial probity, accountability generally and to underpin public confidence.  However, for regulation to be effective, it must be well considered and proportionate.  Regulation in a university context has a particular perspective for several reasons.  Universities are producers of both public and private goods and their funding reflects this.  In addition, unlike the majority of the public service, universities are in an internationally traded marketplace, both in terms of students and staff.  There is a high expectation for universities to be innovative and to contribute to national and global stocks of knowledge.  Part of that innovativeness is based on academic freedom and an appropriate degree of university autonomy.  Trends in this regard are monitored by the European University Association, EUA, through its autonomy score card process.  As part of our symposium we requested the EUA to update the score card for Ireland.  It found as follows:</p><blockquote>This 2014 update of the Autonomy Scorecard for Ireland reveals a decline of university autonomy, in particular in staffing matters.  In some areas it is quite subtle and can only be captured partially by the scorecard metrics.  It appears clearly though that there is an entrenchment phenomenon, with governmental control over human resources and finances having been consolidated over the period considered.  The measures that the government took at the beginning of the economic crisis have neither been halted nor reversed.  </blockquote><p>I must stress, in conclusion, that this is not about a blanket approach to deregulation.  The IUA has put forward proposals to strengthen institutional governance and has welcomed the HEA system performance report and appraisal process.  It is, rather, about ensuring that institutions whose contribution to the economy and society depends on agility and flexibility are appropriately empowered to make that contribution.  The two key issues are the need for sustainable funding and sensible regulation.  I will now pass over to Mr. Lewis Purser, who will deal with the question of whether that funding is justified and who will also talk about the human capital impacts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.446" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lewis Purser" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015021100002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to present to the committee.  In this statement I will draw out the salient points from the supporting documentation supplied to the committee which is much more comprehensive and which contains a number of graphics that I hope are helpful.  I will address the contribution of the universities to the development of human capital in Ireland.  This human capital is widely acknowledged as our single most important natural resource and is what our entire national economic strategy is developed around, for both indigenous and export-led growth.  I will begin by looking at the growth in the numbers of university students over the last ten years at all levels - bachelor, master and doctorate - as well as the numbers in areas of specific national targets, including, for example, under-represented domestic student groups and international students.<br/><br/>The overall number of university students grew by 14% during the period 2004 to 2014, with an increase of 54% in PhD students.  Additional overall growth of 5.5% is planned by 2016-17, in line with the strategic compacts agreed between the Higher Education Authority and each university.  The number of students admitted to universities and other colleges through the DARE and HEAR schemes, which target students with disabilities and those from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds, has increased by over 200% during the period 2009 to 2014, to the extent that now one in every five applicants to the CAO is also applying to DARE or HEAR.  Both these groups of students are national priority target groups.  In addition, there has been an overall growth of 45% in the number of international students in Irish universities.  There are three main categories of international student: full-time international students who come to Ireland for a full degree programme; offshore or distance students who are studying on a programme provided or accredited by an Irish university, but delivered outside Ireland; and short-term exchange and visiting students such as Erasmus students from other European countries, Junior Year Abroad students from the United States and, more recently, from countries like Brazil.<br/><br/>Following this discussion of student numbers, our submission looks at the quality of outputs from the university education process, using various indicators.  The first is graduate employment and other graduate destinations.  This looks at the success of graduates in obtaining employment and-or other successful destinations following completion of their degree programme.  The next indicator is employer feedback on higher education outcomes which looks at employer satisfaction with the quality and employability of recent graduates, as well their future skills requirements.  Another indicator is student engagement and student experience, which looks at the feedback from students regarding their educational experience and satisfaction.  The final indicator is completion rates and average duration of studies, which looks at whether students completed their degree programme and whether they completed it on time. <br/><br/>In terms of graduate employment and other graduate destinations, the data gathered by the universities and published by the HEA shows that since 2008 the proportion of the honours bachelor level 8 graduate cohort in employment has remained stable - 50% in 2008; 51% in 2013 - while the proportion seeking employment in 2013 was 6% or half the national unemployment rate at that time.  While the relative employability successes enjoyed by university graduates are clear compared to the general population, a number of challenges remain.  For example, the proportion of recent graduates employed overseas has more than doubled from 5% in 2008 to 12% in 2013.  Likewise, the numbers of level 8 graduates entering further studies or training has increased from 34% in 2008 to 40% in 2013.  These figures reflect the difficulties in obtaining employment in Ireland but also the demand for more advanced or specialised education or training for specific sectors of the labour market. <br/><br/><font color="#212100">  In terms of e</font>mployer feedback on the quality and employability of recent graduates, <font color="#212100">some key findings of the 2012 and 2014 national employer surveys by IBEC and the Higher Education Authority are relevant.  The surveys found that over 75% of companies were confident that graduates have the right workplace and transferable skills and relevant subject or discipline knowledge.  This confidence was particularly </font>pronounced among foreign-owned employers, that is, among multinational companies in Ireland.  <font color="#212100">The surveys further found that over 80% of companies were satisfied with the calibre of science and maths graduates.</font><font color="#212100">The majority of PhD graduates were employed because the job required doctorate-level skills or qualifications. </font><font color="#212100">However, large numbers of graduates - approximately 15% - from outside Ireland continue to be recruited by employers, both multinational and indigenous.</font></p><p>There are lower levels of satisfaction among employers with recent graduates&rsquo; foreign language capabilities and entrepreneurial skills.  These are areas that can be addressed by the universities through better integration of skills and competences in internal curriculum development and quality assurance processes and through the continued promotion of study abroad opportunities and high-quality work placements.</p><p> In terms of feedback from the students themselves regarding their educational experiences, engagement and satisfaction, all Irish universities conduct surveys of their students on a range of specific issues such as course and module feedback, library usage, sports facilities and many other topics.  In addition, for the past two years, all Irish higher education institutions - universities, institutes of technology and a number of other colleges - have conducted a national survey of student engagement to which nearly 20,000 students responded in 2014.  The survey is aimed at first year undergraduate, final year undergraduate and taught post-graduate students.  I will not go through all of the results, but some of the highlights are as follows: some 63% of all participating students selected "often" or "very often" when asked if they were improving knowledge and skills that would contribute to their employability; 67% of all participating students reported positive relationships with teaching staff, finding them to be available, helpful and sympathetic; 80% of all participating students selected good or excellent when asked how they would evaluate their entire educational experiences at their institutions; and 65% of all participating students selected "often" or "very often" when asked if they used an online learning system to complete an assignment.</p><p> The feedback from our Irish survey also allow us to compare what students in Ireland are telling us with the feedback from students in Australasian countries and the US, where similar surveys are conducted and where we have sourced and adapted our Irish survey tool.  The results for Ireland are broadly favourable compared with those for Australasia - mostly Australia, but also New Zealand and a couple of smaller countries - but we still have some work to do to catch up with the US benchmark, the obvious leader in this field.</p><p> The feedback is important for universities that can use this information, often in detailed ways, in combination with other sources of feedback, for example, from employers and through the quality assurance processes, to take appropriate action.  The data coming through the Irish survey provide a useful evidence base for further discussions at the level of each individual university, which is where the changes must occur, as well as at national level.  This usefulness will increase over time following further iterations of the survey.  We have conducted two already and are gathering an evidence base.</p><p> Regarding student completion rates and the average duration of studies in Irish universities, evidence shows that we compare favourably with other countries across Europe and the OECD.  This is in terms of overall student completion rates and students completing their studies on time.  The average time to completion in Ireland is 4.02 years while the EU average is 4.59 years and the OECD average is 4.4 years.  This demonstrates that the system in place in Irish universities is more efficient, thereby encouraging students to complete their studies on time.  This is better for individual students and the State, which contributes large amounts of public funding.</p><p> Our submission also provides a summary of quality assurance procedures used across the university sector to ensure and enhance quality in the education processes.  We describe the variety and extent of these processes and mechanisms; they are designed to ensure the fitness for purpose of study programmes as well as academic and administrative structures.  During the past ten years, all units of all universities have been reviewed, in most cases twice, by expert panels involving external international and Irish expertise as well as by students, resulting in quality enhancement plans with formal monitoring and follow-up.  All of this information is on the websites of the individual universities.</p><p> In addition, all of the universities have been through two full rounds of institutional review by expert panels external to Ireland.  These panels have made a series of useful suggestions and recommendations for each university, all of which are available on the website of Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, the State agency that organises these reviews.  The institutional reviews have confirmed that each of the universities has been in full compliance with its quality assurance obligations under the Universities Act 1997 and, possibly more importantly, with the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area, the European benchmark in this regard.  Irish universities are seen by other European partners as leaders in this area.  These external validations of quality in our system provide confidence to the national authorities, students and national and international partners regarding the quality of academic programmes and other services provided by the universities.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and look forward to discussing these and other issues of concern to the committee.</p></speech>

In most circumstances, it will return much more than &euro;1 for every &euro;1 invested.  In the 2010 to 2011 period, for example, the gross income of higher education institutions in Ireland was &euro;2.6 billion, generating a gross output of &euro;10.6 billion.  Investment in higher education in Ireland generally has greater impact than does similar investment in the UK.  The accompanying illustrations in my supporting documents bear this out, for example, figures A1.1 and A1.2.  This testimony is supported by four appendices.  Appendix I contains materials and diagrams related to this discussion.  Appendices II and III are academic papers outlining the impact, input-output analysis methodology and the Keynesian multiplier methodology.  Appendix IV is a brief biographical note.  I will attempt to answer all of the committee's questions today, but if members have further questions, I have provided contact details.</p> <p>  This research, entitled Tionchar, is funded by the Irish Research Council under the theme 2 research projects grant scheme RPG 2013-6 - SFI-HEA Assessing the Impact of Publicly-Funded 27 Research, Development and Innovation - based in the school of business at Trinity College Dublin.  The funding was granted to a consortium of academics: Professor Brian Lucey, Professor Poul Holm, Ms Niamh Brennan of Trinity library and myself.  Mr. Qiantao Zhang is our post-doctoral fellow and is soon to receive his doctorate in economic geography from Cardiff University.  Without his work and great skill, this presentation would not have been possible.</p> <p>  We have received generous assistance from people within the higher education sector.  It is the first time that this type of analysis has been done since the late 1960s.  The Irish Universities Association, IUA, Institutes of Technology Ireland, Mr. Tom Boland of the Higher Education Authority and his staff, Ms Mary Doyle of the Department of Education and Skills and her staff, the presidents, secretaries and registrars of the institutions, Dr. Stephen Kinsella of University of Limerick, Professor Colm Harmon of University of Sydney and Ms Siobhan Phillips and Mr. Martin Hynes of the European Science Foundation have all been invaluable in their support.</p> <p>  Economic impact is a broad concept with many components.  When discussing the economic impact of higher education, we usually refer to a component of national industrial policy where higher education provides a method of improving a country's human capital endowment.  My contribution today will focus primarily on the role of higher education institutions as entities existing within the economy, which can be considered in the same way as one would describe an Exchequer-financed investment such as roads or public administration.  This is exclusively concerned with the demand side of the economy whereas human capital is the supply side.</p> <p>  I warn members that, while this study highlights immediate value for money, it does not comment on returns beyond the present.  Since human capital returns are made manifest over a 45 to 65-year time horizon, it would be unwise to consider immediate returns the entire result of investment in human capital.  Policy makers should note that long-term horizons and information asymmetries present in all forms of education delay by many years the effects of policy changes on long-term economic growth.  These impacts ultimately are about expanding the supply side of the economy and yield long-term, non-inflationary and stable equilibrium expansions in output and employment.</p> <p>  Many analytical techniques exist to evaluate immediate returns.  To offer the most accurate results in the time allowed, I shall focus exclusively on the input-output method.  The results are described in figures A1.1 and A1.2 of Appendix I.  They illustrate how Irish higher education institutions as a body outperform most UK institutions, with the exception of London-based institutions, while netting out the effect of Government investment, that is, the balanced budget multiplier.</p> <p>  The Tionchar project is a multidimensional one.  Not only do we examine immediate impacts through the Keynesian and input-output methods of analysis, but we also consider a Solow or economic growth analysis as well as the impact on innovation and industrial policy.</p><p>The input-output method treats higher education institutions as a sector or firm, as if we were discussing the construction industry, for example.  It involves asking, for a given level of income and expenditure, what level of additional economic activity is generated in the economy.  Higher education is considered solely as a sector of the economy made up of producers and consumers, with no comment on the wider effects on the economy's human capital endowment or on non-economic contributions.</p><p> The input-output technique takes a matrix of raw economic data collected from the public and private sides of the economy to study interdependencies between suppliers and producers and the economic impact of the import or export of producer goods to meet consumer demand in the national and regional economy.  The analysis illustrates that the output of one sector can in turn become an input for another.  This method was created by Professor Wassily Leontief during the 1930s, for which he received a Nobel prize in 1973, and involves treating all sectors in a linear fashion.  Supply is taken as exogenous in its environment - that is, it does not respond.  Firms function by consuming certain products and producing outputs which are in turn consumed at a later stage.  The data we use in our analysis is from the Higher Education Authority and the Central Statistics Office.  The input-output tables date from 2010 and, as such, may include latent Celtic tiger effects.  We have tried to provide the best analysis possible.</p><p> The disaggregation of the input-output tables, which represents the key parameters for the Irish higher education sector, is shown in figure A1.4.  The data show that 68% of the costs for higher education institutions come from staffing.  Expenditure by these institutions translates at minimum to 77% of all purchases taking place within the domestic economy.  Income is slightly less diverse than one might expect, with 65% of the sector's income coming from Irish Exchequer sources.  It is important to note the distinction between universities and institutes of technology with respect to diversity of income, a distinction which has serious implications for the balanced budget effect.</p><p> With this data, we can calculate type I and type II multipliers.  Type I multipliers relate directly to the purchases of goods and services by the higher education institution itself.  Type II multipliers are related to the induced effect, that is, where household consumption responds to changes in wage income.  Type II output multipliers, as set out in figures A1.7 and A1.8, show the results for the institutes of technology and the universities all being greater than one - meaning they get back more than &euro;1 for every euro invested - and much higher than their Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish and London counterparts.</p><p> Since the higher education system is supported so extensively by the Exchequer, it is important to calculate a balanced budget effect.  This figure takes into account the opportunity cost of Exchequer funds.  In any environment involving Exchequer financing, one must consider the effect of taxation in reducing the disposable income of those taxed.  While Ireland continues to borrow for day-to-day finances, that practice is set to end by 2018.  As it stands, the Exchequer is in primary surplus, such that all public money expended on higher education crowds out funding to other areas of public expenditure unless tax receipts increase.  The balanced budget effect subtracts Government funding and the associated multiplier effect of that funding.  We use a relatively high multiplier effect given the level of support to the sector.  It is important to note that any funding that comes from the European Union constitutes an external injection into the Irish economy.</p><p> As depicted in figure A1.9, institutions heavily reliant on Exchequer funding have their multiplier effects sharply reduced.  Diversity of income in the university sector allows them to maintain strong multipliers relative to the institutes of technology.  Table A1.2 provides a clear comparative illustration of the performance of Irish higher education institutions compared with their UK counterparts.  It is only in particularly specialist institutions in London, such as the London Business School, the London School of Economics and the Institute of Cancer Research, that we see higher returns.  It is important to note that Irish universities, as comprehensive institutions, consistently perform above their UK counterparts.  As figure A1.11 illustrates, there is no clear relationship between overall income and the balanced budget multiplier.</p><p> The input-output technique also allows us to make a comment on employment by way of a consideration of the number of jobs generated for every &euro;1 million of expenditure.  Through direct effects of the universities, or type I effects, the sector generates 1,731 jobs.  Induced effects, or type II effects, generate 66,470 jobs within the sector.  These findings are in keeping with US studies.  The fact that direct employees of the higher education sector are relatively well remunerated has a knock-on effect in the economy.  I would, however, urge great caution with respect to these figures given the nature of the Irish data.</p><p> Overall, our investigations so far have found that the higher education sector represents value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  In most circumstances it will return more than &euro;1 for every &euro;1 invested.  When balanced for the opportunity cost of Exchequer funds, it remains very high, especially compared with the UK sector.  I will, however, highlight some caveats.  The analyses to date have treated the sector as an industry and do not consider some of the more important aspects of higher education investment and outputs.  In addition, it is important to note that economic processes in reality are not linear.  Supply does respond to demand and typically in a non-linear fashion.  The Tionchar project hopes to progress towards a Solow impact, or the improved human capital endowment effect.  Although data limitations in the Irish context have complicated the process, we are beginning to use surveys to try to fill those gaps.  Our intention is to do a comparative benchmark analysis comparing Ireland with other European countries.</p><p> Our method says nothing about institutional efficiency, which is a reasonable concern given the state of the public finances.  Our later research will use a data envelopment free disposable hull technique, a form of operations research that looks at what is achieved versus potential activity within a sector.  Effectively, one is looking for the production possibilities frontier of a sector and where the sector is at.  This method is commonly used in health research.  Figure A1.13 5 provides a graphical representation of the technique.</p><p> The more complicated questions relate to individual returns to education and the non-monetary and societal returns to education.  I highlight this since returns from investment in higher education are crucial to our understanding of its role in the economy.  Higher education does afford a wider return to society, but this is very difficult to capture in empirical data.  Professor Walter McMahon of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Professor Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Professor Edward Glaeser of Harvard University have produced initial estimations of the health, family, social cohesion, happiness and income equality effects of mass participation in higher education.  This analysis of the complete economic and non-economic returns from higher education is complex, data intensive and requires careful interpretation.</p><p> I have attempted to highlight the initial results of the first comprehensive study of the economic impact of Irish higher education institutions since the 1960s.  It is clear the sector represents value for the taxpayer, given the consistently strong multiplier effects and taking account of the caveats I indicated.  I look forward to questions and comments from members.</p></speech>

Much of what he had to say seemed rather depressing, whereas the contribution from Mr. Purser made me feel elated.  That was somewhat confusing in terms of what we should be taking away from this meeting.  Mr. Costello referred to the deterioration in the student-staff ratio.  Mr. Tom Boland of the Higher Education Authority told this committee how that deterioration can lead to a deterioration in student performance as a consequence of the lack of mentoring, the isolation aspect and so on.  Will Mr. Costello comment on that?  Professor Morgan Kelly delivered a lecture recently in UCD on the rise of middle management and administration within the university sector and the failure to develop teaching and mentoring.</p><p>One is talking about quality and sustainability.  That seems to be a major part of it.  There also is a significant disparity in what one needs to pay to go to university in the South and what one needs to pay to go to university in the North.</p><p> Are there too many staff sitting in rooms doing research and writing books that nobody will read and not enough staff teaching?  I mean teaching in a thousand different ways.  I mean mentoring, for instance - an MIT system of teaching.  Last week I telephoned two colleagues whom I know well and both of them teach one hour a week.  Would the delegation comment on that?</p><p> Mr. Purser spoke of good news, and it was excellent.  He stated that 75% of companies were confident that graduates have the right workplace and transferable skills.  What was the outline of the companies?  Were they technology or scientific companies?  What kind of companies were they?  What was the cross-correlation of the 20,000 students who were assessed on this?  From where did they come?  From what disciplines did they come?  What was the balance of the disciplines?  Were they mainly from the sciences and the technology area or from biotechnology, or were they from the arts and humanities?  What was the balance?</p><p> Mr. Purser made an interesting point about the lack of language teaching at primary education.  He found in the study that there was a lower level of satisfaction from companies in the ability to speak foreign languages.  The lack of language teaching in primary education outside of Gaeilge is something that we have brought up in this committee.</p><p> Mr. Purser's paper is extraordinary.  I would have to admit that in listening to him I might have been in what as Gaeilge we call "rang a haon" - it means first class - in that I would not have had his genius and the knowledge of an economic background.  However, one of the most interesting points is what many of the professors of economics he mentioned say about how important education is for education's sake, that we do not always necessarily need an economic graph because there is such a thing as family happiness and social cohesion, and that the idea that we all go to university to get a job is a given.  Of course it is a major factor but education is for and by itself.  Are there a lot of studies on that?</p><p> The presentation was so considerable followed by our contribution that I will stop now, and maybe come back in later.</p></speech>

I do not see - perhaps I missed it - anything about attrition rates.  While the number of CAO applicants seems to be increasing all the time, I understand attrition rates are fairly high.  I am not too sure about the university sector but in the institutes of technology, IOT, sector there is a problem.</p> <p>  While they are here, we are moving towards clusters of institutes of technology and technological universities.  Do they see those encroaching on the traditional university or the traditional universities moving towards the technological area, if they know what I mean?  There is a significant amount of duplication in the country, which concerns me.</p> <p>  They also talk about income.  When in the sphere of education, when I hear one talk about income I get a little worried.  Education should be a cost on society.  I do not see the space for income, except, perhaps, in Ms Lucey's case where one is probably attracting lots of foreign students into the country.  I see nothing wrong with her case.  That is something I would like to see developed.  It will benefit the country overall.  Those are the only areas that concern me.</p> <p>  It will take me some time to work my way through Dr. Larkin's comprehensive report, and I thank him.  I am anxious to see the follow-ups to which he has referred.  If I am wrong, he should correct me, but I think it is the first major study on what is going on in third level in Ireland.</p> <p>  Does Dr. Larkin plan to extend that into the IOT area?  One of the areas I am concerned about is the marrying up of the different sectors in Irish education.  I brought this up with those who were here last week.  I refer to the progression from further education through to third level education, whether in a technology university, an institute of technology or a university.  I wonder whether there is any information on the fact that students in Ireland at a further education college can transfer directly to UK-based universities and get credit for the year's study that they would have undertaken in an Irish further education college whereas, traditionally, Irish universities want one to go back two years and start all over again and regard further education as an add-on to a poor leaving certificate.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

It challenges us all to assess how exactly to approach the funding of third level and support the sector in the future, especially bearing in mind we will have almost 30% more students in the sector by 2028, which, frankly, is a frightening statistic.</p> <p>  I have a couple of observations which may morph into questions.  Mr. Costello stated that in times of financial strife and difficulty, the amount of non-Exchequer funding of the sector increased significantly.  Was I correct in observing that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.459" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1042" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015021100002#J00600"><p>What latitude is there for further such funding?  I will ask the question bluntly.  Was the sector, with the decline in Exchequer funding, forced to be innovative in seeking out and securing such non-Exchequer funding, from where did it come and is there more funding in that space?  How good are we at looking at the tradition of other universities, particularly in the United States, of going back to the alumni to see can they make some sort of contribution?</p> <p>  Ireland earns &euro;1 billion per annum from international education, the vast majority of which goes into the sector.  Have we fully exploited that?  Some universities are especially adept at securing investment through international education and have done extraordinarily well in the past number of years.  How can we encourage a best-practice approach across the sector, learning from the wonderful examples that are emanating from some universities and, indeed, some excellent institutes of technology?  How can we take that learning and apply it across the system?</p> <p>  Finally, and this is something of a hobbyhorse of mine, what opportunity is there in the future to use technology to deliver learning and education, not alone here in Ireland but globally, particularly in emerging economies on the African Continent?  There are some governments, for instance, Zambia, through the World Bank, investing significant amounts in further education and third level education, looking at best practice internationally and, essentially, seeking out providers of such education, and Zambia is looking at technology as being one of the conduits through which that education can be delivered.  Is there any opportunity for us there?</p> <p>  We have an exceptionally strong brand abroad, and an especially strong reputation, as the land of saints and scholars and with the tradition that has grown down through the centuries.  Other countries, such as New Zealand, are doing extraordinarily well with a multiple of our output in international education, and yet I would argue that such tradition has been built up over the past 20 or 30 years.  We have a far older and far stronger tradition or, if one wants to call it that, brand.  How do we fully benefit from that in the future?</p></speech>

What we have tried to show is that the system has come through the crisis in many respects fitter and stronger, which is in line with the Deputy's point regarding income.  It has also done it by drawing on internal resources and drawing on a huge amount of dedication on the part of the staff in the system.  Whether the student-staff ratios, which is the point to which I was speaking, is a sustainable position in the long term is a big question.  The quality aspect is complex and, as Mr. Boland said last week, we will not see the position regarding that until it is gone and then it will be too late.  That is a concern.  Arising from the increase in student numbers and the decrease in staff numbers, there is less time available for the one-to-one element with students.  That is an inevitable consequence of what has happened.</p><p> Senator O'Donnell mentioned the research issue.  That arises but one has to examine where research in university fits in the round.  There has been a very significant change in the make-up of Irish universities in the past 20 years, and in the past 15 years more particularly, where they have moved from being predominantly teaching institutions to being research and teaching institutions.  That has been necessary because the world the universities serve now is much more innovative and dynamic.</p><p> An interesting aspect of the exporting sector in Ireland is that employment in that sector has tended to stay pretty much at around 350,000, but the companies that are part of that sector and that generate the 80% of our GDP, or whatever the percentage is, are completely different companies now from what they were 15 to 20 years ago.  It is a completely different cohort of companies.  Those companies and companies throughout the economy have much different expectations and universities need to respond to that.  That is from where the impetus for research has come.  On the one hand, it is to benefit companies directly because universities collaborate with companies on research.  Furthermore, it is to make sure that teaching in universities is at the cutting edge of knowledge and that the people who are teaching are fully informed by research.  It creates the issue of the balancing of research and teaching loads, to which the Senator rightly referred.  That needs to be done through a workload allocation system whereby, to take the example of a school, the head of the school can ensure that there is an equitable workload across all staff and that some staff do more research and less teaching and some staff do more teaching and less research.</p><p> The final point on that aspect is the issue of postgraduate teaching.  It can be questioned whether postgraduate education is education or research but, in reality, it is both.  We heard about the increase in postgraduate numbers which has been a big part of the increase in income.  Teaching and research are two sides of the same coin.</p></speech>

I was not thinking of it in terms of entrepreneurial skills, learning from it, innovation and having to research matters to move them on.  I was thinking of it at a completely different level but I take Mr. Costello's point.</p></speech>

It pulls and pushes back and forth between those two poles.</p></speech>

It has forced the universities to reduce their staffing by 3% a year during recent years.  Is that now impacting seriously on research?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.465" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ned Costello" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015021100002#K00500"><p>It has not impacted as badly on research as on teaching.  There is an interesting point regarding regulation.  When the second ECF was produced, we negotiated a flexibility within it for non-core funded research staff.  For example, if somebody got a grant from Science Foundation Ireland, the staffing associated with that grant was outside the confines of the ECF.  There had to be a 20% contribution to take account of the continued liability of pension costs but the staff associated with it were outside the confines of the framework.  Non-core funded research has done relatively much better but it has an impact in that the principal investigators are predominantly tenured academics.  The ECF has bitten on that side.  It has affected both research and teaching but, as Senator O'Donnell has pointed out, it has affected teaching more than it has affected research.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell raised the issue of attrition rates and I will ask Mr. Lewis Purser to comment on the non-completion rates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.466" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Lewis Purser" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015021100002#K00600"><p>I thank Senator Craughwell for drawing our attention to this area.  I have given it the slightly more positive heading in our background paper of completion rates rather than attrition rates, but it is same thing.  From page 20 onwards there is some discussion and data about it.  The universities have an attrition rate of 9% from first year to second year and that has been stable over recent years.  The Higher Education Authority uses the data submitted annually by every institution and then it does the studies.  It can check details through tracking students, use of personal public service numbers, etc., and that shows why national databases are extremely important.  It can get the national averages and all the national data.  That rate has held firm.  A 9% rate compared with the EU or OECD average is very good.  From the data I could find from the OECD publication, Education at a Glance, and I referenced this in our paper, the average is 30%.  Therefore, a 9% rate in the university sector is not bad and that is across all disciplines.  I will not shy away from pointing out that the challenges are in some of the science,  technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, areas.  Computer science in particular has always been a challenge.  It is linked to the shock some students get on going into first year from the mathematical challenge and challenges in respect of some other subjects that they may not have been fully exposed to in school at second level.</p></speech>

There are successful computer courses in the country where the mathematics element has been downgraded.  I am not so sure that is a good idea but it has happened purely to allow for the weakness with regard to mathematics.  Youngsters go to college expecting to develop the next greatest game or the next greatest app and they suddenly find their first year is totally immersed in pretty heavy mathematics.  For a student who drops out of college during first year or at the end of it purely because they made a bad choice, we make it very difficult to get back into the system.  Mr. Purser might address that aspect.</p></speech>

Since then, all students who have sat a higher level mathematics paper and achieved a minimum of a D3 have got bonus points.  It is not the only thing that has influenced a change in behaviour in second level students and in families, but it is one of them.  The Department of Education and Skills, to give it justice, has invested heavily in the continuing professional development of mathematics teachers.  The Project Maths curriculum has been rolled out.  From 2011 to 2013, we have seen a 45% increase in the number of leaving certificate students who are sitting higher level maths, which is a good thing.  It has certainly been welcomed by our stakeholders throughout the country, public and private.</p></speech>

However, as a <i>sequitur </i>to what Mr. Purser said, the Senator correctly adverted to the variation in non-progression rates across the higher education system as a whole.  There is evidence that they are worst in the institutes of technology sector.  While it is not for me to speak for the IOT sector, representatives of the sector would say that obviously the socio-economic profile of entrants to that sector is different and that inevitably has an effect.  The same pattern is evident with computer science in the IOTs as in the universities.  The more difficult courses, particularly those with lower points requirements, tend to be the ones that people come into.  They tend not to have the capability to succeed in the course and then they drop out of it.<br/><br/>On the question of technological universities, our position has always been that it is one of standards.  If an institution deserves the title of university, then it should look, walk and talk like a university.  Therefore a technological university should be of a university standard, but with a different disciplinary focus from a comprehensive university.<br/><br/>Inevitably, however, if technological universities are created, there will be bits of the technological aspect of comprehensive universities that look like a technological university, if I can put it that way.  I think we want that because we want universities to be as engaged with technology and with companies as technological universities are.  However, there is also a regional dimension, which the Department's policy would require to be stronger in the case of technological universities.  There is an SME element that the Department would maintain needs to be stronger as well.<br/><br/>I hate bringing everything back to resources, but as Mr. Boland did it last week, I am probably allowed to do it.  The big worry is that creating new universities will not be a cheap process.  Where will the money come from?<br/><br/>There is also significant challenge on the employment contract on the TU side.  The employment contract is very different because in the IOT sector, as the Senator knows, it is predominantly a teaching hours-based contract.  As the sector wants to do more research, it is struggling with that.<br/><br/>Fundamentally it is not a question of principle.  It is really a question of more practice.  If we have institutions of university standard, they should be universities.  However, we have to find a way to pay for it and then we are back to the sustainability piece.<br/><br/>I will ask Mr. Casey to talk about the diversity of income that the Senator and Deputy Cannon raised.</p></speech>

It peaked in about 2009 and it has begun to decline since then, but over the period it increased by &euro;117 million.</p> <p>  Back in 2007, based on analysis of the consolidated accounts, approximately 59.5% of total income came from Exchequer sources.  In 2013 that was down to 47%.  There have been concerted efforts to expand income from non-Exchequer sources and that has come from a range of places.  More income is coming directly from the students with the increase in the student contribution.  There is an element of that in it.</p></speech>

Most of the growth would have come from other areas.  There is international fee income, other fee income, postgraduate, other academic courses, CPD courses and other areas like that.  There have also been concerted efforts to commercialise campuses.  For example, universities would go to tender to provide bank concessions.  If a bank wants to have banking facilities on a campus, the university will try to exploit that in terms of money.  They try to generate income through sports facilities and other facilities on campus - car parking and things like that.</p> <p>  There have been efforts in the area of philanthropy.  In Ireland we do not have the culture in that respect, but institutions are putting in considerable efforts to develop that area.  They are trying to tap into alumni in an effort to develop and promote a culture of philanthropy in higher education.</p></speech>

However, it needs to be ring-fenced, carefully managed and controlled in order that we do not decide that we have a cash cow and start moving towards the cash cow while leaving behind the core role of the university which is to provide education up to postgraduate level, at which we have been very good.  We may be missing out on the cash cow and I would be interested to hear what Ms Lucey has to say.</p> <p>  I visited China in 2000 and the hunger to come here to study was incredible.</p><p>In the period 2000 to 2004 there were more than 380 Chinese students at the school in Blackrock at which I taught whereas now there might be ten studying there.  Somewhere along the line, we dropped the ball.  Going after that cash cow would not be a bad idea because it would mean that the academic aspect of the university would continue.

I do not think there is a significant risk that universities will take their eye off that ball.  There has been a necessity to generate income, from whatever source, in light of the fact that there is a relatively fixed cost base for institutions.  Staffing levels, pay and everything else are largely outside the control of the institutions so there has been a need to expand income in those areas.  I do not think that is a bad thing and institutions should not be taking their eye off the ball.  The processes and resources that have been put in place to try to exploit opportunities in those areas have probably been mainstreamed to some extent and that is a good development for the institutions as we emerge, one hopes, from the recent period of sustained cuts.</p></speech>

What we are discussing is the icing on the cake.  Not to trivialise it but the cake is getting smaller and the icing has had to get bigger.  One of the key issues facing universities relates to the fact that the restrictions on what can be done to incentivise and reward staff to generate more income are more significant.  This is a difficult one with which to deal because everyone knows what we have been obliged to go through to maintain coherence in the public sector and so on.  As Mr. Tom Boland mentioned last week, if we want staff to go out and really win significant amounts of international business, for example, or to go to teach in branch campuses abroad, it is reasonable to say that one must be in a position to incentivise them to do so.  The same is true in the context of continuing professional development, which is the other area in which a market exists.  If one wants staff to do stuff out of hours and provided one has the quality assurance system in place to ensure that this is not done at the expense of their day jobs, which is critical, then the regulators should be open to this.  At present, they are not open to it.  This is a matter of ongoing debate between ourselves and the Department.</p></speech>

While it might be quite strong in places such as the US, it is certainly not as strong in Asia.  That requires investment in our national brand by our embassies.  I commend the embassies in terms of the really amazing work they do in respect of the national brand, particularly in the context of education in Ireland.  The Deputy referred to New Zealand.  The New Zealand Government's level of investment in the country's national brand is significantly higher than the corresponding level of investment here.  I do not have the figures in that regard with me but I can certainly provide them.  Without the type of investment to which I refer, it is difficult to raise our profile in those markets.</p> <p>  We were asked about what is happening internationally in the context of best practice.  We would certainly support increased collaboration, and that has happened in the higher education sector in general.  Most of the higher education institutions in Ireland are involved in Brazil's science without borders programme.  We are currently processing 1,123 students in respect of it and there are more than 1,000 students here already.  That is real evidence of increased collaboration.  In the context of global relations, the Deputy correctly pointed out that we have not engaged with our alumni in the best way possible.  We are exploring a project in Africa at present to engage with our alumni and with friends of Ireland.  That project is proceeding on a pilot basis and if it is a success, we will consider the results.  We would certainly like to see it rolled out to other more significant markets.</p></speech>

There was an expectation that those who came here to study and received the relevant stamp would enjoy the quality assurance that came with it.

My question is associated with the topic being discussed.  I welcome the representatives.  Without wishing to take from the wonderful contribution to education made by Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT - the college is very proactive in the development of the midlands and has been working very actively with companies and businesses in the area to educate students to meet the various needs - I have long contended that the midlands deserves a university.  How far away is the provision of a university in the midlands?  The cost of coming to the city to study is a huge factor for students in the midlands, in terms of seeking accommodation and so forth.  That issue is brought to my attention time and again by parents.  It probably should be a separate item on the agenda for a meeting on education, but perhaps the members of the Irish Universities Association would give their views on the development of university facilities in the midlands.</p></speech>

Before the Deputy arrived we were talking about the big questions surrounding the affordability of the creation of universities and where the money would come from.  I should reference the very positive collaboration between Maynooth university and AIT.  That is where some of the imperative in national policy for clustering is originating.  In reality, it will not be possible to have a university in every location in Ireland and what we must do is ensure that the relationships between universities and institutes of technology and other higher education institutions are working as effectively as possible.  There is a very strong linkage with Athlone, not least because Maynooth would see itself as facing the midlands as well as the hinterland of the Dublin metropolitan area.  That is not the perfect answer, but it is the best one I can give.</p></speech>

In the west there is Galway and Limerick and there is Cork in the southern part of the country.

One criticism I have of the university sector - not all of it but some of it - is that it is not as flexible as the institutes of technology in terms of access.  I worked for two years as a clerical officer in the registrations office of the Institute of Technology in Bolton Street and I met people there who went from being an apprentice to doing a night course and going on to do a certificate and diploma.  One guy who had moved on to postgraduate study had started as an apprentice in Bolton Street.  There were always night classes and the college had a huge amount of flexibility.  I would be critical of Trinity College.  I went to Trinity College but there is not much change there in terms of the level of part-time education it provides from what was provided when I was there in the 1980s.  That is the advantage of ITs.  Both sectors do different things and from the socioeconomic perspective, the institutes of technology have an excellent record in flexibility.</p></speech>

I will start with the non-economic returns.  Some estimates for this have already been made by the OECD which can be found in Education at a Glance.  They tend to be very high for Ireland.  The estimate for 2010 is that the social contribution effect is $49,600 in public benefit for a man and $60,647 for a woman on a purchasing power parity basis.  One can calculate these things but, almost by definition, they will have many strings attached because it is an implied effect.  One is doing a precision calculation for these things.  Looking at the US data on this, what tends to drive the US data returns is  that individuals in higher education tend not to end up in incarceration.  The very high returns that are typically discussed in the US are social benefits-----</p></speech>

However, once one removes that, one tends to have better social cohesion effects and improved agglomeration effects in terms of innovation, which is what Professor Glaeser at Harvard University emphasises.  There are those types of benefits.</p> <p>  The problem in Ireland is that we have very poor data.  If we are to calculate these things, and Qiantao Zhang has been fantastic at this, we have had to create this from scratch through surveys.  The OECD has some data.  In the Central Statistics Office, CSO, there are gaps between income data and CSO data.  I draw members' attention to one of the most precise studies of this, Elish Kelly's paper from the Economics of Education Review 2010, "The economic returns to field of study and competencies among higher education graduates in Ireland".  That was driven entirely by survey data.  There was no CSO component in this except what came from the census.  The census has a difficulty in that while it tells us what people did at school, university and other higher education, it does not tell one how much they make.  Most other countries count this.</p> <p>  That would be one of the elements in that regard.  It is a very important component and it is something on which there must be much analysis.  It has been discussed by the Carnegie Foundation in the United States since it began its studies in the 1970s.  This has been a known quantity as an idea and there have been calculations since the early 1970s, even down to how much improved dental health one has as a result of going to higher education.</p></speech>

When the statistical analysis is done, they suffer from tremendous amounts of multi-collinearity.  Is the reason for the improved life expectancy of an individual who has gone through higher education down to the fact that he or she has gone through third level and has not eaten as many bad foods or engaged in as many bad habits or is it because they are part of a socioeconomic classification which tends to have higher levels of longevity anyway?</p></speech>

Does it work outside of the job factor?  In what way does it work and keep people alive with possibility, a quality of life and a sense of what the philosophers call "happiness", which is very much a part of what education should have been about, that sense of a life well lived?  It is a huge area and I understand it is not as easy to quantify or to qualify as economic research geniuses such as Dr. Larkin.</p></speech>

Professor Richard Layard in the UK who was the research assistant for the Robbins report, which created the modern higher education system in Britain, has published extensively on this.  There is something that can be developed but it is a matter of getting the initial data together to look at that question.  Professor McMahon in the University of Illinois has calculated this into his non-economic returns to higher education.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell referred to further education, credits and progression.  There are many aspects to costs which can be examined in terms of progressing from further education into higher education.  Significant data and analysis has been done in the UK about this because they have this question about where FET dovetails into higher education and the OECD has done good work on this.  I bring the attention of members again to the 2015 edition of Going for Growth and pages 220 and 221 which reference Ireland.  There are recommendations relating to FET activities for labour market activation policies as well as recommendations on research and development policies, which would dovetail with the DEJI approach to universities.  As was highlighted by Mr. Costello, there is a constant tension between what the Department of Education and Skills and DEJI hope to achieve as policy objectives in the higher education sector.  That is sometimes difficult to reconcile because universities are seen as elements of the national industrial policy.  If one were to go back to the mid-1950s and examine higher education policy and the analysis of human capital policy, they were not seen as much as part of the national industrial policy but as part of a wider social and manpower policy.</p></speech>

We have worked closely with the Department Education and Skills, HEA and IUA.  We hope that part of our work becomes part of the policy discussion.  We have begun discussions with people connected to the secretariat for the Cassells group.  They are looking at their analysis now and the NESC work for the Cassells group will probably have to use some of the work we have done because on the issue of diversification of income, it is clear that institutions that have more diversified income have a stronger economic impact because there is less of an opportunity cost unless one is talking about areas with profoundly slack aggregate demand.  The stimulation provided by a higher education institution in such areas is more a reflection of the fact that there is above average unemployment and below average economic activity than anything else.  In the UK, these types of studies have begun to be used by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to bring about new campuses in locations referred to by the Minister there as economic cold spots.</p></speech>

I refer to diversity in the system.  One of the strengths of the Irish system historically is that it has been a diverse system and we do not want to lose that.  It has also been a less well co-ordinated system and the direction in national policy is towards a diverse but better co-ordinated system.  Two aspects are important in that regard.  The first is that there used to be a great deal of talk about parity of esteem among institutions.  The benefit of the HEA's strategic dialogue and compacts process is that it asks institutions how well they fulfil their chosen mission and their standing will ultimately be determined by how well they do so within a system of diverse but co-ordinated institutions.  We do not want institutions all doing the same thing.</p> <p>  However, we would like to provide the committee with an additional note on the question of access and diversity of entry routes, which the Chairman raised, because there has been significant activity in that space in the university sector.  Time does not permit a discussion but we can provide a note.</p></speech>

It is an independent project and not an IUA project but, hopefully, it will lead to the start of a conversation about higher education as an investment rather than as a cost in order that when we discuss the cost, we look at it in return on investment terms.  It tends to be talked about as a cost on the State or a cost on the individual.  The project is hugely valuable in that regard.</p></speech>

From the Office of Public Works I am joined by Ms Clare McGrath, chairman; Mr. Tony Smyth, director of engineering; and Mr. Michael Long, accountant.</p><p>As Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I am pleased to set out some of the priority programmes of work to be funded from the 2015 Revised Estimate for the OPW.</p><p>As members will know, the OPW is responsible for a wide variety of functions, with an overall budget of &euro;397 million in 2015.  The principal areas of responsibility reflect two priority areas of the Government's programme - flood risk management and estate portfolio management.  Before I address these two areas, I take the opportunity to remind committee members that the funding presented to them today, as part of the Revised Estimate, does not represent the full extent of the OPW's activities.  In 2014 the OPW also incurred expenditure on behalf of other Departments and agencies which amounted to some &euro;126 million.  The main areas of this expenditure were the provision of schools for the Department of Education and Science, the newly developed national children detention facility in Oberstown for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the delivery of the Intreo programme for the Department of Social Protection and the leasing of accommodation on a repayment basis for numerous Government clients.  In addition, the office's professional and technical staff also perform in an advisory capacity across a wide variety of functions which include energy conservation, architectural matters and property management.</p><p>On the topic of flood risk management, members of the committee are well aware that the OPW is the lead agency in the management of flood risk in Ireland.It has invested over &euro;400 million in flood risk management measures to provide protection for homes and businesses across the country.  Under the framework for capital investment up to 2016, the Government committed &euro;225 million to flood risk management, a substantial capital allocation which is enabling the OPW to continue its flood risk management programme in conjunction with the local authorities.  Despite regular reductions in capital funding, the OPW has made every effort to prioritise this area of investment in recent years.  A capital allocation of &euro;60 million is provided for the programme in 2015. </p><p>In order to implement the State's strategy for flood risk management , the OPW has developed a catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme in recent years.  The CFRAM programme lies at the core of the assessment of flood risk management and will allow Ireland to meet its commitments under the EU flood directive.  The programme is focused on 300 areas of potentially significant risk.  These areas are known as areas for further assessment, AFAs, within the programme.  A comprehensive suite of flood maps is being produced for each AFA which will represent a significant addition to and complement the existing flood mapping produced by the OPW.  The ongoing programme is looking at all possible options to address flood risk in each AFA and will identify the optimal measures for inclusion<font color="#0000E0"> </font>in the flood risk management plans to be produced under the programme.  Members are probably well aware of this in their constituencies from ongoing consultations on the matter.  The programme will set out the medium to long-term strategy and, subject to resources, prioritise a programme of work to achieve the effective and sustainable management of flood risk in Ireland.</p><p>For members' information, the current position is that flood maps are being produced by the OPW.  It is only through the clear identification of the risk now and in different climate change scenarios in the future that all of the main stakeholders concerned, both nationally and at local level, can work<font color="#0000FF"> </font>together towards implementation of sustainable measures to manage that risk.  In line with this approach in recent years, numerous major flood relief projects are being advanced by the OPW and at various stages of completion.  The schemes in Bray, for the River Dodder, in Fermoy, Waterford and Ennis are just some of the ones under construction, with considerable investment committed to in 2015.  Many other schemes are at various stages of planning, with a view to starting construction this year.</p><p>Many areas of the country, mainly coastal areas, were impacted on during the adverse weather in December 2013 and the early months of 2014.  To repair the public infrastructure that was damaged, the Government allocated funding to various Departments, including &euro;19.1 million to the OPW.  The chairman of the Office of Public Works wrote to the committee last month providing details of the funding and payments made by the OPW to local authorities in 2014 in respect of damaged coastal protection infrastructure.  Provision is included in the 2015 OPW Estimate to meet the storm damage funding allocations which some local authorities were unable to draw down in 2014.</p><p> In tandem with its major capital projects, the OPW has provided almost &euro;27 million in funding for local authorities since 2009 to carry out localised minor works where a requirement for such works is identified and they meet the eligibility criteria set out under the scheme.  The OPW has established excellent working relationships with the local authorities and this, together with the considerable funding provided for them, has proved to be a key factor in maximising the capacity of the minor works scheme, with approximately 460 projects completed to date under the scheme. </p><p> The estate portfolio management programme, on the other side of the Vote, encompasses the management, maintenance and development of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio, including the conservation, protection and presentation of national monuments and national historic properties in State care.  Property represents the second highest administrative cost to the Government in the provision of public services after pay and pensions.  The Office of Public Works has been given the considerable task by Government of rationalising the State's property portfolio in order to reduce that cost and reflect the substantial fall in staff numbers across the Civil Service in recent years.</p><p> The ownership of State property is legally vested across many State authorities and agencies, which can at times result in an independent approach by each State entity to managing its property portfolio.  Changing this approach by legislation to a more centralised model would be an onerous undertaking and thus the Government decided that a collaborative and consistent approach by State property managers in dealing with property would be the most effective manner to progress this particular reform.  With this in mind, the Government appointed the Office of Public Works as lead of the steering group on property asset management to co-ordinate and drive this reform.</p><p> As protocols for streamlining intra-State use of public service property are being developed within the group, we are already seeing more effective engagement by public property holders.  Optimising value for money and the enhanced use of State properties for the public good continue to be pursued through an ongoing property disposal programme and a more streamlined administrative and legal process for the valuation, transfer and sharing of property.  Strategic property related decisions are being facilitated by an intra-State property register, developed by the OPW, which is being populated with property data from all State property holders.  Ministers have given their full commitment to ensuring their Departments and agencies will co-operate fully.  The plan will, over time, promote agreed targets for space allocation per full-time equivalent employee to be achieved by Departments.</p><p> From the OPW's perspective, office accommodation was recognised a number of years ago as one area where significant savings could be made.  I am glad to update the committee that, since 2008, the OPW has undertaken a major rationalisation programme that has resulted in the surrender of over 1.2 million sq. ft. of office accommodation and yielded a cumulative reduction of over &euro;111 million in rent.  In that period the OPW has surrendered 276 leases, with an annual rental value of &euro;34.7 million, while rent reductions were negotiated by the OPW on 121 leases between 2008 and 2014.  The annual rental value of reductions achieved is &euro;8.59 million. </p><p> The drive to further optimise office space needs to continue and will be facilitated by establishing a revised workplace definition for the public service based on space allocation required for the functions being performed by staff.  Departmental accommodation requests will be addressed through examining alternative, flexible modern working practices and encouraging Departments to review records management processes and storage needs in order to optimise space requirements and achieve best value for the money invested.</p><p> As part of the project management service provided, the OPW will continue to deliver both major and minor works to a variety of Government clients.  This year will see major Garda accommodation projects on site at Wexford and Galway and on Kevin Street in Dublin, while the development of Kilmainham Gaol and courthouse will be completed in time for the commemoration of the 1916 Rising.  </p><p> In the area of property maintenance the OPW has assumed funding responsibility in recent years for the provision of a shared service for Departments.  The funding for works relating to building maintenance of State property to the value of almost &euro;20 million transferred to the OPW in 2013.  This allowed the OPW the opportunity to manage maintenance on a prioritised, whole of government basis and initiate a planned preventive maintenance works programme, which will produce savings in the medium term and deliver better care for the fabric of the State's buildings. </p><p> Within the area of estate portfolio management, heritage services manage the conservation and presentation of 760 national monuments and 30 national historic properties, with a combined provision of 70 visitor centres across the country.  Through targeted presentation by the OPW, visitor numbers to heritage sites have increased by 33% since 2010.  The free first Wednesday initiative, for example, has contributed greatly to the increase in visitor numbers.  Visitor numbers at staffed heritage sites continue to grow, with 4.4 million visitors recorded in 2014 and multiples of that number visiting open sites around the country.  The focus of heritage services in recent years has been on the protection and maintenance of structures, with a greater emphasis on minor improvements works, rather than on major capital projects.  Any investment funds available will go to sites most in need and, importantly, to where capacity has been identified that will generate increased business and receipts.  The planned reinvestment of surplus receipts generated from creating such additional capacity will support a strong incentive to increase activity at heritage sites and improve business opportunities.  It is a key initiative.</p><p> On staffing, I am pleased to inform the committee that, after an absence of some years, the OPW has reintroduced the apprenticeship programme.  This topic came up at Question Time this morning.  The national monuments division has recently recruited 21 apprentices in the crafts of carpentry, joinery and stone masonry.  They will be the first participants in the inaugural SOLAS stone curriculum.  This is a valuable development in the field of conservation and will maintain and sustain these skills to the benefit of the OPW, the wider State sector and the country into the future.  In tandem with this initiative, the OPW continues to demonstrate its commitment to training and work placement through its ongoing programmes that enhance the professional development of professional graduates, while making a contribution to the work of the office.  </p><p> I acknowledge and highlight the substantial contribution the OPW's staff play in these programmes of work for the State.  Since my appointment as Minister of State, I have had the opportunity to experience at first-hand the professionalism of many staff cohorts across the office, ranging from the engineering staff dealing with drainage maintenance and flooding crises in communities to the exceptional guiding staff at heritage sites who are ambassadors for tourism in many parishes and communities.  I compliment all staff of the office on their work and ongoing commitment in the challenging environment they continue to face.  </p><p> I thank committee members and look forward to taking questions they may have.</p></speech>

I wish to ask general questions across the board.  We will then clear the subheads one by one.  I will concentrate on a few issues, one of which is flood risk management and the State's portfolio.</p> <p>  The Minister of State says the OPW does a lot of work on behalf of other Departments.  It manages the Leinster House complex, Government Buildings, Dublin Castle and many other places.  There used to be an issue of being paid by the relevant Department.  How much money is due to be paid by Departments and how much is owed for longer than 12 months?  Are there amounts for which the OPW has billed Departments that have not been paid?  It may be on a sheet of paper in someone's drawer in the OPW or on a sheet of paper in someone else's drawer at the other end, but it is relevant in considering the financing of the OPW.</p> <p>  I was disturbed by one newspaper headline on an article written by a journalist about paintings missing in the Leinster House complex.  It gave the impression that it had happened after the previous general election.  In fact, it almost gave the impression that some Deputies had run away with them.  It could be seen in the light that paintings could not be located after the previous general election.</p><p>Will the Minister of State provide an update on this issue?  I suspect the paintings have not been tracked down and that they are in storage in a basement somewhere.  I would like the Minister of State to debunk the myth that has developed in this matter.  I do not have any painting in my office.</p></speech>

Yeats in his office?</p></speech>

Why is it involved in this regard?  I thought most of the PPPs relating to these projects would involve the Department of Education and Skills or individual school boards of management.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State expand on the position on the OPW's delivery of Government initiatives in terms of commemoration projects?  There is only a 1% increase in this regard.  There is a very big centenary coming up next year, namely, that of the 1916 Rising.  I would have liked to have seen a significant increase in the Estimate for 2015 in preparation for next year's events.  An increase of 1% in the entire subhead for heritage services does not give the impression that sufficient planning is taking place in the commemoration of the 1916 Rising.  Perhaps the Minister of State might outline the position in greater detail.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State provide a rundown of the Intreo public offices managed by the OPW?  This is a relatively new project and remains a work in progress.</p> <p>  The next issue to which I wish to refer relates to the old decentralisation programme and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's offices in Portlaoise.  This matter has been discussed by the joint committee and I tabled a number of parliamentary questions on it.  Essentially, the Minister of State confirmed in reply to one of these parliamentary questions that sanction had been given for an extension to the offices in Portlaoise.  There are 11 offices leased in the town and the Minister of State provided information on all of them.  Having already sanctioned the extension, it appears the OPW is now going to conduct a space audit in the coming months.  Does the sanction still obtain or will it have to be amended in the light of the results of the space audit?  Why was sanction given, particularly as the OPW is now obliged to engage in such an audit?  If the Minister of State does not have the relevant information to hand, he can forward it to me.</p> <p>  My final point is on subhead B10 - unitary payments.  The OPW is managing the National Convention Centre in Dublin on behalf of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport by way of a public private partnership.  It is indicated that the costs to be borne by the State will be met by means of single unitary payments from the OPW Vote over a 25-year period which commenced in mid-2010 and that the final capital payment will be made in 2015.  The briefing note we have received indicates that for the period 2012 to 2015, inclusive, capital payments amounted to &euro;75 million.  The total is probably even greater, particularly if earlier payments were made.  The capital payments on the National Convention Centre are running at approximately &euro;30 million per year.  Over a period of 25 years, this amounts to &euro;750 million.  Therefore, the total involved will be over &euro;800 million.  What was the total cost involved during the lifetime of the PPP for the National Convention Centre?  I do not know whether the unitary payments are due to taper off over time or whether they will increase.  Will the Minister of State indicate what will be the full cost of the PPP for the entire period?</p></speech>

Frankly, matters in this regard have become silly.  There is no view within the OPW that anybody went off with a load of paintings in the back of his or her car.  Let us be very clear on that point.  However, there are lessons that need to be learned about the inventory of State art.  We have adopted the necessary procedures.  Any Deputy with an office in Leinster House or any public building is entitled to hang State art on the wall.  There is a perception that such art is locked away in vaults, but that is not the case.  It can be found in Garda stations, Intreo offices and Leinster House.  Some of it could be hung in the Deputy's offices if he was so minded.  As he is aware, there tends to be a significant churn of personnel in these Houses.  Members lose their seats, while others are promoted and demoted.  There are those who will leave pictures on the walls of their offices when they leave, while others will take them with them when they move offices.  That is our understanding of what happens.  However, 21 artworks remain listed on the OPW art asset register.  These may have been moved to different office spaces within and outside Leinster House without the Superintendent's staff being notified.  Several artworks have been located in other Departments or offices during inventory checks in recent years.  The issue is not particular to Leinster House, although referencing the Parliament tends to make for a good media story on occasion.  My officials had discussions with the Superintendent on this matter and he has agreed to circulate images of the unlocated works to assist the inventory process.  During the summer months I expect my staff to dedicate a little more time to this matter in order that we might try to bring it to finality.  There is no assertion on my behalf or that of the Office of Public Works that anybody ran off with the paintings in question.  However, there are lessons to be learned.  The OPW, as an agency, is eager to ensure State art is displayed.  There are a number of peace initiatives, as part of which we take State art on tours, both North and South.  We are very eager that State art be accessible, that it should not be locked away in vaults and that it should be displayed in public buildings.  I am happy to debunk that myth.</p> <p>  A decision was taken by the Government that the OPW would directly contract work in order to assist in the delivery of schools.  This was viewed as a speedier method of proceeding.  The projects are directly contracted from us and I can supply the Deputy with the details.</p> <p>  As all Deputies will be aware, a number of Departments are involved in planning next year's commemorations.  The lead Department is the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  It would be useful to provide the Deputy with an overview of the OPW's involvement in the process.  As stated, Kilmainham Courthouse is going to be renovated and integrated into the Kilmainham Gaol visitor attraction.  This is going to be of major benefit to what is one of our most popular and heavily visited tourism sites.  Since taking up my position, one of the most common complaints I have heard is that, such is the level of demand, tourists are obliged to queue for lengthy periods to obtain access in Kilmainham.  If not actually in Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's constituency, this attraction is located close enough for her to know it well.  The idea is that a new visitor space and entrance will be created at the former Kilmainham Sessions Courthouse, which will greatly expand capacity and the value of the experience.  The Government has made &euro;5.5 million in funding available for this project, as one of the signature capital developments associated with the 2016 anniversary.  There were 328,886 visitors to Kilmainham Gaol in 2014, 326,200 in 2013 and 310,910 in 2011.  Urgent repair works have been undertaken to protect the fabric of the courthouse and prepare for the more significant works to be carried out by our property maintenance services which will be completed in quarter 1 of 2015 at a total approximate cost of &euro;3 million.  In addition to the courthouse project, the OPW is also undertaking work to adapt and refurbish the gaol museum, which is obviously also a key part of the visitor experience.</p> <p>  A restoration programme has been put in train at Glasnevin Cemetery.  Works to be undertaken on memorials are funded from the general grant to the cemetery.  Obviously, however, we provide any co-operation and assistance we can.</p> <p>  The Commissioners of Public Works have statutory responsibility under the National Monuments Act to undertake the care and maintenance of national monuments.  There are a number of historic properties under the care of the OPW, including Kilmainham Gaol, Arbour Hill, the Garden of Remembrance, Pearse Cottage in County Galway for which significant funding has been provided, Dublin Castle and the Pearse Museum at St. Enda's Park in Rathfarnham.  We will be fulfilling our statutory remit in protecting these properties.  As the Deputy is aware, a new Cabinet sub-committee charged with dealing with this issue has been appointed and on which the OPW is represented.</p> <p>  I have an update for the Deputy on Intreo offices.  The Government set the OPW and the Department of Social Protection a very ambitious target-----</p></speech>

The first ten Intreo offices were delivered in May 2012 and a further 35 offices were handed over in 2013 and 2014.  The remainder are targeted for delivery in 2015.  In a number of towns Intreo has been delivered across two locations.  The Intreo programme is estimated to cost in excess of &euro;40 million.  Where possible, the OPW and the Department of Social Protection will work within existing available space.  However, at 20 locations, additional accommodation or leases will be required.  Many of the projects targeted for completion in 2014 have rolled over into early 2015.  I am happy to acknowledge that fact.  Given that it has been an ambitious programme, property solutions have been found, on occasion, to be complex.  This has involved the splitting of the Intreo offices into two locations.  However, the majority of Intreo offices are complete or will be complete by the end of this month.  I can provide more detail if the committee wishes.</p> <p>  Deputy Fleming knows the history of the issue of Portlaoise far better than I do.  While there was a decision taken, there is no funding to make that decision a reality. As a result, the OPW has been considering the scenario.  We have given a commitment to carry out a space audit.  I reckon that is the prudent thing to do at this stage.  I know from my colleagues across Government that several public servants and civil servants working in various Departments are based in Portlaoise.  We are going to carry out the space audit.  The current annual rent for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine lease in Portlaoise is a little short of &euro;634,000.  The rent has been reduced from approximately &euro;926,000.  There is one matter I am somewhat concerned about, which comes up from time to time in parliamentary questions, although not necessarily from Deputy Fleming.  It is the idea that if we have a lease, it is not a permanent building.  Sometimes, the OPW uses leasing as a more appropriate way of providing a permanent facility.  It is not necessarily a short-term lease.  I am happy to continue to engage with Deputy Fleming on the matter.  Anyway, we are carrying out the space audit.  That is the most up-to-date position.</p> <p>  The unitary payments in respect of the National Convention Centre will be phased out over time.  Committee members will note there were significant payments in 2012, 2013 and 2014, but they have been decreasing each year.  The capital payment in 2012 was &euro;20.221 million, whereas in 2015 it is &euro;13.5 million.  The project cost is &euro;380 million.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

I wish to raise with the Minister of State the issue of flooding.  There is an ongoing issue that many householders have in respect of getting insurance for their homes.  I know that the predecessor of the Minister of State, Brian Hayes, had entered into discussions with the insurance industry.  Will the Minister of State bring us up to date on the position?</p> <p>  I welcome the plans outlined by Minister of State for Kilmainham as well as other projects of the OPW in respect of works in anticipation of next year.  No better body than the OPW to be in charge of such works.  Its excellence as a State body is well established.</p> <p>  The Minister of State did not mention Moore Street, the national monument and the terraced areas.  The Minister of State is aware that this is an area of some controversy.  He may not be aware of it, but Kilmainham is not in my constituency, while Moore Street is.</p></speech>

There has been ongoing toing and froing between Dublin City Council, the Department and the developer.  The thing is a fiasco, quite frankly.  With a little over a year to go to the moment of commemoration, it is quite disgraceful that it has come to this pass.  I realise the Minister of State may be limited in the nature of his commentary overall.  However, I call on him to set out the role of the OPW in this as well as anything he may be able to do by way of finding a solution.  To my mind, any solution requires entirely new planning permission as well as a new concept for Moore Street and the historic buildings.</p> <p>  I note that under subhead B8 the Department is paying more than &euro;86 million in rent.  Has there been a value-for-money audit in respect of this area?  I know the Department is holding substantial leases.  Are there plans to surrender more of them?  It is a substantial budget.</p> <p>  I am keen to raise the issue of the National Convention Centre as well.  The Minister of State will be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General issued a rather damning report on that project.  He found that the high cost of the project would outweigh its public benefit over the next century.  Obviously, he wrote that when we were approaching the new century.  Anyway, it is rather shocking.  In fairness to the Minister of State, the unitary payments have been scaled down, but they are still very substantial.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland reckons the potential benefit of the Conference Centre to the economy over the 25-year period when the payments are being made will be somewhere in the region of &euro;170 to &euro;255 million, well short of the investment by the State.  The point is that in 2010, on foot of this fiasco, the Comptroller recommended changes in terms of how bids are evaluated in future.  Can the Minister of State indicate whether those proposals have been taken on board?  Have those recommendations been implemented?</p> <p>  By the way, on the issue of heritage services, I call on the Minister of State to tell me he had nothing to do with the 1916 video or that website fiasco.</p></speech>

My faith in the Minister of State remains steadfast.</p> <p>  I note there has been an increase in spending on Government publications under subhead B12.  I gather it is in the region of one third, if I am not mistaken.  This is substantial.  I had assumed that e-publishing would yield cost savings, with an eye on the environment and efficiency.  Will the Minister of State explain the position, please?</p> <p>  Under subhead B9, service charges and utilities, a total of &euro;10 million is associated with energy costs, water rates and other local authority charges.  The Minister of State said some of this was still being paid on unallocated space.  Will the Minister of State explain this, please?</p></speech>

My predecessor established a memorandum of understanding between Insurance Ireland and the Office of Public Works.  The understanding was that the Office of Public Works would make available all details of flood mitigation works carried out by it.  In turn, Insurance Ireland would make that information available to its member organisations.  The information could then be considered by them in assessing risk.  As everyone knows, the OPW does not have a role in regulating the insurance industry.  However, the OPW is the lead body in respect of flood mitigation and it can make all the information available.  That is what we are doing.  Insurance Ireland representatives have come back to my officials in recent days with the first progress report on what it has done with the information it has been given.  As soon as that is analysed I would be glad to come back to the committee with it.  I may be broadening my remit somewhat as Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, because we do not have a policy role, but I am a Minister of State at the Department of Finance as well.  Anyway, I believe that as a country we need to have a serious discussion about flood insurance.  I have looked at examples in other countries.</p><p>There does not seem to be a magic wand solution.  They are doing something in the UK.  We need to watch and see if that works.  We could learn from that.  They have started a few initiatives in France which have not worked and which have been unwound.  We are unlikely to get into a detailed flooding discussion because we had one at the previous meeting, but if the State is gearing up to invest even more significant amounts of taxpayers' money in flood mitigation over the next decade, we need to have a scenario in which people can obtain flood insurance for both commercial properties and residential homes.<br/><br/>A dual approach is needed.  The first approach, in which I have a direct role, is that the OPW gives the information to Insurance Ireland to pass on to its member organisations, which should let us see an increase in insurance coverage and good faith in return.  However, if that does not work, I have an open mind on what we should do.  While I do not wish to give the committee more work, I would be eager to engage on this on a cross-party basis.  I will revert to the committee with the first progress report from the industry's point of view on flood insurance in the coming weeks.  I would appreciate its help on that.<br/><br/>I do not have a role in the Moore Street issue.  My role covers property taken into State care.  There is then a duty on my office to maintain it.  These buildings have not been taken into State care and, therefore, it is a policy matter for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.<br/><br/>We have had significant success on rents over recent years.  A total of 1.2 million sq. ft. of office space has been surrendered, which equates to 276 leases.  Department rents have fallen from &euro;131 million in 2008 to an expected outturn this year of &euro;87.4 million through a programme of lease renegotiations and surrenders.  The OPW continues to progress the property asset management delivery plan to ensure further opportunities.  We have plans to further reduce leases this year.  We have a surrender target of 16 leases, 15 of which are in Dublin.  This will amount to 349,717 sq. ft.  This work is not finished, though we have achieved a great deal.  There are also plans to move to OPW-owned properties.  There will be lease surrenders, for example, by Department of Social Protection local offices.  The headline target is further lease surrenders, the overwhelming majority of which will be in Dublin.<br/><br/>I have inherited a legal reality where the convention centre is concerned.  The contracts are signed and it is a legal agreement.  The decision was not mine or the Deputy's but it was taken in the context of the ancillary benefit to the State of having this facility available and attracting conferences.  It is my office's role to administer that legal reality and that is what we are doing.  As the Deputy acknowledged, the cost is decreasing.  With regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's comments and whether lessons have been learned, it is a matter for the National Development Finance Agency, but I will revert to the Deputy on that as well because serious issues have been raised.<br/><br/>With regard to the issue of Government public services, the increased requirement in 2015 is for additional printing costs of approximately &euro;65,000 relating to the publication in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>by the Department of Justice and Equality of the details of approximately 66,000 non-nationals to whom citizenship was granted in 2010 and 2013.  I am a great believer in e-government, but that is why the subhead has increased.<br/><br/>With regard to unallocated space, this relates to vacant buildings, including Garda stations, which I discussed with Deputy Fleming this morning.  There has been a decrease in the number of vacant buildings.  A number of Garda stations were closed through both disposals and arrangements with the community.  That is what the figure refers to.</p></speech>

There are plausible reasons for this, but I am anxious to know that this is not a case of training for training's sake.  Is there a metric for this?  Do the people who undergo training deliver better services afterwards?  I refer to shared services.  The training allocation has increased from &euro;262,000 to &euro;627,000, while the training allocation for the Valuation Office has increased by 33%.  I acknowledge that staff need training, but when they are training, they are not working.  I am wondering whether it is necessary.</p></speech>

Where are all those people now?  Are they all squashed in or are the properties leased?  That is a massive reduction.</p> <p>  We discussed flood plains with the former Minister of State, Brian Hayes, a few years ago.  As late as this week, someone in my own village was refused insurance because of the maps and contacted me.  When the maps were last drafted, work on them was not done on the ground.  They were based on previous maps.  The flood plains stopped on an incline, because water cannot flow uphill.  When the new maps are produced, will they be more reflective of reality?</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State considering moving Heritage Week? It is always held in early September, which is a busy time for those involved in agriculture.  We never get to enjoy it.

None of us believes that insurance companies are not mapping risk.  If the fact that Ireland and other European countries are complying with an EU floods directive in the interest of their citizens to map flooding on a methodical basis, make it public and set out in a systemic way a list of projects that need to be done, it would be regrettable if the industry suggested that would create new risk in any shape or form.  I have spoken to industry representatives about this.  I told them that we will continue to make available the information we have and keep them in the loop.  They are involved in a number of CFRAM stakeholder groups.  I am disappointed when I hear the feedback the Deputy has given, because we are not creating new risk, but I hear it from time to time.  Nobody is at a greater risk of being flooded because the OPW is mapping the risk.  We will lessen the risk by being able to seek funding from Government to properly address it.  However, we have been clear that the maps are preliminary.  There is significant ongoing consultation in the Deputy's constituency and county and then there will be final maps, which will be more reflective of that.</p><p>If the Deputy has specific constituency concerns or community input that he wants to feed in he should please come to me. </p></speech>

It has not moved and is not likely to move, given the new information the Minister of State has provided.  He has quite rightly said it already had information he will continue providing.  There are people in every constituency who cannot get insurance and who continue to be at risk of flooding, for example in Baltrasna Lane, in my own neck of the woods, on 13 November.  These people are out of their homes for months on end and suffer &euro;30,000 worth of damage every time there is a flood and they cannot get insurance.  What steps will the Department take?  Does it need to bring in new legislation?  There must be at least a minimal level of insurance that insurers must be obliged to provide to certain people.  I know two families on Baltrasna Lane who have abandoned their houses because they do not have the money to keep putting back into them because there have been floods again this year and they are down &euro;30,000 again.</p></speech>

I cannot speak for my predecessor.  He put in place this arrangement, which has been very good, to establish the sharing of information.  We are now at crunch time.  We have the first progress report.  We need to see whether all that engagement and time-consuming effort by the Department&rsquo;s officials in meeting with the insurance industry yielded results for the citizens.  We told the insurance industry we had reduced the flooding risk in an area and asked it what it had done.  We will have the initial overview of that shortly.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct to ask where do we go if there is no co-operation.  I do not want to jump that hurdle or to presume.  I want to engage in this in good faith.  Co-operation is the easiest way from every perspective, including that of our constituents but I genuinely appeal to this committee to work with me on where we go if that does not happen.  Before I worry the chairman of the OPW and others, the OPW does not have a mandate in respect of flood insurance or insurance policy or regulation.  However, across Government, be it in the Department of Finance, or through a Government decision, there are policy options.  When I started exploring options, out of curiosity and frustration for my own constituents, I found that the policy options I thought might work did not.  It was difficult to find a perfect model.  I would be very happy to engage with the committee on this issue.  Insurance Ireland, OPW officials and officials of the Department of Finance will have a round table discussion on this issue because it is a question of wanting to work and to co-operate with people but we also have to ask what happens if the State spends nearly &euro;1 billion putting in place schemes.  In fairness to the industry, it is important to say there will be several new schemes coming on stream &ndash; pardon the pun - for flood mitigation.  We continue to roll them out.  We will continue to provide that and to engage.  I am not in the business of an engagement that does not yield results or of deploying public time and resources should it not.  I hope it does.  I am entering into it in good faith but I would really appreciate the input of everybody on the committee. </p></speech>

We can put this into the mix too.  We would appreciate if the Minister of State would send any information he receives to the committee secretariat because it is within our remit.  We will feed it into our discussions when the insurance companies come before us.</p></speech>

He is right that we can regard training as wasteful but we need to be very careful because as part of Civil Service renewal and making sure our public services are fit for purpose we are, for example, obliged under the new building regulations to provide five days of professional training to people in the engineering sector.  I assure the Deputy it is not window dressing.</p> <p>  In response to the question about where all the people are gone, there are fewer people working in the public service and that has been reflected in property choices and decisions made by this office in consultation with Government clients over recent years.  We are also moving to different types of workplace.  I see it in the OPW office in Trim.  We are moving to open plan and hot desks which helps us reduce leases and costs. </p></speech>

I appreciate what is being done and wish the Minister of State well.  I hope everything that he and the officials do yields results.  The people we represent do not have any more hope.  They are at the end of their tether.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State explain the increase in the budget for household staff costs in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in?  Did we get a lorry load of new positions that we do not know about?  It has increased by 7%, which is quite significant.  This time last year when we spoke to the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor it was revealed that there was an extra few bob in the heritage budget that had not been spent last year and because there were very few people in the room we had a general discussion about possibly investing in the visitor centre at the Hill of Tara.  Subsequent conversations and correspondence revealed that would be pushed forward.  It is not mentioned anywhere in this year&rsquo;s budget.  No further discussion has been held about it.  We have one of the most precious sites in the country in Meath and there is not even a toilet there for people who visit it.  There is not a visitor centre there to open five days a week, let alone seven days a week.  It is an absolute shame that there has been near on zero investment in one of the most beautiful sites in the country.  What are the plans in that regard for this year?  Where was the extra &euro;25,000 spent last year that was ringfenced at the end of the year for Tara?</p></speech>

On 1 January 2014 there were 24 people working there and on 1 January 2015 there were 20 people.  The budget was provided at the end of 2014 in anticipation of 2015 but we do not expect it to be fully spent.  There was an extra pay day which inflated the salary figures.

There is a view that we should not stick our oars into administrative issues arising between the OPW and local authorities but nonetheless it is in my constituency and concerns the site acquired on behalf of the OPW by Cork County Council and funds which are due to be refunded to the council.  That needs to be wrapped up.</p> <p>  The OPW recently purchased a site with Cork County Council for a Garda station and a fire station.</p><p>The local authority, Cork County Council, is proceeding in-house with its own design for the fire station and the OPW is about to embark on a process to appoint consultants to design a Garda station.  It would appear to be desirable on a number of fronts, not least for the economies involved, but also from a design compatibility perspective, that we would have one design team working on the site.  I have tentatively raised this issue with the local authority and it has no objection in principle.  It would also assist in shrinking the timeline involved in getting a project like this, critical local infrastructure, to a stage where it can proceed to construction.  Could the Minister of State confirm that there is not a problem from his side in working with the council, notwithstanding previous hiccups the OPW has had with the council, to resolve a single design team?  There could be two very fine designs done by the respective design teams that might not be compatible on a single site and it would be better if one team was designing the fire station and the new Garda station.  The Minister of State might address those two issues.</p></speech>

My officials are in discussions and will be meeting Cork County Council officials.  I do not think it is prudent for me to say more than that, but the meeting will be taking place.</p> <p>  Regarding the delivery of a Garda station and a fire station in Macroom, which we have discussed, there are examples of where this has happened before and there has been synergy between two projects.  I would urge Cork County Council to contact my officials to explore this.  There is no problem with having the conversation and it is a live possibility that it could work.  I cannot definitively say one way or the other, but certainly there are no flashing lights that the conversation cannot happen.  I would encourage Cork County Council to contact my officials, who will certainly engage on it.</p></speech>

I am sure, if it is possible, that as a public body it would like to facilitate another public body because that is what public bodies should be doing.  It would like to assist in solving a problem and doing it more economically than having two design teams.  The initiative to make contact should probably come from the OPW, should it not?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.605" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22015021100002#G00800"><p>That is a very good question.  There are a number of reforms.  I have to say this sincerely.  In this role over the past seven or eight months I have had the opportunity to travel to an awful lot of OPW sites, many of which I had never been at before.  The dedication and commitment of the staff, who, like so many right across the public service, have had to deal with fewer colleagues in the workplace, pay reductions, harder work and all that sort of stuff, is something of which we can all be really proud.  That is seen in the visitor numbers.  Even in a scenario with fewer staff on the sites and given the challenges for anybody working in the public or private sector during an economic crisis, to actually see these people continuing to increase visitor numbers is something of which we can be really proud.</p> <p>  From an economic point of view, the OPW has managed to take on a substantial body of extra work and it is important to say that it is extra work.  The Government makes decisions and the OPW then has to get on and deliver the decisions.  The Intreo offices, the school buildings, the maintenance we carry out, the many extra tasks that have been taken on at a time of reduced budgets and reduced staff numbers is a credit to my officials and our front-line staff throughout the organisation.</p> <p>  I put the statistics on the record of this committee earlier in respect of the economic benefit of the work of the OPW.   Aside from the economic benefit of the revenue brought in at heritage sites, we have the economic benefit of our flood management schemes and the colossal work being done by Tony Smyth's team on the whole seafront project.  If we look at the money that has been saved for the taxpayer, and it is a recurring annual saving, by reducing the footprint in terms of State leases, it is quite colossal and I outlined those figures.</p> <p>  There is a lot of work to do.  There is no area in which the OPW is working where the work is complete, and probably no area where the work will ever be complete.  The organisation can be very proud of what it has achieved, but the work goes on.</p></speech>

Does he have any liaison with, say, the IDA in specific regions where the IDA finds it does not have the appropriate sites?  Does he liaise with the IDA and see if he would have the appropriate sites that might be useful for it or even for other enterprises?</p></speech>

There has been a scenario in the past where the left hand did not necessarily know what the right hand was doing.  For the first time, we are trying to bring together all the information and the IDA is able to feed into that, which I think is important.</p></speech>

How come they are still in the system if the Minister of State says his budget now covers that?  Is that old money that is still coming through from previous years, and how much is still outstanding?  That was my essential question.  The Minister of State might explain to us one other question.  On subhead C2, events and facilities management, is that to other Departments or would that involve concerts and private events?  What kind of locations would have been rented out for events and facilities management?</p></speech>

Regarding recoveries for services carried out on a repayment or agency basis, which is under subhead J4 that the Deputy raised, from goods and services we get &euro;9,529, an agency fee of &euro;826,634 and, from the Social Insurance Fund, which repays the OPW, half the rents of all properties.</p></speech>

We are seeing a lot of each other today.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the 2015 Estimates for my Department&rsquo;s group of Votes.  The group, as the Chairman said, comprises a significant number of Votes.  It contains the Vote for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Vote for the Office of Government Procurement, the Vote for shared services, the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of my Department, namely, the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the Valuation Office and the Office of the Ombudsman, the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances, which covers Civil Service pensions, and the Secret Service.  The Vote for the remaining element of the public expenditure and reform group, that for the Office of Public Works, is handled separately by the sub-committee.</p> <p>  In total, we are seeking for these Votes just short of &euro;504 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;30 million, or 6%, compared with the original 2014 Estimate.  Almost &euro;19 million of the &euro;30 million increase is due to the timing of the 1 January 2015 pay bill, which had the effect of creating an additional fortnightly pay bill in 2015.  If we exclude this item, the actual increase is 2%.</p> <p>  The Public Expenditure and Reform Vote comprises two programmes, as sub-committee members will know, public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform.  In regard to the first programme, the sub-committee will recall my appearance before it a fortnight ago, on 28 January, to discuss the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015-2017.  My statement on that day dealt in detail with the areas covered by the first programme.  In the circumstances, I do not think that it will be necessary to go back over the same territory today, but I am of course willing to answer any queries which might arise.</p> <p>  In regard to the provision for Vote 11 for my Department, we are seeking a net funding allocation of &euro;40.61 million.  This represents an increase of &euro;4.7 million compared with 2014.  The increase is required primarily for the second programme of my Department, public service management and reform, where additional funding is required to progress the ambitious targets set out in our recent public service ICT strategy.  ICT has been recognised as a critical component for the successful delivery of many existing public services.  The public service ICT strategy which has been approved by the Government will enable the public service to build on these successes and use ICT to operate in a more efficient, shared and integrated manner across all Departments.  The increase will also support the implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan, which is a key programme for Government commitment.</p> <p>  As set out in the public service reform plan, public service reform has been, and will continue to be, a key element of the Government's strategy for recovery.  I acknowledge that the level of reform we have delivered would not have happened without the efforts and commitment of public servants, and I commend all of them on their contribution to date.  The Public Service Reform Plan 2014-2016 has a strong focus on service improvement and the delivery of improved outcomes for service users.  In addition, it maintains the emphasis on efficiency measures which was a key element of our first reform programme published in November 2011.</p> <p>  Implementation of the reforms set out in the plan and in the complementary departmental and sectoral integrated reform delivery plans will facilitate ongoing service improvements and cost savings into the future.  Substantial progress has been made on public service reform across a range of areas in terms of reducing costs, delivering better value for money and improving services.  Details of this programme will be set out in the annual progress report on implementation of the reform plan which is due to be published next month.</p> <p>  Staff numbers have been reduced, as members know, by around 10% since 2008, and the pay bill has been reduced by more than 20% since the peak of 2009.  Our programme of public service reform has delivered significant efficiencies and increased productivity.  It has also enabled us to maintain and improve public services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets while meeting increased demand for services.</p> <p>  Examples of measures to reduce costs include reforms in the areas of public procurement, shared services, alternative models of service delivery, ICT and digital government, and property management.  A core principle of the reform plan is to use some of what I have classified as the reform dividend from increased efficiencies to reinvest in new or improved services.  Savings made have already facilitated the recruitment of extra staff in key front-line public services, as I indicated to the House today.</p> <p>  Sub-committee members will be aware that, together with the Taoiseach, I launched the Civil Service renewal plan on 30 October 2014.  This innovative plan incorporates a vision and a three-year action plan.  It represents a fundamentally new direction for the Civil Service.  Renewing the Civil Service is a key part of the overall public service reform programme.  The plan has been crafted to build on the existing strengths of the Civil Service and to take actions where required to improve the capacity and capability of the Civil Service to meet existing and future challenges.  All of the actions in the plan will support a higher performing and more open and accountable Civil Service.</p> <p>  The key themes of the programme are for the Civil Service to be unified, responsive, professional, open and accountable.  The immediate focus now is the work involved in delivering on the six priorities for implementation by the summer.  The priorities are: the establishment of an accountability board, which is well in train; the creation of a Civil Service management board, which has already been done; the establishment of the first performance review process for Secretaries General; identifying available options to strengthen the disciplinary code, in particular to address underperformance; to extend open recruitment in key areas to fill the skills gaps that are now emerging; and to undertake the first Civil Service-wide employee engagement survey.  I am looking forward to overseeing progress in the implementation of the renewal plan this year and working with my colleagues across the Government to support the changes.</p> <p>  The reform and delivery office, or RDO, within my Department is overseeing and driving the reform programme across the Civil Service.  It is, of course, often necessary to invest in the short term to facilitate change and ensure savings will accrue in the medium term.  For this reason, the RDO has been allocated &euro;1.99 million in 2015 from the reform agenda fund.  The funding for the RDO will be used to support a number of reform initiatives and projects, including the implementation of the public service reform plan, as I said, implementation of the Civil Service renewal plan and funding for investment in the reactivation of the Irish non-profit knowledge exchange, INKEx, database.</p><p>I will happily give more details about the database because it is a very exciting project.  We will also provide support <font color="#2F2F2F">for external service delivery projects and seed funding for new shared services projects.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Overall, I am satisfied that the progress we have made on public service reform is very significant.  Of course, I am very conscious that we need to maintain a strong focus on the delivery of reform to ensure that we continue to have a sustainable and flexible Civil Service into the future.  To this end, my Department will continue to work with all Departments and offices, particularly with larger sectors, to ensure that services are delivered efficiently and that outcomes for services and service users are improved.</font><br/><br/>I shall now discuss public service pay.  The Haddington Road Agreement forms the cornerstone of pay policy up until 2016 when it is due to expire.  The recovery in the economy is in no small part due to the contribution made by public servants in keeping the cost of the public service pay bill at a sustainable level. <br/><br/>The public service gross pay bill was reduced from its peak of &euro;17.5 billion in 2009 to an estimated &euro;13.8 billion net of the pension-related deduction last year.  The cost reductions and the substantial productivity increases, including additional hours worked, which the Haddington Road Agreement and previous public service agreements have facilitated, have allowed the Government the scope to reinvest in key front-line services such as education, health and policing by recruiting additional staff to deliver those services.  This is a reform dividend that will help sustain the public service reform agenda by reinvesting some of the efficiency savings we are delivering into improved services. <br/><br/>Effective management of our fiscal affairs also requires us to plan for and address the public service pay and pension reduction measures which are based on emergency based legislation.  I refer to the so-called FEMPI legislation.  As our fiscal position improves, the emergency basis on which the financial emergency measures are singularly based no longer forms a secure legal basis for the continuation of the legislation in its present form.  <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I have made it clear that public service pay rates will continue to be frozen this year.  It is the seventh successive year in which there will have been no pay increases for public servants.  As we know, there have been two or in some cases three cuts in wages.  <br/><br/>While there have been some comments on the issue of increases to public service pay, it is important, as I have said this morning, that expectations in this regard are realistic.  I have identified that at a minimum, my preference is to have the first quarter Exchequer returns available to me to inform any response to pay claims submitted by public servants and their unions which will form part of discussions in coming months.  Any such discussions on pay will take place in the context of the State's fiscal position and the pace of financial recovery for this year and next.  The current financial stability, which was hard won, will not be jeopardized.<br/><br/>One of the most notable features of the Croke Park and Haddington Road agreements is that both the Government and the public service unions strove to find a negotiated solution in very difficult circumstances, where public servants were being asked to contribute so much both financially and in terms of real and genuine reform.  I expect that future negotiations, including any discussions that might take place this year, will also be carried out in good faith and in accordance with the industrial relations machinery in place.<br/><br/>In addition to progress in public service reform, we have been pursuing a wide ranging political reform programme &ndash; the other strand of my Department's second programme of work.  This is aimed at delivering open, accountable and ethical government underpinned by a transparent, efficient and effective public administration system to help rebuild trust in government and in the institutions of the State.  <br/><br/>Many of the commitments in the area of political reform, set out in the programme for Government and in the public service reform plan, are now in delivery phase and real progress has been made on a number of fronts.  These include, for example, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013, which was enacted in July and commenced in September of that year; the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 which is now the law of the land; the Freedom of Information Act 2014 which was enacted last year; and the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014 which was enacted last year.<br/><br/>Turning to other Votes in the PER group, I am aware that the chief procurement officer in my Department, Mr. Paul Quinn, briefed the committee in recent weeks regarding the reform of procurement across the public service and the development of the Office of Government Procurement.  The development of such an office is an important innovation. <br/><br/>The procurement reform programme is an important element of Government's overall reform programme.  The procurement reform programme is tasked with delivering increased value for money, more accurate and timely data, and an improvement in the capacity and capability of procurement across the public service.<br/><br/>The net funding allocation for the Office of Government Procurement in 2015 is estimated at &euro;18.974 million, compared with &euro;12.431 million last year.  That is a significant increase.  A portion of this funding reflects budget transfers from the national public procurement policy unit and national procurement service, functions that previously resided on my own Department's Vote and on the Vote of the Office of Public Works.  They have migrated into this consolidated Vote.  Further budget reductions will be achieved, across the wider public service, as procurement functions migrate to the centre.  That means there will be savings in a number of other Votes that will be added to the Office of Government Procurement Vote over time.  Procurement of supplies and services represents a very significant portion of overall Government spending.  It is essential that the public service achieves economies of scale and maximum value for money that it expends.<br/><br/>We have talked about shared services many times.  Shared services is an innovative business model and a key element of the reform plan that takes advantage of the latest technologies to drive better value for money.  It frees up departmental staff to focus on more strategic areas and core services.  It reduces complexity and duplication across organisations and greatly improves efficiency.  Shared service centres typically take two to three years to become established and stabilised.<br/><br/>The national shared services office, within my Department, is leading shared service strategy and implementation of shared services projects within the overall reform and renewal context.  The new office is directly responsible for overseeing shared service projects within the Civil Service.  As part of its wider leadership role, it provides expert guidance and support to other public service sectors in progressing their shared service commitments such as local government.  <br/><br/>Solid progress continues to be made across all aspects of the shared services transformation agenda.  PeoplePoint and the Civil Service human resource and pensions shared service now service more than 26,000 employees across 21 different public service bodies.<br/><br/>The payroll shared service centre services 20,000 payees across 21 bodies.  It is envisaged that the financial management shared services project will be progressed further this year.  Shared services projects are also being advanced across the wider public service.  As Deputy Fleming will know in particular, Laois County Council is leading the roll-out of a payroll and superannuation shared service for the local government sector which is known as My Pay<i>.  </i>Payroll and financial management shared services for the<b></b>education and training boards are proceeding as a priority in the education sector<i>.</i>A feasibility study and business case for a single integrated financial system is<b></b>advancing in the health sector, together with work on e-invoicing. <br/><br/>A provision of &euro;39 million is sought for Vote 18 - Shared Services.  The increase, compared with 2014, reflects the ongoing migration of transactional human resources, pensions and payroll processing within the Civil Service to the shared services Vote, together with the advancement of the financial management shared services project.  A significant portion of this increase is mirrored by offsetting reductions on the votes of the originating Departments.  These projects, by their nature, require a certain amount of upfront investment but will yield economies and efficiencies in the medium term.<br/><br/>PeoplePoint will become fully operational this year.  The transitioning of payroll shared services will reach a conclusion next year.  The financial management project will return to Government for final decision during the course of this year.<br/><br/>In regard to Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, sub-committee members will have received a short summary briefing note on the Vote and its various subheads.  As recorded in that note, the Vote primarily provides for pension and retirement lump sum costs for civil servants, including prison officers, and pension payments for dependants.  The sub-committee will recall that there was a Supplementary Estimate for this Vote last year.  As I emphasised at the time, this is a Vote that is particularly difficult to estimate year on year as expenditure is primarily driven by the variable numbers of individuals who will opt to retire before reaching their compulsory retirement age, and whose years of service and grade-pay level will determine final payment which is variable and uncertain. <br/><br/>The majority of persons covered by the Vote, once they reach the age of 60, may opt to retire at any stage before reaching compulsory retirement age, which is generally 65 years of age.  Eligible persons may opt to retire even earlier than 60 years under the terms of the cost-neutral early retirement scheme, CNER.  In addition, there will be levels of retirements due to ill health as well as persons becoming eligible to claim preserved pension benefits arising from previous employment within the Civil Service.</p><p>These are people who are already out but did not qualify for the age until this year.  To illustrate the volatility of personal decisions to voluntarily retire before reaching minimum pension age, in 2012 more than 600 persons opted for CNER, cost-neutral early retirement, while in 2013, just under 80 persons did so.  Approximately 130 persons did so in 2014.</p><p> Members of the sub-committee will be aware of the announcement yesterday of an extension to June 2016 of the period within which public servants can retire under the terms and conditions which they held prior to the pay reductions under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  As I stated in my press release, the main considerations for the extension relate to workforce planning and impact on services.  This Estimate, involving a net provision of &euro;370 million, represents a decrease of &euro;14.8 million or 4% on the 2014 net Estimate.</p><p> The sub-committee has been supplied with a detailed briefing by my Department&rsquo;s officials on the various Votes in the Public Expenditure and Reform group, including those for the sub-offices of the Department.  The Vote for the Office of Public Works is handled separately by the sub-committee.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.  I commend the Estimates and am happy to answer any questions which may arise.</p></speech>

What were the specific savings on that?  The lottery regulator is answerable to the sub-committee and this is the first opportunity we have had to discuss this issue.  The Estimate has a figure of &euro;150,000 for the office.  The Minister stated it is anticipated that the new licensee, Premier Lotteries Ireland, will be in a position to commence funding the office in 2015 and, therefore, a relatively small budget is required to cover the early costs of the office.  This sub-committee has been asked to provide funding for that office as part of this Estimate.</p> <p>  It is extraordinary, however, that as soon as we give the new licence to Premier Lotteries Ireland, for the first time in 30 years the lottery did not take place due to some problem.  What is the role of the lottery regulator in the process?  Will the Minister give us a report from the lottery regulator&rsquo;s office as to when it became aware of the difficulties before the recent &euro;10 million draw had to be postponed?  On the day it occurred, what actions did the lottery regulator take?  Was the office informed of all procedures?  Was the decision not to carry out that Wednesday night lottery taken by the regulator or by the operator?  Whose function is it to make that decision?  I want to know the power of the regulator.  We have seen right across the Oireachtas regulators established which then have become just poodles.  We have seen this with the communications regulator.  The energy regulator has control over Irish Water.  However, when the Government made a decision on water prices, the regulator heard about it just like everybody else.  We have established regulators but ensured they have little power because we have circumscribed their functions.  If the lottery regulator&rsquo;s office is to be funded through this Vote, we need to know why a draw was not held for the first time in 30 years.</p> <p>  The Minister stated the State assets disposal programme was brought to completion in 2014, yielding special dividends to the State from the sale of assets of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB of &euro;350 million in 2014 and approximately &euro;1.4 billion in total over 2014 to 2016.  Will the Minister inform us what funding is expected to come through in 2015 and 2016?  If the programme has been brought to a conclusion, does that mean there will be no decision to sell the Government&rsquo;s 25% shares in Aer Lingus?</p> <p>  There has been a significant increase in subhead B5, consultancy and other services, from &euro;100,000 last year, with an outturn of &euro;102,000, to &euro;450,000 this year.  The increased allocation in this subhead reflects several new expenditure pressures including legal costs.  The budget has been allocated in respect of costs awarded on foot of a legal challenge taken by the Garda Representative Association on the inclusion of garda&iacute; in cuts to sick leave entitlement for public servants.  Will he explain the background to this case?  Why is this Vote being used to pick up the costs?  Whose decision was it to take this challenge to the courts?  Was it necessary to defend it?  Could common sense not have prevailed before getting into these legal costs?  Are we paying costs for both sides?  What is the practical outcome of this?  Did the Attorney General have a role in this case?  Is that the same Attorney General that the Oireachtas was meant to rely on yesterday?  If it was, the Attorney General may have got this badly wrong too.  We want some details on this particular issue.</p> <p>  On the reform agenda, the outturn last year was approximately &euro;700,000 but this year the Minister is looking for &euro;2.4 million.  What reforms will happen this year?  Why is the reform agenda three and a half times more expensive this year compared to other years?</p></speech>

Obviously, when we were preparing the Estimate in October, we had to make a provision for &euro;150,000 to cover the operation of the regulator in the course of 2015.  I am advised that it is unlikely that any of these moneys will be used because the full cost of the regulator, including the provision of premises and support staff, will be borne entirely by the licensee in accordance with the Act.</p><p>We have made a provision in case of a carryover of a few thousand euro from last year.  We need a subhead, but I am advised it is unlikely it will amount to the &euro;150,000 being provided.</p><p> With regard to the role of the regulator during the difficulty experienced in recent weeks when the lotto draw was delayed for a day, I understand the regulator of the national lottery has requested a full report on this outage, to include the reasons contingency measures did not work and the lotto had to be postponed.  Apparently he has asked for measures to be taken by Premier Lotteries Ireland, PLI, which is the licensee, to avoid a recurrence.  He has also demanded details of testing and any other measures taken to provide assurances.  All of this is being done, I am advised, by the regulator.  The Deputy will recall that during the passage of the Act last year we made the regulator amenable to the House, so it may be worthwhile when the full investigation has concluded to invite him before the committee to go through it in detail and give reassurance, because it is important that people have confidence in the operation of the lotto as it is a very important national institution </p><p> The State asset disposal programme was brought to a completion last year, yielding special dividends of approximately &euro;350 million last year to the State from the sale of assets of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB.  I am advised approximately &euro;1.4 billion in total special dividends is expected from last year, this year and next year.  I can go through this in some detail if the Deputy wishes, or I can give him a document on Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the ESB with regard to the sale accrued and the dividend profile.  Would the Deputy like me to read it or will I provide the detail to him?</p></speech>

As I answered in reply to a parliamentary question this morning, Aer Lingus was on the list of assets available for sale but it was heavily conditioned in the announcements made at the time by me and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  An approach has been made by the parent holding company of British Airways to acquire not only the State shareholding but the entirety of the shareholding in Aer Lingus, and this is a matter being pursued by a group involving the Department, led by the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Finance.  It will come to the Government in due course.  As of now, I have not made any provision for returns or dividends from any such sale.  It will be a matter to be determined in due course.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked particularly about Vote B5, the legal costs from the Garda case.  The advice of the Attorney General was sound since we won the case.  I do not want to be discordant about it, but I must say it was rather unusual to win a case on all grounds, as we did, and not have costs awarded for us.  We have decided to appeal this and it is before the Supreme Court.</p></speech>

We introduced primary legislation to change the sick leave arrangements and we debated it at some length.  I gave a period of time because further matters had to be determined by the Labour Court.  This was at the end of 2013.

Given that the Minister has set out his stall, that he intends to carry out what he described this morning as a scoping exercise with the public sector unions, I presume he envisages a deal in time for the budget.  He is committed to ratcheting down or unravelling FEMPI but he also stated here that he is committed to implementing it and sticking with the current formulas.  I am confused.  These are confusing messages.  I ask the Minister to clarify this.</p></speech>

We have made very substantial reductions in the pay bill of the order I indicated, from a peak in 2009 to last year.  The anchor of much of these reductions is financial emergency legislation, which is unique legislation because we have not in the past by law reduced the pay and conditions of any set of workers.</p></speech>

This was the trade-off I negotiated with the public sector unions.</p> <p>  I am conscious, and the advice I have from the Attorney General is, that FEMPI legislation is not a permanent feature.  It is predicated on there being an emergency axiomatically, and I must make this determination and report to the House annually underpinning it.  Rather than simply sailing to the day when demonstrably an emergency no longer exists - God hasten that day - and have the entire underpinning of these reductions and pay sustainability undermined, I propose to open discussions.  I have stated that once I receive the third quarter figures I will begin the process of discussing with the public sector unions their priorities, because there are a number of subsets in the issue.  I want to maintain, and I have indicated this in the questions I answered this morning, the productivity gains we have achieved.  I do not want to undermine them, and issues such as reformed sick pay are now permanent features of the Civil Service code.  I want as far as practicable to give the best support to the most vulnerable and the lowest paid, but I want to engage with the unions on their priorities.  It is my intention, if at all possible, to have an agreement that can be balloted by the public sector unions before we get into the final phase of budgeting, which will be September, so that when I present the budget in October we will have clear understanding of the amount of money to be paid, perhaps on a multiannual basis.  I do not want to show too many cards, but as the Deputy knows, the budget horizon is now on a three year multiannual basis.</p></speech>

I am conscious of time.  In April the Minister will commence the scoping exercise with a view to having something on paper, if not balloted, by September.  He used very particular language with regard to rolling back, phasing out or scaling down FEMPI but in his opening statement he made it clear that public service pay rates will continue to be frozen in 2015.</p></speech>

From the beginning of my utterances about wanting to engage with the public sector unions, I made it clear that Haddington Road would be expected to run its course.  Haddington Road is a three-year agreement from the summer of 2013 to the summer of 2016.  We need to have an agreement not simply to run into that but to understand where we are going beyond that.  Certainly, when I produced the budget and Estimates for 2015, the maintenance of the Haddington Road agreement was explicit in all my utterances publicly in the House and outside.</p></speech>

What is envisaged here is that if someone retires in the shadow of the grace period, his or her pension calculation can be determined at the pre-FEMPI cut.  The most recent FEMPI cut was in the 2013 Act.  I have obviously had a great deal of discussion with colleagues, particularly in both the health and education sectors, who want to give certainty to people.  I have been contacted by individual unions on extending the grace period to facilitate people to continue in work up to the normal retirement age who are within a year or two of retirement and would like to continue working but feel obliged to retire early to take advantage of the grace period.  On balance, that was the right thing to do.  I gave consideration to extending it permanently so that there would not be a deadline <i>per se</i>, but I would have to change primary statute to do so.</p></speech>

I have raised with the Minister before the statute law revision programme in subhead B9.  This has been going on since 2002.  I understand the Minister can confirm for the committee that he has used JobBridge interns to carry out some of this work, if not all of it.  He might just refresh my memory on that.  He might tell me if he is continuing to use JobBridge interns and whether any have been offered full-time contracts at the appropriate rate.</p></speech>

It is an extraordinarily valuable programme involving largely either newly qualified or qualifying law students to give them first hand involvement, originally in the Office of the Attorney General and now in my Department.  We have used JobBridge for that purpose and it has been a hugely oversubscibed programme which is regarded as an extremely valuable asset on people's CVs.  Much of what we discuss here is rather dry and, as such, I note that the Government passed yesterday the latest tranche of legislation to be published on foot of the statute law revision module.  The programme is about tidying up the old laws on the Statute Book.  Deputy McDonald in particular will be glad to know that among the provisions we intend to repeal in the current batch is a proclamation of 1561 declaring Shane O'Neill to be a traitor, an order of 1590 prohibiting the sale of horses out of the Pale on pain of death, a declaration of 1654 ordering the removal of Irish Papist proprietors, their wives, children and families from the provinces of Leinster, Munster and Ulster and requiring them to go to Connacht-----</p></speech>

While I will move on, I am not happy with the answer the Minister gave me.  He says the regulator has asked for a report, but that is looking for a report on a horse after it has bolted.  If a regulator is to be of any use, a clear line must be drawn between his office and the bodies he regulates.  It appears from the Minister's answer that the regulated bodies did what they liked and told nobody.  I do not know whether they informed the regulator and whether they had the authority to cancel the draw without the regulator's approval.</p><p>The idea of asking for a report when it is all over shows the regulator's role is possibly very minor.  If the regulator is to be taken seriously, operators need to operate in fear of the regulator so that they will not want to cross the regulator.  If they do not fear crossing the regulator, it means the regulator does not have much power.</p></speech>

I will not go back over the previous discussion but the Estimate last year for this Vote was &euro;362 million.  The Minister brought in a Supplementary Estimate in December for another &euro;22 million because it is hard to predict the numbers.  We are told the outturn was &euro;368 million which meant the Minister required an additional &euro;7 million, even though he came to us in December looking for &euro;22 million.  I know it is hard to predict but looking for &euro;22 million with only a couple of weeks to go to the end of the year when only &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million was ultimately required seems a good bit off the mark.  It is more of an observation and I acknowledge how difficult it is.</p> <p>  In regard to the Government announcement yesterday on the extension of the grace period in respect of retirements, to which Deputy McDonald referred, the Minister said he got approval from the Government to extend it to June 2016, which is fine and it probably makes common sense to extend it to the end of the agreement.  I wish to ask about the modalities more than anything else.  That deadline was in the Financial Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  Will this require legislation or a statutory instrument?  </p> <p>  The Minister said he was concerned there would be an exodus of senior staff if he did not make this change.  He also stated that an exodus of senior staff would also carry with it the short-term financial effect of once-off superannuation costs.  It is probably asking too much but given that the Minister said in his press release yesterday that a short-term financial effect would have arisen had he not made this change, was he able to advise the Government of what that effect may have been or of the lesser effect, having got that sanction?  I presume that when he went to Government to ask for this sanction, he said it made sense and that there was a financial effect.  What is the financial effect to which he referred in the statement?</p></speech>

It was not discussed with us.  We will get through the business very promptly.  We will fly through some of the other subheads.  We might take another few minutes here but I will not be caught by a ten minute limit.  I do not think the Minister would be happy the conversation was being curtailed.</p> <p>  In his press release, the Minister said that the pension is then subject to a reduction under the same legislation of between 2% and 5%, which reduces the benefit.  That will not apply if this runs to the end of the agreement.  That would have happened to people if they had gone this year.  Under the Haddington Road agreement, they would have experienced the pension reduction of 2% to 5%.  Now that this is being rolled out to the end of 2016, anybody going after that will not be caught by that cut in the Haddington Road agreement.  Is that correct?  The Minister might just explain those points.</p></speech>

I will not mention them by name but one RTE correspondent outside a hospital on the first grace period night was expecting Y2K to happen, everyone to down tools and a mass exodus of people.  However, that did not happen.  We have done something unique in terms of cutting people's pay.  People have had 40 year careers with an expectation of a pension at the end of it.  There was an immediate burden in regard to the actual take home pay they were getting and that we would reduce the impact of that on the pension into which they paid over 40 years.  That is why we had the grace period in the first instance.  I mention those who were not caught by the grace period but who were still caught by the Financial Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013.  People within the grace period between now and 2016 will, if their pay is impacted - if their pension is more than &euro;32,500 - be caught by the Financial Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 on their actual pension calculation.  That is fair because the Deputy may remember, we mirrored the reduction for those in salary of &euro;65,000 with a proportionate reduction for those in pension of &euro;32,500.</p> <p>  In terms of the legal mechanism to do it, I am empowered by the Financial Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 to do so and it will be done by way of statutory instrument, which I will lay before the House.</p> <p>  In terms of the discussion we had before Christmas on the quantum of money &ndash; I know the Deputy is not making a big deal of it &ndash; in essence, it was not the numbers who retired that changed but it was the appropriations-in-aid we got.  We did not have an exact calculation on the amount of net money that would come in from pension contributions under the single pension scheme.  It was actually greater than we expected.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister will supply a detailed note to the committee on these subheads.  The Estimates never before provided a figure for liabilities under Chapter 2C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Although nobody can predict the ultimate figure, the estimated figure is &euro;1 million.  The Act places joint liability for taxes due on the trustees of pension schemes where an individual's pension benefit from all sources exceeds &euro;2 million.  While this liability has not arisen to date, a provision of &euro;1 million is being made for 2015.  The threshold value for a pension scheme has decreased enormously from &euro;5 million, to &euro;3.5 million and now to &euro;2 million.  The pensions value for retiring senior civil servants is probably far higher than &euro;2 million.  Some people will retire on pensions of &euro;100,000 - I am not saying that includes anybody in this room - and the ultimate value of that pension could amount to more than &euro;2 million depending on the individual's life expectancy.  We are into a new era in which legislation that rightly applies to people in the private sector is correspondingly applying to those in the public sector.  However, the idea that the taxpayer should be liable for any tax due because an individual's pension is valued at more than &euro;2 million is difficult to accept.  Surely the liability for any tax due on an individual's pension fund should fall to that individual rather than the junior clerical officers who are paying for it through their taxes.</p> <p>  Perhaps I am misreading the matter but I ask the Minister to clarify why he is making this provision and the circumstances behind his decision.  He is probably taking a prudent approach, and the liability might arise this year.  I do not mind if he takes the time to prepare a detailed note on the matter.  Has he estimated how many public servants in retirement have pension funds valued at in excess of &euro;2 million?  There must be some because this provision would otherwise not be necessary.  I suspect he has information on the matter given that it is a new provision.  I will take whatever cursory evidence he has available now but I also ask for a comprehensive note.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.710" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22015021100002#P00400"><p>I will provide the committee with a comprehensive note on the matter.  It sounds complicated but it is exactly as the Deputy has indicated.  It is Government policy that significant pension pots shall be liable for tax.  The threshold was very large under the former regime.  People could accumulate an extraordinarily large pension pot on a tax-free basis, that is, subsidised by the taxpayer.  We have reduced that substantially for the private sector and an analogous reduction has to be made for the public sector.</p> <p>  Under the Act, once the liability crystallises, it falls to the fund to pay.  If, for example, Deputy Sean Fleming is entitled to a pension of that scale - please God, in due course - he could decide whether, in accordance with the Act, the fund should pay the tax and the tax would be rebated out of his pension entitlements over a period of 20 years.</p> <p>  In regard to the estimate of &euro;1 million, it is not a token figure.  I am advised that five individuals are anticipated to come within this category, and there is also contingency for three higher paid civil servants with chargeable excesses in or around &euro;150,000.  In each case, the individuals concerned would be opting to repay the relevant amount over the full 20-year period.  If they take the option of taking a reduced pension payment over the qualifying 20-year period rather than paying the tax out of their lump sums, that is the sum of money for which the trustees - my Department in this case - are liable.</p></speech>

I have no problem if the State Laboratory or the Minister, through his office, want to send a note to the committee.  However, the detail might be fleshed out a little bit further.

I cannot be blamed for not wanting to pass the bottom paragraph on page 50 of the briefing document which deals with parts of its output targets for 2015.  This was referred to this morning.  It refers to the completion of the required asset valuations and global valuations.  Global valuations concern the major State companies such as EirGrid, Bord G&aacute;is and the ESB.  They also concern the mobile phone companies which have antennae throughout the country.  There is a global valuation divided by population per local authority.  The Minister might ask the Valuation Office to send us a note on its proposals and methodology for the global valuation which it will be doing this year on Irish Water.  I am sure it is not done yet.  We will not discuss it now.  We will wait for the note.</p></speech>

Twenty tribunal appeals were processed by the Valuation Office last year, six of which were appeals relating to the valuation programme.  The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which is currently before the House, seeks to reform the appeals process and eliminate the first appeal from the commission.</p></speech>

The outturn last year was &euro;20 million.  For shared services, the note states the net Estimate last year was approximately &euro;30 million and the net Estimate this year is &euro;39 million.  However, the outturn last year was &euro;20 million.  The outturn did not get anywhere near the Estimate last year.</p><p>Having spent &euro;20 million last year, the Department is now seeking to double the amount this year.  Why does the Minister believe there will be double the activity?  The briefing note compares the 2014 and 2015 Estimates, but earlier in the document we were told that the 2014 outturn was only &euro;20 million.  Let us not compare this and last year's Estimates, as last year's was nowhere near achieved.  Why must we double the money?  We could go into the issue in detail, but will the Minister outline a general picture?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.760" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22015021100002#R00200"><p>The budget reflects the pace of migration to shared services.  Sometimes it does not progress quickly and we must slow the pace.  We are consolidating a range of services while continuing to provide them across the public service.  The incremental budget in 2015 reflects the migration of payroll services to the centre.  Some &euro;5 million of the increase is mirrored in the budget reductions in the originating Vote.  As it migrates into a shared service, there is a saving in the parent Vote, with further budget transfers to be achieved and the migration of all payroll, for example.</p> <p>  Client Departments paid &euro;2.5 million for the PeoplePoint service in 2014.  It is intended that this charge will increase to the point where the cost of the service is fully recouped from each Department.  Departments will be required to absorb this cost within their existing resources.  This is something that they have achieved to date.  The 2014 underspend that the Deputy pointed out was driven by a later than anticipated decision on the financial management shared service project, which in turn impacted on expenditure on licensing costs, combined with a later phasing of waves to the other shared services.</p> <p>  The provision in this Vote necessarily includes a one-off set of costs that will taper off once the various services become operational.  The committee will see evidence of this in programme B3 on PeoplePoint and programme C3 on payroll shared services centres, PSSCs, where projects are processing at the set-up stage.  Regarding external services and consultancies, the Estimate includes a provision of &euro;7.5 million this year spread across current and capital budgets.  This reflects the procurement of essential IT and project expertise across the three projects, namely, human resources, payroll and financial management transactional services.  The number of staff also increased from 596 to 649, reflecting the redeployment of payroll staff from originating Departments.</p> <p>  To be blunt, we did not progress in 2014 as quickly as we would have liked, so we did not use the Estimate.  Obviously, we will not use the money until we are ready to make the transactional change.  We are confident that we will expend it all and have the consolidated shared services in place during the course of 2015.  The completion of the second shared service round will happen at the end of next year, not this year.  We must make a decision on the financial management shared service.</p></speech>

There is a substantial increase in the Estimate.  Given the new bodies, that is understandable.  However, it came to light during the year that the office made a case concerning the troubling situation in nursing homes in County Mayo.  That morning, the Ombudsman stated on radio that he had the authority to investigate individual complaints relating to the situation but also indicated that he had the legal authority to investigate complaints relating to private nursing homes.  I imagine that, if he were to be busy in that regard, the amount of money we are providing his office would not cover it.  Does this Estimate cover much in the health area?  According to the Ombudsman's office, it receives few complaints in this regard.  I am not referring to processing medical cards or other administrative difficulties, but to complaints about health services, in which regard the Ombudsman probably feels that people are reluctant to take on hospitals, consultants, doctors or nursing homes.  Has the Minister an opinion on how many complaints are being made on that front?  Is there anything that we can do to assist the Ombudsman or to remove the public's fear about making complaints?</p></speech>

There is a significant increase in the money because of the new legislative responsibilities that the Oireachtas is giving to the Office of the Ombudsman.  In specific terms, this covers the full-year cost of additional posts sanctioned for the implementation of the register of lobbying legislation, which we anticipate will be enacted shortly; three sanctioned posts at principal officer level - a legal adviser, a head of IT and a registrar of lobbyists - that must be filled this year; two sanctioned assistant principal posts for the Office of the Information Commissioner, OIC; and three executive officer posts arising out of the additional bodies that came under the Ombudsman's remit, as referenced by Deputy Fleming.  Money will also be provided for some consultancy work that the Ombudsman wants to carry out in respect of the development of a register of lobbyists during the course of this year.</p> <p>  I do not know whether the Deputy is interested in the salaries or staffing cohort of the Office of the Ombudsman, but I can quickly give him the details now or provide them in written form.</p></speech>

Members will recognise the ambassador, as he is a regular observer at these committee meetings.  Today, he is in formal session for the first time with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p> <p>  Today's meeting will concentrate on the programme of Latvia's Presidency of the European Council, which occurs for the first six months of 2015.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear an opening statement from the ambassador and then take questions from the members of the joint committee.  I hope to be able to take a number of questions together.  Perhaps the ambassador might bank the questions, and he or his deputy might answer them as he sees fit.</p> <p>  Before we start, there is the usual citation in respect of mobile phones.  I ask members to switch them off to ensure that they do not interrupt the proceedings, which they do even when on silent.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Ambassador, I call on you to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.779" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Dr. Gints Apals" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015021100002#B00200"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I assure the committee that the Latvian Presidency intends to work in full conformity with the provisions of the Lisbon treaty, respecting the competences and prerogatives of all the parties involved in the EU decision-making process, which is collective by default.  The priorities of the Latvian Presidency have been developed in close co-operation with the other members of the trio, namely, Italy and Luxembourg, as well as all the European institutions and member states, duly respecting their interests and positions.</p> <p>  The general priorities of the Latvian Presidency have been presented in Dublin on several occasions.  Committee members will recall that the Latvian Presidency has two broad objectives.  First, to steer the work of all relevant council formations to fully overcome the economic and financial crisis.  Second, to promote stability, security and development in the neighbourhood and the world in close co-operation with the European Commission, the European External Action Service and all the member states.  To reach these two objectives we intend to promote three main themes, namely, competitive Europe, digital Europe and engaged Europe.  Naturally, while speaking before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade I will focus on the external dimension and the major issues pertinent to the common foreign and security policy, the common security and defence policy, external trade, economic relations and the enlargement process.</p> <p>  The Presidency will extend all possible support to the President of the European Council and the High Representative in her role as the President of the Foreign Affairs Council, to help her to conduct the common foreign and security policy and co-ordinate all external action of the Union.  This will be done through chairing appropriate meetings upon invitation from the High Representative, organising numerous events in Latvia and lending our knowledge and expertise in specific fields of external relations.</p> <p>  During the coming five months the Latvian Presidency will put particular emphasis on EU relations with the Eastern Partnership countries and central Asian countries.  As committee members are aware, the European neighbourhood policy will remain the key EU instrument when it comes to framing relationships with neighbouring countries.  Ongoing conflicts and instability in the broader neighbourhood are a cause of great concern for all member states and institutions.  More than ever, the neighbourhood countries need EU attention and support.  Hence, Latvia is keen to enhance the effectiveness of the EU policy in addressing political and security challenges in the eastern and southern neighbourhoods.  To achieve this, we will support a comprehensive review of the European neighbourhood policy aimed at better effectiveness through increased differentiation.</p> <p>  Latvia intends to contribute to the strengthening of the Eastern Partnership as an inclusive platform and the promotion of a more individual approach to each partner country, respecting their ambitions and objectives.  We are keen to strengthen political association, economic integration, enhanced trade, improved mobility, people-to-people contacts, education co-operation, and engagement with civil societies, as appropriate.  In co-operation with the President of the European Council and relevant EU institutions, Latvia will host the 4th Eastern Partnership summit in Riga on 21&ndash;22 May 2015.  We maintain the summit will provide an excellent opportunity to review the progress that has been achieved since the Vilnius Eastern Partnership summit as well as set the way ahead.</p> <p>  Latvia will support the European External Action Service in further developing the relationship with the southern neighbourhood region, contributing to stability and security of the region based on the principles of democracy, human rights, freedom of speech and the rule of law.  Latvia will also support the efforts of the High Representative to strengthen EU engagement with central Asian countries, as we see a need to intensify our relations with that part of the world.  To this end, Latvia is keen to promote EU-central Asia dialogue and co-operation in areas of importance for both sides, including energy security, transport, sustainable development, the rule of law and education.  In this regard, the review of the EU-central Asia strategy in March 2015 will be of the utmost importance.  The scaling-down of the international security presence in Afghanistan in 2015 as well as instability in Iraq and Syria require greater EU attention towards central Asia to meet such common challenges as terrorism, border security and drug trafficking.  The implementation of regional co-operation programmes, namely, the border management programme in central Asia and the central Asia drug action plan, will be crucial in this regard.</p> <p>  While noting the strategic importance of enlargement policy in promoting political stability and economic prosperity in Europe, the Presidency remains committed to moving forward with the ongoing accession negotiations with Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey with a view to achieving further sustained progress.  The Presidency will pursue an enlargement policy based on the principles of conditionality and each country's merits.  These principles will also guide the Presidency's work in advancing the European perspective for other western Balkan countries according to respective stages of their integration, while keeping EU membership as the ultimate goal of the process.</p> <p>  My country fully supports the efforts aimed at increasing the effectiveness and visibility of the common security and defence policy.  Latvia will contribute to the preparations for the European Council of June 2015 and will underline the importance of continued progress on the security and defence agenda.  In this regard, Latvia deems it important to advance the work towards better and more efficient civilian and military capabilities, including EU battle-groups and better civil-military co-operation to address maritime security risks and threats.  We will also support enhanced civil-military co-operation when it comes to improving cyber defence awareness and protection.  Of course, appropriate attention will be paid to the challenges faced by the European defence industry as well.</p> <p>  Latvia will highlight the crucial nature of co-operation with international organisations and individual partners as part of the CSDP, in particular, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United Nations and the United States.  Close co-operation with NATO in capability development, rapid response, training and exercise requires our attention.  Naturally, Latvia will promote co-operation between the EU and the US in the light of emerging security challenges in many parts of the world.  The Presidency is keen to pay particular attention to problems related to external aspects of counter-terrorism such as foreign fighters, financing of terrorism, radicalisation and recruitment.  We are keen to address these issues in the first instance through better implementation of the already-agreed EU instruments and policy measures in all member states.</p> <p>  Open and fair external trade is vital for all of Europe.  Greater market openness as well as more active trade and investment flows are essential for promoting growth and economic recovery throughout the union.  The Presidency will contribute, therefore, to achieving further progress on the World Trade Organization multilateral negotiations and the Doha development agenda.  The Presidency attaches great importance to the ongoing WTO accession negotiations, including, but not limited to, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan and Serbia.</p><p>It will support the preparations for the upcoming WTO Ministerial Conference of 2015.<br/><br/>The Presidency will support also the ongoing work on bilateral trade agreements.  I assure the committee that Latvia considers the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement and Free Trade Agreement negotiations with Japan and Vietnam as top priorities for the coming five months.  The implementation of Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements with Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine will be high on our agenda.  In addition, Latvia will promote the approval of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, with Canada and the bilateral trade agreement with Singapore. <br/><br/>The year will be of crucial importance for progress on a universal post-2015 agenda for sustainable development<b></b>and the eradication of poverty.  The Presidency will work energetically to advance consultations on comprehensive EU contribution to international negotiations leading to the UN Summit in September 2015, facilitating the adoption of a new framework, including a set of globally-applicable sustainable development goals, SDGs, which will succeed the millennium development goals, MDGs.  In that context the Presidency sees gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment, good governance, the rule of law, human rights, and inclusive, sustainable growth to be of particular importance, including in regard to the European Year for Development 2015. <br/><br/>The Presidency will also contribute to preparations that lead to agreed EU position for the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in July 2015.  The partnership agreement between the group of African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries and the EU is due to expire in 2020.  Therefore, the Presidency will work with the European External Action Service, EEAS, and the European Commission to advance EU reflection on future relations with the ACP countries.  Together with the EEAS and the Commission, the Presidency will closely monitor the ongoing and emerging humanitarian crises, as well as disease outbreaks, of which addressing the Ebola epidemic will be of paramount importance.  The Presidency will help to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of EU humanitarian aid<b></b>and to advance EU humanitarian advocacy <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>third countries and international organisations.  The Presidency will support the necessary follow-up for preparations for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit.<br/><br/>I have outlined probably the most important policy areas, which we regard as a priority and the committee will understand that the work programme of the Presidency and the EU as a whole is extremely broad.  I will gladly answer any questions members may have on any of the subjects I mentioned and I will also gladly go beyond the area of external relations should that be necessary.  I thank the members for their kind attention and we can now move on to the members' questions and comments.</p></speech>

I compliment him on Latvia's accession of the Presidency and particularly the way Latvia has set about its work programme and we wish his country well.  The first speaker is Deputy Smith and other speakers include Deputies Mitchell, Eric Byrne, Neville and Crowe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.782" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015021100002#C00300"><p>As the Chairman did, I welcome the ambassador and his colleague to the committee.  I compliment him on his presentation and wish his country well in its Presidency.  I welcome that Latvia has decided to prioritise economic growth and job creation as key goals.  He outlined the overarching priorities of a competitive Europe, a digital Europe and an engaged Europe.  There are challenges arising from the technological expansion across the EU.  It is important for all member states of the EU and its citizens that we boost smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  I welcome that Latvia hopes to advance the formulation of a proper framework for data protection, which is important in this era in which we are living.  Reducing telecommunications costs is an issue particularly for people who travel a good deal and for somebody like myself who lives in a Border constituency.  Unfortunately, we have a land Border in our own country and we have to put up with those costs.</p> <p>  With regard to the European External Action Service and the Lisbon treaty of 2009, both of those in their own way have made Europe a more visible actor in international affairs and in trade and diplomacy also.  The ambassador outlined that Latvia wants to facilitate a continued and an increased presence of the EU and better engagement and relations with its immediate neighbours.  </p> <p>  With regard to the Eastern Partnership, does the ambassador believe that a more prudent approach is needed by the European Union in its dealings with neighbouring countries?  He stated in his presentation that Latvia intends to contribute to the strengthening of the Eastern Partnership as an inclusive platform and to promoting a more individual approach to each partner country, respecting their own ambitions.  That is a mutual requirement for both the EU and its neighbouring countries.</p> <p>  Last summer Latvia increased its defence budget on its eastern border with Russia and it requested additional security help from NATO.  I note in a comment Latvia's ambassador to the United States made last Thursday that he stated that citizens of Latvia remain nervous and concerned about the rising tensions between Russia and the West.  He also stated that the situation is getting worse.  Has Latvia felt supported sufficiently by the European Union and the European External Action Service when dealing with Russian aggression on its borders?  As we review the work of the Presidency of the EU, the heightened tension and conflict in the Ukraine today and the major loss of life is a very worrying development.  We sincerely hope that a ceasefire will be achieved and that progress will be made in bringing about real and meaningful dialogue to bring that dispute to a proper conclusion.  I thank the ambassador and wish his country well in its Presidency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.783" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015021100002#C00400"><p>The ambassador and his colleague are very welcome.  The ambassador is doing a great job on behalf of his country.  I have met him at many events.  He has been very active and I congratulate him on that.  I hope the Ministry for foreign affairs in Latvia recognise his hard work.</p> <p>  To follow on from what Deputy Smith said, Latvia plays a very important role in a very sensitive political period.  Ukraine and the Eastern Partnership were mentioned.  A summit will be held in Riga on the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy.  Can I be a little provocative and ask the ambassador a number of questions?  We are collectively aware of the difficulties of those emerging democracies from under the yoke of communism but we are also very conscious of mistakes Europe might have made in the past in its relationship with the Eastern Partnership and in the relationship with Ukraine.  I have just come back from there and this committee has addressed the issue off the largest successful political party in the recent Moldovan elections being a pro-Putin, a pro-Soviet party.  In that region there are great sensibilities which require the utmost diplomatic skills.  Those are the skills of Europe's relationship with the Russia Federation.</p> <p>  Latvia has a substantial Russian speaking population.  By way of background and to counterpose what I am going to ask the ambassador, I am sure he will be aware that this country in the past four years has granted citizenship to 70,000 new Irish citizens from 126 countries in the world.  He may know that we advocate new communities and immigrants to participate in local elections.  If they have been living here for six months or longer, they are eligible to vote.</p><p>I might counterpose our position with Latvia's position regarding its Russian-speaking community, which is quite substantial, maybe in the region of 26% of the population, who do not have these basic democratic rights.  How does the ambassador view the role of Europe under the presidency of Latvia <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the relationship of Putin and the Russian Federation to Europe, given what they allege has happened in eastern Ukraine, namely, discrimination against Russian speakers, and the possibility that the same argument would be used against the Latvian authorities?<br/><br/>What are the key areas of the Eastern Partnership summit in Riga and the European neighbourhood policy?  What will be different after those debates in Riga?  Where will they lead?<br/><br/>On a domestic, but also international, front, I am conscious of being lobbied when in Latvia by politicians who argue that we are facilitating sham marriages of Latvian women, predominantly to non-Europeans.  We have the statistics here.  They are mainly Pakistani, Nigerian, Brazilian and Bangladeshi men.  Is the ambassador happy that we are taking the necessary steps to prevent these sham marriages?  It is alleged that these women are being trafficked from Latvia to Ireland.  What are the Latvian authorities doing at their end to prevent the trafficking of women into Ireland to enable non-Irish citizens to avail of residency?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.785" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015021100002#D00200"><p>I, too, welcome the ambassador, thank him for his presentation and wish Latvia well in its presidency, which is coming at a crucial time for Europe in general, on the economic and social front and on a security level.  There are major trade agreements coming up, economic issues that affect all of us, very particular economic issues that affect Greece and the problems in Ukraine.  Everybody has mentioned the problems in Ukraine.  I would also like to refer to that and how it impacts on Latvia.  When the problems started in Ukraine, there was a general increase in Russian military and intelligence activity in Latvia, and Lithuania and Estonia as well, and this was noticed very much.  There is a large ethnic Russian population in Latvia.  About a quarter of the population is of Russian origin.  The Russians justified their activities in Ukraine on the basis of the abuse of the rights of the Russian-speaking population.  Is Latvia open to similar accusations?  Does Latvia, which is in the EU, unlike Ukraine, feel safe from any desire of Russia to exploit what it sees as abuses of the rights of their ethnic population in other countries, whether within the EU or in Ukraine?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.786" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015021100002#D00300"><p>I welcome the ambassador and wish Latvia well in its EU presidency.  The ambassador said in his speech earlier that the Latvian Presidency will be focused on jobs and growth.  Ireland's EU Presidency was also focused on jobs and growth, but unfortunately unemployment, specifically youth unemployment, is a significant problem not only in Ireland but right across Europe.  A &euro;300 billion investment package has been announced by the European Commission, but many see that as one leg of the stool.  Does Latvia see the area of youth employment as a priority for the Presidency?</p> <p>  The question of Greece was touched on earlier.  There are a few debates in Europe on how we move forward.  Some are pro-austerity and others are pro-stimulus.  The Greek Government has called for a debt conference.  Would Latvia see that as part of its EU Presidency or would it have a view on that idea of a debt conference and bringing together people, not only the public representatives, but civic society groups and so on that are impacted by debt and poverty and deprivation?  Greece is looking for a write-down again.  It is outside the EU Presidency, but I am interested in Latvia and where it positions itself in that debate within Europe.</p> <p>  The ambassador said TTIP is one of the priorities.  There are huge concerns about this, which we have discussed at this committee and at the European Affairs committee.  There are aspects of TTIP with which people are very uncomfortable.  Ireland has concerns about the impact on our agricultural and food sectors, whether it is about regulation and deregulation and so on.  The big area people are concerned about is investor-state dispute settlement.  There is significant concern about it right across Europe.  The Commission stated recently that it had received 150,000 replies to its consultation and 145,000 related to opposition to this matter.  The ambassador says he wants to push ahead with the negotiations, but the concern from civil society and across Europe relates to the secrecy surrounding the negotiations themselves.  Are there similar concerns in Latvia on aspects of that agreement - the change in work portfolios, people moving from jobs, trade within countries, within Europe and so on?  Are those concerns shared?  Some are calling for the suspension rather than the prioritisation of the talks.</p> <p>  The ambassador says Latvia strongly supports the European common security and defence policy and he would like to see enhanced co-operation with NATO and the increased use of training and battle groups.  I do not share his enthusiasm.  I accept that Latvia has historical reasons for this, and it is a member of NATO, but many of us see NATO as a relic from a previous time.  Would the ambassador see the interaction there as complementary rather than competitive?  Ireland is not a member of NATO.  How do countries like Ireland figure in this closer alignment?  Does the ambassador not believe issues like the common security and defence policy, CSDP, are driving some of the scepticism in Europe?  Some would say it is an attack on sovereignty.  Is CSDP entirely framed in the interests of larger EU countries?  I am more concerned about the debate on where we fit into this moving together with NATO, as a neutral country.  There are concerns.  Latvia is very concerned about the issues in Ukraine, as are others, and the Eastern Partnership.  Is there a role for those countries that have decided to stay outside the partnership?  The ambassador mentioned people having an independent role and so on.  How does he see outreach to those countries, like Armenia and Azerbaijan, that have decided to stay outside the partnership developing?</p><p>Is the Presidency thinking in terms of conferences or how is it going to pull that together?  Does it favour an increase in military involvement in the Ukraine?  Some people say there is still potential even at this late stage with the initiative from France and Germany.  </p><p> On the European Year for Development 2015 can the ambassador detail any specific plans in this regard?  How will the Latvian Presidency advance many of those issues?  The ambassador mentioned the implementation of regional co-operation programmes in central Asia and the whole area of drug trafficking.  After we returned from Iran some were keen that it should have a relationship with the European Union.  Previously the European Union had a relationship with Iran and countries in that region to try to stop the flow of drugs from Afghanistan.  Figures were given for the growth of the poppy and it will all end up on our shore.  Does the ambassador see the Iranians or other countries in that region as having a role and what can Latvia, during its presidency, do in this area?  The Iranians complain that they are not getting support.  One of the reasons given for this was the death penalty.  We co-operate with other countries around the world, despite the death penalty, as it is flowing straight to Europe.</p><p> On the issue of minority languages, I understand there are many minority languages and community groups throughout Europe which the European Union supports.  Given the tension with the Latvian and Russian minorities, do the representatives see that as a contradiction in terms of the direction in which the European Union is going?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.788" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1056" speakername="Dan Neville" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015021100002#E00300"><p>I welcome the representatives and thank them for appearing before the committee and wish them every success.  We know how time consuming and difficult the presidency is for all sections of government.  Russia has been mentioned.  Can the ambassador see any approaches that would improve relationships with Russia, outside of the issues in relation to concerns in Ukraine, as the dialogue between Russia, which is Latvia's nearest neighbour, and the European Union has almost dried up?  Surely, that is not conducive to developing relationships, understanding and influencing events which are important to both Russia and to the European Union.  One of the key issues in the European Union at the moment is the situation regarding Greece and potentially leaving the Union but hopefully not.  As for the Presidency, can Latvia see itself taking initiatives rather than the various ministerial meetings to try to overcome the difficulties that have arisen and find solutions as it is a highly complex issue?  While some commentators say the EU is in a better position now to lose Greece than it was previously, we have to be careful about believing much of that because it certainly would reduce international confidence in the euro if Greece left the European Union, apart from other issues surrounding it.  Has Latvia looked at any initiatives that the Presidency could take?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015021100002#E00500"><p>I join in the welcome to the ambassador and wish Latvia well with the Presidency of the European Union.  I apologise for my late arrival but I have read his presentation which is interesting.  I was particularly struck by his comments with regard to strengthening the Eastern Partnership.  He also included the engagement with central Asian countries, some of us hope to be there later this month.  There is much tension in that area.  The relationship that Latvia builds with those countries will, to a large extent, assist the direction that the EU and those countries will go in the future.  I welcome the Latvian Presidency committing to doing  that.</p> <p>  Ukraine has been mentioned.  I welcome the dialogue which is taking place.  I would raise a question in that regard, it is very much a German-Franco driven initiative.  It struck me that perhaps there should have been some EU-wide involvement and Latvia, given that it holds the presidency, might be involved.  Perhaps the representatives will comment.  I am friendly with some of the Latvian parliamentarians and I know that they would be hostile to Russia because of their experience; in the same way as we were oppressed by the British for many centuries, Latvia has also suffered oppression under the Russians in its history.  Some of them have chastised me for some of my encouragement with the Russian authorities.  As Deputy Neville said, that is the way forward.  Russia and Europe have many inter-connected objectives and interests that need to be founded on a better relationship than we had.  Perhaps the representatives would comment on the Europe-wide aspect of that.  </p> <p>  The ultimate question would be with regard to Greece.  There is much talk about the economic crisis in Greece which obviously is hurting the people badly.  We have experienced it here as have other European countries to a greater or lesser degree.  It has to be said that the European project has been damaged by this crisis.  There has been a dearth of quality political leadership across Europe all during this crisis.  The manner in which they tried to deal with it has not taken into account the effects on citizens and, perhaps, dealing with it in a way which has ameliorated some of the difficulties which people have encountered in their daily lives as a consequence of this.  All governments carry some responsibility.  Given the geographic location of Greece, and given what is happening in the Middle East - it is nearly an entry point for any escalation of the crisis there - but also given the political make-up in Greece, real leadership will be required to deal with that issue.  Nobody is talking any more about a two tier euro which would reflect the disparity between the economies.  That was largely debated at the outset of the crisis but seems to have gone off the radar altogether.  How Greece is handled is not just a Greek issue, there will be knock-on effects in Spain, probably in the not too distant future, and perhaps in Italy as well.  It needs to be handled in a way that takes into account the medium and longer-term vision if there is a vision for Europe any more.  I say that as somebody who is fully committed to the European project but who will think long and hard the next time we are voting for a treaty as to whether I will vote "Yes" or "No".</p><p>That would never have been my position in the past, but the manner in which this crisis has been dealt with by the European Union is nothing short of scandalous, although others may disagree with that point of view.</p><p> I refer to the ambassador's comments on counter-terrorism and the high profile incidents in Paris and other issues come to mind.  Approximately 30 people have left Ireland to travel to the Middle East as combatants.  They have joined the terrorist group that is in charge of parts of Iraq and Syria and are being trained to engage in terrorist activities.  I  listened to a radio programme yesterday on which it was reported that foreign combatants were being placed at the forefront in killing people, including by beheading.  It is obvious that this is being done to break any taboo they might have in order that when they move to other countries, they may well pose a significant threat to the civilian populations.  In the opinion of the ambassador, how should citizens who return to European countries and who have participated in violence be dealt with?  How should we deal with the issue of immigration?  It is not inconceivable that many who are not citizens of European countries may find themselves drifting into Europe in the next two decades.  They may well come with a particular intent which will not be benevolent towards the freedom we enjoy in this part of the world.  How will the programme anticipate and deal with this issue?</p></speech>

I refer to questions concerning the future shape of Europe; the future relationship between Europe and neighbouring countries; the situation in Ukraine; and the possible impact of a smaller or larger European Union.  Other questions concern security and defence matters and the efficacy of the European Union, the United Nations and NATO; the influence of Europe on its neighbours in terms of human rights issues; and Russia, a subject with which the ambassador will be very familiar.</p></speech>

I assure members that I will try to do my best to answer the questions one by one in order that every member will receive a proper response from our representation.  Not all of the questions are pertinent to the role of Latvia as Presidency of the European Council.  Nevertheless, I regard this as a unique opportunity to speak to a large number of elected representatives of the Irish people; therefore, I will gladly dwell on each and every question raised.</p> <p>  I will begin with the question from Deputy Brendan Smith concerning the role of the European Union, the External Action Service and support for those countries that might be nervous, as the Deputy described it, about the situation to the east of their borders.  One must always keep in mind the wider context.  There are several international organisations active on a global or regional basis; this is not only about the European Union and the External Action Service.  I also deliberately referred to NATO as the defence alliance in that it deals directly with military threats to its members.  The European Union is not a military alliance and this distinction should be kept in mind.  Therefore, the instruments of the European Union are mostly political and economic.  </p> <p>  From my perspective, the European Union and the External Action Service are doing their best, employing the means in their possession - diplomatic means, statements, public messages and economic sanctions against individuals or states.  This is the role of the European Union and the External Action service.  </p> <p>  I referred to NATO and the NATO alliance.  The individual member states and their governments are responsible for the defence of the territories.  There are many other international forums which are also very useful in addressing these security concerns.  I refer, for example, to the OSCE and, in partial form, the Council of Europe.  I could list many more, if necessary.  In brief, the role of the European Union has been appropriate, while the External Action Service has also been active, given its mandate.  The latest initiative is an initiative of France and Germany, coming on top of the activities of or those agreed and pursued by the European Union.  I can only hope for complementary work between the European Union, the External Action Service and individual member states, including my own.  </p> <p>  Deputy Eric Byrne asked many questions.  I do not necessarily agree with all of his qualifications when speaking about the situation in my country or Ukraine.  He asked about the European neighbourhood policy and the positions of Ukraine and Moldova.  We recognise that there might be differences between national positions.  The European neighbourhood policy concerns six very different countries.  Three countries have signed association agreements that are being ratified by EU member states, while three other countries are still interested in participation in the European neighbourhood policy, but they have their own approach.  For example, Armenia has chosen to join the Eurasian economic union and customs union, but it is still eager to have political dialogue and a political association with the European Union.  In the future member states might look for flexible arrangements to accommodate every single member of that group according to their ambitions and objectives.  At least from the perspective of my government, the Eastern Partnership is a useful platform for dialogue with these countries.  It is also a useful platform for dialogue between the countries of the partnership.  It is a multilateral platform that facilitates exchange and co-operation between the six countries mentioned.  Therefore, in holding the Presidency and as a member state, Latvia is very much interested in keeping this platform active for the future because it opens a range of avenues in relations between Europe and these countries and between themselves.  The ultimate purpose is to promote our values in the wider region, not only economic interests but also the values of the European Union, including human rights and the rule of law, for example.  This also applies to Ukraine and Moldova, even in spite of the fact that not all political parties in these countries fully embrace European values.  One should always keep in mind that this is an open and ongoing process.  The spread of European values and the extension of our principles form part of an open-ended process.  The Deputy referred to the success of specific parties in the Moldovan elections, but one should always continue dialogue and convince people that the European approach has its merits.</p> <p>  I refer to the Deputy's second question on the Russian-speaking population.  I do not really recognise the link between ethnic origin or the native tongue and citizenship.</p><p>We have citizens of many backgrounds and citizenship is not awarded to anybody on the basis of their ethnic origins or linguistic identity.  Therefore, there are many Russian-speaking citizens of Latvia, some of whom are ethnic Russians while others are not.  The Russian language is widely spoken and Russian is probably my second language and my first foreign language.  Therefore, the committee might also consider me to be a Russian speaker or a member of the group.  </p><p> Latvian policy in matters of citizenship is very simple.  Latvia will grant citizenship to any permanent resident on the basis of individual application.  What we cannot accept for legal and political considerations is that the State could or should impose citizenship on a group of persons without individual applications.  This would be wrong.  Citizenship cannot be imposed on anyone.  This applies not only to Latvia but also to many other countries in the world.  Therefore, when it comes to citizenship, let me assure the committee that this is a purely legal question in my country which has been resolved using all democratic mechanisms and there is no discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or language origins.  </p><p> In respect of local elections, if I understand correctly, Deputy Byrne suggested that any permanent resident should be entitled to participate in local elections regardless of his or her citizenship, place or origin, etc.  The international practice contains several approaches.  My country still belongs to a large group of countries that see full participation in political processes, including the right to vote and be elected at all levels, as the prerogative of the citizen.  Anybody who would like to take part in those elections is cordially invited to apply for a Latvian passport.  This will be a speedy process that will facilitate social integration between different groups.  </p><p> In respect of discrimination against Russian speakers in Ukraine, I can only say that I do not necessarily agree because I am not in possession of any facts concerning discrimination against the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine in the past or currently.  I do not even recall many signals about discrimination against the Russian-speaking population before the outbreak of the recent crisis in eastern Ukraine.  For more than 20 years, Ukraine was a stable country and the international media did not report much about any sort of discrimination.  I can only voice my surprise that very recently and suddenly, many mass media outlets were reporting and talking about the notion of discrimination against ethnic Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine.  This was not the case in the past.  This would lead me to say that the EU collectively and EU member states should do something to promote our own values and views through the mass media in the eastern neighbourhood and the Russian Federation because sometimes we might have different views on certain subjects but we then need to have a dialogue which would be a two-way street - not only us accepting certain notions but also us having the liberty to make our voice heard.  This would certainly promote peace and stability throughout the region.  </p><p> In respect of the agenda of the Eastern Partnership summit in Riga, I should say that the international situation remains very dynamic.  Certainly the agenda of the summit will be defined in a collective manner which means that all the EU institutions concerned will have the right along with the host nation to define the agenda and the programme of the summit.  We would like to see this as a venue for free and broad debate among all participants - European and those coming from partner countries.  That will allow us not only to take stock of the implementation of association agreements and not only to talk of mobility but also to reflect on the way ahead.  Given the dynamic and changing nature of the situation in the region, some questions are still open.  I am quite sure that by April, we will have much more clarity.  We should also remember that the summit will happen on 21 and 22 May.  That is to say, there is still some time.  While we can collectively define the agenda items, proposals are more than welcome.  </p><p> The last question concerned bilateral relations and the problem of sham marriages.  This is a complex issue because in the past, several hundred Latvian women came to Ireland and married third country nationals from several countries.  This was a difficult situation.  The trend has changed and the number of Latvian women coming to Ireland to marry third country nationals has decreased significantly.  We also appreciate all the steps taken by Irish authorities to prevent sham marriages and the human trafficking element of that problem.  This work should continue and is continuing.  There are several international co-operation projects involving institutions and NGOs from Latvia, Ireland and other countries.  Probably the best way to prevent sham marriages involves raising awareness of the risks of such marriages.  At the same time, I must voice my respect for the position of the Irish Government because it is fully entitled to adopt whatever immigration procedures and policies it wishes.  This is a matter for the Irish nation, Parliament and Government.  We cannot interfere with the Government's decisions regarding whether or not the Irish authorities would recognise certain types of marriage.</p></speech>

I only addressed one question.  The criminal code of Latvia has provisions for the prosecution of people who would organise such marriages for profit.  These people would be prosecuted in criminal courts in Latvia.  This is not the case in Ireland.  We have discussed these issues on many occasions.  Of course, the Irish approach is based more on certain decisions taken by the European Court of Human Rights that see the right to engage in marriage as a basic human right that cannot be restricted in any way.  Certainly both sides will continue-----</p></speech>

It is just to clarify that there was a loophole in Irish law that gave better rights to citizenship to third country citizens, such as people coming from Bangladesh or India, when they married an EU national than somebody from within the EU who married an EU national.  I think that loophole has been closed so the incentive to traffic is not as great as it previously was.</p></speech>

The statistics I am reading are in the briefing on that Bill.  It has not concluded but it has been introduced.  Our end would also say that Latvia has a responsibility because the trafficking of women is organised there rather than in Ireland.  We have attempted to stop some of these sham marriages and we fell foul of the law.</p></speech>

There were several recommendations from the General Assembly from the United Nations on amendments to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill.  I have not mentioned all the titles of the Bills.  More laws will be passed by the Oireachtas and we look forward to their enactment very soon.</p><p> I thank the Irish authorities, Garda National Immigration Bureau and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service for their close co-operation.  I should mention that the problem does not apply only to Latvian women, but in the years 2009 and 2010, the women mostly came from Latvia.  The situation has changed and as H.E. Dr. Gints Apals stated it is not only the Latvians who come to Ireland.  We can deal with the issue only on a national level as we did by amending the Latvian criminal law in 2013.  The law came into force in 2013 to tackle sham marriages by making it a crime to facilitate the application for residency rights.  In January we also started the HESTIA project in co-operation with the European Commission and the six countries involved are Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Slovakia and Ireland.  We greatly appreciate the Irish Immigrant Council, which joined this project, as well as the support of the Department of Justice and Equality.  </p><p> This is a complex issue and will take a great deal to stop.  It is not only about immigration risks, it is not only about addressing the evolving form of human trafficking but also about the security risks.</p></speech>

First, I will respond to the questions from Deputy Olivia Mitchell.  If a government wants to pursue an aggressive policy, the pretext is always at hand.  I cannot really support the example she gave on the point of international law.  I would find it difficult to conceive that the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland or the United Kingdom would claim the right to defend the interests of English speaking people around the world only on the basis of their linguistic identify.  Normally in international law, states have the right to protect the interests of their citizens, but the idea that any country could claim the right to protect the interests of the citizens of another country is a very difficult question and I cannot see how such an argument could be used against my country or neighbouring countries while remaining within the bounds of international law.</p></speech>

We appreciate the fact the Greek Government would like to negotiate a solution to the existing economic crisis and debt problem.  This is certainly a positive message.  We also recognise the fact the Greek Government has a democratic mandate.  As far as the European Council is concerned, I must emphasise that the Council can and will even tomorrow discuss the situation in Greece but decisions concerning the problems arising from assistance and possible modification of those provisions are for the eurozone finance ministers.  This probably will be the correct way to negotiate any alteration of existing provisions.</p> <p>  With regard to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, I recognise what Deputy Crowe said that the issue is complex but the Council has given a clear mandate to the Commission to pursue negotiations.  Democratic scrutiny is important.  I have had assurances from the members of the Commission that of course the Commission is looking for a balanced deal with the United States, which respects the interests of both sides, both the European countries and the United States.  The negotiations will continue for some time because the Commission would like to assure a fair and balanced deal for both sides.  In that process there are elements of democratic control, not only NGOs, the world conference but also elections to the European Parliament and contacts with elected members of the European Parliament, not least of course, members of the government.  There are many mechanisms to acquire more information and probably these means should be employed by citizens.  The Latvian Presidency will not be of any particular assistance in the process.</p> <p>  I will comment on the CSDP and the role of NATO.  NATO is a defence alliance and at the same time it is an important organisational structure providing security and addressing humanitarian crisis and peace operation throughout the world.  The EU through the CSDP mechanisms co-operate with NATO for the purpose of peace operations.  Ireland, as far as I know, is also co-operating with NATO, being a member of the partnership for peace arrangement, with the purpose of conducting joint peace operations.  This is how I see the relationship between Ireland and NATO.  What I said about co-operation with NATO does not necessarily extend to territorial defence.  The EU unfortunately is not a defence alliance, even though the treaty contains the Sovereignty Clause.  </p> <p>  In respect of the Eastern Partnership of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the ambitions and interests of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus should be taken into account when thinking of the future of the Eastern Partnership.  One can negotiate with those countries.  It is important that they remain as participants of the process.  With time their positions on certain issues may change.  Certainly during this process, we can only keep the existing context and welcome those countries as participants of the Riga Eastern Partnership summit. </p> <p>  I did not fully grasp the points made on the increased military involvement in Ukraine.  I would say that I oppose any military involvement or intervention in eastern Ukraine but at this moment there is only one party which is engaged in military intervention in eastern Ukraine.  Certainly this is not the EU and these are not EU member states.</p> <p>  In Central Asia, the very important issues are the fight against drugs and the position of Iran in that respect.  The EU is doing a great deal and we need to raise awareness of what it is doing.  For more than a decade the EU has funded two significant programmes in that part of the world, the Board of Management Programme for Central Asia, helping those countries to establish civilised borders and to control migration, trade and everything else across borders; second, the Central Asia drug action plan initiative is also funded by the European Commission.  These are two major instruments.  In addition, one can involve many international structures.  In Malta there are bilateral projects, involving not only EU member states and countries such as Iran but the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna.  That structure is very active in Central Asia doing research and controlling the drugs traffic across central Asian countries to Europe.  This is a matter for international co-operation and the EU can certainly play a positive role and is already doing so.</p><p> The next question is how to improve relations with the Russian Federation.  I already mentioned that there is certainly one possibility which is to send our message concerning our values and views to the Russian public as actively and widely as possible.  There is a deficit of information inside the Russian Federation on developments elsewhere and how people in Europe perceive developments in Eastern Ukraine and other places.  Much more active exchange of information using European funds for information in the Russian language intended for the Russian population would be a means to improve our relations with the Russian Federation in general.  It is not only about dialogue between governments.  This is also about public diplomacy and everything else.</p><p> I already tried to answer the question on Greece by saying that the Presidency of the European Council can probably not take any significant initiatives to address and modify the existing assistance programme to Greece.  Simultaneously, the European Council is having a debate on the social and economic situation in Greece, but the meeting of the eurozone ministers for finance would probably be the correct institution through which to formally address those concerns.</p><p> I was asked about the European perspective of Eastern Partnership countries.  Certainly, a European perspective exists, but it might be rather remote.  When we speak on Eastern Partnership countries, we must recognise that while they have signed the association agreements, these have not yet even been ratified by all European member states.  This is only the beginning of a very long process which might in time lead to membership as a subject for negotiations and probably as an ultimate reality.  That is not going to be within a few years but rather we should speak in this context of a decade or two.</p><p> I have already said concerning the initiative of Germany and France that all complementary initiatives are welcome from the point of view of the Presidency.  I have heard also of similar views of the High Representative who spoke in Dublin two weeks ago.  Therefore, one can only appreciate the new initiative should it be productive.  Concerning Greece, we addressed the issue of negotiations.</p><p> The last question I was asked was on counter-terrorism.  The Presidency would like to do whatever is possible to improve counter-terrorism measures in Europe but we must also recognise three important factors.  First, counter-terrorism measures are mostly national competencies of EU member states.  Second, they normally involve sharing information and co-operation between security and intelligence services.  Third, there are already a number of European documents and initiatives on this subject.  Therefore, we believe that the European Council should certainly continue to debate the matter while paying particular attention to better implementation of existing measures.  Before producing new declarations or adopting new documents, one could simultaneously consider full or better implementation of the agreed measures.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

The Department met with all the key stakeholders in terms of the commitment we gave in May to review the legislation.  I intend to bring forward proposals to the Government shortly based on that review to ensure the insolvency legislation can work effectively to help people trapped in unsustainable debt so that they can arrive at sustainable solutions.  Subject to Government approval, I intend to introduce a number of amendments on Report Stage arising from that review.</p><p>I would like to address some substantive issues when I do that.  At the discussions today, I would like committee members to be aware that this is the context.  I will be going to the Government based on the review and hopefully bringing forward some further amendments for which I would need Government approval.</p><p> I appreciate the intention behind Deputy Collins's amendment, which seeks to ensure that information about creditor refusals is publicly available.  I am not sure it is necessary and there are some workability issues associated with it as well.  The ISI has already announced that from the first quarter of this year, 2015, it will publish on a quarterly basis details of debt settlement and personal insolvency arrangements that have been voted down by creditors.  That information is now going to be available on a quarterly basis and that will make it available much more quickly, instead of waiting for an annual publication.  I believe this is the right direction to take so that it can be seen clearly what is happening when people are trying to deal with these debt issues.</p><p> Debt relief notices would not be included in the proposed amendment, since the Personal Insolvency Act does not provide for a creditor vote for this type of arrangement.  If it is a limited write-down of unsecured debt for persons with very little income or assets which is approved directly by the court, a creditor can object to the court but no creditor vote is required because of the specific and limited nature of the debt solution.  Perhaps the Deputy would take the points I am making in this regard.</p></speech>

Under the Act as it is now, trying to get information from the banks is like pulling teeth from a hen.  The amendment seeks to ensure that the public has the full understanding of how successful the Act and the legislation are as well as ensuring that we as Oireachtas Members can see on an annual basis the issues that are emerging.  We would also be looking to amend the Act ourselves moving forward.</p></speech>

In terms of the amendment, could I suggest to the Deputy that this is part of the review and will be one of the issues I will bring to the Cabinet?

It concerns the bank veto.  Anecdotally, we hear stories that banks are working reasonably but then within Oireachtas committees we detect, reading between the lines, that the banks are making it clear it is one veto after another.  We considered this to be a weakness with the Act.  Giving a bank the ability to prevent a deal stacks the deck against the person who is trying to get their life moving again.  For example, looking at the evidence the banks gave to the finance committee, they were quite strong in suggesting they would not be engaging in write-downs and so on.  This is the key problem with the original Bill that we would want to see revisited.  We are using this opportunity today to flag the issue with the Minister and I hope she can revisit the whole issue.  The veto is the one area that is a fundamental flaw in the original Bill.</p></speech>

That proposal, as the Deputy says, was made on Report Stage of the Bill in 2012 and it was opposed at that point on the basis that it seems unlikely that creditors would accept or agree to be bound by a solution which was only approved by a minority - the Deputy is saying 30% - of value of the overall debt.  There would be a situation where, out of all of those creditors, it would only require 30% of them to agree that the arrangement was acceptable.</p> <p>  I am aware of the issue the Deputy is trying to deal with and I believe there are other avenues open to us which we will be considering as a result of the review.  The courts might be able to play a further role, for example, and be in a position to make further interventions.  There are obviously different definitions of "unreasonable" for different people.  A court might make a call where there had been a particular situation in which a solution was being refused by a creditor.  We are concerned here with striking a delicate balance between the rights of creditors and debtors.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that we have to be clear that the banks must and should engage constructively on these issues and help people come to resolutions.  That is a key issue.  Although the solution suggested here is not the right solution and I am not in a position to accept the amendment, I intend to bring forward changes and proposals for the Personal Insolvency Act and will be considering very carefully the range of possible approaches, also in the context of any legal advice.  There will be some constitutional property rights, for example, that would impact on this type of decision.  I would point out that in the UK, the percentage is 75%.   We have 65% here and the Deputy is suggesting going down to 30%.  I understand the problem he is trying to deal with but it is a very dramatic reduction in the percentage where agreement is needed in order for it to be accepted.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to accept the amendment but there may be other ways of dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that the perception and the message that came from the banks in the finance committee was that they are not in the mind-set in terms of dealing with  write-downs and that they want to send out a robust message in this respect.</p><p> We must do something radical, although I do not know if that is the right word, to remove the veto.  It is ensuring that the banks do not have the percentage on their side to stall a settlement.  There is also a balance of responsibility and, at present, they have all the chips on their side.  There is a flaw in the legislation and my party feel strongly about it.  When this was going through originally, the entire Opposition took this position.  Those who take up the option vindicate our view.  We may not convince the Minister today but I ask her to deliberate further on the matter to see if we can make changes.</p></speech>

I can envisage a situation where it might be possible to draft changes to consider a court review of the reasonableness of bank decisions on debt settlement arrangement, DSA, or personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, proposals.  We will consider it further to see if we can examine the court's powers to take a stronger approach on the issue.</p> <p>  With regard to the ISI, I informed the D&aacute;il during the debate on Second Stage that we saw dramatic changes towards the end of last year when we changed the fee structure.  The ISI carried out an information campaign on its service and there was a large increase in the number of people using it in the last quarter of last year.  Hopefully, this will continue.  In establishing an insolvency service, the experience in the UK was that it took several years to be effective.  We want to make it as effective as we can as quickly as possible.  In the review, we have examined any actions we can take to strengthen the possibilities of this kind of debt resolution being agreed by banks.</p> <p>  Two weeks ago, we had a meeting with insolvency experts working directly with individuals.  Some banks are engaging to a much greater extent than others.  It is very uneven.  Some banks are working very well with the insolvency people who are representing clients while other banks are not working as effectively as they could.</p></speech>

That being the case, the amendment is not relevant.</p> <p>  There is an issue in regard to the wording of the amendment.  It is unclear from it whether it prevents the ISI charging a fee to credit rating agencies or other persons who wish to consult the ISI register.  It is also unclear whether it prevents the official assignee in bankruptcy, whose functions are exercised partly under the Personal Insolvency Act, from collecting the remaining contributions to the cost of bringing in an estate at bankruptcy.  We have already provided for a reduction of costs to a person entering bankruptcy, from some &euro;1,350 in 2012 to approximately &euro;275.  I made these changes towards the end of last year.  We have done a lot in terms of fees representing a barrier.  I met the CEO of the ISI, who was concerned that the upfront fees were a barrier to people.  That is why we waived them, which has been in effect since October.  The reduction in the bankruptcy fees is substantial.  There are increased numbers using the service.</p></speech>

We have reduced fees considerably.  Personal insolvency practitioner fees are not fixed but must be set out in writing in the personal insolvency agreement or the debt settlement agreement.  They must be agreed by the debtors and creditors.  There is considerable variability in terms of whether banks are working closely with the ISI.  If banks make arrangements, they usually assume costs of &euro;5,000 for an agreed personal insolvency arrangement.  That is the current situation.  Normally, creditors pay but the problem arises when a deal is refused.  That is something I want to examine further to see how we can work on the issue.</p></speech>

We are anxious to see a full review of the Act laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within one month.  The intention of the Bill to amend the original Bill is fine but we feel the core issue is the veto.  We all respect organisations like Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, working on the front line.  This is not just about statistics, it is about people's lives and being trapped in misery.  The Bill was intended to find a pathway for people but there have been problems.  From talking to groups on the front line, we know what they think are the issues.  As soon as we can, we should deal with the problems that exist and make the Bill deliver what it was originally intended to.

I appreciate his intention of providing for a review of the Personal Insolvency Act 2013.  The amendment is not necessary because the Act provides for a statutory review.  Section 141 requires the Minister for Justice and Equality to carry out a full review of the operation of insolvency arrangements under the Act, including DNRs, DSAs and PIAs within three years of its commencement, that is, by 21 July 2016.  The review is to be completed within one year and the resulting report laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  We have completed a departmental review having met the various stakeholders, including MABS and others involved in this area, following the statement of Government priorities last May and I will bring forward proposals based on that review.  The review has examined the full scope of the Act.  Perhaps the Deputy will consider withdrawing the amendment because it may serve to unnecessarily duplicate the review work, which is provided for in the Act.  I will speak fully on many of the issues in the review on Report Stage.  I understand that Stage will not be taken next week and it will be some weeks away.

This petition is entitled equality and fairness regarding the raising of the State pension age to 66 and beyond.  The petitioner was Mr. Henry Gaynor and it is petition No. 33 of 2013.  Mr. Fergus Whelan, industrial officer in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, is with us today.  We are very grateful to him for assisting us in our deliberations.  I remind everyone to be careful with mobile telephones.  This is a live session being viewed by members of the public and I wish those tuning in well.</p><p>Before commencing, I must inform Mr. Whelan that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence he gives to this committee.  If he is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and he continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>We look forward to listening to Mr. Whelan's presentation and we will have questions and answers after it.</p></speech>

I gave the committee a brief paper in advance, to which I will speak.  I will begin with the executive summary.  Citizens are being deprived of a significant benefit they earned and paid for.  This measure is not designed to help older workers to stay in employment.  Employers and unions were given no opportunity to consider the complex labour market issues involved.  In terms of the raising of the pension age - it is not the retirement age but the pension age because they are two different things - we are going further and faster than any other country in Europe.  We will have the highest pension age in Europe at the end of this relatively short process.</p> <p>  There has been no public debate on this matter.  No one has explained to the public why we must have the highest public pension age in the EU.  This measure makes nonsense of the advice the Pensions Board gave for years about the importance of long-term planning for one's retirement.  This measure flies in the face of the principles of pension reform.  The troika did not impose this measure.  It was contrived by politicians and public officials who will continue to enjoy good pensions from age 65 and earlier.  We are a long time into this process and we have no faith that the cosseted pension elite who contrived this matter have any intention of mitigating the injustice they have caused.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it.  We were told that this hasty arbitrary diktat was agreed with the troika.  There was no political debate, no public consultation and no cost-benefit analysis of the measure.  No consideration was given to the significant labour market issues involved nor was thought given to issues of fair play, equity or minimising hardship on those worst affected.  Social policy issues, labour market issues, industrial relations issues, pension policy issues, planning issues and social insurance issues are involved.</p><p>Nobody should be fooled by the notion that this has anything to do with austerity.  Long before austerity, spurious demographic arguments were being used by the Department of Social Protection and, hopefully to its now shame, the Society of Actuaries in Ireland to tell us that 50 years from now, there would be so many pensioners and so few people at work that we had to do something drastic about PRSI pension entitlements.  They even on occasions dressed these assumptions up as inescapable facts.  There are no inescapable facts about 50 years from now.  Making assumptions about population growth five years ahead is a very good idea if one wants to plan for a school building programme.  In terms of pension policy, doing demographic projections 50 years ahead is complete nonsense.  </p><p> In the run up to 2014, workers were given no advance notice when depending on their age, they stood to lose &euro;12,000, &euro;24,000 or &euro;36,000 per year.  The newspapers hardly covered it and the Department of Social Protection did not write to these people to tell them that although they had been paying PRSI for the past 40 years and were expecting a pension at 65, they would not get it.  Between themselves and their employers, the people affected by it paid almost 15% of their salary since the PRSI system was invented to pay for this benefit so this is not a handout.  No politician or civil servant looked into their heart and said it would be nice to give these workers a pension.  This is something these workers paid for and nobody had the right to confiscate these payments because it is confiscation of money earned and paid for by workers paying PRSI.  These workers are now victims of decision makers who are not affected at all.  The people who happily made this decision will suffer no ill effects as a result of it.</p><p> Apologists for this measure suggest that as people are living longer, they should work longer.  ICTU holds that people should be free to work longer if they wish but they should not be obliged to do so in order to avoid poverty.  No provision has been made to facilitate workers remaining in employment after age 65.  When the lower grades in Government Departments, who are on the higher levels of PRSI, reach the age of 65, they are out the door, regardless of whether they have any pension entitlement or not.  The Government can hardly expect the private sector employers to keep their people on if it is not prepared to keep its own employees on in this situation.  On a number of occasions, we asked the Department of Social Protection what it proposed to do with its lower grade staff on the higher rate of PRSI when they hit 65 if they had no pension entitlements.  Even when it was put in writing, that answer was not forthcoming.  The reason it was not forthcoming was because it knew exactly what it was going to do.  It was going to push them out the door, which is exactly what it did.  This has nothing to do with keeping people in the workforce for longer.  </p><p> Employers and unions were given no opportunity to consider the other complex labour market issues involved.  IBEC was concerned about whether the lack of clarity concerning the legality or otherwise of an affiliate sacking workers at age 65 would lead to litigation.  We were concerned that if a person with 40 years service was going out the gate with no pension, he or she might picket it.  In a way, I am sorry some of them did not do this.  It might have brought the matter to a head but as a trade union official whose job it is to fix industrial disputes, I can say it would be a very difficult dispute to fix because this person has been pushed out the door and he or she has nothing to lose by keeping the picket going for the rest of their life.  </p><p> Other labour market issues that were ignored were the effects on the morale and productivity of workers either being retained in or forced out of employment against their will.  This is a big issue for both us and employers.  Even if one lets somebody who has been planning to go at 65 stay on to avoid poverty, there are implications for productivity.  There are also implications for productivity and morale among other people who are being held back from promotion because people who were expected to leave at a particular age are being kept on.  If the Government had decided that people were not getting a pension at 65 but their employers had to keep them on, the troika would have regarded it as a labour market rigidity.  I use the term "if" because nobody involved in making this decision with whom I spoke had any intention of doing anything to protect a worker who was being driven out of employment with no pension entitlement.  </p><p> Another issue that is very dear to my heart, probably because of where my working life began, is the fact that it is all very well for to ask somebody working in this building or organisation, in the various organisations associated with it or in education to work to 68.  Where is the justice in asking a scaffolder to work to 68 if one could find an employer who would be irresponsible enough to let a 68 year old man climb a scaffold on a January or December morning?  There was no discussion of this matter.  If arrangements are made to keep people on - not that anybody has done this - is there a knock-on effect down the line in terms of youth unemployment and positions not being available for younger people coming into the labour market?  </p><p> Pension reform and pension planning are long-term issues.  When we go to negotiate a pension scheme, we engage actuaries and the workers pay them big money to find out how much they have to put away and for how long if they want a certain pension.  This must be done over a 40-year period, which is the proper way to plan a pension.  To come along 35 years into that and say, "By the way, some of the figures are wrong because we changed the rules.  You've paid for three years PRSI pension but we have decided you're not getting it," makes a nonsense of pension planning.  </p><p> The current Administration is saying that it wants to move towards a mandatory pension scheme or a pension scheme that involves everybody.  This decision has done a lot of damage to that prospect.  People have been paying PRSI for years and now they see it confiscated.  What worker will agree to pay into a pension for their entire career if some Administration in the future can just say, "We didn't really mean it.  We wanted you to pay for it but we never had any intention of giving it to you."  Huge damage has been done to confidence in pensions as a result not just of this measure, but of others we will not go into.  Perhaps we will come back another day and talk about them.  To put it simply, if somebody was told five years ago that he or she was going into an occupational pension scheme, they would nearly have celebrated.  If it was said to a young worker today, he or she would nearly cry because very few people have any faith that they will get what they are paying for.  This decision has been a big contributor to that.  </p><p> I will not read out the rest of my paper.</p><p> In the paper I drew up last year I refer to a person aged 59 years but I will correct that to 60 years of age.  A private sector worker who is 60 years of age this year will not get their pension until he or she is 67 years of age.  I know this because I am that person.  I started to work at 16 years of age in a construction site and I have worked ever since.  I will not get a penny out of my PRSI pension until I am 51 years in the workforce.  That is assuming my employer allows me to stay on after 64 years of age, which is the age at which I finish work.  That is a big assumption.  The people who made this decision can get very generous pensions.  Most of the people involved  have very generous pensions at 60 years of age and never paid the rates of PRSI that I paid.  </p><p> In my entire life as a trade union official I have tried to avoid the public sector-private sector divide, and that is still very important to me, but it is very hard when well-pensioned elites can make decisions at the flick of a pen which deny people who are much poorer than they an entitlement without a by your leave.</p></speech>

I hope I do not repeat the questions I asked previously when the witness appeared before one of the committees - I think it was the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  This issue comes before us because somebody has appealed to us, as a petitions committee, that the public service and public policy is doing them a disservice.  That is the reason the petition is before us and the reason Mr. Whelan was invited to appear before the committee.</p> <p>  I have wholehearted sympathy for the position the witness and the petitioner have taken.  I agree in particular with the point he made around the lack of debate and the lack of foresight for those who are affected in any way.  Normally if an entitlement is to be taken away there is negotiation or compensation.  In this case neither has happened.  What is even worse is that this was one of the Bills that was guillotined where we never reached the debate which had been scheduled so that we could tease out all the implications of a move such as this.  Has any analysis been carried out around the number of jobs that will be affected?  There is a whole range of contracts, including Mr. Whelan's own case, where it is hoped employers will extend the contract or else one will be retired.  One is not pensioned any more because the pension age is 65, 66 or 67 as the case may be and one will be put on the dole, the jobseeker's allowance.  If all those people have to extend their contracts that means there are many young people whose job opportunities have been delayed to them by one, two or three years.  Has a job of work been done to see what will be the effect on the jobs market?</p> <p>  The other question is around alternatives.  I agree with Mr. Whelan's scepticism around the actuarial approach being given to this pension timebomb as it is presented.  Have any alternatives been offered, for example, to look again at the PRSI contributions, the reinstatement of the National Pensions Reserve Fund or such like to ensure that the Social Insurance Fund is adequate to address what is a perceived shortfall?  That is not correctly linked to the petitioner.  The petitioner basically said that it is unfair to lose an entitlement which they were led to believe their PRSI contribution was going to bring them at retirement age.</p></speech>

What happens when a person reaches the age of 65 is that he or she has to go out the door.  Retirement is a nice thing, it sounds as if one is going to get a watch and pension.  The correct word is dismissal.  No analysis was carried out on the effects on the job market.  When IBEC and ourselves were in with the Department of Social Protection we were asking the same questions but we did not agree on everything; basically, we were asking for clarity as to whether people would have to stay on.  The attitude of the officials at that stage was that it was being implemented, if people want to stay on they can take their legal cases and see how they get on.  This was done on the basis that we will just do it and let the fall-out be what it is.  No analysis was done of the likely effect and we still do not know the likely effect.</p> <p>  In fairness, it is very hard to get a handle on what is being done.  For instance, one of the aspects is that one is entitled to unemployment benefit for nine months, but is that the case?  It is if one has not been unemployed in the recent years but quite a number of people when planning for retirement would have taken their redundancy package and signed on for unemployment and so on and would have been depending on it but not everybody gets it.  Something bizarre has happened in respect of unemployment benefit and while I welcome some of the change, it is not a long-term but a short-term fix.  As I understand it, a person who is entitled to unemployment benefit will not just get it for the nine months but will be given it for 12 months.  That is certainly better than nothing and helps in a little way but it does not help for the second and third year.  To some extent, the effect of that was to prevent a bigger backlash against this in the short term.  The alternative is that if the pension age has to go up, by all means let it go up but let it go up for everybody and much more slowly than the present rate and let it go up to 68 when it has gone up to 68 for everybody else.  Why should Irish workers be the only workers in Europe who do not get their pension until they are 68 years of age?  By all means push it out but an injustice has been which can be mitigated if it is pushed out a little and only to 67 years of age.</p></speech>

One of the points raised by Mr. Gaynor towards the end of his presentation which was interesting - I wonder if ICTU has done an analysis of this - was that the net cost-benefit to the Exchequer is actually very small.</p><p>He suggested that the numbers of people who actually end up retiring at 65 years is rather small, because some finish work early and others do not stay in work for health or other reasons until they are 65 years of age.  I do not have the figure to hand, but it was a rather small figure.  Has ICTU done a cost-benefit analysis on the matter?  Let us compare that with the net cost to the State.  There would be a loss of tax revenue because those people would not be working and we would be paying them unemployment benefit for that period.  On the face of it, only a saving of &euro;500,000 annually to the State is at issue in respect of introducing something that has major implications.  Has ICTU had a chance to examine the net cost and the implications?</p><p> Another point mentioned by Mr. Gaynor is the ring-fencing principle in industrial relations.  We have seen it with newly qualified teachers and nurses.  People who were already in the system were ring-fenced and any changes brought in to working conditions were only for new entrants to the system.  Mr. Gaynor has suggested that if something like this were to be introduced, then it is only right and proper from an industrial relations perspective that we should only introduce it for people who start to pay PRSI from when the agreement is made, and anyone who is already in the system should be ring-fenced.  Mr. Whelan is an industrial relations negotiator.  This seems to be a generally accepted principle across unions and employers.  Does this fly in the face of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.883" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergus Whelan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015021100002#E00200"><p>I will answer the second question first.  It is even bigger than that.  The industrial relations aspect comes from a far more fundamental thing in law, that is, legitimate expectation.  There is a thinking in law whereby if an employee pays for something on the basis that he has been told this is what he will get, then he has a legitimate expectation.  This proposition tears up legitimate expectation in a most unfair way.  If anyone had the wherewithal to bring a Supreme Court challenge or a challenge to the institutions in Europe, I believe this could not but fly in the face of legitimate expectation.</p> <p>  The other question was whether we had done a cost-benefit analysis.  We have not.  I believe that initially only a rather small number of people would be affected by it.  However, the fewer the number of people affected by this, the greater the injustice.  If I and five others are the only people to have lost &euro;24,000 as a result, it is a greater injustice than if 50,000 people were affected.  In other words, it is worse if a small number of people have been targeted.  It would have the effect that a small number of people have lost out but no one else would lose out.  That is a graver injustice and a bigger inequity.</p></speech>

Does ICTU have an opinion on this?  To claim jobseeker's benefit, a person must be seeking work.  A person does not qualify for jobseeker's benefit or allowance if he is not seeking work.</p></speech>

In the normal course of events, when a worker finishes his active working life, he is entitled to jobseeker's benefit.  Now, it could be the case that a social welfare inspector could call him in and ask for proof that he has been actively seeking work, but they do not do that.  It has always been the way.</p></speech>

This is the anomaly I am trying to point out.  Let us suppose a person has left work or has had to leave work and does not have a State pension.  The only option open to him for an income is jobseeker's benefit.  However, technically speaking, to claim jobseeker's benefit a person must be actively seeking work.</p></speech>

Although it is rather difficult to pin down, I also understand that they get it for 12 months rather than the nine months to which they are entitled.</p></speech>

Most workers who leave work at 65 years have been paying vast sums of PRSI, insurance against periods of unemployment.  It would appear to a worker in that situation that the entitlement for nine months is only right, particularly if he has worked for 40 years and had never claimed unemployment benefit in all that time.  It would be a bit much for someone to pay for 40 years and never get any benefit from those payments.</p></speech>

It is clear that what Mr. Whelan wants is for the pension of &euro;230 to be available at the age 65 years, and, therefore, that the people concerned would not have to avail of the jobseeker's benefit.  Does he think the arrangement as it stands devalues the jobseeker's system?  I declare an interest.  Many years ago I worked for the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.  It was clear that unemployment benefits were a payment of social solidarity for people while they were seeking work.  Does Mr. Whelan have a difficulty with the fact that the Department has found this solution to the conundrum that has been created?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.899" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergus Whelan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015021100002#E01800"><p>We are where we are.  I believe this is a terrible injustice, but some of it has been done already and I cannot see any circumstances where the Department is going to bring back the pension age to 65 years.  However, I believe that if there is going to be any mitigation of the injustice, then the second raise in the pension age should be pushed out to something along the lines of what is in the rest of Europe and that we should not go to 68 years.</p> <p>  By the way, I think Mr. Gaynor made a very articulate point in respect of people like himself and his colleagues who have worked all their lives in gainful employment and have never been unemployed.  If I understood him correctly, he took the view that putting him on jobseeker's allowance was somewhat belittling for someone who had never been unemployed.  I do not see it that way.  I see it as someone getting an entitlement that he has paid for.</p></speech>

The poor old chucks out there who are self-employed rarely come in for mention.  It is something that we should examine further down the line when it comes to pension reform.  The self-employed really have no safety net whatsoever.</p> <p>  I want to touch on one thing.  The Deputies who were elected in 2011, me included, face the vista of 68 years as well.  I am keen to have that on the record.  That change has taken place and it is only fair to mention it.</p></speech>

We told it about the knock-on problems.  We asked it at one stage to postpone it.  It was coming up to 2014 and this was moving quickly.  We asked it to push it back to give us some time to set up a forum where we could examine the labour market issues.  The Department said it would set up a forum but did not do so.  As the clock was ticking, the Department brought in ICTU, IBEC, the Employment Law Association of Ireland and the old-age pensioner organisations into a room in Croke Park, listened to everything we had to say and that ticked the box that it had consulted with us.  However, we never managed to influence the Department in any way.  These are probably very good negotiators and it was hard to believe that any arguments about justice, equity or fair play made the slightest impression on it  The message was that this was happening and if there were labour law issues it was nothing to do with the Department.</p></speech>

Very few active building workers are still employed at 65 years.  Generally, people get out of the game as they go into middle age but some do not.  For the small number who do not find another way of making a living, they expect to get the pension they paid for at 65 years of age.  Any scaffolder of my age will not get the pension until he is 67 years, which is a gross injustice.</p></speech>

When I was in the room while Mr. Henry Gaynor was here, I could see huge confusion among committee members about the difference between public and private pensions, which part is the PRSI pension and which part is the occupational pensions.  The pension models around Europe differ so greatly that European comparisons are not of much value, with the exception of the UK.</p></speech>

In some cases, the entire pension is an occupational pension.  Our system is a mixture of first pillar and second pillar pensions but, in the time available to me, I will not be able to explain it.  We can be certain that a 60-year-old scaffolder in Berlin has better pension prospects than a 60-year-old scaffolder in Dublin.</p></speech>

In the current climate, that is ridiculous.  It is also an insult to the people who have that kind of service record.  The State transition pension also disappeared.  It was to allow people to retire at 65 and be paid a State allowance for the period until they qualify for the pension but is now gone.  This is also related to the compensation the State gives in exchange from PRSI and jobseeker's benefit, which is set at &euro;188.  The contributory pension is &euro;236 so there is a substantial weekly loss to the person of &euro;48.  That is substantial in the current climate, especially since people make provision on the basis of retiring and think they will be okay for the first year or second year.  Most of the people who were severely worried are those with contracts that will end at the age of 65.  That is their employment contract and unless the State starts to negotiate on their behalf that the contract will be extended - the State has not given any indication that it will ensure the contracts are extended to 66, 67 or 68 years - people who are forced to avail of jobseeker's benefit will incur substantial loss.  Has that been calculated on the basis of the figures I am coming up with?</p></speech>

The Government has driven people with no pension entitlement out of employment at age 65.  If the Government has done it, what does it expect private sector employers to do?  The Government is leading by example and telling private sector employers that it is grand to sack people at 65 years.</p></speech>

It is an objective that has been achieved.  For a long time, every time there was a new report by the Pensions Board or anywhere in the public service, demographic material was included suggesting we were living way beyond our means and that we must tackle the public pension provision.  The troika came as a godsend to these people because they were immediately able to raise the pension age without any public debate, go further than anywhere else and not engage in discussion about what they were saving.</p></speech>

The person might win.  Mr. Gaynor handled this well when he was talking about the European court system.  All these things are decided on the merits of the individual case.  One person might win and another person might lose.</p><p>I am an old type industrial relations practitioner.

This is the Minister's first time taking the Estimates and I wish him the best of luck.  The Department is almost all-encompassing at this stage.  Broadband coverage is the main communications issue.  People right across the country are very exasperated with broadband services and the almost never-never promise or commitment on the provision of broadband.  Approximately 40% of the State has no adequate broadband service.  I understand that the Department is moving closer to the view that the only reasonable or credible way of providing broadband right across the country is through a fibre system.  Has the Department costed the possibility of bringing fibre to every community?  What kind of investment is needed?</p> <p>  I refer to an application to the European Union Commission's state aid programme.  Has that application been submitted to the EU Commission?  What is the likely timeframe?  Even though it is nearly 12 months since the next stage of the broadband plan was issued, it has not been submitted to the European Commission.  People who have bought telephone and broadband bundling packages from some of the companies providing telecommunications services, such as Eircom, are very frustrated.  They are not receiving an adequate service because the broadband system is not up to speed.  What recourse can be provided by the Department?  The communications regulator has issued very unsatisfactory communications in this regard.  The main issue on the communications side is the broadband spend.  What kind of money is being allocated by the Department for 2015?  What is the Department's best estimate of the funding required for the provision of fibre to every community?  How will it deal with complaints against telecommunications companies who are not honouring their side of the bargain?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.934" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR62015021100002#A00900"><p>I thank Deputy Moynihan for his insights and his questions.  To reference the Estimates I remind colleagues that the 2014 allocation had allowed for an end of contract provision of &euro;9.058 million for the NBS service-provider and an allocation of &euro;6.2 million for schools broadband, as well as additional moneys for the separate issue of postcodes.</p> <p>  To deal with the national broadband plan provisions for 2015, the provision has increased from &euro;1.3 million in 2014 to &euro;4.1 million for 2015.  To address Deputy Moynihan's question, the main reason for this increase of &euro;2.8 million is to meet the payments required under the four new consultancies entered into in late 2014 and early 2015.</p><p>They were to cover the legal questions in respect of the national broadband plan, which is a very big project, the economic and financial questions that arose, on which the Deputy touched, and procurement and technical questions, as well as the engagement of additional external expertise.  We are proceeding with that work.</p><p> Colleagues will be aware that last November I published the outcome of a mapping exercise in order that citizens, businesses and colleagues would be able to see the position on what the private sector had undertaken to deliver by the end of 2016 and, by extension, what State intervention would be required in circumstances where the private sector was not willing or in a position to provide services.  The mapping exercise was critical; in fact, it was required in the context of the state aid application, to which the Deputy referred.  We will have to make a state aid application under the general principle, of which colleagues will be aware.  State aid rules &ndash; EU-wide rules &ndash; prohibit the State from intervening in the provision of services where the private or commercial sector is delivering or intends to deliver a service.  We have not yet made our state aid application, but I expect it to be made sometime mid-year.  We are not yet ready to make the application.  We are doing an enormous amount of work on a daily basis in the Department and with our external advisers in looking at financial, governance, legal and contract issues.  Will there be one or several contracts in terms of the State's intervention?  Who will own the network, which will be the equivalent of 100,000 km of road, if one were to think of it as a roads system?  An enormous amount of work needs to be done this year on the state aid application to take us to the stage to which we need to get by the end of the year to go to tender to find a contractor or contractors to build the network.  That is the way we need to do it to do it properly.</p></speech>

The European Union does not allow us to nominate a technology.  Having said that, anybody who reads the literature and has an understanding of broadband knows that the technology of choice in delivering high quality broadband is fibre.  I am certainly very conscious of this and the thinking generally on what is best technically to deliver high speed quality broadband across the country.  Fibre has been and is the technology of choice.  However, I cannot make a definitive call on the technology to be used because state aid rules and the European Union do not allow me to do so.</p></speech>

The application seeking state aid approval will be sent to the European Commission mid-year.  I stress that this issue is beyond urgent in communities everybody present and I represent.  The application will be made mid-year, but has the Minister received an indication from the European Commission as to when a decision will be made on the matter?</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy in placing the emphasis on the timelines involved.  We have imposed on ourselves very exacting month-by-month timelines.  I will ensure the Deputy and colleagues will receive a monthly report on where we are in the various stages we need to go through.  The answer to the Deputy's question on state aid is that once the application is made, we will, to some extent, be at the mercy of the European Commission.  We will have to wait for it to give its response to the application.  I spoke briefly to Commissioner Oettinger in the past three weeks when I was in Brussels and again flagged the importance of this project, in which the European Commission is very interested.  It is watching very closely because it can see we have got our act together in terms of how precisely we want to deliver on our plan.  I expect and will urge it to expedite our application when it receives it.  The Deputy's frustration will translate into action on the part of the Department.  We will deliver.</p></speech>

I expect the decision to be that it will allow state aid to be given.  What timeframe does the Department envisage after we receive approval from the European Commission?</p></speech>

When we make the submission for state aid approval, the clock does not have to stop.  I expect and will want to go to tender at the end of the year.  I do not believe we will have to stop or pause the timetable in order to wait for the response to the state aid application.  I hope to make the application mid-year, perhaps in the summer, and in the meantime drive on towards the tender process which I hope we will be able to commence in December.  That is my aspiration.  One does not have to stop the other.</p></speech>

If we have a cobbled-together scheme, we will be selling 40% of the population short.  We need to move forward with a proper and foolproof broadband system.</p></speech>

We need to go through each of the stages I have outlined and go to tender, with a roll-out in 2016.  Doing it right is the most important aspect.  Adopting an approach simply to fill in gaps in a haphazard way will not solve the problem.  It must be undertaken as one big project.  I undertake to keep Deputies closely informed on each stage along the way.  I will do this on a monthly basis, not just when I have an opportunity to appear before the committee.  I will make a monthly report available to Deputies.</p></speech>

However, I hope we can look to a number of sources of financing and that we are not just talking about the Exchequer writing a big cheque.  We have spoken to the European Commission; the Juncker moneys have come on stream; we have the European Investment Bank and even considered the World Bank.  Domestically, we have the Strategic Investment Bank, while I have spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about how we can pull together the different sources of funding for the project.  However, if the Deputy will indulge me, I do not think I will put a figure on it today.</p></speech>

Even if I had a big pile of money in the budget this year for the national broadband plan, it would not be possible to spend it because we will not have a contractor in place until next year.  I have had a number of meetings with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are discussing the multi-annual capital plan with a view to expenditure in 2016 and 2017, to which the Government is fully committed.  It is included in the statement of Government priorities from last summer.  It is absolutely a priority across government.</p></speech>

I have read a few lovely flashy documents about the roll-out of broadband.  I see that two service suppliers are talking about services in certain areas.  Certain towns have been earmarked, but the problem is that when one rings the people concerned to ask them for a date, one is told that every town will have a service by May or June 2016.  I cannot understand how it is not possible to say, as in any walk of life, whether, according to the work programme, it will be October this year that such a town will have a service or February next year when another will a service.  The boat will stop in May or June 2016.  It would be nice for people in various parts of the country to know whether the service will upgraded in such a town in the west-----</p></speech>

There is an urgent need for a roll-out of broadband to all rural areas.  It is one of the critical pieces of infrastructure that will ensure the revival of rural areas.  I made the Minister aware a few days ago of companies that were in constant contact with other countries.  The simple fact is that we will lose jobs.  When does the Minister envisage broadband services being rolled out throughout the country from beginning to end?</p></speech>

Whoever the unfortunate person will be, the last person in the country to benefit will receive broadband by 2020.  I expect, once the successful contractor or contractors are in place, the roll-out of the plan to start in 2016.  That is the timetable.</p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy&rsquo;s points about existing problems with the timetables of commercial operators, unfortunately, I cannot direct them.  That is not the position we are in, but the mapping exercise shows what the commercial sector will do between now and the end of 2016.  I know that is not a full answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, but he can say to a constituent or anyone else in the country who is wondering how he or she will fare and how he or she is fixed in terms of broadband that if he or she is to be supplied by the private sector, it will happen before the end of 2016, at a minimum 30 Mbps.  That is important also because many people have access to broadband but not at adequate speeds.  In fact, practically everybody has access to some broadband service, but it is not adequate.  The private sector is to deliver a minimum figure of 30 Mbps by the end of 2016.  The map is prospective to the end of 2016.  If one is in the blue area, the private sector will deliver a service; it is up to the State to deliver the rest.</p> <p>  To return to Deputy Michael Moynihan&rsquo;s point, it is about the State doing it properly once and for all.  The Deputy gave me examples of school, educational, social and cultural use, to say nothing about the business opportunities in rural areas to create and maintain businesses.  Tourism is an obvious sector.  There are many other people in new innovative areas of business who depend on broadband, not just to download from the system but also to upload.  We understand what the need is, but we want to do it properly.  The private sector has given an undertaking to deliver between now and the end of 2016.  Individual operational problems are a matter for the private operators to deal with, subject to the regulator in certain instances where undertakings have been given or contractual arrangements are not being followed.  It is up to the private sector to do what it is supposed to do for its customers.</p></speech>

I echo the concerns being expressed in predominantly rural constituencies.  The difficulties faced by businesses and householders alike are enormous because of the lack of proper broadband provision.  I use the line that we are only as strong as the slowest connection and, unfortunately, there are a lot of slow connections around the country.</p> <p>  One of the Minister&rsquo;s first engagements was in Cahersiveen to officially launch the fibre broadband service in the town.  It is of enormous help in that part of County Kerry, but like in so many other parts of the country when one travels a couple of miles outside the town, there is literally no reception.  In the Black Valley near Killarney, the last part of the country to receive an electricity supply, people are still writing to me to say their telephone connections are not up to standard.  We have lagged very far behind.  It dates back to the 28th D&aacute;il and the privatisation of the telecommunications infrastructure.  It is a legacy issue.  I am not taking a political shot, but it was a huge mistake, from which we must learn, no matter which policy area we are examining.  It is urgent that we move forward.  I know that we want to get it right, but we have learned that if one tries to rush things, they will not work out.  It is vital that we get it right and have it done as soon as possible.  I get a sense of helplessness from people whose service from their providers is not of a good enough standard in terms of their contact with the regulator.  They do not believe the regulator is responding adequately to their concerns and complaints.  This is something I have heard on many fronts.  There is a substandard service and when people go to the regulator, they do not make much progress or get any joy from it.  This matter must be addressed.  It is one thing not to have a good enough service, but when one cannot progress a complaint, one is really in trouble.</p></speech>

People do need to bring the extent to which current services are not up to scratch to the attention of the commercial operators.  Occasionally, colleagues in this room and others bring the matter to my attention.  As I indicated, I have no direct responsibility for the operation of commercial companies.  However, from time to time we meet them and communicate concerns in a general sense.  The regulator has a critically important role to play in that regard.  If there is anything I can usefully do as Minister in the interim, leaving aside the big picture about which we have been talking, I will try to do it, but my main concentration is on fixing the problem once and for all in order that whoever will be sitting in my position or that of any of the Deputies across from me in three years' time or at the end of the next Oireachtas in five years' time will not be saying we did a half-baked job, that we did not do it properly or that we did not take steps to ensure coverage was provided for everyone in rural areas, in particular.</p></speech>

I still struggle to understand the reason we are spending so much on the system and why it is being described as the best system in the world.  One thing has become clear: if it is to be used as a system beyond a postal and delivery aid, it will depend on a major clean-up of databases in all Departments.</p><p>We are probably talking about years, if not decades, before it is the system some people think it has the potential to become.  Have other Departments made any financial provision to prepare for using Eircode as a tool in managing their operations, as was envisaged by the architects of the system?</p></speech>

Provision was made for that work in previous years, including last year in particular, and the work has been substantially completed across the public sector.  The Deputy is correct that it needs to be done in order for the Eircode system to work.</p> <p>  The contract for the development and roll-out of the national postcode system was signed in December 2013 after a full public procurement process.  The actual design was approved by the Government in April 2014.  A short piece of legislation will be prepared in the coming weeks to deal with data protection issues.  We can realistically hold to the goal in the timetable of delivering this by the summer.</p></speech>

We have looked very closely at developments in other countries and, if I am not mistaken, this committee's equivalent in the House of Commons investigated this issue recently.  Other countries are also considering the idea of moving away from a device-specific charge to one that is household-based.  I do not think we are in a position yet to introduce a household broadcast charge.  We would have to build public understanding and acceptance for such a charge.  I have previously pointed out this will not be a new or additional charge, but sometimes in the broad cacophony of debate in the echo chamber, that message does not get across.  We need to build public acceptance for a broadcasting charge.  Public service broadcasting is critical to our democracy and it should be funded in a robust and stable fashion.  There is merit to a broadcasting charge but I do not see it being introduced in 2016.  We should look to develop and model it in the medium term, based on the experience in other countries.</p></speech>

It is difficult to defend the current arrangement when one considers the local radio stations.  Any discussion of the new broadcasting charge needs to include the fundamental question of how it is going to be distributed.  Earlier today we discussed a range of issues with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  We have to decide how this fund will be spent in the future.</p></speech>

I am aware of the huge contribution made by the independent broadcasting sector.  Deputy Moynihan referred to independent local radio, which is of critical importance.  In 1988 or 1989, the Deputy's colleagues introduced a new legislative basis for independent broadcasting which gave rise to a degree of controversy at the time but which has since bedded down quite well.  We now have a lively public sector alongside an equally lively private sector in broadcasting.  We need to maintain both sectors.</p> <p>  RTE has had a dual funding model since the early 1960s.  The decision to establish a sound and vision fund was one change in that regard.  A percentage of proceeds from the licence fee is made available under the fund for programming that is not directly produced by RTE.  I support the sound and vision fund and we have recently announced a new phase of it.  The question of redistributing revenue from the licence fee away from the public sector to include the private sector is more difficult to justify.  If we are to have a robust public broadcasting sector, it needs stable funding.  However, I am open to discussing the issue with the IBI.</p><p>I am uncomfortable with the idea of the zero sum, that we have to take from one to give to the other.  I would rather see the private broadcasters having the comfort of knowing they can have access to advertising revenue and can function in the marketplace alongside RTE and that similarly RTE has the stability of the revenue from the licence fee.  However, because we are in a relatively small country of 4.5 million people, it will never be realistic for RTE to be like the BBC, solely funded from the licence fee.  I cannot see that being realistic, certainly not in the short term.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Moynihan.  What we are looking at here is re-examining the definition of public service broadcasting.  It may not always be national broadcasting, because there is a local public service that is going on and is capable of going on as well.  Are there any discussions with RTE or other stations about specially commissioned programmes in the run-up to 2016?</p></speech>

There is an interest in RTE in this important event in 2016.  I am old enough to remember what was done in 1966.  The television programmes about commemoration were extremely important.  Television, radio and all media have a huge role in this.  The Government has been looking closely at the commemoration events and has a programme in place in that regard.  I encourage RTE and all the broadcasters to participate in that.  From my own informal discussions with the chair of RTE, I know the broadcaster would be amenable to what the Deputy is saying and will look at it itself.  There is a new board in place now with some very interesting people on it in the context of the issue the Deputy raises.</p></speech>

TG4 does enormous work, principally for the language, which was the basis for its establishment.  It does this right across sport in particular and in some other areas the other broadcasters miss out on or, for scheduling or other reasons, do not accord as high a priority.  TG4 has been very innovative and I agree with the Deputy that this is especially the case in the area of sport.  I travelled to Baile na hAbhann just before Christmas and met the board.  I had a good discussion with its members about their priorities and about the station.  It is a gem in the broadcasting landscape and I am very supportive of it.</p></speech>

How much money is being spent on research and development for energy or alternative sources of energy, particularly biomass?  I have looked at Drax in the UK.  It constitutes 10% of the UK energy market.  Is there any serious examination of biomass in this country and smaller units throughout Europe that are using timber and other sources to generate energy?</p> <p>  I have a major issue with the Commission for Energy Regulation.  It is doing the job it has, but does it require more powers?  Is the Department the parent funder?  What money is being spent on research and development on biomass?  How much is being spent on the Department's subsidy for wind energy?  Is there concern within the Department at the moment about that subsidy, that it would end when wind farms are coming onto the system in future?  Is an alternative being considered or is the grid already saturated or likely to be saturated in the next while in relation to wind energy?</p></speech>

The Deputy will see that in respect of renewable energy research, development and deployment, there is a figure of &euro;1.2 million.  There is provision of &euro;4.75 million for ocean energy development, a very important and exciting area.  The energy policy and statistical support unit, which is also important, has &euro;400,000.  IMERC, the facility in Cork with which the Deputy would be familiar, is allocated &euro;1.16 million.  I was there a few weeks ago and it is doing incredible work. For the International Energy Research Centre the figure is &euro;1 million.  INTERREG is allocated &euro;400,000.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, which assists us, is allocated &euro;150,000.  I will return to those issues if the Deputy would like.

There are huge opportunities there and potential for the future.  As a relatively small island country, the best contribution we can make to that sector at the moment is through research.  We have excellent people in IMERC in Cork and we are trying to fund that as best we can.  We want to bring on bioenergy.  Everybody is committed to increasing renewables in our system and we must do that.  Wind has been important and very cost-effective, but it is only one contribution.  Bioenergy is very important.  We published a draft bioenergy plan in 2014, which gives the broader context for the bioenergy sector.  We reckon it will contribute half our renewable energy target.

We do not just look at the cost to the State of the support mechanisms, the REFIT system and the incentives.  Even when we factor in the grid and all of the infrastructure - the whole kit we need to get the energy from one place to another - it is clear that wind has proven to be the most cost-effective of the sources we have.  It is not the only source, but it has proven itself in recent years as being the most cost-effective.</p></speech>

The Deputy may look at another country that has moved beyond the position here and has decided it has gone far enough.  We must look at what stage other countries have reached.  Wind cannot be their sole energy source.  I expect we will reach a stage where we decide we have reached the maximum we can get from wind and must look at other sources.  We are doing that and the reason we brought forward the bioenergy plan was to ensure that we do not just discuss developing wind but also discuss other sources and elements.  This is the reason the Department's forthcoming White Paper is so important.  I may sound like a broken record when dealing with parliamentary questions when I constantly invite colleagues to participate in our White Paper debate in order that we can consider how best to balance all the different sources.</p> <p>  I have come to this issue without any prejudice or background.  I look at the issue completely dispassionately in the interest of what is best for the country.  I hear what is said to me about wind, but I also want to bring forward biomass.  I also met solar energy advocates yesterday.  If colleagues wish to participate in the energy debate, and I am sure many will despite being very busy, we must consider the best source of energy supply for Ireland in the long term and how best to fund it.  The REFIT system works through a public service obligation and is funded through a levy that goes onto our bills.  That is the system we have currently.  Should we continue with this system or are there other ways of dealing with the issue?  This is not funding from the Department.  We do not use Exchequer moneys from the Estimates to subsidise this.</p></speech>

We have targets in terms of renewable energy to achieve by 2020 and we have made commitments as a country.  We must decarbonise our economy.  We have come through a traumatic economic crisis which has had an impact on what we have been able to do, but we are back on our feet.  I believe the country should contribute to the broader global agenda on combating climate change.  I attended the conference in Lima in November and a speaker there made a stark point, that every economy in the world will have to adjust, whether rich, poor or in between.  Every economy must adjust its economic model to decarbonise its economy.  It is no exaggeration to say that otherwise, within a generation, we will face a catastrophe.  We must do this, but we must do it in a planned and fair way.  The targets we in this country are asked to shoulder should be fair <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other countries.  The Taoiseach and others have been in discussion with our European partners to ensure they are fair, but we must move forward on them.</p></speech>

The oil market is very volatile currently, but the renewable energy market is also very volatile.  It can be very difficult to predict what will happen next year, let alone in ten or 20 years' time.  Is the Minister satisfied his Department and the CER have enough energy economists looking into the crystal ball and predicting what will happen down the line?  I know how difficult that is.</p> <p>  Page 29 of the documentation refers to the increased levels of CO2 avoided due to the use of renewable energy.  However, the financial value of that avoidance reduced from &euro;47 million in 2011 to &euro;16 million in 2013.  I do not understand how that can be the case.  It does not make sense.</p> <p>  The number of low-income homes implementing energy-efficient measures has reduced from 12,000 in 2014 to 7,475 in 2015.  This is disappointing.  Is there any double counting in those figures?  Was the 12,000 figure for 2014 the actual output or the then planned output?  What is the actual output?</p> <p>  My final question concerns an issue I have raised previously, micro energy generating projects and the cost of linking to the grid.  I believe the cost of linking is an impediment to these projects.  I spoke last night to a chap who was talking about setting up what would be a nice industry in Sligo which he wants to be totally self-sufficient in terms of renewable energy generation and use.  I am aware from previous discussions with a person in Monaghan that he not only had a self-sufficient solution to renewable energy but also to waste management but could not proceed with his project because of the cost of linking to the grid.  Are there any serious discussions taking place, as distinct from aspirations, in terms of encouraging and facilitating micro energy generation projects?</p></speech>

We also want to encourage the involvement of individuals and communities in improving the way we manage our energy and develop energy projects.  The Deputy will agree with me that one of the advantages of micro generation and community energy projects is that people in local areas see energy, energy production, energy use and efficiency as something that is important for them rather than just something the State is imposing on them as a requirement.</p> <p>  This lack of understanding is the problem with our current debate and we are all - State agencies and Government - somewhat responsible for this.  We have ended up in a situation where too many people feel victims of energy policy rather than participants in it with an opportunity to have an input into the policy and, perhaps, to produce energy-efficient themselves, whether on farms or in local communities.  We will get far more engagement from local communities in the big challenge of energy if we provide for such projects as the Deputy has mentioned.  I have discussed this in the Department and have pressed officials on the issue.  A significant component of our thinking in the White Paper due this summer, following the Green Paper we had last year, concerns how we can engage local communities, not just in debate but in projects that have meaning for the community and with which they can work.</p> <p>  I met representatives from Energy Co-operatives Ireland last week and they are promoting and pressing this agenda.  They made submissions to the Green Paper and want to engage with us.  We must do that.  We want to talk as much about the energy citizen and community as opposed to just having a Department policy that is imposed on people as if they are victims.</p></speech>

I will try to answer some of the other questions.  The Deputy asked a good question in respect of expertise.  He asked whether the Department and the CER have a sufficient number of technical experts.  I do not believe we have had enough, but in this year's provision we have clearance to employ new experts in the area of energy and energy economics and all of the professional and technical areas so as to be able to build a proper policy for the country.  We have already employed some new people this year and will employ more.  The CER also has clearance to employ more staff.  It needs more staff to do this job for the community.</p><p>The Deputy queried the component costs of energy prices.  The carbon price has reduced across the board.</p></speech>

Last year, under the Government stimulus programme, we got additional funding of the order of &euro;30 million for 2014, which we put to very good use.  That one-off stimulus of &euro;30 million is gone, and even though we got an additional &euro;10 million, if I am not mistaken, the provision shows a net drop of &euro;20 million on last year's figures.  If the Deputy is asking me whether I think the better energy programmes and all the SEAI project work is important, I can tell him, yes, it is critically important that people's homes, businesses and public building are energy efficient.  As public representatives we need to ensure that we render public and private buildings energy efficient so that the cost of energy will decrease in the future.  We should not, as the adage goes, be putting the coal up the chimney.  We need to ensure we reduce dependence not only on imported fossil fuels but on all energy sources.  We should think about reducing energy consumption.  The energy companies might not necessarily like to hear us say that.  We want a growing economy, but we want to try to ensure we decrease our use of energy where we can.</p></speech>

When will the new planning guidelines for wind turbines come into force?  Families have been very distressed by the granting of planning permission for these turbines.  It is causing major problems.</p> <p>  There are people who propose to generate energy - who have made their application to join the national grid and are in line to do so - who are not progressing their projects, yet they are holding their positions in the queue.  Is there a case for setting conditions for applications to join the national grid such that the applicant must show that he or she has the money to complete the project within an agreed timeframe?  The present arrangement is akin to bed blocking in hospitals, as it blocks new entrants.</p> <p>  I have talked to people in Bord na M&oacute;na about growing willow and other crops for biomass.  The reality is that our timber industry cannot produce enough trees to supply the sawmills, not to mind using them for something else.</p> <p>  The price of electricity is very important.  Other countries can produce electricity more cheaply than Ireland, but they have moved away from wind energy, while we are subsidising it.  Has the Minister a roadmap for bringing down the price of electricity to ensure our economy is more competitive, which will help businesses to create more jobs?  Let me be clear: I do not buy into paying levies to subsidise energy production that is costing us jobs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.1010" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR62015021100002#G00900"><p>My first point will not endear me to the Deputy, but to achieve the targets that we regard as important, in order to decarbonise our economy, irrespective of which energy sources we use to replace it, there will be a cost.  It will not be possible to do it for nothing.  The approach we have taken is to do it through refit incentives and support schemes.  The Deputy is correct if he is saying that we should be vigilant and careful to ensure that the policy mix is right and that if we get to a stage at which the supports for one particular energy source are no longer justified, we should switch from that.  Of course that is right.  Let me sound a note of caution: in order to achieve our objectives, there will be a cost.  The question is who will bear it.  Will it be the Exchequer, the consumer or the business?  It may not be a long-term cost and it may taper off at a certain stage when we have reduced our dependence on fossil fuels permanently, but there will continue to be a cost.</p> <p>  To address the Deputy's question on comparators for Ireland, let me draw his attention to a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators in January 2015, which noted that for 2012 Ireland had an average electricity support, per unit of gross electricity produced, of &euro;2.03 per megawatt, versus an average across the 22 countries assessed of &euro;13.68 per megawatt.  Only two countries, Finland and Norway, had lower supports than Ireland.  It is important to put the issues in context.  People say that other countries are turning away from generating wind energy, but no two countries in Europe are exactly the same.  Some have done more and others have done a lot less in terms of wind energy.  What is required is a mix.  If we move away from one source, we must think of what we are replacing it with.  Each and every source of energy has an issue.  The Deputy mentioned biomass, and if I am interpreting him correctly, he said the sheer quantity of timber required was enormous.  That is an obstacle to the bigger picture for biomass.  Some of the other inputs are easier to advance through Government policy.  We have to be conscious that the Drax power station type model requires enormous inputs of wood, and that is an issue with biomass.  We have already touched on the issues that arise from wind energy.  I would like to see solar energy advancing, but there are obstacles and issues with each and every replacement source of energy. </p> <p>   Deputy Fitzmaurice asked two questions about the national grid.  First, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to issue guidelines, but obviously my officials and I have been in contact with the Minister, Deputy Kelly, and his officials, as well as the SEAI, and we are looking at the review of wind energy guidelines in respect of noise, proximity and shadow flicker.  It is proposed to update the relevant sections of the existing guidelines on each of these specific issues.  A number of technical appendices will be developed to assist planning authorities on noise assessment, monitoring and the setting of planning conditions.  Draft guidelines, as the Deputies will be aware, were published in December 2013 for public consultation.  After deep consideration of the various submissions and the modelling that arises from that, the revisions to the guidelines that the Deputy asked me about will be finalised and will be issued to planning authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act.  I believe that will be done in the early part of 2015, although I cannot give the Deputy a precise date.  Ultimately, it is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></speech>

If we are to use fossil fuels, which is the case for some, we could reduce the amount by as much as 70% or 80% by using solid fuel stoves.  As far as I am aware, no grant assistance is available for this.  At least, that was the case the last time I asked.  The idea could be explored and many would opt for it.  It does not involve a major system conversion; it is just a case of installing a stove where there is a fireplace.  It could be a major help.</p></speech>

It is in the process of being carried out and due for publication, possibly in mid-2016.  On the question of how much it will cost, we have in mind a figure in the order of &euro;1 million.  Importantly, the consultation process did not just consider the potential environmental health impact but also the human health impact.  Many of the submissions received, including from Deputy Michael Colreavy's part of the world in counties Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan, asked for there to be someone on the group with a health competency.  I am delighted that there is someone on it with that expertise, as the survey's two major pillars will be to consider the environmental and health impacts.</p> <p>  Stemming from a number of public meetings that we held in Sligo last summer, I also asked for some feedback during the process, instead of having to wait two years for the results.  I am delighted that there is a dedicated information-sharing website.  We will be able to furnish the Deputy with the details.  I am also hoping for a mid-term review to be carried out in whatever form in a couple of weeks time.</p> <p>  Regarding petroleum, a number of initiatives are ongoing.  The Department's expenditure is on promotion because we need to get companies interested.  Thankfully, there is momentum within the industry, given the new Atlantic licensing round that will close in 2015.  We will not be in a position to say how real the momentum is until the close of the round on the Atlantic margins, but the feedback from companies has been steady.  After decades, there have only been four finds, but we must consider the geography of what is available to us.  In a European perspective, Ireland is the fourth largest country if the undersea landmass off the south and south-west coasts is included.  Ireland is larger than Germany, although not as large as Portugal, France and Spain.  The Department is focusing a great deal of its energy on this front, particularly via the Geological Survey of Ireland and the INFOMAR project.  The large amount of research involved is being undertaken at considerable expense.  There is a partnership between the Government and industry, with the main tenets being transparency, openness and accountability, but the undersea landmass available to us has resource potential.</p> <p>  Reverting to the contribution of unconventional systems of extraction and exploration on land and without undermining the independence of the EPA-sponsored analysis, we have a great deal of territory under the sea that can be explored.  Obviously, it will depend on companies' exploratory finds.  The Minister has specific responsibility for the Corrib field.  I hope the first gas supply will start towards the end of the second quarter of this year.  In terms of our reliance on fossil fuels, we import 100% of our oil and 95% of our gas.  With the new Corrib gas supply coming on stream in mid-2015, we could meet as much as 42% of our own gas needs.</p></speech>

How close are the communications between us and the Northern Ireland authorities?  The pace of developments in Antrim does not seem to take into account the fact that the EPA is conducting a study in the South and that a report will issue in mid-2016.

The committee is the mechanism by which the information is being gathered.  The Northern Irish representatives will have the same access to information as their Southern counterparts during the process.  North-South political mechanisms allow Ministers from both jurisdictions opportunities to examine genuine and single-tier North-South issues affecting Border areas.</p><p>There is an opportunity for the North-South Ministerial Council to be kept informed throughout this process.  It will also be an opportunity for politicians, both North and South, to actively engage during the process.  Closer to home, as a former chairman, I think there are possibilities available through the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I have spoken to my colleague, Deputy Frank Feighan, about this.  We have representation North and South, albeit reduced to one or two political parties.  We do not have global political representation from the North.  However, there is a conduit and a mechanism for North-South input.  With an issue as important as fracking, we should use all the political mechanisms we have available to us.  If Deputy Colreavy was to formally put it to his party colleagues to get in touch with Deputy Feighan, I have no doubt Deputy Feighan would be eager to help and assist in the matter.  </p></speech>

Remedial works were to be carried out there to solve the problems.  However, there seems to be a huge delay.  Is there a strategy in place for when these problems occur?  Why are there delays in carrying out these works?  This issue is very important for people involved in fishing in the tourism sector.  Why is it held up?  Is there a body which should be controlling it and moving it along rapidly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-11a.1029" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/997" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TR62015021100002#J00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the role of the officials within my Department.  They have been extremely proactive and this has been in response to the genuine proactivity at a local level.  Local councillors, Deputies and the local community's swift response on the clams issue in Lanesborough has been positive and has helped the process.  Do my section and Department have statutory functions with regard to moving forward the whole issue of the invasive species?  No, they do not.  However, with that in mind, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of my officials because they have responded to my request to show leadership and to take responsibility in terms of leading on this, which has happened.</p> <p>  There was an agreement prior to Christmas.  There have been EPA issues and there has been a lot of contact with Inland Waterways and the local authorities.  There has been a whole mix of collaboration to try to get a pilot dredge and there was pressure on to do this before Christmas.  We got agreement in principle before Christmas to do the dredge.  The only thing holding this up at the moment is water levels.  The advice is that to do it right the job should be done at lower water levels and we are following this advice.  The pilot dredge has been agreed, but we are waiting on the water levels to move to a more satisfactory position in the interests of doing the job right rather than making a half-job of it.</p> <p>  To reiterate, my officials in Inland Fisheries have been very proactive on this.  It is an example of community engagement.  There is a sense of frustration at a local level.  There are fears at a local level also, which were taken into account.  Can these invasive clams be eradicated fully?  The advice I have been given is that they cannot, but we need to focus on containment and ensure that we dispose of them in a proper way.  We need to ensure that we do not have fishermen using boats and gear that might transfer the clams to other areas.  These are good-practice issues.  We are working with Inland Waterways on these and the use of smaller boats and containment.</p></speech>

I understand a report is coming out in 2015.  If a report is due in May or June, certain information should be available at this stage.  What is it looking like?  Will a certain amount of eel fishing be allowed?  What is the Minister of State's view on this?</p></speech>

As a person born in the north-west of Donegal and on the coast, I would not have had much familiarity with it before being appointed to this post.  However, I have had quite a good briefing on the issue and I have learned a lot.  We have had a number of delegations from people who fished eels in the past.  There is a problem with stock levels.  However, there is also a role for the ESB, which I have contacted formally.  We need to sit down and examine how we can-----</p></speech>

There is a problem with the stocks and the life cycle.  It is a long-term life cycle.  We are also hearing reports of different examples, such as what is happening in Lough Neagh.  We are examining other practices surrounding the fishing of eels.  The eel fisherpeople would have been the custodians of the stock.  I would like to see the custodians more involved in the consultation.  There is an upcoming consultation, and I would not like it to be seen as a token gesture.  A number of delegations have come forward with a number of good ideas.  I would like to follow through on those.</p></speech>

The Wild Atlantic Way has done a massive amount for the coast.  There are a couple of things I wish to mention.  Some of the Leader companies did a power of work on the life project in conjunction with the Department and the European Union.  They did a pile of cleaning up of rivers and enhancing inland fisheries.  The Department should take a more proactive role.  Inland fisheries appears to be the last thing to be looked at.  There is a huge amount of goodwill and massive potential for tourism in places which would not normally be known for their tourism industry.</p> <p>  I have met many of the anglers and the people who have benefited from the LIFE project on their stretches of rivers.</p><p>They say that a huge tranche of money that was not used was sent back to the European Union.  It was never distributed through the Leader companies or even through the Department.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.  In the new tranche of funding that is due to come through from this year to 2020 or 2021 is there scope to move the LIFE project on in many of the inland fisheries and rivers that were untapped heretofore?  Why was the money sent back in the first instance?</p></speech>

Obviously, there are stocking challenges with brown trout and wild salmon and there are discussions and consultations taking place about management.  We could have a very wide debate about the constraints and the challenges, be it pollution, cormorants or seals, but we have a difficulty in terms of stocks.  At the same time there are very positive partnerships at community level.  I will cite one, which the Deputy alluded to, on the River Lacken.  There has been a great partnership project there between the local development company and the people.  In fact, workers in the T&uacute;s programme came to work on the rehabilitation of spawning beds, looking at walkways and so forth.  This work must come from the community.  When I meet with members of the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland they talk about the pressures they are under in terms of fewer personnel, enforcement and being vigilant in monitoring, so the community, local angling clubs and the local groups in charge of the various rivers have a massive role in this regard.</p> <p>  On the question of money going back to Europe, many of these funding applications are demand led at community level.  We have a role to play through the new process under SICAP to encourage groups to get involved.  Certainly, there is a role for the Department in facilitating that as much as possible.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke about river beds, spawning and so forth and it is clear that a huge amount of work must be done.  Rivers have been overgrown inland, among other things.  It is a crying shame that money was sent back.  The Department, Inland Fisheries Ireland and everybody else involved should grasp this issue by the scruff of the neck and ensure that every cent that might come from Europe to enhance our inland fisheries is used.</p></speech>

Nobody wishes to send money back.  There was enthusiasm at the Inland Fisheries Ireland board meeting.  Many of the members would have been practitioners down the years.  There is potential and there are certain aims and objectives on which our Department can follow through.  I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion regarding information sharing for creating awareness.  Getting away from inland fisheries for a moment, even within the GSI section, where work is ongoing on the Tellus project, which is a mapping exercise looking at water tables and other information that will be shared with different local authorities, the EPA and so forth and on which an extra &euro;3 million will be spent this year, there is a job to be done in terms of creating awareness.  Although it is in the very early stages, in case the Secretary General and the Assistant Secretary General fall off their seats, we have just had a discussion on the possibility of bringing the work of the Department, be it on inland fisheries, GSI or in the petroleum division, to secondary schools to bring it to the attention of students.</p></speech>

Administration costs are up by 14% in 2015 in the salaries, wages and allowances.  We spoke earlier about the need for expert staff in the Department and for the regulator.  Are there additional plans to recruit?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct to raise it.  I am very keen on ensuring it happens, and we have clearance to do it.  For example, there is a need for petroleum exploration specialists and for senior telecommunications analysts and engineers in respect of the broadband roll-out we discussed.  We need a head of cyber security to lead in the protection of critical national infrastructure, and energy market analysts, a subject we also discussed earlier, to focus on both market and technology developments nationally and internationally.  To answer the Deputy's question, the first element relates to the recruitment of specialist staff.  The second element is that the increased allocation also includes moneys that must be made available owing to the fact that there are 27 fortnightly pay days in 2015, as opposed to the usual 26.  It is a quirk of the Roman calendar that we have 27 pay days in 2015.  Nobody gets any extra pay, unfortunately, but they get paid on an extra occasion this year.</p></speech>
