At a coming meeting the joint committee is also due to meet the National Women's Council of Ireland to discuss the issue of gender equality.  At this meeting we will focus on the quality of the indicators used as part of the pilot programme to measure the progress of each of six Departments, the process used to devise the indicators, the ways in which the pilot programme and the Revised Estimates Volume can be improved to help to encourage greater use of performance information during the Estimates process.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.

I have prepared a very short presentation to take the committee through the key points of the pilot programme, following which we will be happy to answer questions the committee may have about the equality budgeting initiative.</p> <p>  Our work in progressing the equality budgeting initiative flows from the commitment in the programme for Government to develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  There is also a commitment to ensure institutional arrangements are in place to support equality and gender proofing.  These commitments are reflected in the national strategy for women and girls 2017 to 2020.  Since last year we have been working to implement these commitments in a real and meaningful way.  In so doing we have engaged with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the National Women&rsquo;s Council which have been very helpful in guiding us in our approach. </p> <p>  Before I look in more detail at the pilot programme we have specifically adopted for this budgetary cycle, I want to highlight a few key principles that have underpinned our thinking and approach in this area.  We see equality budgeting as a tool that can provide us with greater information on the likely equality impacts of proposed or ongoing budgetary measures.  Greater visibility of such impacts enables us to better integrate equality concerns into the budgetary process.  It also enables the impacts of budgetary decisions to be subject to greater scrutiny.  In this way, we view equality budgeting as an important element of any well functioning budgetary system.  We do not view it as creating a separate and distinct budgetary process for specific equality measures; rather, it is about the equality impact of budgetary policy a whole.  From looking at international experience, countries that tend to do well in this area integrate equality budgeting into their existing budgetary framework.  That is something we have tried to replicate in our approach by anchoring the equality budgeting initiative in the existing performance budgeting framework in place.</p> <p>  Looking in further detail at the progress we have made so far, on budget day a policy paper entitled, Equality Budgeting: Proposed Next Steps in Ireland, was published.  I understand a copy of the paper was shared with committee members in advance of the meeting.  The paper looks at the international experience of equality budgeting, the existing mechanisms in place in Ireland to assess equality impacts and also the pilot programme for equality budgeting in operation this year.  Given the potential scale of equality budgeting, we  have decided, at least initially, to focus on the equality ground of gender.  From a practical perspective, this would be the most effective, as there is a wealth of international experience of gender budgeting and it is also an equality dimension for which a lot of disaggregated data are available.  Our intention is to learn from this approach and what we will do this year and then expand the initiative to other policy areas and equality dimensions in the future.</p> <p>  In advance of publication of the Revised Estimates we asked the six Departments participating in the pilot programme to conduct an assessment of their selected policy programme area for its impact on gender equality.  Following the assessment, they articulated a high level equality objective for the programme.  They then selected relevant performance indicators and targets which were set by the Department to enable us to track progress towards achieving the overall goal.</p><p>Following that assessment they articulated a high level equality objective for that programme.  They then selected relevant performance indicators and targets to enable us to track progress towards achieving the overall goal.  Progress towards achieving the targets will be reported on in the public service performance report. </p><p> The next slide gives an idea of the diversity of the programme areas that are included in the pilot initiative and the types of high level goals that have been articulated by Departments.  Six programme areas have been selected that cover a wide range of Government expenditure areas.  Each of the Departments has also published a number of performance indicators related to its objectives that will allow us to track progress towards achieving the equality goals.  Our intention is to learn from our experiences with these different programme areas this year with a view to expanding the initiative in future years. </p><p> In terms of the next steps, work is currently under way to prepare for the publication of the public service performance report.  Following on from the equality goals and indicators published in the Revised Estimates, the report will contain an update on the progress and steps that are being taken by Departments to work towards realising their objectives.  In order to guide our approach to the further development of the equality budgeting initiative we intend to establish an expert advisory group on equality budgeting.  The function of the group will be to take stock of progress to date and provide advice and guidance on the future roll-out and expansion of the equality budgeting initiative.  Alongside this we will also continue our work in supporting Departments participating in the initiative to develop the skills necessary to successfully equality proof policies. </p><p> That is an outline of the pilot approach so far and if members have any questions, we will be happy to respond.  </p></speech>

Deputy Calleary is first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-21a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018022100002#C00300"><p>I welcome the delegation which perfectly demonstrates equality and commend it on its work.  We have been talking about this issue in the abstract for quite a long time so to begin to see it in reality is quite interesting.  However, I am wondering about the choice of measures.  In terms of demonstrating the potential impact of equality budgeting, there may have been stronger measures and greater challenges to be presented to the participating Departments.  While female apprenticeship is really important, for example, access to education is even more important.  Barriers to both access and to education completion are crucial.  In terms of sport and given all of the controversies over the past 12 months involving the soccer team and the challenges faced by the Irish women's rugby team, the number of governing bodies supported by Sport Ireland's women in sport programme seems like a very weak measure in terms of addressing the actual challenges in the area of female participation in sport.  In fairness to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, it has taken on a very good high level goal.  Did the individual Departments pick those measures or did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform pick them?  What are the plans to advance this?  I am particularly interested in the measures under way in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  That is one of the Departments where an equality-budgeting analysis has the potential to have a deep impact and to address many of the challenges facing us.  The same is true of the Departments of Education and Skills and Health.  The measure chosen in the Department of Health is something to do with quitting smoking.  Again, while the objective of reducing the overall prevalence of smoking is very laudable and important, one would imagine that in the context of equality challenges there are other issues in health that would need that kind of analysis.</p> <p>  In summary, who made the choice in terms of the measures?  Did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at any stage challenge those choices and look for something deeper?  Where is this going?  Once the pilot is finished, where does the Department intend to bring this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-21a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018022100002#C00400"><p>I thank Deputy Calleary for his questions.  Certainly we would have high ambitions for the work under the equality budgeting initiative and would absolutely recognise the point the Deputy makes.  One hears a lot about equality budgeting and its importance and we all understand its significance and value in terms of the contribution it can make but one must ask what that refines down to in specific terms.  The indicators and objectives that have been chosen, from our perspective, represent a good cross-section of issues.  We are very happy with the engagement we have had from the relevant Departments.  The reality is that policy responsibility resides in those Departments and it is often the case that when we look at initiatives that relate to the expenditure framework, there is a somewhat legitimate view that it relates to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is our responsibility.  A good example of that is the issue of performance information.  We have engaged with this committee on that issue previously, flowing from the work of the OECD on budgetary scrutiny and parliamentary oversight of public spending with its focus on improving performance information.  What we have tried to do is integrate the equality budgeting initiative into that framework but the ownership issue is one upon which we must work with the Departments and we recognise that.</p> <p>  The specific indicators or objectives that are part of the initiative were developed over a relatively short period of time in advance of the budget.  As members know from previous meetings, we were working with organisations like the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC and the National Women's Council in 2017 in trying to scope out an approach.  When we finally decided on a way forward on this, it was only two or three months before budget day so we had to go to the Departments and ask them to come on board for this pilot initiative.  While we have been very clear that there is very significant learning available through the process that we have now established, it will need to step up significantly for us to be able to properly examine the contribution and value that it can add.  What we see as very important in that context is the role of an oversight or governance group with experts who can come in and give further momentum to the initiative going forward.  We did engage with the Departments on the objectives and as the Deputy has pointed out, the objective from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is a very significant one.  In terms of the Department of Health, we engaged with the chief medical officer and his team.  They thought that smoking reduction was a significant indicator but I take the Deputy's broader point that there are clearly much more significant equality issues to be addressed in the health and education systems.  </p></speech>

Smoking is one area, for example, where enormous progress has been made in the last number of years with both genders in terms of cutting down.  Something in the health area that addressed access to health treatments based on regional location or income, for example, would have been a better measure.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-21a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018022100002#C00700"><p>I do not doubt that but if this is to work the way we all believe it should, it must highlight the basic and fundamental equality issues in Departments.  Rather than looking at a specific stream in education, for example, we should be looking at access to education.  The various disadvantages faced by women, particularly by women who do not finish school, should have been the starting point before going on to examine apprenticeships, second level, third level education and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-21a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018022100002#C00800"><p>Yes, but the experts say that pilot schemes should have a relatively narrow application in the first instance.  Starting off, we also looked at this in terms of focusing on some of the bigger issues but it was brought home to us that this must be practical.  As Deputies will know from engagement with IHREC and the National Women's Council, people have talked around equality budgeting and gender budgeting for a long time but we must land at something that is meaningful and relevant in terms of the budgetary process and that is what we are seeking to do.  We are not making major claims for what we have done thus far and we are certainly not saying that we have reached the end of the road in any sense.  It is a starting point but an important one at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-21a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Swaine" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018022100002#C00900"><p>A key element to the success of the initiative is the availability of data and using that data to drive further interrogation.  A lot of the Departments may have had other goals in mind initially but they needed further time to scope out the availability of data or put in place systems to record the necessary data.  I do not think it precludes future rounds of this initiative having more ambitious goals in that respect.  It is important for the first round of the initiative that everybody is able to participate at the different stages and contribute the data that is being collected and for the goals that are currently in place, we will be able to do that.</p><p>Two Deputies are waiting to come in and I ask them to bear with me for one moment, as I do not normally do this.  I want to follow on directly from Deputy Calleary's question because it relates to something the committee has been looking at.  There is a high level target of 300 for apprenticeships.  There is very little information around that.  There are tangible things that are easily measurable.  Has the Department figures for things such as the number of overall apprenticeships, the total number of women taking up apprenticeships, what access is there for them to do so or what percentage of uptake would the Department wish to see?  In his response, Mr. Beausang said that it was a start and we could do more later but I suggest it was a very limited approach.  If any effort had been made at a high level, the Department could have looked at the percentage of women who were able to take up apprenticeships.  That does not begin to deal with all the other areas of education which were not touched on at all.  Something as simple as saying that there are, for instance, 10,000 apprenticeships and we would like 50% of those to be made available to women by a given date could be done.  Was any consideration given by anyone to including something like that as a high level target?</p></speech>

The list giving the number of apprentices registered on programmes is further up that page.  For 2017, it was 4,114 which puts the figure of less than 300 women apprentices in context.  It provides context where it sits in the Revised Estimates, including the level spending in the area and other indicators.  I take the point that it looks minimalist when extracted from the Estimates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-21a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018022100002#D00300"><p>That is part of setting a target.  Here we are in the context of the Revised Estimates, setting a particular equality objective agenda in an important area of further education and training.  In the policy area, a framework will have to be adjusted when that target is achieved.  That is the essence of accountability.  They have committed to that objective against the backdrop of where they stand.  It will require the Department of Education and Skill to do some very serious thinking about how to make apprenticeships more attractive to women and there is access to them, ensuring that there is a better gender balance.  I am sure is already happening in the Department and predated the equality budgeting initiative.</p> <p>  We are conscious that when a presentation is made about the equality budgeting initiative, it appears to fall on six measures and people can wonder what it is all about.  In fact, it is about driving a process of policy-proofing that must be undertaken by Departments and examining a range of issues that relate to how we ended up with such a gender imbalance in the take-up of apprenticeships.  The Department of Education and Skills will have to engage on a framework on that basis.  What we are seeing here is the end of the pipeline.  </p></speech>

In fairness to the Department of Education and Skills, this step-change in policy has taken place, because there was a review of the apprenticeship programme.   This examined expanding the programme to make some of the apprenticeships more attractive to different genders and age groups.  This process is having a knock-on effect, I just do not know if the high level indicators and objectives are being tied in with the policy at a high level in Departments.  I am not sure if it is a case of Departments having an indicator and wondering how they will arrive at policy answers in order to fulfil it.  I am unsure how much cohesion exists or the commitment that is there in the Departments to achieve their own goals.  Some Departments, such as Education and Skills, have done some policy work but others are not doing it.  Who is responsible?  Does it come down to the Minister in charge?  Is it the officials?  What role does the budget steering group have in driving the policy?  It would be useful to have the witnesses' comments on this.</p></speech>

It is also reflected in its implementation.  It relates to a programme for Government commitment.  The Department has long experience of this issue as we try to improve it.  It is reflected in the Parliamentary Budget Office's report today on the equality information on the budget documentation.  Over the years, the Department has done much work in trying to improve what we call the performance information.  Something that we see, and there is much international experience in this, is that if one is very clear about what individual spending programmes are meant to achieve - and perhaps in the past we have not been - it can have a significant effect on improving and enhancing those policies over time.  That is the mechanism we see working here.  Articulating these objectives in the context of the equality budgeting initiative drives change.  I will not sit here and claim that is across the board and that if one were to call to any random Department today and asked about the equality budgeting initiative that it would have much knowledge of understanding, but to be fair it is only a pilot at this point.  Given the political mandate for it, our role is to intensify and reinforce the process and, as the Deputy says, ensure that it has a knitted-in quality.</p> <p>  Looking at the Revised Estimates volume and performance information over the years, it is not meaningful for monitoring performance and holding people to account for their performance, or driving change in the implementation and design of public expenditure policy and spending programmes.  That is a challenge for those of us in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or when we work with colleagues in other Departments more generally around performance information to make information relevant and impactful.  On the equality budgeting initiative, we need to look in particular at the issues that have surfaced that the indicators relate to and ensure that change is taking place.  </p></speech>

Even in the area of apprenticeships, the Department has looked at expanding the programme and other apprenticeship programmes that would make it more attractive but we need further data on questions such as how many complete the apprenticeships or how many gain employment afterwards.  Having 300 people take up apprenticeships is not the same as having 300 people complete them and gain employment.  If the Department is really looking at equality proofing, it will need to go beyond the indicators that are currently set.  Is it the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's role to push the other Departments?  How much of that will fall back on the Departments themselves?  Can the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform go in and tell them the indicators or are the other Departments setting their own?</p></speech>

The answer to the Deputy's question is that it is a shared responsibility.  Given that the Department and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform have ownership of the equality budgeting initiative, as is reflected by our presence today, we are in the driving seat and seek to work with Departments with the benefits of external expertise that I spoke of to deepen the process.  The point Ms Swaine was making in the presentation was that we have a framework and a way of doing it which reflects best practice advice and experience in other jurisdictions.</p><p>We want to try to make it real and impactful in an Irish context.  However, the first step is to have the framework because, as I earlier stated, when one is dealing with the spectrum of poverty proofing, equality and gender budgeting, gender mainstreaming and so on it can all get very dense and theoretical and we are trying to boil it down and make it simple, clear and straightforward to drive the type of changes that Deputy O'Brien mentioned.</p></speech>

That had an application to the equality budgeting initiative but in conjunction with the advisory group we are setting up we will consider specifically tailored guidance for the equality budgeting indicators to assist Departments in selecting indicators.</p></speech>

The fundamental point is whether this was a political decision.  Although the six areas are somewhat valuable, what of apprenticeships?  There is a difficulty in getting both genders to undertake apprenticeships, which must change, given that the professions of qualified plumbers, carpenters and other tradespeople are among the most useful and important in society.  The authorities in the United Kingdom considered establishing degree-level apprenticeships in order that people would have the same level of qualifications whether they were economists, carpenters, doctors or members of another profession.  That would add value to apprenticeships and could be considered in terms of making them attractive to both genders.  Also of interest are the situations in regard to arts and sport.</p> <p>  Was a political decision behind the approach taken in this area?  If the members on this side of the table were asked to address the issue, we would identify the most glaring inequalities in budget expenditure and see what could be done to address them.  Social protection accounts for approximately a third of budget expenditure and there is still great discrimination in how it is distributed.  This morning, the Taoiseach engaged with Deputy Paul Murphy on job activation.  Women are discriminated against in job activation.  As regards housing, families headed by a lower-earning woman face all kinds of discrimination in the context of a desperate social and affordable housing deficit.  Would it not have been more useful and immediate to address the big political expenditure decisions for which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is also responsible?  I appreciate that steps in that direction are being taken.  I presume regard was had to the situations in the Basque country and Austria, which are of interest.  Some members met members of the Scottish Parliament last year and heard about a similar programme there.  Why was the other approach not taken?  Why did the Department not start by trying to remedy the really glaring inequalities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-21a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018022100002#E00400"><p>Our assessment, and possibly our instinct, was to walk before we run.  We consulted widely with experts.  Ms Swaine attended an OECD conference on gender budgeting and we took away lessons from other countries.  The lessons are not particularly reassuring in terms of the effectiveness of gender budgeting.  Many countries have engaged in gender and equality budgeting but whether that delivered the results for which people hoped is open to question.  Although I cannot recall the exact figures from the OECD survey, there was difficulty in identifying where an engagement with equality and gender budgeting generated clear change rather than shedding more light on issues such as those referred to by Deputy Broughan.</p> <p>  I do not wish to be defensive about the pilot programme but it has been of benefit.  The child care issue and the objective in that regard is very significant and relates very directly to more general economic policy because the maintenance and enhancement of our growth rate over time will be achieved by enhanced female labour force participation and child care is an important element of that.  The objective regarding the level of female recipients of Science Foundation Ireland research grants is a very important signal for women in terms of access to STEM courses and their participation in that area.</p> <p>  Data and the availability of data are huge issues, as mentioned by Ms Swaine, because although the equality budgeting initiative is being referred to as a new initiative, distributional analysis has been conducted on the budget for many years using the simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model, with which I am sure the Deputy is familiar.  It generates a significant amount of very useful information on the distribution impact of budget changes but there are many gaps and shortfalls in that information.  To try to build on and enhance the information available from SWITCH, the Department carried out social impact analysis whereby officials considered particular areas of public expenditure to try to form a baseline of information such that we have an understanding of the impacts of particular spending programmes on individuals and households.  In some instances, we found that the impacts were not very aligned with the initial objectives of the spending.  We are attempting to strengthen the general approach we take to these issues and the equality budgeting initiative is an important part of that.  We are not yet at a point of development whereby we can start embracing very substantial and significant issues that might have gender equality implications because we do not have the tools or data to do so, nor the experience of how to progress from an understanding of what these gender and equality issues are to how to change policy to address them.  At a certain level, what we are trying to do and the process we have described today is the easy part.  The difficult part is the change driven from a better understanding of a particular spending area.</p></speech>

I note that a point made in the papers we have been given or in one of the witnesses' contributions is that in terms of cost-benefit analysis it is a huge positive for a country to deal with these issues and ensure that we get the input of all citizens, and that is the case in terms of GDP or GNI or whatever it is now called.  Has the Department done any costings on benefits of the programmes in the six areas?</p></speech>

From the perspective of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, that is an important backdrop to what we are trying to achieve in this area, given the importance of the macroeconomic framework in generating the resources for public spending,.</p></speech>

It was adopted into the country's constitution in 2012 and has been up and running in practice since 2013.  It also adopted a performance budgeting framework at the same time.  It brought both in together.  Again, they are still in the early stages of development.  The OECD is just concluding a review of that model and it will be advising on a few of its pitfalls.  We will be looking to that piece of work with interest in order to incorporate it into our own learning.  Austria, Iceland and the Nordic countries tend to fare quite well in this area.</p></speech>

It is now mandated that every expenditure programme or line Ministry needs to have five high-level objectives, one of which must be gender related.  There is huge diversity in the types of objectives across the system in Austria, but it is part of its regular budgetary process.  It is something we are trying to mirror and integrate into our regular documentation such as the Revised Estimates and performance report.

It is a similar approach to that which we have adopted here.  It is not limited to one objective, but that tends to be the case.  That then flows downward to a number of indicators.  It is included in the strategy statement of the Department itself and informs its work programme.  It also filters upwards to parliamentary scrutiny.  That is how Austria has approached it and we are learning from it.  Many of the countries working in this area are still at an early stage of development and are learning from each other.  There is an OECD group on gender mainstreaming and budgeting.  It had its inaugural meeting last year and will meet on an annual basis to share learning.</p></speech>

The way I look at it, there are a couple of things involved.  On ownership of the whole thing, there were some initial comments made about departmental ownership.  I very much welcome the decision of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, on this and his implementation of the pilot programme.  I would strongly suggest that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform grabs this by the scruff of the neck, as it would in many other areas, and sayS that it wants to drive this as an integral part of its work and to have ownership of how it will work right across all areas of Government.  It cannot be left to departmental ownership.</p> <p>  The second thing is that few good things come out of a recession and a collapsed economy, but there is one small thing which can be looked at in this area.  Things are now getting better and money is coming into the system.  Fresh money has been made available.  Consideration of gender should be hugely important when looking at that money and where it is focused in terms of the programmes and funding commitments to future programmes.  It is not a situation of pulling money back from somebody else, but of looking at and pushing key areas in terms of future balance.  I accept that it is a pilot programme and that there is headline stuff in it but someone mentioned walking before one can run in this area.  This is more strolling than walking.  It is very limited.  Even as a pilot it does not give us enough in this area on which we should be really focusing.  </p> <p>  To put an example to the witnesses, we might consider the area of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, and encouraging women into it.  Part of that work is obviously linked to education, schools, and access to STEM for women at second level - particularly in respect of providing courses in single-gender female schools.  There is no point thinking about that in an abstract manner at one particular level.  That is an example of where there must be an overarching view, because two or three Departments could cross each other on this.  There is no point in one Department teeing up a target if it is not being supported downstream.  </p> <p>  In one of the more positive examples, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs key indicators really do address some of those issues I and some of the other members have raised.  For example, if one is talking about women's involvement in the workplace, an associated key indicator is crucial.  In the case of some of the other Departments the approach is just too abstract.  The approaches give some interesting information but I do not see how they give us the policy change, or even the start of it, through this pilot programme.  I do not know which of the witnesses would like to respond to my comments.</p></speech>

The Minister announced it in the budget and it is a commitment in the programme for Government.  Significant Department of Public Expenditure and Reform resources have been committed to moving forward on equality budgeting, as reflected in the work which has been done.  In all elements of the Department's activities we come to a point where we have to collaborate and co-operate because we do not have responsibility for other Departments' policies.  It would be naive of us to think that we can drive changes in them.  We hope that we can drive change in policy through the framework.  I take the point the Chairman is making on ownership.  We are focused on ensuring that there is a clear direction to this work led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<br/><br/>The point the Chairman made on the availability of resources is, of course, very important.  As the Chairman will know, the Minister has consistently focused on the whole stock of resources out there.  In the context of the kind of work being done in the Department at the moment in the second year of the spending review, ensuring that resources are devoted to priorities which are impactful, effective and efficient is a big priority for the Department.  Gender and gender equality objectives are part of that.</p></speech>

I refer members to the circulated list of amendments which have been grouped for the purposes of debate.</p></speech>

I said it would impose an unnecessary burden on SMEs at a time when we should be doing everything we could to help them by reducing regulation and red tape.  I also said it was unfair on the auditors of small companies to have to perform audits of companies that were almost too small to audit in the first instance.  Many of them have only one or two members of staff.  The loss of the exemption will also apply where a company misses an annual return deadline with the Companies Registration Office where, for example, a director suffers a serious illness or there is a death in the family.  These are issues that come up every day of the week and challenges faced by small companies.</p> <p>  During the debate on Second Stage Deputies also received communications from some of the accountancy bodies outlining some of their concerns about the legislation.  I am concerned about section 9 on the basis of what has been said.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the fact that the accountancy bodies perceive the proposed changes as a misuse of the audit function.  They argue that we will be out of step with the rest of the European Union and that the changes will impose an additional administrative burden on the SME sector.  They also point out that the cost of going to the High Court will be prohibitive for most small companies and will overly penalise them in their day to day functioning.  It is on that basis that Fianna F&aacute;il is opposing sections 9 and 10.</p></speech>

During the debate on Second Stage I promised to consider the points made on the issue both during the debate and in representations I had received directly since the Bill had been published.  Clearly, there are legitimate concerns where a company finds itself unable to file on time, but we should be able to find a way to address some of them.  However, any way forward must also ensure the interests of third parties will be protected and not undermined by reduced transparency.</p> <p>  One aspect that strikes me is the way in which the loss of the audit exemption is applied in law.  The position could be improved.  In particular, the costs involved and burden imposed could be reduced by changing the years to which it applies.  Currently, there is a need to go back in time, but the accounting and audit profession has made representations to the Department, as recently as this week, to the effect that making the audit more contemporary would save time and reduce costs.  I intend to bring forward proposals on Report Stage for the introduction of measures to reduce the cost and lessen the impact of some of the more burdensome aspects of losing the audit exemption.  I am also looking at ways by which we could further streamline the annual filing process.  There may be scope to reduce or change the steps associated with filing such that there would be fewer reasons for a company to file late.  I intend to consider amendments that would simplify the filing process and hope to be able to bring them forward on Report Stage.</p> <p>  In summary, we are looking at removing the requirement to make an application to the District Court.  Companies will be allowed to file late, but they will lose their audit exemption and will have to have their accounts audited.  However, audits will take place for the current and following year, which will remove the necessity to file documents for an historical audit.  Companies have 28 days in which to file and a further 28 days in which to make a subsequent filing.  We may change that figure and give companies 56 days in which to file their final statements and annual return.  That is what I am hoping to bring forward on Report Stage, having considered what the Deputy has said.  I hope that is acceptable to him.</p></speech>

There are three types of such an agreement, as provided for in sections 33, 35 and 45 .  Section 33 provides that the IAASA may enter into such agreements with a prescribed accountancy body or a recognised accountancy body.  These are agreements to settle cases of non-compliance by a body in respect of the application of the disciplinary process by a prescribed accountancy body and how a recognised accountancy body is performing the audit oversight tasks for which it is responsible.  Section 35 provides that the IAASA may enter into such agreements directly with a member of a prescribed accountancy body, a statutory auditor or an audit firm.  These are agreements to settle cases of breaches of the standards of a prescribed accountancy body or of the rules governing statutory audit.  Section 45 provides that the Director of Corporate Enforcement may enter into such an agreement with a director of a public interest entity where that director has contributed to a breach of the rules of statutory audit by a statutory auditor or audit firm.</p><p> All these agreements share some characteristics.  For a start, the terms of this type of agreement are binding on the IAASA or the Director of Corporate Enforcement on the one hand and on the accountancy body, auditor or director concerned on the other.  They may include sanctions, such as a financial penalty.  Depending on the circumstances, an agreement may be entered into without an investigation or inquiry having first been initiated.  They are at the absolute discretion of the parties concerned.  The IAASA or the director, as appropriate, shall publish the details of any agreement on its website as soon as is practicable.  The purpose of these agreements is to avoid lengthy and costly proceedings while ensuring the appropriate regulatory outcomes.</p><p> The purpose of amendments Nos. 3, 7 and 18 is to clarify that these agreements may be reached without the need to initiate an inquiry under section 933, or an investigation under section 934 or an investigation under Part 15 of the Companies Act 2014, as appropriate.  Amendments Nos. 4, 8 and 19 clarify that while the terms of these agreements may include the imposition of sanctions and the payment of costs, they are not limited to these terms.  Amendments Nos. 5, 9 and 20 are purely technical to allow for amendments Nos. 6, 10 and 21, respectively.  Amendments Nos. 6, 10 and 21 clarify that this type of agreement does not require the confirmation of the court, as provided for in section 941 of the Companies Act 2014 and in new section 957I, which is inserted by this Bill.  This is because the agreements are at the absolute discretion of both parties to them.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 21 also insert new subsections into sections 934E and 957E, respectively, to the effect that the IAASA or the Director of Corporate Enforcement, as appropriate, shall publish the details of these agreements on its website as soon as practicable.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 13 is purely technical to permit amendment No. 14 to be made.  Amendment No. 14 inserts five new subsections into the new section 936B which is concerned with the matters that the IAASA must communicate to the CEAOB.  The EU audit directive requires the IAASA to communicate immediately to the CEAOB certain sanctions imposed on statutory auditors or audit firms or directors of public interest entities.  As some of these sanctions may have been imposed by the recognised accountancy bodies, the IAASA will rely on those bodies for this information.</p><p>Accordingly, amendment No. 14 inserts a new subsection (3) to clarify that a recognised accountancy body must inform the IAASA immediately of any temporary prohibition imposed by it on a statutory auditor or audit firm that prohibits it from carrying out audits or signing audit reports, and from performing functions in audit firms or public interest entities.  Amendment No. 14 also inserts a new subsection (4) which clarifies that there is a similar obligation on the IAASA to submit this information onwards to the CEAOB immediately.  As well as this urgent type of information, the EU audit directive also requires the IAASA to provide aggregated information annually on all sanctions and measures imposed under the EU audit directive for publication in the CEAOB&rsquo;s annual report.  This amendment therefore  inserts a new subsection (5) to clarify that a recognised accountancy body must also give the IAASA annually all such equivalent sanctions and measures it has imposed.  Similarly, the amendment inserts a new subsection (6) which clarifies that there is a like obligation on the IAASA to submit this information onwards to the CEAOB as soon as may be.  Finally, the amendment inserts a new subsection (7) to clarify that with regard to sanctions in the case of the recognised accountancy bodies, these are the sanctions imposed by them on statutory auditors who are members of that body or in respect of whom the body has been designated oversight functions.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 is technical and related.  It inserts a cross reference to the EU directive to clarify that the obligation on recognised accountancy bodies to ensure that they can impose penalties on auditors includes the imposition of these temporary prohibitions as provided for in Article 30a(1)(c) and (e) of the directive.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 17 clarifies that the Director of Corporate Enforcement must inform the IAASA immediately of any sanction imposed on a director which prohibits the director from performing functions in audit firms or public interest entities.  This is because the IAASA has a corresponding obligation to inform the EU Committee of European Audit Oversight Bodies immediately of all such sanctions.</p></speech>

Both the EU audit directive and regulation refer to &quot;sanctions and measures&quot;. However, some of the provisions of this Bill refer to &quot;penalty&quot;&rsquo;.  Accordingly, this amendment inserts a new definition for &quot;penalty&quot;&rsquo; to clarify that it includes a &quot;sanction&quot; and a &quot;measure&quot;.</p><p>As we are speaking on section 51, I would like to signal that I may be tabling further amendments to this section on Report Stage.

While the Bill was published in November 2017, I am still receiving some comments of a technical nature with regard to the contents of this section.  Furthermore, due to the fact that we are working within the context of the Companies Act, it may be necessary to make adjustments to other Parts of the Act to take account of this new Part.  For example, there seems to be a need to ensure that there is consistency in the terminology here with that in Part 6 of the Act.  In some places the Bill speaks of &quot;consolidated financial statements&quot; while in others it uses the term &quot;group accounts&quot;.</p><p>I will bring forward any further necessary amendments on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 25 is intended to clarify the text of section 1504.  As required under Article 24 of the EU audit regulation, the IAASA has direct responsibility for quality assurance inspections of audits of public interest entities by statutory auditors and audit firms, investigations into statutory auditors and audit firms arising from these inspections, and sanctions on statutory auditors and audit firms of public interest entities.</p><p>A recognised accountancy body may wish to undertake an investigation into the audit of a public interest entity by a statutory auditor or audit firm that is a member of the body itself.

It also provides that in such a case the IAASA may impose a sanction on the statutory auditor or audit firm of the public interest entity having considered all the facts of the case.</p><p>This amendment inserts a new subsection (9) and provides that, prior to undertaking such an investigation, the body must in the first instance seek the consent of the IAASA and shall not commence and investigation until it has consent from the IAASA to do so.</p></speech>

Section 1529 provides that the auditor of a public interest entity prepares a report that is additional to the usual audit report.  This &quot;additional report&quot; is submitted to the audit committee and directors of the entity and its purpose is to give greater detail on the audit.  The contents of this additional report are set out in Article 11 of the audit regulation.  The report must include, for example, descriptions of the scope and timing of the audit, methodologies used and judgements made in the course of carrying out the audit.</p><p>Section 1529 goes on to exercise a member state option at Article 11.1 of the EU directive which permits the audit committee to disclose the additional report to such third parties as specified in national law.  There are six bodies set out in this section who may request this report.  They are the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners, Director of Corporate Enforcement, the IAASA, the Workplace Relations Commission and any body responsible for the regulation of a public interest entity.</p><p>This amendment clarifies that the additional report &quot;shall&quot; be disclosed by the audit committee of a public interest entity to certain public bodies on request.

Article 12 of the EU audit regulation places an obligation on statutory auditors of public interest entities to report certain information where they become aware of it while carrying out an audit of the entity.  The information is concerned with a material breach of the laws, regulations or administrative provisions which lay down, where appropriate, the conditions governing authorisation or which specifically govern pursuit of the activities of such public interest entities, a material threat or doubt concerning the continuous functioning of the public interest entity, and a refusal to issue an audit opinion on the financial statements or the issuing of an adverse or qualified opinion.</p><p>There is also an option at Article 12.1 that permits member states to request additional information from statutory auditors or audit firms of public interest entities provided it is necessary for effective financial market supervision as provided for in national law.  As indicated to Deputies in the briefing on the Bill, the Government intends to exercise this option.  Accordingly, amendment No. 27 inserts a provision to state that the Central Bank is the authority that can request this information from a statutory auditor or audit firm.</p></speech>

The subsection is proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 29 which is a clarification.  Section 51 inserts a new section 1573 which is concerned with the registration of third country auditors and third country audit entities.  Those third country auditors and third country audit entities whose country's oversight systems have been deemed to be equivalent by the European Commission will be required to have their details included in the public register of auditors held by the Registrar of Companies.  These auditors will be able to perform audits of certain undertakings incorporated in third countries, the transferable securities of which are admitted to trading on the Stock Exchange in Ireland.  The details of the third country auditors and third country audit entities whose country's oversight systems are deemed to be in a transitional period by the European Commission will not be required to be included in the public register but will be made public by means of the IAASA's website.

We are joined by Mr. Dave Coleman, solicitor with Coleman Legal Partners, Mr. Eilis Barry and Mr. Paul Joyce from FLAC, and Dr. Joanne Blennerhassett of the Sutherland School of Law, UCD.  We are also joined in the Visitors' Gallery by Mr. Paddy Coleman and Ms Kelley Monks from Coleman Legal Partners, and by Ms Caroline Smith and Ms Ali Williams of FLAC.  I welcome them all warmly.  It is only appropriate that I apologise because the commencement time indicated was a little earlier than we could cope with.  We have been talking to our support team about that and we hope the problem will not recur.  I hope the coffee was up to standard.</p><p>The format of the meeting is that I will first ask Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to address the committee on the Bill, and we will then hear opening statements from our witnesses.  We will then open up the discussion so members may ask questions and make contributions.</p><p>Under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na daoine at&aacute; tagtha isteach chun labhairt faoin Bhille seo.</p> <p>  I thank the guests for their patience and for coming here to discuss what I believe is potentially very significant legislation.  I have circulated an opening statement and I will try to get through it briefly.  The references to specific sections are just an aid to members.</p> <p>  The Bill has been proposed by me and Deputy Pearse Doherty.  The ability to bring about litigation of the kind alluded to in the legislation would be of very significant value to a wide variety of potential applicants.  It could increase access to justice significantly and open up avenues that did not exist previously for many affected by particular injuries and injustices.  In the first instance, I will note that there are forms of group litigation already in Ireland, but none of the kind proposed, and that all have some deficiencies.  In particular, the representative case model provides only injunctive and declaratory relief.  It is not possible to seek damages, which is a major deficiency.</p> <p>  An model on which our witnesses are likely to have considerable knowledge is the test-case model.  The option for persons involved is for a test case to proceed and related cases to follow subsequently on the basis of that precedent.  This is a real route that can realise damages and other remedies, and it has been used extensively in Irish courts.  This model has significant drawbacks, however.</p><p>Most significant, the person taking a test case faces the very significant consideration of costs being awarded against them and being liable for that amount on their own.  This is a disincentive to taking any case, particularly people who may be on limited incomes or dealing with debt already, such as someone in mortgage arrears.</p><p> The issue of legal representation and duplication of legal costs is also relevant.  It also means that the person taking the case has no direct responsibility to others in the same or similar situations and those persons do not have to be notified.  It is essentially a single case on a single set of facts, even if the Judiciary has creatively and pragmatically used the model to deal with groups of cases.  It is also not possible to calculate the potential overall liability of all cases in the class of cases under this model.  This is not ideal for plaintiff or defendant.</p><p> The Law Reform Commission, LRC, paper on which this Bill is based states, &ldquo;The test case approach encourages, even if it does not validate, the multiplication rather than the division of costs for the generic issue among the members of the group."  There is clearly a real need for such legislation.  It can, I believe, be of huge benefit to our legal system and to many citizens.  I am looking forward to engaging with this session to see how we can improve it and amend it.  I hope that this will be an evolving process.  I wish to say that I am very open to suggestions and amendments, not only from my colleagues on the Committee on Justice and Equality but also from the expert witnesses.</p><p> I want to offer some brief observations on the submissions I have received.  I was going to address some of the criticisms levelled by the Government during Second Stage, but I believe the submissions by Dr. Blennerhassett and by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, address quite a number of those criticisms.  An issue about costs was raised by both Dr. Blennerhassett and FLAC.  I would be supportive of the idea of civil legal aid in principle, and I did note the draft Bill in the LRC paper.  However, as that would involve a charge on the Exchequer, it would not be possible for me, as an Opposition spokesperson, to have included that in the Bill and to move it.  It is certainly something to which I am very open.  Dr. Blennerhassett raises some very interesting points in her submission on changes to the manner in which costs are decided, especially where costs follow the event and in terms of conditional fee arrangements.  I would be interested in learning more about that.</p><p> A point was made in both the debate and in some of the submissions about tracker mortgages, and I note that Dr. Blennerhassett has identified that it could be complicated and that there may be better routes, although FLAC has submitted that it could be a viable route to seeking redress.  In any event, I have instanced that to a large extent as an example rather than necessarily the only circumstances in which it would be relevant.  There is a significant amount of discussion of other remedies, for example, alternative dispute resolution and ombudsman and regulatory redress.  They are areas of interest.  I also note that the civil law review will not consider those.  I would be open to hearing more about those solutions, but ultimately a route such as this legal route will be necessary.  There are also points concerning settlement, and I am open to views on that.  Dr. Blennerhassett makes the point well that tensions and differing expectations are inevitable within a group and that it may be necessary for a judge or regulator to approve a settlement.  Again, this is an area that I am open to considering further.  A point is also made about existing cases, and I am willing to take on board that it may well be the case that retrospection could be a difficulty, but that is a matter that we can discuss further.</p><p> Dr. Coleman's submission contains very interesting proposals.  I am particularly open to the idea that the register should predate the proceedings on the basis of cost reduction, and we can explore that further, and also the proposed redrafting of the points made on costs which relates to section 9.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the submissions and views of members.  I might ask Deputy Pearse Doherty to make a brief comment on the Bill in general before we open the discussion.</p></speech>

I am glad that we are the stage of pre-legislative scrutiny, and I hope that this will proceed throughout the parliamentary process here and that it is not frustrated through the need for money messages or otherwise during its passage.</p> <p>  It is 13 years since the Law Reform Commission's report on multi-party action legislation.  It is clear that we are not the only outlier in the European Union, but compared with our peers, we are an outlier in not providing this type of course of action to litigants.  I was prompted to look into the issue because of the tracker mortgage scandal, where victim after victim was left to argue and wonder if they had another kind of course of redress through the courts whereby they were able to take on the Goliaths of the financial institutions to get them to address the difficulties and the challenges they faced after having lost so much money as a result of the tracker mortgage scandal.  Their own personal assets were put on the line.  In those circumstances many wondered if they could have looked at a class action, multi-party type of suit.  When we scrutinised that issue, we found that the Law Reform Commission had indeed recommended this back in 2005.</p> <p>  I am delighted that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has taken the time to pen this legislation based on those recommendations at the time and that the D&aacute;il has passed that legislation to this Stage.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of the witnesses.</p></speech>

We are also grateful to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for giving detailed consideration to this access to justice issue, and we would like to stress that FLAC is very happy to provide any assistance it can to the committee on this and other issues.  We have submitted quite a number of detailed documents setting out the work of FLAC and its experience of multi-party actions, especially in the area of the implementation of the social welfare equal treatment directive and the recent collective complaint to the Council of Europe.  I do not intend to reiterate what is already before the committee.</p> <p>  While FLAC welcomes the Bill, our biggest concern at the moment is that there is no legal aid for multi-party litigation.  That needs to be addressed to make the Bill effective, particularly for people on low incomes or potential claimants whose potential damage may be just too low for a private firm to take on the risk.  The Bill clearly envisages that proceedings should be issued, and I welcome the suggestion that it may be possible to amend that to have a register.  Even if it was the case that a person could join the proceedings by simply joining the register, that person will still need legal advice as to whether he or she should or should not.  It is a critical issue that legal aid and legal advice would be available.</p> <p>  The LRC in its report addressed this issue in annex B with a very simple amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Act which provides that multi-party actions should not be excluded.  For the purposes of this oral presentation we have been invited to comment on the Government's criticism of the Bill, as expressed by the Minister of State, and that is what I will do.</p> <p>  It has been suggested that the Bill is technically flawed in that it seeks, inappropriately, to enact as primary legislation a scheme that was intended by the LRC to be in the form of rules of the Superior Courts.</p><p>The Superior Court Rules Committee has the power, exercisable with the agreement of the Minister for Justice and Equality, to make and change the rules of the superior courts.  It appears that the Law Reform Commission envisaged reform by way of the rules committee rather than primary legislation.  However, there is nothing in principle or law to prevent changes from being brought about by primary legislation.  We believe it would be constitutionally suspect if the Oireachtas were in some way to be disbarred from introducing legislation to seek to improve access to justice in the absence of the Superior Courts Rules Committee making such rules for whatever reason.  Nevertheless, it may be more appropriate to include in the Bill a provision that procedural rules would be adopted to give effect to the provisions of the Bill.  It is not necessary to exclude the Superior Courts Rules Committee and the Bill could be amended to provide that the committee would make procedural rules. </p><p> We have also been asked to address the issue of tracker mortgages.  The overarching point in that regard is that the tracker mortgage scandal was clearly the catalyst for publication of the Bill.  Irrespective of whether multi-party actions are an appropriate way to deal with the tracker mortgage issue or whether there is a more efficient redress system available, this does not take from the fact that we do not have formal effective procedures for multi-party litigation.  The Bill is a significant improvement and development in that regard.  There is no doubt that issues will arise in the future which would benefit from having this legislation in place. </p><p> It is not clear that the redress programme in place would achieve the resolution of all tracker mortgage cases, particularly the more egregious cases where repossession proceedings have been brought or family homes repossessed.  If the procedure provided for had been in place when the tracker mortgage scandal emerged in 2011-12, it is arguable and certainly possible that some of the issues could have been addressed by now through such litigation.</p><p> The Government's statement queried whether multi-party actions were a viable way to deal with tracker mortgage issues.  Clearly, there are different types of plaintiff, claim and lender involved and the losses incurred also differ.  However, the core issue of overcharging on interest creates a commonality.  While multi-party actions may not be the best procedure or even a necessary one for every claim arising from the tracker mortgage scandal, it is difficult to argue that they would not be a suitable vehicle for at least some of the claims. </p><p> The Government's statement noted that the report of the Law Reform Commission was relatively old and that it would be appropriate to consider developments that had occurred in the meantime, in particular, at European level and internationally.  While FLAC agrees that it is wholly appropriate to consider these developments, none of them suggests the current lack of provision for multi-party actions is in any way justified or should be maintained.  Most recently, the EU anti-trust damages directive which relates to damages under national law for breaches of EU competition law makes provision for collective redress.  It has also been suggested the matter will be addressed by the President of the High Court in the review of the administration of civil justice.  While it is welcome that the President of the High Court will consider this matter as part of the review, we hope his review will go beyond multi-party actions and examine other barriers to access to justice, for example, class actions, standing rules on costs and protective costs and other forms of resolution of matters.  It would be unfortunate if the review were, in some way, to inhibit the Oireachtas i legislating on matters related to access to justice.</p><p> Some technical issues were raised by the Government about the Bill.  FLAC is not overly concerned with a number of them.  It is correct that an element of the Law Reform Commission's proposal is admitted, namely, the requirement that any person joining a multi-party scheme agrees at or before the time he or she joins it to the terms of any settlement arrangement.  This matter could easily be rectified and I am not sure it is a critical issue.</p><p> Concern is also expressed about the designation of a lead solicitor under a Bill and whether this could, in some way, impinge on the right of access to the courts by an individual with a legal representative of his or her choice.  It must remembered that the parties are opting into this system which is in no way compulsory and that the High Court judge will have a key role in ensuring the lead case fairly and adequately represents the interests of all those on the register.  </p><p> A further concern is raised about whether it would be considered safer for any such Bill to apply to new proceedings only.  On my reading of the Bill, it is not immediately clear that it purports to apply to existing proceedings.  It is important to remember that it would not change substantive rights or even substantive remedies.  It is more a case management Bill than one which would change existing rights.  Again, that concern is not a critical issue.</p><p> The Law Reform Commission has subjected this matter to considerable scrutiny and analysis.  It is clear from its report that it considers the proposal to be an alternative rather than a radical one.  While the Bill clearly is not the solution to remove all barriers to access to justice, it attempts to deal with some of them.  For that reason, FLAC welcomes it.</p></speech>

I have been researching multi-party actions and the issue of collective redress for the past ten years.  My doctoral research entailed a comparative examination of multi-party actions in a number of common law jurisdictions and I also examined Ireland's procedures for collective redress.  I compiled my findings on the uses of multi-party actions in other jurisdictions and how they could potentially be of use here in a book which may be of assistance to the joint committee. </p> <p>  I propose to discuss Ireland's current system for delivering collective redress and outline the problems with it.  In my written submission I respond to the Government's criticism of the Bill, as outlined by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  Owing to time constraints, I do not propose to set out my responses in detai,l but I would welcome questions Deputies may have on them.  I also offer my assistance in any way I can with the legislation. </p> <p>  I will begin by examining the idea of mass harm, which is what multi-party actions, MPAs, are designed to resolve.  Mass harm is severe or widespread damage which usually causes harm to many victims.  We are all potential victims of mass harm which has become a feature of modern life.  Ireland needs a legal procedure that can respond to the legal challenge presented by this reality.  Thirteen years have elapsed since the Law Reform Commission published its report on multi-party actions, which is too long a period without change.  The matter needs to be addressed urgently.  For this reason, I am glad that the committee is examining legislation on the matter.</p> <p>  In the opinion of Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness, president of the Law Reform Commission when it issued its report on multi-party actions, the Irish methods of dealing with multiple cases have led to "appalling situations because of the lack of multi-party actions".  In recent years there have been numerous cases of mass harm in Ireland, including the Volkswagen emissions scandal, pyrite damage, contaminated blood products, Army deafness claims, asbestos-related ill health and the recent tracker mortgage rate abuse by banks.  Ireland is one of the few common law jurisdictions that does not yet have an effective mechanism for multi-party litigation.  Instead, the courts occasionally use a confusing array of alternative methods in cases where a multi-party action mechanism would have an obvious role.</p><p>It would appear that the MPA litigation is necessary as a remedy of last resort where the other techniques failed to deliver collective redress and where there is, therefore, no alternative but resort to the courts.<br/><br/>MPAs, by enabling victims of mass harm to combine their legal actions, can be a key tool in achieving access to justice.  Litigants can overcome many of the impediments that they face in taking legal actions individually.  It gives strength in numbers.  It allows them to pool their resources because very often they deal with David versus Goliath-type scenarios.<br/><br/>I will now discuss the current Irish mechanisms for dealing with mass harm, which I believe are inadequate.  These are private actions and multi-party procedures that currently fall short of MPAs.  They are rarely invoked because they are of such restricted use.  The first mechanism is representative actions.  The Irish courts have taken a very restrictive attitude towards them.  They are only allowed in very limited circumstances where parties have the same interest and where certain prerequisites are met.  They cannot be used for tort claims.  Most of the cases that I have talked about today are tort claims.  It is not possible to get damages and crucially, it is not possible to get legal aid.  <br/><br/>The remaining tools are joinder and consolidation, which are technical ways of joining cases, and finally we have test cases.  These are commonly used and are unduly costly.  They also result in procedural inefficiency, as well as unnecessary duplication.  In addition, the risk of adverse cost awards, on which my colleague, Ms Barry, has spoken, and potentially ruinous costs make them very unfavourable. <br/><br/>I will examine a few of the cases that exemplify the problems of mass harm litigation in Ireland.  They show the problems that can occur when some of these procedures I have just mentioned are used and there is no MPA procedure.  There is huge inefficiency in terms of financial terms and delay.  By proceeding on the basis of these fragmented and piecemeal procedures, access to justice is impeded, there are gross procedural inefficiencies and there is procedural unfairness.<br/><br/>We have had the social welfare equality cases, the Army deafness claims, and the best recent example is the pyrite construction dispute.  The latter ended in 2011 and ran for more than two years with claims of more than 550 homeowners.  It was the longest-running case in the history of the Commercial Court and one of the most expensive court cases in the history of the State.  Each plaintiff had to take a separate action and they all had to instruct their own lawyers.  This case typifies the problems inherent in the current procedures whereby plaintiffs must initiate separate and individual claims and seek damages at huge cost, delay and causing wasteful inefficiencies.  I believe that these examples show that it is in the interests of the State, litigants and of justice to embrace some form of multi-party action procedure to avoid these anomalous cases.  Such a procedure would enhance access to justice and help overcome the obstacles such as the high litigation costs faced by individuals.  Another key factor is that it would make mass litigation more manageable and allow case management.<br/><br/>There are particular difficulties with multi-party litigation in Ireland, as my colleague, Ms Barry, has mentioned.  Funding cases is a crucial problem, in particular in respect of legal aid.  We do not have an effective system for legal aid.  As the Irish scheme specifically excludes test cases and multi-party actions of any sort, it is not available for representative actions.  In order to avoid the risk of ruinously expensive legal costs, litigants commonly proceed by using the device of men of straw.  That means litigants will have no assets and nothing to lose financially in an action.Second, litigation insurance is generally not available in Ireland because professional third party funding is not permitted in Ireland as it offends against the rules on maintenance and champerty.  Third, and also crucially, costs follow the event.  That means that the loser of a case usually has to pay the entire amount of the costs.  It is a double financial burden to be obliged to meet both sets of costs in the action.  Were multi-party actions to be introduced, there would have to be changes as to how costs are currently decided.<br/><br/>The Law Reform Commission report in 2005 cited Professor Hodges of Oxford University and his call for &quot;a managerial mechanism to move forward resolution of all the individual claims&quot;.  The commission recommended that any reform in this area should be based on principles of procedural fairness, efficiency and access to justice.  In particular, it recommended that there should be active case management by the courts, which I think is key in dealing with large-scale cases.  <br/><br/>Let us consider what happened in Europe.  In January, just a few weeks ago, the European Commission published a report on the implementation of its 2013 recommendation on collective redress.  At present, 19 member states in total have implemented collective actions across various sectors.  The report states:</p><blockquote>In the Member States where [collective redress mechanisms] do not formally exist there appears to be an increasing tendency of claimants attempting to seek collective redress through the use of different legal vehicles ... This may raise issues concerning effective prevention of abusive litigation.</blockquote><p>That particularly applies where there is a lack of safeguards, as provided for in the European Commission's recommendation.  Ireland remains one of eight member states that still do not provide for any possibility to collectively claim compensation in mass harm situations.  <br/><br/>In conclusion, it is clear that cases of mass harm and multi-party litigation occur in Ireland.  Due to the lack of an appropriate MPA mechanism, other methods are used by way of improvisation thus causing appalling delays, costs and injustice.  The experience of the victims of Thalidomide, for example, shows that this current practice is causing much difficulty.  The MPA experience in other jurisdictions shows that they can enhance procedural justice in appropriate cases.<br/><br/>It is important to note that collective actions alone are an outdated approach for dealing with mass harm because they are not the most efficient route to justice.  As we know, the courts are not the only forum in which to resolve legal disputes.  We must also learn lessons from emerging new techniques of collective redress.  We need to adopt a modern holistic approach.  This requires a combination of legal tools, including regulation, alternative dispute resolution, the courts and ombudsmen.<br/><br/>In summary, MPA litigation is a necessary remedy of last resort to deal with mass harm where other techniques fail to deliver collective redress.  Mass harm affects a huge number of people, particularly consumers.  Professor Hodges also talked about needing better ways to manage the unmanageable.  Mass harm litigation can become unmanageable and MPAs offer a way of dealing with this.  <br/><br/>I believe the current procedures are hugely flawed and cause injustice.  There is no perfect solution to meet the challenge of delivering collective redress.  After 13 years we finally have this legislation that could help manage the reality of mass harm litigation.  The MPA procedure is what the Law Reform Commission recommended after extensive research and consideration.  This Bill is the best option we have at the moment for creating a procedural mechanism to deal with multi-party litigation.  Therefore, I suggest that we do our best to work with the legislation.  It might need some fine tuning, as most legislation does, but let us not lose momentum.  Let us not get left behind in the Dark Ages without an effective multi-party action procedure.  The law is dynamic and we can always incorporate changes and collective redress techniques as they evolve and become available but at the moment they are very limited.  Without doubt, Ireland needs to finally overhaul its collective redress procedures and introduce an MPA procedure to remedy what I see as a severe gap in its legal mechanisms.  I thank the committee members for their attention. </p></speech>

There is nothing that has been said in this room today that I disagree with and I will continue on from what has been said.</p> <p>  I am the founding partner of Coleman Legal Partners and I have specialised in group litigation for the past 30 years.  </p> <p>  The use of any judicial system by a group of citizens, and their advisers, with common purpose in the absence of formal court rules to guide them necessarily means a journey by all parties, be they plaintiffs or defendants, that is fraught with risk and exposure to risk that often, in practice, precludes large numbers of people, and their rights have been taken from them without ever being vindicated.  I do not say that from a subjective point for view.  I say it from an empirical point of view as this has been my experience.</p> <p>  I have received a copy of the Bill.</p><p>While I apologise for having tracked and changed it, I felt it was a way to show the committee that there may be another way to look at the Bill.  While I apologise for the damage I did to it, it was the best way to explain myself.<br/><br/>Later in the Bill, there is provision for a judge to decide on more than one lead case, but that is not stated in the definition of the lead case.  The definition refers to a case which may be chosen as representative of the class or group.  In so far as it goes, that seems very logical but already at this point the massive disparity between a plaintiff and the defendant in any case has reared its not too pretty head.  What one sees is not so much what the lead case is but rather who the lead plaintiff is.  That is a massive difference when it comes to the citizen and his or her right of access to justice.  A simple answer is that it is the case which best represents the set of circumstances the court is tasked with deciding.  That is the simple answer.  The practical answer is that the person in the plaintiff case who is the best person in the best position to carry out this case to its ultimate destination must have certain attributes from a practical point of view.  I will explain what they are.  The plaintiff must be willing to go forward as the lead plaintiff and, in effect, do the heavy lifting on his or her own behalf and on behalf of many thousands of others.  In respect of the day-to-day management of the case, he or she must follow absolutely everything.  He or she must be up for it and know what to do, including how to do affidavits and know what that means.  Ultimately, the plaintiff could have the responsibility of carrying the costs where the value of the case being discussed may run to tens of millions of euro.<br/><br/>I have done these cases and, thankfully, been successful in most of them.  However, I can speak to the risks that individuals face in this country when seeking to vindicate their rights.  I can speak to the bank cases and the pyrite cases and, by my experience, shed some light for the committee on what this legislation ought to achieve.  The circumstances of the lead plaintiff must be such that the facts of his or her case govern those of the group.  It is a fact of life that not every case will be <i>ad idem</i>with its next neighbour.  One is going to try to distil some basic principles out of all of the cases which are enough to decide the group.  There will be a degree of subjectivity, such as the extent of damage etc. on an individual basis.  The last circumstance of this person is the one which everyone has spoken about here.  That is that he or she must be such that he or she can withstand any and all negative costs orders made against them.  It is not just the costs of the case.  During the course of the case, it has been my experience that certain judges have made interim costs orders against lead plaintiffs in respect of late filing of papers, etc.  One might blame the solicitor for that but when one is running a mass tort, one may have several thousand people to deal with and it is not always possible to get it right according to the timeline the judge sets out.<br/><br/>We have had to deal with interim costs orders against plaintiffs in those circumstances.  Something should be done about that.  This rule allows any defendant, most of which are large corporations or, indeed, the State, to adopt their first defensive strategy, which is to play the man and not the ball.  They will pick the test plaintiff as the man who has the means to pay their costs or a large portion of them should they win.  If they succeed in getting him nominated, the defendant can, under the current system, apply to the High Court to have its chosen cases in the group litigation taken.  That plaintiff is now on notice and he will worry throughout the case, which gives the defence its first advantage.  One has to ask at this point who in his or her right mind would place what could be the result of his or her life's work on the line to incur the massive liability on behalf of others whom they most likely have never met save with the common interest of a loss they blame others for?  What solicitor would advise someone to take on that risk?  That is a rhetorical question in the sense that the answer highlights immediately the problems any plaintiff and his or her advisers have.  In a case I successfully concluded several years ago on behalf of 300 plaintiffs, the defendants paid out an eight-figure sum.  I cannot name the case or the parties because of the terms of the settlement.  One of the lead plaintiffs was a man of considerable wealth.  He joined the case as an ordinary plaintiff and placed himself in harm's way, knowing a loss would cost him many multiples more than the loss he was complaining of in the first instance.  Notwithstanding the clarity of the advices as to the nature of an adverse costs result, this man stood his ground.  Eventually, he and his fellow plaintiffs were vindicated.  To say his belief in justice caused him and me many sleepless nights is an understatement.  He remains a friend today.<br/><br/>No one, including me, wants to see the courts system with any legislation enacted to guide it used for rampant litigation which clogs up the arteries of the system in order to vindicate minor rights of individuals.  We understand this.  This is not what we see as the intention of the legislation.  Neither does anyone want to see citizens precluded from availing of the right of access to court for fear of a draconian costs order, which might ultimately be his or her ruin.  The job of the legislator is to pick through this issue and assist in any process which treats all protagonists equally.  The old costs rule of costs following the event has an exponential effect in multi-party litigation on the single individual who is saddled with the costs of a case taken on behalf of thousands.  This was never intended to be the result of that rule.  The rule demonstrates the stark difference between the realities of the protagonists where the plaintiff is a minor individual, whose opponent is often a multinational or, indeed, the State.<br/><br/>Similarly, the appointment of one solicitor, or more than one depending on the size of the case, is a thing to be desired.  The proper execution of a multi-party action requires action by a solicitor with three attributes.  The first is that he or she must have the necessary experience of litigation of this type.  The second is that he or she must have the capacity to administer a case which may have thousands of parties.  The third is that he or she must have the necessary resources to execute the case from inception to conclusion.  The third is interesting and I will speak to it later.  I have often seen and met solicitors in smaller firms who are swamped by a case that has grown legs from its initial birth with one client or so.  The applicability of the facts to a larger cohort has made that solicitor unable to adequately and properly deal with the numbers involved.  Given the adverse nature of a costs order, it may be prudent advice for other solicitors with similar clients in similar situations to wait and see what happens with the lead case.  Everybody is now on the ditch.  It means the resources are limited and applied to a lead case and there is no cohesive strategy to vindicate the rights of people in the most efficient way.  This will compound the lead solicitor's problems if the clients do not come to the case to allow it to be adequately resourced.  We will speak to resources later.<br/><br/>The administration of a case is important to all, in particular the clients.  There is of course the lead plaintiff about whom we have spoken but everyone who has suffered as a result of a mass loss has the same right as the lead plaintiff.  However, they must follow on, which means having to be educated in the progress of the case and in its nuances as the defendants often bring forth information or material which heretofore has not been available to plaintiffs and which can change the nature and style of a case.  We will talk about that coming up in the process of discovery later.  In deciding an issue, the court will rightly want to know that those affected by a case are suitably informed of its progress.  Technology has greatly assisted this administration but individuals in the current system all carry a fear of having to pay their own and others' costs.  The majority of queries may have to be dealt with by the solicitor on a one-to-one basis.</p><p>People are genuinely scared because of the nature of the current system which involves joint and several liability costs.<br/><br/>After allowing for the first two requirements, namely, experience and capacity, the resource most necessary to execute a case is money.  In the multi-party section, there is a reference to the High Court stamp duty of &euro;190 and an Injuries Board application fee of &euro;45.  Taken together, this comes to &euro;235 which might not appear like a large sum which would act in any way as a barrier to entry into a case with a larger group.<br/><br/>Recently, outside Leinster House, the wives of serving soldiers protested at the pay and conditions of their partners.  Not wishing to enter that debate and the merits of their protest, it is fairly obvious these women did not stand in the manner they did because they had nothing better to do.  Rather, like many others in our society, they have been put to the pin of their collar to make ends meet.  I mention this group because my firm advises more than 300 ex-soldiers who took and were affected by the anti-malarial drug Lariam.  The merits of the case are not for this room but, respectfully, the mathematics are.  To ask the wife of a soldier to provide &euro;235 for membership only of a case which has a long journey with both the causation of the case and the personal effects on each individual soldier to be proved is something which ranks well above the day-to-day priorities of this particular cohort.<br/><br/>From a defendant's point of view, the absence of the &euro;235 per case means that this cost is avoided at the end of the case, should it be successful.  One does not have to issue proceedings to be part of a multi-party action under this Bill.  Instead, one creates the register outside of the court and then joins it.  For example, in the case of Lariam, the defendant, being the Department of Defence and the State, will know whether somebody was a member of the Defence Forces and whether they were given the drug.  Accordingly, the membership, or otherwise, should not necessarily involve these costs incurred.<br/><br/>The Injuries Board will not deal with these cases because it cannot do so.  The &euro;45 charge is spent finding out something we already know, a point which we have been told in our discussions with the Injuries Board.  This is a typical example of how this goes.<br/><br/>If there were 500 people in this cohort, the total saving is &euro;117,500.  To my mind, that is a significant saving.  The size of this figure in the overall cost of the case may appear small to a defendant.  However, that highlights the inequality between plaintiff and defendant.  To find &euro;235 can be a lot harder than finding &euro;117,500.<br/><br/>The requirements to fund a case do not stop at the entry point.  The cost merely allows for entry.  The management and the proving of the case, as well as its execution to its conclusion, can be massive.  A typical expert witness in a banking case will cost &euro;50,000 to brief, report, respond to discovery and attend a trial.  There may be many expert witnesses.  Who will pay them?  Will it be the clients, private funders or the solicitors themselves?  No expert, be it in a medical negligence or financial matter, will work for nothing.  Somebody has to pay him.<br/><br/>We already have shown that not everybody can meet &euro;235.  If one has 500 people to run a case, brief counsel, hire people to deal with massive discovery - sometimes one has to hire up to 20 barristers to deal with discovery - one can be faced with a bill of up to &euro;1 million.  One can say it is fine with &euro;2,000 per man.  However, that &euro;2,000 is a bridge too far for so many people.<br/><br/>This legislation has to be able to the deal with a hybrid of all types of funding, be it that people can opt to fund themselves, partake of finance if it should be beyond them, or the solicitor can deal with the costs.  Few solicitors would be in a position to carry these costs but it can be done.  The adage of n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile comes to mind.  It is possible for everybody to come together to do this.  However, it is not always the case.  What does a lead solicitor do when he knows some of his 500 people have not paid because they simply cannot?  Does he tell them they cannot come in?  Does he carry the cost himself?  Does he not tell the others?  These are the practicalities of dealing with these cases.<br/><br/>I have never had a multi-party case - I have run more than 20 of them - where everybody paid up.  They did not because they could not.  We just had to suck it up.  That is no way to deal properly with people's right of access to justice, particularly in this day and age.  Normally, it is the poorest who are most affected by these cases, not the richest.  Those are the people who need to be minded most, in my respectful view.<br/><br/>Section 4 covers the day-to-day issues concerning the size of the particular cohort.  The Bill states it should be an application to the High Court to expand the register.  In my respectful submission, there is no need to do that.  One can create the register first and then let the solicitors deal between themselves.  I am doing a case in France where there are 11,000 people in the cohort.  All discussions are not in the courts but between the plaintiff and defendant lawyers, spending hours poring over the list, deciding who is in and who is out.  That is the proper way to do it.  To have these differences aired in court, when it is quite clear to both parties as trained lawyers that somebody is in or out, is a waste of the court's time.  It will certainly clog up the system, a system designed to simplify the process and to make it less expensive.<br/><br/>Section 5 deals with the publication of the existence of the register.  During the establishment of the Residential Institutions Redress Board, ads were taken out by the State all over the world for the whole diaspora to see this was happening in the home country.  People who had often left for the very same reason the redress board was established had to be contacted and identified.  It is to be hoped we will never have the dark time of such a redress system again.  I mean that because I was actually involved in the negotiation of the Act itself.  There should be a provision in this legislation to allow for the inclusion of the existence of the register in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  In turn, this will notify it to people and it can be picked up by the media and so publicised.  Otherwise, the cost falls once again on the plaintiffs to do so because the defendants will not do this.<br/><br/>The adverse costs order is one of the main parts of the Bill which I feel needs to be thought through carefully.  There will only be one shot at this and it is incumbent on everybody to understand who the legislation affects.  We can start with the most vulnerable in society, wards of court.  For example, if a person is responsible for a ward of court and believes those rights have to be vindicated through some loss which has affected this person, he or she has to consider carefully the effect of an adverse costs order against that ward.</p><p>If provision has been made, perhaps in a familial setting, to provide for that person, the money that is set aside for the person is at risk if the person is part of a case.  That is a huge barrier to entry for anybody who is prudent in their advice to a plaintiff on the basis that an adverse costs order is joint and several in fairness to all.  One can also include vulnerable people from a socio-economic perspective in our society.  One can show that the people who are most affected are the people who have the liability of the people who cannot pay foisted onto those who can pay.</p><p> I have a clear example of those who can pay.  Since 2010 many families have struggled in middle class Ireland to get back to a place where there is some element of security in their personal lives.  I was approached by a group of 200 people who claim, in my view rightly, that they suffered at the hands of a particular financial institution in a bespoke matter.  There was a finite number and the issue was quite clear.  I had previously taken a case against another financial institution on the same grounds and won it.  This time, however, because it was after 2010 and people had been sharpened by the losses most people suffered in the downturn, they could not find a lead plaintiff among themselves and they would not put themselves forward as party if their improved lot, based on the sacrifices they made in those years, was once again put at risk for a court case.  They could not go forward, so they had to go back.  In reality they were denied their access.  We have great theoretical access to justice here, but the reality of it is completely different.  These cases must be funded and people will lose twice if there is an adverse costs judgment - what they put in and what they will have to pay up.  On the other side, the defendants might say that is fair, given that they have incurred those expenses in vindicating themselves.  However, to take it against one party when the benefit of the case runs to their defence of many cases is incorrect.  In my view this Bill should not allow the targeting of rich or richer people with the expense of those who cannot afford to pay their way but yet have the equal right of access to the courts.</p></speech>

It is important to have a proper system of justice for mass tort in this country, and that is not because I believe we need a lawyer fest.  I am doing a case in South Africa for 25,000 miners and we have waived our fee.  It is not about the lawyers but about the citizens in the State and the fact that they are denied access to justice even though we pride ourselves on our Constitution.</p></speech>

I very much enjoyed their presentations.  We had an opportunity to debate this in the D&aacute;il on Second Stage and on that occasion Fianna F&aacute;il indicated it would support the Bill.  It is worthwhile legislation.  From my point of view and knowledge of the courts, it is refreshing to have a discussion about facilitating access to the courts.  On many occasions when we discuss legislation it is about restricting access through reducing limitation periods or restricting people's access to the courts by sending them to some statutory body.  It is important that people recognise that access to the courts is a good thing.  People must be facilitated in gaining access to the courts.  There is a big problem in this country in terms of certain people feeling excluded from the system because of its expense.  We must take steps to ensure that this does not happen.</p> <p>  The core advantage of this legislation, and I will be interested to hear Mr. Coleman's comments on this, is that multi-party actions will have the effect of reducing costs in the long run, not just the legal costs of the plaintiff but also the legal costs of the defendant being sued.  Consider, for example, some of the major actions where the State has been wrong, whether it was the infection of women with contaminated blood products or the Army deafness cases.  The State spent a fortune defending those claims.  Does Mr. Coleman think that the cost to the State even of the legal fees would have been reduced had there been a multi-party action scenario for those situations?</p></speech>

Let us remove the word "State" and replace it with "defendant".  In my experience, the multi-party action in the limited form we have it at present is one where one signs up the plaintiffs, they will sign up to the agreed questions between the plaintiffs and the defendants that are given to the court, and in so answering that binds the group.  That is far more efficient than having 300 or 500 individual statements of claim and having to go through all the procedures before the court for each one, which creates a massive amount of work and effort to no avail because everybody in the room will know that the points to be decided are being decided in the main cases and that all other cases should be, in effect, stood up.  I agree that considerable savings can be made by having this system.</p> <p>  When it comes to the State, and I hope I am not overstepping the mark, sometimes there is not much commerciality in dealing with these problems.  In a typical medical negligence case the apology is given at the very end.  In many other areas where the State is being sued through one of its arms, the circle the wagons opinion prevails until it has to give up.  It is the wrong way.  In many states in America, for example, the doctors apologise openly at the outset.  It has really reduced litigation.</p></speech>

It is not simply that one must pay lawyers, one must also pay scientists and doctors to get reports to support the claim.  One of the concerns people might have about multi-party actions is that it could become a little like America where there are arrangements whereby a percentage of the pot is taken by the lawyers.  Does she think there is potential for that here or does she have any concerns about that?</p></speech>

The Bill is quite a modest proposal.  It is more about case management.  It is not providing for big class actions such as take place in the United States, where one has to opt out rather than opt in.  This is very much an opt in proposal so I do not see it as a floodgates scenario.</p></speech>

That is illegal in Ireland.  There is no risk of that happening here.</p></speech>

The defendants asked me why I was taking the case.  I was then sued personally in champerty.  I had to retain lawyers and we had to fight that case.  The main case was stood up.  We fought it and won it.</p><p>I got my costs.  We then came back and they settled at the last minute in the other case.  The defendant will play the man and not the ball every time and the more one puts in the Bill to allow that the ordinary citizen in the street who has from zero to limitless wealth is protected, the more one will achieve for the cohort of people which is the State.</p></speech>

If there had been an acceptance by the State that it was in breach of the terms of the directive in the first place, that cost would have been prevented.</p></speech>

Many of these cases should not be cases.  If persons who are doing a wrong or committing a tort faced up to their responsibility and admitted liability earlier, we would not have to go through such lengthy processes and it would just be an issue about quantum where they would require legal assistance.

As Deputy O'Callaghan said, this is about a rebalancing of access to justice that we currently see in the Irish context where people have been prohibited by the cost and everything else.</p> <p>  In the evidence she presented, Dr. Blennerhassett stated Ireland is one of eight member states that does not have the possibility to collectively claim.  Based on the ones that have, do Dr. Blennerhassett or Mr. Coleman want to outline any European model that Ireland should embrace?</p></speech>

That is where the European Commission has tried to legislate.  By giving guidelines, it has tried to create a blueprint.  Each jurisdiction has its own nuances that it needs to deal with and its own political forces.</p> <p>  We can learn a lot by looking at the United Kingdom - the use of the group litigation order in England and Wales - and also from the safeguards that the European Commission recommended prohibiting contingency fees and protecting against abuse so that Ireland will not become a jurisdiction, like the United States, where there is ambulance chasing and there are incentivised class actions.  We can learn lessons from the United Kingdom and other common law jurisdiction so that we are comparing like with like.</p></speech>

Professor Hodges has said that collective litigation is an outdated mechanism.  He refers to 2018 research.  The study collected many case studies on the different collective redress mechanism from across the EU and the results were evaluated against objective criteria.  The study found that new technology mechanisms of regulatory redress and consumer ombudsmen were clearly better than the old technology mechanism of collective litigation.  Have any of the witnesses explored that research?  Maybe they want to comment on it.</p></speech>

I believe there are emerging new technologies and that is why I say that we need a suite of responses potentially for dealing with collective redress ranging from ombudsmen to regulatory redress, alternative dispute resolution, ADR, and the courts.  We do not need more litigation but the litigation is happening and that is where the role of the courts is important.</p> <p>  At present, we do not have any other mechanisms.  We do not have enough of those other techniques.  Until we have, we certainly need a multi-party action.  That will work as one of the tools in the toolkit to deal with collective redress.</p></speech>

It is very much part of a bigger picture.  We would come across regularly some of the issues the witnesses touched on, for example, ordinary people who have clearly been wronged but cannot get a remedy for that wrong, be it that they have not the financial wherewithal to take a case or whatever.</p> <p>  I am struck by the comments which I agree with about collective redress.  It is not only about access to the courts, particularly where the State is responsible as the defendant.  There has to be a change in culture.  This circling of the wagons most definitely exists.  Not only does this put pressure on people but there are tremendous amounts of money involved.  Looking at the detail on Army deafness, nearly &euro;300 million was paid out.  Some &euro;100 million of that went on legal costs, not to mind what people were put through.  The Lariam example is teed up for that.  The present situation suggests we will have tortuous one-by-one litigation - it has already started - which does not do anybody any good.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms Barry's point.  This is a modest Bill.  It will leave many matters unaddressed.  However, it is an important opportunity to discuss some of the bigger issues and it is better than what is there.  From that point of view, even from the point of view of efficient court management, it is probably better.</p> <p>  I do not have a large number of questions.  The biggest gap in the Bill is the issue of champetry and the lack of provision in it for third party funding.  I would like to know the panel's opinion on that.  The prohibition in Ireland is out of kilter with nearly everywhere else in the world.  The Supreme Court upheld it in May 2017.  Ms Justice Denham stated it should be perhaps looked at as a separate law.  This is where a person not related cannot fund a case.  It has come up on many occasions with persons with whom we have been dealing.  I refer to groups of people, some of whom are involved.  Those who are not might be family members.  They might want to use GoFundMe online where many people throw in &euro;20 because they see an injustice and they want to help, but they cannot do that.  The Government has stated this has to be done in separate legislation and one cannot include it in this.  If we do not address that, we will not advance these issues.  What do the witnesses think?</p></speech>

Some people may be able to access funding but there may be people who are not in a position to access funding from any group.  To us, the more fundamental issue would review of the legal aid scheme.  At present, the scheme's means test is extremely restrictive.  There are whole areas of law excluded.  It will not fund test cases.  Isolating out champerty and maintenance to be looked at, and not looking at legal aid, would be a real shame.  As Dr. Blennerhassett stated earlier, one needs a holistic solution to it.  I would have some reservations about picking champerty and maintenance and not looking at legal aid at the same time.</p></speech>

The cost of the case was &euro;55 million.  The insurance cover was &euro;100 million.  There was &euro;45 million left to remedy the homes.  These were not costs that I received.  These were the costs incurred between the quarry and the builder - that was it.  They took up years of court time.  In the end, it was through the good offices of our firm and the other firm that we negotiated a walk-away basis for the plaintiffs on the basis that there was a fix for their homes.  The system, as it is, is wrong.  It is inefficient and it is incorrect.</p> <p>  Second, the judge hearing that case, and the members might consider this in this Bill, asked for an expert to be appointed to help him to understand the vastly technical issues.  The same applies when one comes to medical device cases and blood-brain barrier drugs cases.</p><p>A judge may need assistance and the judge should have the statutory power to call for it.</p></speech>

For example, if there is a solicitor-client fee in a multi-party action where we are precluded from mentioning percentages but there is a &euro;10,000 reward, there may be a fee between the solicitor and client of &euro;1,000.  In some eyes, that is deemed to be having a personal interest in the case, as opposed to a legal interest in the case, but they cannot be separated.  One is entitled to charge a solicitor-client fee under the rules of court.  Once again, it is in the toolbox of a defendant to play the man and not the ball.</p></speech>

I have much to learn but I find it very interesting.  I have spent much time before the courts in the past ten or 15 years.  I know many people in every county in Ireland and because of my background an incredible number of people have contacted me about issues relating to today's discussion.  I am conscious that the majority of people who ran into problems, particularly with the large financial institutions, had no money left and it was very hard for them to get justice.  The general feeling is that in the Commercial Court, the financial institutions win 10-0 every day.  People feel there is no access to justice because they cannot afford it.  It is a major problem.  This could certainly help in some way.</p> <p>  Mr. Coleman mentioned the circling of the wagons by the State and we see that in many different areas in here.  Aside from the tendency to circle the wagons and take up that defensive position, much like the Health Service Executive and other State institutions do when challenged, why is the Government so opposed to doing something about this?  The witnesses mentioned champerty.  In Ireland the rules around it come from legislation from 1634.  The British and Welsh got rid of it in 1967.</p></speech>

It is quite clear that some of the finest brains in this country are working within Departments and they are very knowledgeable in all areas of life.  They are also very knowledgeable in mathematics.  Respectfully, I believe that before any large tort - the Lariam case, for example - can be dealt with, the gross cost to the Exchequer would be weighed up and the net cost of defending it would be weighed as well.  It would be deemed more prudent to run the case up the flagpole and see what happens in trying to avoid the bus; the other option is to get hit by it.  That seems to be how this is dealt with in the State.  There is a very hard-headed approach taken to these matters.</p> <p>  We can look at calls for public and judicial inquiries into various matters affecting people.  I am reminded of the recent request to open the Stardust matter again.  The people who made the request do not do so for compensation or to run up legal bills.  They are trying to vindicate a right.  However, the vindication of that right could lead to an additional expense or exposure so it is quite clear it is shut down at a very early stage.  From an outsider's perspective looking in, that is how I see it.  Of course, it is not just the case with the Stardust case but in many other areas.</p></speech>

Senator Michael McDowell spoke at the conference and in response to questions as to why the report had not been implemented - he was either Minister or Attorney General at the time - he said he was against implementing it as he saw it leading to class actions against the State.  He qualified that on the basis that the banks would now be the potential defendants and it might be possible to look at it again.  The possible rationale is to prevent claims being taken against the State or at least reduce claims against the State.</p></speech>

There is a fear, to use a clich&eacute;, of opening the floodgates.  The reality is the litigation and harm is happening.

In practice, however, there is no civil legal aid to represent defendant borrowers in those cases.  The Abhaile scheme is a start in terms of people getting legal advice and vouchers to access the advice of personal insolvency practitioners.  There has been a lot of talk about strategic default and people not responding to proceedings or engaging and so on but the simple fact of the matter is that most people go unrepresented or are expected to turn up in a county registrar's court on their own to fight their corner.  Ten years after the bust that, in and of itself, is a ridiculous situation.  That is a broader point.</p> <p>  On the point made earlier, there is a tendency to say that we do not want to lawyer up the system but sometimes that leads to people's basic right of access to the courts being infringed in some way.  We have a tendency to move to alternative dispute resolution for nearly everything.  Employment, social welfare, and landlord and tenant disputes are mostly dealt with outside the courts and, therefore, civil legal aid is, by and large, not available.</p></speech>

First, if a case was to be a lead case of a class of people so affected, each individual institution could be named because they have a common mortgage.  Were a case to be taken, it could have a class value of a non-pecuniary turnout in the end.  In other words, if one were to succeed, X number of people with that institution would not be excluded or removed from their homes.  It therefore does have a value other than the monetary compensation.  We did not speak to that here today but it is true that more than just monetary compensation can be achieved by stopping something.  I know there is a precedent value in the common law system as it currently stands which has a limited effect also.  To put it together by way of an adequately resourced lead case on a class principle gives a better chance of achieving something before the courts than that of the hard pressed man with a &euro;100,000 apartment who owes &euro;300,000.</p></speech>

We then had a discussion on the issue of champerty.  Apart from the issue of legal aid, which is difficult for an Opposition party to affect for procedural reasons, etc., what should this legislation include to deal with the issue of costs?  How complex would it be to legislate around the prohibition of champerty?  Should we consider it?</p></speech>

Allowing third party funding would open up the playing field to alleviate some of the difficulties and inequalities caused by costs.  I would start with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-21a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Coleman" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018022100002#Q01100"><p>There are two types of costs.  There are the costs in funding the case and the costs incurred if one loses the case.  The third party funding costs run to the establishment and execution of the case and the adverse costs are the costs the plaintiffs are exposed to in the event of a successful defence by the defendants.  I agree that there should be third party funding.  It should be very much a matter between the plaintiffs and their funders as to what the relationship is and how it survives the court system.  In other words, there will be commercial terms in any third party funding and we should not try to legislate as to what that is as it will be a matter of actuarial assessment of risk more than anything else.</p> <p>  The second part of the costs issue is the adverse costs order.  In the Bill I marked up, I removed the word "joint".  The judge would only be able to make a several costs order against each of the participants in the case.  This would greatly reduce the risk and increase the appealability of the legislation to the ordinary person.  I would ask that the costs would be split out and that funding of third party actions would be allowed.  I would also ask that the person with means would be protected from his or her fellow defendants if there is a loss because their loss falls on his or her shoulders also.  People have to be protected too.</p></speech>

We could borrow a lot from their common law system, ours being the same, and use what they have achieved.  Its group litigation order system works and allows for third party funding.  I would prefer to see our own system established here for multiparty actions, but we can hinge off on the third party funding.</p> <p>  To show the value of third party funding, last week some &pound;300 million of private funding was raised in England for two cases that have been taken in the English jurisdiction.  One is against truck manufacturers for rigging the price of trucks.  It will have European applicability although it will be fully funded and fought in England.  There are so many companies resident in this jurisdiction for their own reasons and the proper jurisdiction is where they reside.  They claim residence here.  Therefore, a lot more litigation could be taken here and, as in Hong Kong, London and other jurisdictions, a lot of growth in the economy as a result.  It is not a negative thing.</p></speech>

In FLAC's experience, costs are a huge disincentive to individuals bringing litigation of any kind.  The courts have some discretion at the moment in awarding costs and perhaps that needs to be examined.  A particular example would be the possibility of not awarding costs if the case is in the public interest or is a public interest-type matter.</p><p>That could be looked at.  Limiting the costs - having some sort of protective costs order - is another idea.  It is a complex issue.  Separating multi-party actions from the issue of costs generally is problematic as well.</p></speech>

I accept that this area probably needs further consideration.  In the FLAC submission, a distinction is made between what is in the Bill and what the Government responded to but that is between the terms upon which a settlement would be accepted or rejected.  That is between the people taking the case and what was characterised as the terms of any settlement, which is slightly different.  Dr. Blennerhassett also identified the fact that there will inevitably be tensions and different expectations or demands within a group so it may be necessary for a judge or regulator to approve a settlement.  I just want to get a comment from one of the witnesses on the best way to address the issue of settlement and agreement or non-agreement between the persons taking an action.</p></speech>

A total of 112 people were in the cohort.  An offer of settlement was reached.  As a result of that, each person had to sign up to it.  Of course, some people were recalcitrant and reluctant.  However, we agreed with the other side that there would be a 95% uptake and that would allow for it to be put before the court.  One can imagine when one must negotiate 95% of one's cohort.  Similarly, in all the other cases, in order to settle a case because one is not settling for full value, one is settling to de-risk a case because one will not always win 100%, one must take into account the risks the case faces before the law as it is.  We have agreed these "as you go" ways.  I do not think it is really acceptable to have that type of system in place if one is going to legislate for multi-party actions.  There must be a more structured method of dealing with this even if one must enshrine it in legislation that once certain criteria are followed, the case is deemed to be settled.  We could speak to that probably on the basis of other types of issues.  For example, if 95% of the plaintiffs for whom I act want to settle, what happens to the other 5%?  Do I act for them and continue?  Clearly, I cannot do so if I have recommended a settlement.  They are almost in effect cast out other than for the settlement that has been foisted upon them.  It does create quite an issue and a tension with people who will, ultimately, blame their lawyer when, in fact, one is trying to look for the common good and is doing perhaps what a judge would rule if appointed to do so - not the judge hearing the case or creating the register but an application to another judge to hear the pros and cons of the settlement and not the case.</p></speech>

Where an individual might wish to settle, the report seemed to propose that litigants could only remove themselves from the register after the filing of the defence with the authorisation of the court.  In the discussion, there seems to be a sense that the lead case might be cherry picked and settled and that might undermine the multi-party action.  Regarding the terms upon which a settlement would be accepted as opposed to the terms of any settlement arrangement, the Minister of State's contributions seem to confuse.  Regarding the suggestion that one should buy into the exact terms on which one might settle a case as opposed to the procedures for a group settlement of the case, there is a difference between the terms upon which a settlement would be accepted and the terms of any settlement arrangement.</p></speech>

This legislation should not allow such an application to be made until after the resolution of the case.  This is important because the sheriff has gone to homes of clients of mine who for their own personal reasons have had to desist in a case.  It has had nothing to do with their belief in the merits of the case.  They have desisted for personal reasons and have been faced with sheriffs looking for &euro;700 or whatever the figure was at the time.  It is small money but it is very embarrassing and affects credit ratings.  It is something that should be enshrined in the legislation.</p></speech>

They still have the common category but there are some differences with some of the lead cases.  My initial view in terms of our legislation is that this is adequately dealt with because sections 5 and 8 provide for directions given by the judge.  Do we need to provide more specifically for instances in which cases would splinter and subdivide?</p></speech>

It is carried out by the courts service but the Law Reform Commission also mentioned that a single representative would deal with the generic issue.  The commission says this is an essential feature of the procedure to avoid duplication but that a separate legal representative could be responsible for discrete issues within it - either a subgroup or at an individual level - so, again, we could learn from the English and Welsh practice.</p></speech>

However, upon examination, sometimes the installation of the mesh is deemed to be negligent so one now has thrown up a second but personal and discrete issue in each case.  It is how one can proceed with the main issue and allow for another forum or the adjournment of a second issue with no prejudice to allow the first issue to be decided and then the second issue on its merits.</p></speech>

To sum up, I am very grateful to my fellow Deputies for their contributions and to our guests in particular for giving us their time.  It has been very insightful.  There has been a great level of detail.  There is probably a great deal more to tease out but we are certainly an awful lot wiser.  There is a great deal more to be done in this institution and this committee must keep up the pressure.</p><p>One of the main obstacles to Private Members' Bills is the requirement that the Government provide a money message.  We will have to keep continual pressure on in that regard to ensure that this Bill advances through Committee Stage and beyond.  Unfortunately, it is not simply the case that this Bill will continue in train.  A good deal of pressure must be applied.  However, I am optimistic following the comments of fellow Deputies and I hope that we can advance this Bill further without too much delay.</p><p> Fundamentally, this is about access to justice and the better administration of cases.  It is about giving people the tools to take cases where previously they had been prevented from doing so because of the cost of litigation and representation.  On Second Stage, I quoted the comments of the former Chief Justice, Susan Denham, on the launch of the Law Reform Commission paper, when she said that the law was too expensive, too slow and too unequal.  I believe this to be the case, but I also believe that the introduction of a route of action such as envisaged in this Bill can make a significant difference in that regard.  I look forward to engaging with Deputies and experts on an ongoing basis to advance the Bill further.</p></speech>
