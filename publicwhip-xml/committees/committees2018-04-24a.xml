    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joanne McCarthy" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018042400002#B00200"><p>I will start.  I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for giving us the opportunity to talk to them about this really important issue.  All three of us here are of the view that if the committee can unlock this, it will do a lot to achieve equality for people with disabilities and really change how people with disabilities experience their community services, be they disability-specific or mainstream.  We submitted a paper for the committee's consideration.  I will not talk to that as it is quite long so I will just pull out some salient points from it.  We can come back to anything members wish to address.  We also will take the opportunity to notice how timely it is for this to be brought to the committee in light of the recent ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which came into force in Ireland on 19 April.  It is really timely that we are beginning to consider this as an issue.</p> <p>  We also acknowledge the work of the National Women's Council of Ireland in this area.  I do not think the experience of disability is hugely different to that experienced in terms of gender proofing.  While there might be some specifics, the committee has really broken the back of much thinking on this and bringing that to bear on disability would be really helpful.  In respect of the key learnings from this work and the work of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and others, we want to highlight that any disability proofing of policies or budgets needs to involve different thinking.  It is not systemic thinking about one Department and what it does.  We would perceive it as something that crosses Departments.  We need to think very differently when it comes to people with disabilities.  They do not live in silos or just one Department and do not just receive one programme or service.  With that in mind, we would say that at the outset, if one is seeking to disability proof in general, one needs to extend across areas.  This includes how Departments apply expenditure and how Government first and then public bodies make decisions on expenditure.  It includes the information they use to inform what decisions they make, for example, how they are going to use their money and more importantly, that they do not just use this in terms of a systematic look in which they go programme by programme but use a systemic look in which they look across the decisions that any one Department will make and,, more importantly, across how one Department's decision has an impact on other decisions made by other Departments.  If one takes a step back to consider how budgetary or policy decisions are experienced by people with disabilities, it really helps to understand the jerkiness that can happen if one just engages in systematic thinking.  </p> <p>  Moreover, any disability proofing must use disaggregated data.  To begin to introduce disability proofing without understanding what data is and is not at hand and what data we want to acquire would be hugely problematic.  We also think that good-quality and reliable objectives need to govern any decision one might make around how one introduces disability proofing.  This includes very strong and measurable key performance indicators, outputs and outcome indicators.  I know this sounds quite challenging when it comes to disability.  I am sure the committee has heard us and other people in our sector saying there is definitely a data deficit in terms of disability.  As some significant work has been happening around key performance indicators and likewise for the national disability strategy implementation group and the value for money process in terms of disability-specific health-related information, there is stuff there upon which we can build.  </p> <p>  We know that when these measures are not applied, there can be very poor outcomes in terms of how people with disabilities experience or are affected by policies or procedures.  I will give one example.  Rebuilding Ireland places a huge emphasis on addressing the social housing needs of the general population in Ireland.  We also know that the rental strategy never once touched on or addressed the housing needs of people with disabilities as part of that.  We also know that this was despite the fact that in 2010, a report by the Housing Agency specifically highlighted the very specific challenges faced by people we support in terms of accessing housing.  This was despite the fact that we have a national housing strategy for people with disabilities.  There is no stitching between the generic housing plans and this strategy, despite the impending ratification of the UNCRPD.  One might not necessarily think first and foremost that people with disabilities are one's target audience and one might make budgetary decisions or plan policies without understanding their wider impact on such people.  I note, however, that they cross all areas in Ireland and, at 13% of the population, are everywhere.  That is an example of why it is important that we are grappling with this issue.  </p> <p>  We welcome that this is now on the table.  However, we also know that we now have a right.  We actually have to do this.  There is now a need for us to introduce disability proofing in policy and legislation.  Under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, all public bodies must take proactive measures to eliminate discrimination against people with disabilities first and foremost.  They must also promote equality and protect the human rights of people with disabilities.  Even if the committee had not been proactive in beginning to look at how to begin to disability proof, we know there are other pressures that are coming on board in terms of influencing and having an expectation around how policies, procedures and budgets are made with regard to people with disabilities.  </p> <p>  We also know that the ratification of the UNCRPD will also pose challenges and ask questions about how we make budgetary decisions and how we begin to plan policies.  To return to the point, questions will not be asked in a systematic way but in a systemic way.  One will not be told that the answer to our responsibility in respect of the UNCRPD with regard to health will be found only in the Department of Health.  If one looks at each article, one will see the interface and interplay that happens across Departments in terms of the responsibility of Departments to answer the need in question.  For example, under health, it will not just be the Department of Health that must respond to what is being asked of it in the context of Article 25 of the UNCRPD.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will also have to respond and think differently about how it will achieve what is being asked of it.  </p> <p>  There are significant opportunities and changes taking place, most notably with this committee.  The Joint Committees on Health and Employment Affairs and Social Protection have made a really interesting move recently whereby they have indicated that the joint committees will come together to look at how to address the employment and activation issues faced by people with disabilities.  That is very significant.  The committees are looking at the competing barriers that are being put in place by individual siloed thinking in Departments and are beginning to look at how they can work together to unlock that and offer people with disabilities more seamless access to employment activation and so on.  That is the expectation.</p> <p>  We are not alone in this.  As the EU has also ratified the UNCRPD, it is also grappling with the need to disability proof its decisions and budgets.  We can see some of that coming out in some of its programme work and it is beginning to identify how it needs to include people with disabilities or the needs of people with disabilities in how it applies its budgets.</p><p> When DFI conducts budget analyses, we use a systematic approach.  One of the biggest examples of where it became very obvious to us that people with disabilities were inappropriately carrying the burden of the recession was in the context of budget 2012.  If members recall, disability allowance for people under the age of 18 was stopped and then there were staged payments for those aged 18 to 25.  Other groups were also affected by changes in respect of medical card access and the threshold cut-off point and in the context of educational supports for third level and further education for people with disabilities.  When we added up the impact of all of these cuts across Departments, we began to see clearly that the a lack of disability proofing in respect of the budget meant that people with disabilities were carrying a significant burden.  This group was already significantly marginalised in Irish society.</p><p> We greatly welcome the opportunity to come here today to discuss this matter.  The committee asked if we wanted to make recommendations about the budget.  We are of the view that we will get other opportunities to do so between now and the introduction of budget 2019.  For today, we are happy to highlight the importance of and focus on disability proofing generally.  We are happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joan Carthy" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018042400002#C00300"><p>On behalf of the IWA, I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  To follow on from what Dr. McCarthy said, I just want to talk about the impact that disability proofing budgets will have on people.</p> <p>  disability proofing future budgets is not just of the utmost importance, it is essential for the thousands of Irish citizens with disabilities who want the same rights, choices and opportunities in how they live their lives.  People with disabilities did not reap the benefits enjoyed by others during the Celtic tiger years yet they suffered disproportionate, life-changing negative impacts due to the severe cuts applied to the disability sector and health services during the economic downturn.  Since 2008, the budget for disability services has been reduced by &euro;136 million.  While there was a small increase in last year's budget which brought expenditure up to &euro;1.772 billion, &euro;1 billion has been spent on residential services that only cater for 1.3% of people with disabilities.</p> <p>  Responsibility for disability stretches across all Departments.  The IWA calls on the committee to ensure that the Government plays its part in providing fairness and equality for people with disabilities.  This means delivering appropriate investment in the personal assistant service, increasing the supply of wheelchair-accessible social housing and funding a fully accessible transport system for all.</p> <p>  For the purposes of this presentation, I would like to the concentrate on the personal assistant service, which is the cornerstone, foundation and lifeblood of community services for people with disabilities.  This service not only assists with tasks that people with disabilities cannot do for themselves, it also supports people to engage fully in the community, live independently, progress with further education and, for many, take up employment.</p> <p>  It is important to give a real example of how the Government's decisions affect the lives of people with disabilities and, more importantly, to show how a lack of disability proofing has negative impacts.  I know of two people with disabilities who have decided to live together with the support of the personal assistant service.  This vital service has not only helped them get out of bed in the mornings, it also assists them throughout the day.  As one of them said, it gave them the opportunity to be part of society, take up employment and contribute to the workforce and pay taxes.  During the years of austerity budgets, the couple were informed that their personal assistant hours would be cut and that they would have to manage with a skeleton service of basic hours that would barely cover the time needs relating to personal care.  The impact of the reduction meant they were faced with having to cut back their working hours and reduce much needed therapies.  They also could not even consider socialising of any description.  Is this any way for people to live?  Is it not terrible to build an independent life for oneself and actively live in an inclusive society only for it to be taken away because funding for vital disability services is not seen as a priority, and to not have a voice in Government and no system of protection?  There is a problem with the way the Government sees or understands what is meant by a personal assistant service.  The service is not a home help service or a care package.  In fact, it is a way of life that enables persons with disabilities to do all the things that the members here, who are their peers, take for granted.</p> <p>  Without disability proofing, the HSE has stretched hours in the personal assistant service due to a chronic lack of investment.  For example, a person with a disability has a care package of 64 hours.  If he or she dies, then his or her hours, which were previously assigned to one person, are reallocated across five or six people.  This means that the individuals receive a totally inappropriate service that does not meet their requirements.</p> <p>  There are figures that tell us about the amount of personal assistant hours provided but, unfortunately, there are no figures that reflect the scale of the unmet need for people who require such services.  The lack of such vital information makes it impossible for the Government to plan or fund an appropriate service.  Ireland has an ageing population and, therefore, more people will be reported as having disabilities.  People who have disabilities and who already have services in place are living longer and will require extra support in the coming years.  Does the Government have a plan for such an inevitability?  Plans are in place for other sectors.</p> <p>  The Government needs to disability proof future budgets and ensure that the unmet needs of people with disabilities are catered for. Vital services cannot be cut as a result of the lack of understanding of the true value of a personal assistant service to a person with a disability.  The value-for-money policy is based on people being moved into the community but the Government has continued to cut the only community enabling service, namely, that relating to personal assistants, currently in operation.  Decongregation, new models of day services, etc., are all based on high functioning personal assistant services.  There is a need for an extra 500,000 personal assistance hours to be injected into the system to cater for those people who receive inappropriate services.  This would cost &euro;12.5 million.</p> <p>  We strongly encourage members to consider the long-term, positive impacts investment in this sector and the service will have on the Exchequer.  We suggest that a standing committee or office be put in place in order to oversee the disability proofing of budgets and all policies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018042400002#C00400"><p>I thank Ms Carthy.  I call Ms Mitchell, senior policy and research officer with Mental Health Reform, to make her presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Mitchell" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018042400002#C00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting Mental Health Reform to appear this afternoon.</p> <p>  Mental Health Reform is the national coalition on mental health in Ireland.  It comprises 64 member organisations.  We advocate for improved mental health services and the social inclusion of people with mental health difficulties.  We very much welcome the opportunity to discuss the national mental health budget, in addition to issues of transparency and accountability in mental health funding and expenditure.</p> <p>  I shall touch on four key issues: the continued under-resourcing of mental health services in annual budgets; the absence of a national mental health information system and, consequently, a lack of reporting on mental health expenditure; the potential impact of the recent HSE restructuring on the mental health budget; and the requirement to proof budgets in the context of mental health.</p> <p>  First, with respect to the continued lack of funding for mental health services, the total budget for mental health services in 2018 was just &euro;912 million.  If fully realised, this level of expenditure will equate to just 6% of the overall health budget.  This proportion represents a reduction on previous years and severely lags behind in terms of national and international standards.  It is imperative that mental health is recognised and afforded appropriate priority within the wider health agenda in order to reflect its significance in contributing to the burden of disease in Ireland.  This will require a substantial increase in mental health funding to sustain existing levels of service and facilitate the development of new mental health services and supports, a matter which has received little or no attention to date.</p> <p>  In addition to the continued under-resourcing of the mental health system, there is no national mental health information system - supported by key performance indicators - to report on the full extent of service resources, provision, quality and outcomes for community-based mental health service delivery.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.16" nospeaker="true" time="16:00:00" ><p>Mental Health Reform has been calling for a such a system in budget submissions since 2013.  It is not acceptable that more than 12 years after publication of A Vision for Change,there is no information system to account for the more than &euro;800 million to &euro;900 million in public expenditure on mental health care each year.  

On HSE structure, there has been substantial reorganisation of management of mental health services since the publication of A Vision for Change including the appointment of a national director for mental health in 2013 with overall responsibility for a distinct mental health budget and delivery of mental health services.  Further restructuring of governance and accountability structures in the HSE in 2018 has led to the dissolution of the HSE's mental health division and national director of mental health position.  It is vital that coherent leadership in mental health at national level is not lost in the new HSE structure and that there is clear authority and accountability for a distinct national mental health budget each year.  

Aside from the moral and social implications, there is a strong economic basis for investment in mental health services.  The World Health Organization, WHO, recognises that mental health influences a wide range of outcomes for individuals and communities.  It is both a cause and a consequence of social and economic status.  The WHO further identifies that in order to improve the mental health outcomes of the population, Government must focus on facilitating a mental health in all policies approach in which &ldquo;policy makers across all sectors think in terms of mental health impact&rdquo;.  Such an approach should also be applied in the context of mental health proofing of budgets.  Ultimately, this means taking account of the mental health impact of budgetary decisions on the population, including individuals with existing mental health difficulties, across a multitude of areas, such as social protection, housing, employment, education, and early years.

Given the scale of money involved in mental health, the lack of transparency about how mental health funding is spent and considering the lack of systems in place to track and support this spending, our specific appeal to the committee today is it takes on accountability in mental health funding and expenditure as an immediate priority in budgetary oversight.</p></speech>

He has a few minutes.  If the witnesses care to answer immediately rather than waiting until the end, they should feel free.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018042400002#D00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  We have a legal obligation to ensure our budgets are equality proofed.</p> <p>  Dr. McCarthy referred to the importance of data.  What type of data currently exist and where are the gaps?  For instance, one area where I have been trying to secure information is that of the private rental sector, to which Dr. McCarthy referred.  I have not been able to get a number on how many properties comply with the Part M regulations.  If we do not have that type of data, how can we plan for demographic changes and so on?  Will Dr. McCarthy comment on the data, its importance and what we can do to improve that?</p> <p>  Related to the same issue, Ms Carthy said that the Irish Wheelchair Association was looking for 10% of all future builds to not only comply with the Part M regulation but to be accessible for people in wheelchairs to live, not just to visit.  Will she comment on that?  It may be a silly question, but can she differentiate between what the Part M regulations envisage with regard to visitation as opposed to having a property in which someone could live?</p> <p>    On the process and how we move it forward, lessons are being learned from gender proofing; if the witnesses were setting the indicators, what type of indicators would they seek in each Department?  It goes right across the Departments, even article 28 covers about five different Departments.  It is not good enough for one Department to set indicators, it needs to come out of the silos, as Ms Carthy put it.  </p> <p>  On the Department of Justice and Equality having issued guidelines for Government Departments and how to conduct a disability impact assessment in 2012, can the witnesses say how well it is working or is it working?</p></speech>

One was physical sensory-neurological and the other was intellectual disability.  It is commonly held that the intellectual disability database probably captures the health needs in terms of planning for services well enough; these would often mean disability-specific services.  Also, because of the voluntary nature of the enrolment, there is a huge problem in the physical, sensory and neurological data.  Resources were put into the HSE to support the ongoing enrolment in physical, sensory and neurological but that fell away.  The data in that area is not reliable.</p> <p>  The data on intellectual disability is reliable but one has to ask what kind of questions are being asked.  The questions one asks brings about certain answers.  That is where most of the disability data is being housed.  </p> <p>  The Disability Act was never enacted nor was the assessment of need beyond a certain age on children.  That had the potential to be a great source of information in identifying the levels of unmet need for people with disabilities generally.  As that has not been enacted, that information is missing.  Deputy O'Brien is correct that there is a significant deficit in the data being captured on people with disabilities.  The personal assistant service, PA, is a perfect example.  For those who are familiar with the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, we usually brand our work around supporting people to participate in the community, we are about enabling individuals and communities for people to participate and be equal citizens.  We see, as would the Irish Wheelchair Association, PA as being the cornerstone for that because it enables and supports people out into work, socialising, the gym, and all the things that we take for granted.  However, there has been no systematic data gathering around the level of unmet need on PA.  It is very hard to plan for a service when the level of need is not fully appreciated.  The identification of real data which is tangible and can be built upon would be hugely beneficial.  </p></speech>

That spans  the mental health system.  For example, in primary care we have very little information on the numbers of people presenting to primary care settings with mental health difficulties, the types of mental health difficulties they are presenting with, or the types of care and treatment that they are receiving.  One of the biggest issues we have with the lack of data in the mental health services is that we have no national information system whatever, which was a recommendation in A Vision for Change.  As far back as 2007, a number of national and international economists recommended this very strongly, but we are still in the same position.</p><p>We should have very basic information such as detailed data on expenditure, where money is going, staffing and the quality of service people receive.  One of the questions in that regard relates to how many people using mental health services are offered psychological therapy and how long are they obliged to wait.  We do not have that information.  We have absolutely no information on outcomes for people with mental health difficulties using the services, such as how many enter employment or how many are in secure housing.  Those are the types of indicators we should be developing as the basis for an information system. </p><p> A Vision for Change is a very strong policy document that is still relevant but it did not discuss gender mainstreaming in the mental health services and did not provide any guidance in that area.  That should be addressed in the current review of A Vision for Change.</p></speech>

In other words, a person can visit their friend or cousin, the front door is wider, the entrance is flat and there should be a downstairs bathroom, which is usually never accessible because it is under the stairs.  We are looking for accommodation to be liveable such that a person can get a house through social housing or privately that they can live in because it is wheelchair accessible.  It would have downstairs bathroom facilities - an accessible bathroom.  It is based on the needs of people with disabilities living in the community.  When the housing needs analysis was done there were over 4,000 people with disabilities on the housing list.  They were seen as being the biggest single group of people with a need for housing.</p></speech>

I am working with a girl with whom I went to school who had a very bad cycling accident when she was 27 and is now quadriplegic.  Her story is in the public domain.  She has given interviews to several papers.  She has been waiting four years to get a care package but it has not come through.  She is from Mayo.  She lives in a congregated setting in Sligo and cannot get out of it.  I am working with Mayo and Sligo county councils on the matter and public representatives from across the political divide are trying to resolve it.  We have been interacting with the different services for probably two and a half years.  The HSE has been abysmal in dealing with this.  Ms McCarthy said that when one person no longer needs the hours, they are divvied up between five or six people.  I gather Geraldine &ndash; I do not think she will mind me giving her name as it has already been made public - is on a waiting list indefinitely until somebody no longer needs a care package and she gets to use it.  That is the kind of response I get.  The local authorities said they could not get housing for her until the care package was in place.  It is a chicken-and-egg situation.</p><p>I have met both local authorities, as have Geraldine and her team, but we are no further along.  We have a ream of paper but no solution.  I have done searches on <i>daft.ie</i>, as have Geraldine and others, for properties to purchase in order to see what is being built.  There are two projects that have come through the planning process but it will be two years before they will be turnkey ready.  They are quite far out of the town so they are accessible but not inclusive.  How is she to live if she cannot get from her home to her place of work?  Thankfully, other factors are working out better than the accommodation.  Have the witnesses any suggestions on how to deal with the housing issue or what has their experience been?  What do we need to do to get a budget to deal with this?  I feel the local authorities would like to do more but one commented that they do not want to be competing in the private market and purchasing properties because they will then drive up the price for other buyers at a time when there is very little housing.  That does not help the person looking for the home.  I do not know where we will go from here.  We are still going back and forth.</p><p>Do the witnesses have any suggestions about the care package?  Is it simply a case that there are not enough to go around?  The personal assistant service is the same.  I could not agree more with the witness.  People are not being given the choice between the service, home help hours or care packages.  They are being told they are getting X number of hours in a particular context and that is it.  They might say they would like fewer home help hours and more personal assistant hours because they want to get out and have a coffee or to go to a play or something.  The choice does not seem to be there.</p><p>Have the witnesses seen what other countries have done in their budgetary processes to proof disability inequality?  What are their top two suggestions for what we could implement as disability proofing in budget 2019?</p></speech>

It may be worthwhile going that way.  For the medium term, there are personalised budgets.  The task force on personalised budgets has just completed its work and that report is now with the Minister of State with responsibility for disability.  There will be a commitment to piloting, for want of a better word, models of personalised budgets.  Geraldine could perhaps ask if hers could be one of the pilot cases.</p> <p>  There is a huge inequity in the experience of disability services depending on the disability.  Someone born with a disability is included in a cradle to grave approach, a wraparound concept of services.  If a person acquires a disability as they age it is much harder to access disability services.  It should not be that way.  The existing service models soak up between 80% and 90% of the budget.  Planning for unmet needs if a person's experience of disability changes is not incorporated into the planning and delivery of existing services.</p></speech>

The work has been done on the strategies but it is down to implementation and putting in place the proper amount of funding.  Over and over we hear this same problem about somebody who needs housing and personal assistant services, one cannot come without the other.  The HSE says in emergency circumstances it will put this funding in place but the person needs to have the house first, to have a permanent address.  The two Departments are not coming together to figure out the best way to put a service in place for an individual.  People are fighting over and over for services and that is wasting funding because of the professionals who get involved.</p><p>That in itself is wasting funding because of the professionals who get involved in this piece of work.  It is about Departments working together to identify what the need of the individual is, not working constantly in a silo.</p></speech>

In this case people are looking for support packages that will enable them to continue to live independently in the community.  We are carrying out research in Disability Federation Ireland on about 1,000 people under 65 years who have been inappropriately placed in nursing homes.  Although they are predominantly residences for older people, because there is nothing else available in the system, they have been placed in them.  That should not be the case.  There should be a raft of community supports and services, whether it be for someone with an acquired brain injury or someone under 65 years sufering from early-onset dementia.  There should be other options and packages available.  It also depends of demographics and data, about which someone asked earlier.  We are not planning in a way that is in keeping with the demographics.  We may not know the exact person who will have an acquired brain injury, but we know what the trends are across Europe and they are steady.  We should be able to use the data to inform our planning as opposed to waiting and reacting to priority issues.</p></speech>

Linked with what Ms Carthy and Dr. McCarthy have been saying, one of the really important measures that have been taken is an analysis of housing need and future needs.  Local authorities have been doing a lot more work in collecting data.  It will be very interesting to keep an eye on that space.</p> <p>  Something that also seems to have been working effectively is having liaison points between the local authorities and disability and mental health services.  The liaison officers are very aware of housing needs in their areas, the individuals who require housing and the particular things that need to be taken into account in making adaptations and so on.  However, there is also a requirement for training of local authority staff.  The individuals on the front line who are making assessments and allocation decisions need to be appropriately aware and trained in how to deal with disability and mental health issues.  There is much greater co-ordination between local authorities and disability and mental health services in that regard.  </p> <p>  On proofing and the position in other jurisdictions, there are other jurisdictions where mental health services are allocated funding at a much higher rate as a proportion of the total health budget.  In England and Canada it is at a proportion of about 13% and in New Zealand about 11%.  In Ireland we are at a figure of just 6% and that proportion has decreased during the years.  That issue certainly needs to be looked at as a priority.  In other jurisdictions they are also investing very much at the early stages.  They are seeing great returns on funding where they invest in the early years in perinatal mental health services.</p></speech>

Did they carry out any analysis of budget 2018 and the decisions made in it?  How are those decisions playing out during the current year?  The delegates mentioned the Parliamentary Budget Office.  What role would they like to see the office fulfilling in the disability proofing of budgets?  Have they been in contact with the director or any of the staff in the office to get them to work on the additional data that might be required?  In respect of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's programme on gender equality budgeting, would the delegates like to see a similar programme emerging for the disability proofing of budgets?  </p> <p>  On costings, I noticed that several of the presentations were looking forward to 2019 and up to 2021.  As Ms Carthy said, the personal assistant service is at the heart of some of the resources we need.  She mentioned a figure of 500,000 hours.  There was also a reference to the personal independence payment which has been introduced in the United Kingdom.  What is the delegates' attitude to it?  A costed disability payment was mentioned.  I remember proposing such a payment with other colleagues 15 or 20 years ago.  The suggestion has been made during the years.  What costings have the delegates made for 2019 onwards?</p></speech>

It is a really interesting pilot programme.  There is a responsibility to equality proof.  There is also more information on gender and greater clarity on the issues involved.  Six Departments decided to play ball and identify areas they would highlight in respect of gender proofing.  This has to be applauded.  The initiative came up in a previous hearing.  I also agree that they may not have been very ambitious in terms of the programmes that were to be tested.  Perhaps we might look to bring greater ambition to the process if we were to disability proof.  There was a lot of work done on indicators.  We have a national disability strategy implementation plan.  The detail is slightly outdated in the light of UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, but the high level goals are still in place.  We would have to look at strengthening the indicators in order that they would be more ambitious in the outcomes to be achieved for people with disabilities.  My answer to the Deputy is that it was a good attempt, but for our sector, we would like it to be more ambitious and would much prefer to see a more systemic analysis, testing how Departments are working across each other to support people in having really good lives in the community.</p></speech>

Such a person would be able to ensure all Departments were being pulled in in order that it would not end up falling within the remit of one Department.  That needs an overseer.  I hope that would help to produce the information we require.</p> <p>  On the key indicators, even at this level, it is a matter of looking at the unmet needs and the data.  They should be a starting point for the key performance indicators even before we get to measure the impact on people with disabilities.  We should include how we will gather the information we require as part of the KPIs.</p></speech>

The HSE has been very clear in its most recent operational plan that, owing to demographic changes, national pay agreements and various other factors, it will struggle to maintain existing levels of service within existing budgets and also struggle in the development of new services.</p><p>Development funding was allocated to the mental health sector in recent years to invest in new services that had been recommended in A Vision for Change.  We had a concern about the amount allocated and it was increased a little subsequently following liaison with Ministers.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, have committed to significant investment in mental health services in 2019 through the provision of &euro;55 million in development funds.  It is imperative that commitment be fulfilled.</p><p> On the role of the Parliamentary Budget Office, I mentioned that there was a massive issue in the mental health area in that there was no national information system.  A key role for the committee and the office would be in the provision of a direction and the oversight of budgetary decisions on mental health service funding and expenditure.</p></speech>

I have a specific question.  It is a small one, but it is arises a good deal.   </p> <p>  Growing children who are wheelchair users and perhaps have very severe disabilities, both physical and intellectual, often experience a long delay in being given a new wheelchair which may also be more advanced.  Do the delegates have views on how families could be assisted in that regard?  It is an important matter for them when they have a child living at home as he or she grows to become a teenager and an adult.  Do the delegates ideas on how that issue might be addressed better?  Certainly in my area, it can take a long time for someone to be given a new wheelchair.</p> <p>  We have quotas for the employment of people with disabilities, particularly young people who may have a physical disability, be highly qualified and are anxious to find employment.  Do the delegates consider the quotas to be adequate?  Do they consider they should be applied to larger places of employment in the private sector, as well as the public sector?  There are many bright people who have a physical disability but whose employment opportunities are heavily restricted simply because they do not even get to interview stage.  The Dublin Institute of Technology has taken a number of initiatives with a number of employers, but we do not have scale in the way other countries do.  Do the delegates have proposals in that regard?  </p> <p>  When I was in office, I spent much of my time encouraging the recreation of apprenticeships in Ireland, both new apprenticeships and, in particular, traditional apprenticeships which fell away in the financial collapse.  I asked employers, both in the public and private sector, about providing apprenticeships for people with disabilities which, unlike in other countries, do not feature very much on the radar.  Has any progress being made in that regard?  </p> <p>  Regarding Ms Joan Carthy's  comments on the personal assistant service, I was involved when the Centre for Independent Living was established many years ago.  The first allocation of funding came from the then Department of Social Welfare.  Do the delegates have views on where services should be located?  Would it be better if over a period of time, they were moved to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as in that way they would be part of income and life support, as opposed to medical support?  It is not about people with disabilities being ill but about having a condition in respect of which they require support.  I often felt like giving up on some of the detail in the Department of Health.</p></speech>

On the issue of income support, obviously, in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection it is accepted as such.  With respect to younger people, particularly those with mental health issues, what are the delegates' experiences in their being able to access income support and subsequently being able, as they choose to do on a voluntary basis, to access help and support through a community employment scheme?  How do the delegates see it progressing?</p></speech>

They often cannot access an advocate or bring one along with them to address some of the issues related to income support.  That is a significant issue.</p> <p>  People with mental health difficulties have the highest rates of unemployment in comparison with any other disability group.  More than 50% of participants in a recent study which was the subject of a report on disability allowance by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection reported mental health difficulties as being the reason they were in receipt of disability allowance.  A few issues arise in that regard.  For people with severe and sometimes enduring mental health difficulties, existing support and employment structures have not been successful in supporting them into employment.  The Government is looking at the provision of individual placement support which is the international evidence based approach to supporting individuals into employment and which has proved to be very effective in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, France and Australia.  For individuals on the more moderate scale of mental health difficulties, there is more flexibility in supporting them to enter employment and sustaining them in it.  These supports are available within the work environment to ensure they do not fall out of work or, if they do, that they can be supported back into work quickly.</p></speech>

They need to be brought forward in the private sector also.  Account needs to be taken of the services that assist people into employment.  It could involve the personal assistant service, the provision of a medical card, transport and so on.  Like any other issue that comes up, employment requires a cross-departmental approach. There needs to be greater awareness across the private sector of the ability of people with disabilities and their untapped talent.  Account also needs to be taken of all of the other services that need to be put in place for some people to help them get back into employment.</p> <p>  To respond to the question about the assessment of need for young children who need new equipment as they grow, that happens across the board, whether it be for a young or an older person who needs extra services or equipment.  It comes down to a lack of funding.  There is no magic wand, other than carrying out of an appropriate and timely assessment and funding being put in place to enable the equipment to be made available to the individual concerned.</p></speech>

We want them because we want to give people good opportunities to find employment, but they are definitely not high enough.  We were not ambitious enough when we put them in place, even within the public sector.</p><p>The other problem in that we do not track and often people go in at entry level and get stuck there.  There are some basic issues with courses which we need to address before we even begin to look at broadening this and making it the responsibility of the private sector.  We need to figure out where it is currently at and then use that information to go further.  The private sector does have a role to play around employment and supporting people with disabilities into employment.  This is about the incentives and supports that we put in place to enable employers in the private sector to feel confident and comfortable around employing people with disabilities.  We need to learn from the courses in place and why they are not working. </p><p> On which Department is best placed to work alongside the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, would like that to be the Department of the Taoiseach.  We feel it is our time.  The existing national disability strategy is 12 years old and it was hammered throughout the recession and is way behind where it should be.  We believe the Department of the Taoiseach now needs to row in behind this strategy.  In terms of a systemic approach, only the Taoiseach's office can demand that Departments work together.  The view within the disabilities sector is that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection should be the lead Department because it is about the lived experience and day-to-day issues such as income, employment and so on but that no one Department can resolve disability issues.  In transferring responsibility from the Department of Health to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection we might be repeating the same experiences we have had to date in terms of the latter being able to answer everything.  If that is the case, that is not the answer.  What we need is an implementation plan led by two or three Departments.  The initiative taken by another committee - whereby the Departments of Health, Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Education and Skills have come together, in terms of dealing with a person's health to see what he or she requires in terms of personal social services or to enable him or her to go on to further education and then on to employment, and in terms of income - is interesting.  We all know the additional costs associated with having a disability.  This type of interface between Departments would enable people to be equal and active.   </p></speech>

What I heard loud and clear from all them is that we need to rid ourselves of the silos and to ensure interconnectedness between Departments on disability issues.  Dr. McCarthy suggested that the Department of the Taoiseach should be the link Department, which is a straightforward request we can make.  It makes sense.</p> <p>  On the lack of personal assistant supports and mental health services, is the biggest problem in terms of getting additional personal assistant hours a resistance to allocating bigger budgets or is there also recruitment issues?  I have heard through my colleague Deputy Gino Kenny that in mental health services, recruiting and retaining staff is a huge problem.  What do we need to do in this space and what are the budgetary implications of trying to address the problem of recruiting staff in these areas?  We hear a lot from the Government now that money is not an object yet, it appears, services remain unable to recruit staff.  Something is an obstacle.  Is it that the pay and conditions for the people we need to recruit in these areas are not what they should be and, consequently, people do not work in them or there is a high staff turnover?  I would welcome a comment on this issue.</p> <p>    I am struck by the comments on the housing issue.  I am concerned for all sorts of reasons, as are many of others, about the over-dependence of the Government's Rebuilding Ireland strategy on the private sector, primarily because I do not think it is capable of delivering.  It was mentioned that we also cannot depend on the private sector to provide accessible accommodation.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on that point and also on the fact that there is no requirement on private developers to ensure a percentage of its housing is accessible housing, which is clearly something we should be pushing for.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that medical cards are granted based on people's needs and the high cost of prescriptions and so on.  On transport, is free travel for people with disabilities an issue?  Senator Dolan's office recently contacted my office about a lady in my area who is non-verbal and was issued a fine for not having a valid parking ticket, which was later quashed following intervention by Senator Dolan's office.  As I turned out, I knew the person.  I could not believe this happened.  This lady cannot get a free travel pass for public transport.  Is automatic entitlement to free travel for people with disabilities an ask of the Disability Federation of Ireland?</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, it is bonkers.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment.  I think the issue for this lady is that she is not eligible for a free travel pass because she is not in receipt of a disability payment, which is crazy.  That she was issued with a fine is also crazy.</p></speech>

Perhaps the witnesses would also comment on this issue.</p></speech>

On the personal assistants service, PAS, there is a resistance to funding the service.  On the employment of personal assistants, there is need for a review of what people are earning and how we can entice people into the service.  From the Irish Wheelchair Association's point of view, a large number of our personal assistants are on low contracts and, with additional funding, they would be able to take on more hours.  These are the people we need.</p><p>There is a problem with taking in other people.  There is also a problem relating to people who are on social welfare.  If they try to come from social welfare to work in a personal assistance service, as we can only take people on for a low number of hours due to the lack of funding for services, they cannot give up their social welfare payment.  They are caught in that position where they cannot come away from jobseeker's allowance or such to take up work because we do not have the extra funding.  It is a catch-22 situation.  Another issue relates to pay restoration and the funding that should be coming down the track to pay for the personal assistants who received wage cuts.  That has not been restored and is an issue.  There are people working for the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA, and other services who could easily take on more hours if the funding is provided.</p><p> There is a report from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport relating to the pilot project launched for the DART in late January and early February.  The report looks positive but a big part of the problem is that people find it difficult to report when things go wrong on Irish Rail's website.  People with disabilities are not really that great for putting in those complaints.  I do not think it will be a real reflection of what is happening.  As part of the pilot project, the 24 hour notice period was reduced to four hours but staff have been taken out of the stations and stations have been hubbed, so one person might cover four stations, and one still has to ring and hopefully somebody will be there.  What happens, more often than not, is that somebody might be there to get a person on to the DART but there might not be somebody at the other end to get a person off, which in itself is a huge problem.  A couple of organisations came together to push that with Irish Rail.  We are keeping an eye on the reports and on our own members and any issues they have so that we can report back separately to Irish Rail's report.</p></speech>

There is also the ongoing issue with the differences between section 38 and section 39 bodies.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of that and the impact it is having.  We know that there is a process under way that is looking at just that.  It is definitely an issue of how we employ and retain staff.  Do not forget that we invest in training and supports and want to build a healthy pool of staff that can support and enable people with disabilities.  If one cannot retain staff, that is hugely problematic and very unsettling for people with disabilities who are dependent on a very personal relationship and often intimate care.  It is hugely unsettling for them if we cannot sort this out so that they can be confident about their access to services going forward.</p> <p>  On housing, we all know that it is meant to be based on the disability steering group's input and the assessment of social housing needs.  That is supposed to be happening from local authority to local authority but it is not.  This has been identified and the Housing Agency is looking at this going forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Mitchell" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2018042400002#J00300"><p>I will pick up on the Deputy's question about staffing in mental health services.  He is correct that there are massive challenges with recruitment and retention in mental health services.  In general adult services, we only have about 75% of what is required, and the situation is much more dire in child and adolescent mental health services, with only about 51% of the required staff in post.  That has massive implications for staff and for people and families accessing services, with waiting times, quality of services and so on.  Pay and conditions are an issue.  It is difficult for Ireland to keep pace and to compete with other jurisdictions such as Canada, Australia and even the UK.  We see many of our graduates moving to other jurisdictions to work in the mental health space.  The conditions are also an issue.  We regularly hear from professionals that they do not want to commit to work in a service where they know they will not have the full complement of staffing.  There are also issues relating to promotional opportunities.  It is an issue that extends beyond the HSE and Department of Health to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We need to look at pay and conditions in mental health services.  Mental Health Reform has advocated for a new way of thinking and a new way of looking at service delivery for quite some time.  There has been a strong emphasis for a long time on the recruitment of medical staff, nurses and psychiatrists.  There needs to be more of an emphasis on recruitment for other disciplines such as occupational therapists, psychologists and social care workers.  There is also an emphasis on the community and voluntary sector.  They play a fundamental role and there is space for investment in that area and for peer-led community mental health services. </p></speech>

It is very short.  I forgot about it with the initial questions.  When refugees come into the country, do the witnesses keep an eye on the extent to which, as part of our refugee resettlement and acceptance programmes, we try to assist people with disabilities?  I ask because I am dealing with a family from Gaza who are in Turkey.  Four of them are severely disabled.  They cannot go back to Gaza, for obvious reasons, and are stranded in Turkey.  I am trying to see if I can help them to resettle here.  Is there any focus on that?  I suppose the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Department of Justice and Equality deal with that.  Do we ensure that we help people with disabilities who are looking to come into the country through resettlement or otherwise?</p></speech>

On a bigger policy piece or us reaching out in some way, that is not happening.  I do not know whether it is happening on a wider basis.</p></speech>

That includes people from ethnic minority groups, including refugees.  There are significant barriers there with regard to help-seeking behaviours among people from ethnic minority groups, language barriers, and being able to access appropriate and culturally sensitive services.  There is a question of whether we are delivering culturally sensitive mental health services and to what extent.  There is a significant amount of work to do in that area.</p></speech>

For example, I know of what was previously called the Post Polio Support Group.

The organisation has to rethink the services and supports it offers.  I support my colleagues in saying that service-providing organisations definitely feel those issues on the front line.

I am accompanied by colleagues from the Department.  Mr. Frank Maughan is head of climate mitigation and awareness, Mr. Eamonn Confrey is head of electricity policy division and Ms. Rebecca Minch is head of energy efficiency and affordability division.  I also acknowledge our colleagues from the EPA and SEAI.</p> <p>  The Government published its first statutory national mitigation plan, NMP, in July 2017, explicitly recognising that it does not represent a complete roadmap to achieving the objective of transitioning Ireland to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050.  The mitigation plan begins the process of development of medium to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades.  Importantly, the national mitigation plan is a living document that will be updated as ongoing analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  Policy development and implementation will happen in parallel. </p> <p>  Climate mitigation policy requires strong governance and accountability including oversight by the Oireachtas, independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council and co-ordination across Government supported by continuing investment and robust technical and analytical input.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 requires relevant Ministers to present an annual transition statement to both Houses of the Oireachtas setting out details of measures and actions, and their effectiveness.  A climate action high-level steering committee, chaired by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and meeting quarterly, drives ongoing policy development and implementation.  It has met twice to date.  The technical research and modelling group, TRAM, chaired at assistant secretary level and meeting monthly, provides the necessary analytical support.  The committee has identified 45 actions as being relevant to its work today.  A separate briefing note was provided in advance on progress on these actions and we look forward to engaging with the committee on them.  </p> <p>  In terms of ongoing policy implementation and development, and building on the national mitigation plan, it is important to highlight the publication in February of the national development plan, NDP, which will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade to address the significant climate mitigation challenges that Ireland faces.  It provides for a strong focus on strategic investments in the areas of transport, renewable energy, grid development and interconnection, and the built environment.  Almost &euro;21 billion, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, will be directed to addressing the transition to a low-carbon society.  In addition, the NDP allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.  This capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030. </p> <p>  Preparation of the national energy and climate plan, NECP, which is an EU requirement, is at an early stage, with a draft to be finalised by the end of 2018 and the final plan to be developed by end-2019.  In terms of climate mitigation policy, the NECP will need to align with and, where possible, build on the NMP and the NDP.  Given the significant investment priorities already identified in the NDP, the NECP is likely to have to look to taxation, regulation and behavioural change actions and measures to further develop mitigation policy at this juncture. </p> <p>  Decarbonisation will involve fundamental societal transformation, as well as ongoing engagement with society through the national dialogue on climate action, NDCA.  The central objective of the dialogue is to create awareness, engagement and the motivation to act across society. Under the dialogue, a climate ambassador programme commenced in September 2017, a climate action week took place in October 2017, a green schools expo was held on 22 February 2018, and the EPA hosted a series of lectures on climate action policy.  An advisory group has been established by the Minister to input into the organisation of regional and local events that will be piloted shortly. </p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Dr. Matthew Crowe, director of the office of evidence and assessment, and Dr. Stephen Treacy, a senior scientist.  We welcomed the publication of the national mitigation plan and are supporting its implementation through the actions assigned to us and through our broader climate functions and responsibilities, which are listed in our submission.  We now see a robust policy framework in place through the national mitigation plan, the national adaptation framework and the national development plan.  We can now move to implementation and action as we address climate change.</p> <p>  I will give a high-level overview of greenhouse gas emissions trends before handing over to Dr. Crowe.  Overall, greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland are increasing and that is making achievement of our decarbonisation goals ever more difficult.  In 2016, the latest year for which we have numbers, our greenhouse gas emissions increased by 3.6% and we recorded increases across all the main sectors of the economy.  Agriculture, for example, increased by 2.7%, transport by 4.1%, and energy industry emissions - mainly power generation - increased by 6%.  When we look out to 2020 and our commitments to the EU effort-sharing decision, we are moving off the pathway and trajectory required to meet those targets.  In fact, in 2016 we exceeded our annual binding limits for greenhouse gas emissions.  Those figures and the national emissions projections that we publish every year show that we are faced with challenges in terms of meeting those targets and our aspirations under our national policy position.  If we are to move on to a sustainable trajectory, we need to implement all of the measures that are in our national mitigation plan.</p></speech>

However, we also need to get the balance right between the urgency of getting on with the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy and society and making the right decisions for the future.</p><p>There are many challenges ahead, but there are also many opportunities for Ireland.  If we get this right, Ireland can be a leader in this transition, which we can discuss further later.  Many of the EPA actions in the national mitigation plan are in the research area.  The committee will be aware that the EPA co-ordinates environmental protection research on behalf of the State, and has been doing so since 1994.  It has also been funding climate change research for over a decade.  This is helping to build capacity and knowledge foundation in our universities, colleges and institutions that can support this transition.  The EPA makes an annual call for proposals in three areas, water, climate and sustainability, the most recent of which was made yesterday in respect of 2018.  We have a number of co-ordination committees, involving the funding agencies, Departments and agencies, that help us with our work.</p><p> Action 11 is to co-ordinate the production of an annual report on climate change research from the National Climate Research Co-ordination Group.  We have also been tasked with developing a periodic assessment of key findings of that research every five years.  We are currently scoping out those two reports and we expect the first report will be published in 2019.</p><p> Actions 78 and 90, on which we are co-lead with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, are around building our knowledge base on carbon neutrality in an Irish context.  In the call announced yesterday, we have called for proposals in this area.  Regarding action 8, climate dialogue, the EPA will have a supporting role in establishing and running the national climate dialogue.  We are in the process of hiring three staff to establish a secretariat to support the Department and the advisory group in that work.  We look forward to our role in the climate dialogue.</p></speech>

We also perform an analysis and design support role to the Department with regard to policies and, separately, SEAI is the statutory body mandated to prepare Ireland's energy statistics and energy projections.</p> <p>  In terms of SEAI's vision, simply put, we would like Irish society to use less electricity and energy generally, to use cleaner energy and also to innovate.  Increasingly, we are seeing a convergence of these three activities, particularly around the human in the home, the car and in small businesses.</p> <p>  In terms of the national mitigation plan specifically, we set a tracker for all of the national mitigation plan activities, including those specifically tasked to SEAI as the primary correspondent and those where we could provide support.  We examined all of the timelines and, separately, sought activities where we could support other agencies and catalyse an increased or accelerated pathway for their own activities.  We see this is a minimum bar for performance as opposed to a limit of our ambition.  </p> <p>  In terms of the specific activities allocated to us, they are all on track, bar one.  The only deviation from that one is that we determined with external expertise and with the Department that a lower than anticipated sample size was required for the warmth and wellbeing scheme.  I will outline some of the highlights.  With regard to the warmth and wellbeing pilot scheme, which looks at the co-benefits of energy efficiency, we are working with the HSE, the Department of Health and our line Department to determine what health benefits there may be from energy efficiency upgrades.  With regard to the excellence in energy efficiency design, EXEED, programme, a building was launched last week by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, which moved from a C1 energy rating to an A2 energy rating, resulting in 60% to 65% savings.  With regard to the behavioural economics unit, its first report will be published in May.  These analyses over 100 different interventions worldwide in sustainable energy with empirical results and will provide recommendations to a variety of Departments and other bodies in Ireland on how we could engage behavioural economics in the design of our policy.  We have also started engaging more with the OPW, the Department of Education and Skills, and public sector bodies to show that leadership role.</p> <p>  The key messages with regard to the national mitigation plan activities is that they are all achieved or on track and, separately, we see it as a minimum bar of performance as opposed to a target.  I am sure that throughout our discussion I will elaborate further on some of the activities we have done in addition to this minimum bar that will touch on a lot of the points raised at the Citizens' Assembly, for example, and in respect of other activities on which we work with other Departments. </p></speech>

The climate change advisory council published a report last December in which it criticised the plan and stated that it is not sufficient to put Ireland on a pathway to achieving its 2020 targets or long-term decarbonisation objective.  Do the officials accept that criticism and, if so, what steps are they taking in that regard?</p> <p>  I thank the SEAI for its presentation.  I think the authority is doing well in terms of completing its tasks.  I have a particular interest in the retrofit pilot.  During previous appearances before the committee the SEAI outlined the expense involved in relation to the pilot.  I note from today's presentation that SEAI hopes to have a further 100 homes completed this year.  Perhaps Mr. Gannon would explain the reason for the small scale of the project and why only a further 100 homes are expected to be completed this year.</p> <p>  In regard to the EPA, I am interested in the issue of methane emissions, particularly from livestock.  Is the agency aware of the Canadian and Australian research by James Cook University of Queensland and James Cook University Australia in particular which found that the addition of a less than 2% dried seaweed to a cow's diet could reduce methane emissions by as much as 99% and if Teagasc or any other body is working on that research?  It seems too good to be true but I would welcome the witnesses' views on the issue.  </p> <p>  I will invite Deputy Stanley and Deputy Dooley to put their questions at this point, following which the witnesses can respond to all three sets of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.77" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018042400002#D00500"><p>I thank the delegations for their presentations.  My first question is to the Department officials.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the national mitigation plan is not fit-for-purpose and lacks specific actions to bring us on the journey on which we need to go over the next two years, 12 years and 32 years up to 2050, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  Does the Department have specific plans to immediately revise the plan?  According to the EPA, and all the other bodies involved in this area, we will over-shoot our 2020 targets.  What specific actions are being planned by the Department to accelerate a reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions?</p> <p>  In regard to the SEAI, leaving aside waste generation, power generation is where the lion's share of our emissions come from.  In terms of the move from large-scale generation to micro-generation from renewable sources such as solar, prices in Ireland are the fourth highest in the EU.  I brought forward a Bill dealing with micro-generation, which I am sure the witnesses have reviewed.  I would be interested in hearing their views on the Bill and on how households and small businesses can become involved in generating electricity, which is common practice in other countries.  While some people in the industry would say that the cost of transitioning will be high, as I said, prices here are already the fourth highest in the EU and we have not yet started the journey of transitioning to renewable fuels.  Perhaps the witnesses would comment.</p> <p>  Competition in the market is around switching rather than the cost of electricity.</p><p> The EPA representatives said in their presentations that greenhouse gas emissions are projected to increase.  What recent proposals or specific plans are going forward from Government to help to reduce emissions?  Specifically, I want to refer the question back to the Department.  From what we can see, the national mitigation plan is lacking in specific actions.  I argued the point at this committee four or five years ago when we were dealing with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development legislation.  The fact that the Act did not have binding sectoral targets was a fatal flaw.  What is the EPA view on setting specific sectoral targets for the electricity production, heat and transport industries?  Do we need to do that?  It is worth pointing out that our biofuel usage has decreased by 8% and in some ways we are going backwards.  At this point do we need to set specific sectoral targets to move on?  Much of this is coming from the generation of power and we need to start taking action in that area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.80" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Carroll" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018042400002#E00300"><p>I will address the Climate Change Advisory Council view that we will not meet our 2020 targets.  The Department accepts that in terms of the latest Environmental Protection Agency emissions projections, which have been outlined.  We are going to be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels as against the target of 20% below 2005 levels.  There are reasons for this, including reduced investment capacity over the period of the economic downturn.</p> <p>  It is worth making several points about the national mitigation plan and some of the criticism that is being levelled against it.  The document was published in July 2017.  It is a direct and honest document.  It quite clearly stated the scale of the problem.  It recognised that we would not meet our 2020 target.  It also set down measures that we have in place and measures under consideration.  It was a real statement.  It also recognised its own inadequacy in terms of not setting out a complete pathway to decarbonise by 2050.  Given the challenge to decarbonise by 2050, not to mind 2020 or 2030 targets, and the way technology changes so rapidly, it would not be possible to set out a clear pathway all the way to 2050.  What the national mitigation plan said was that it would become a living document, a first step.  It was not the case that the plan was in place and set in stone and that we could move to implementation.  We are implementing but we are constantly developing policy at the same time.</p> <p>  It may be unfair to say that there is a lack of specific detail in the mitigation plan.  There are 106 actions, some of them very important in terms of enabling us to move forward with climate mitigation policy.  A total of 61 sectoral measures were in place and 17 sectoral measures were under consideration.</p> <p>  The national development plan makes good on the promise that mitigation policy will be developed on an ongoing basis or that the national mitigation plan will become a living document.  In the national development plan, &euro;22 billion is earmarked for climate mitigation investment.  Some &euro;8 billion of this is Exchequer investment while &euro;14 billion is non-Exchequer.  That investment will make a significant impact in decarbonising in the period to 2030, but we will still continue to develop policy on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  I will set out a flavour of some of the things in the national development plan.  There is an objective to have 500,000 electronic vehicles on the road by 2030.  From 2030 onwards fossil-fuelled cars will not be allowed to be sold in Ireland and from 2045 there will be no NCT certificates issued for such cars.  The plan aims to increase the retrofitting of houses to 45,000 per annum to BER B rating, which is a deep level of retrofitting.  We know that 500,000 houses are remote from the gas grid and largely reliant on fossil fuels for heating.  The plan is for 170,000 of these to be transitioned to sustainable heating by 2030.</p> <p>  The national mitigation plan was the first step.  We said we would continue to develop policy.  The national development plan is the next iteration, within the climate priority, of the development of mitigation policy.  There is an EU requirement to develop a national energy and climate plan.  Again, that will give us further opportunity to bring forward new policy, possibly looking at the areas of taxation and regulation.</p></speech>

The point I am trying to raise is that we are not even going to go a quarter of the distance we need to go in reducing greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2020.  According to the EPA, and the Department agreed with the appraisal today, at best we will reach 4% to 6% of the targeted reduction, whereas in fact we should be at 20% of it.</p> <p>  Every time we raise the point, we hear about what is planned and the &euro;21 billion and so on.  The problem is the slow pace.  We are not even off the blocks on solar power.  We have not even got into offshore wind yet.  We are still messing around with public transport.  I heard the ambitious figures for electric cars but, my God, we are making a slow start with it.  That is the point I am making.  This needs to be actioned and accelerated, taking on board the point that we are only one quarter of the way there.</p></speech>

We are only going to get about a quarter of the way to the 2020 target.  We had reduced investment capacity over the period of the economic downturn.  We need to start moving faster and accelerating policy.  The national mitigation plan, the national development plan and the national energy and climate plan, which is forthcoming, are part of that process.  We need to start looking out to 2030.  We need to ensure we are in a position to meet our 2030 target and try our best to exceed that target.  What is in the national development plan represents a step change and it is a commitment to significant additional investment.</p> <p>  Over 50% of transport emissions come from private journeys.  Having 500,000 electric vehicles on the road will make a big impact on that.  We need investment in public transport in our cities for modal shift.  Public passenger transport accounts for approximately 4% of transport emissions.  My colleague from the electricity policy division may wish to come in with a comment on the electricity sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.84" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Confrey" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018042400002#E00700"><p>Deputy Stanley mentioned two specific things around microgeneration.  I know the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will probably want to come in on this point.  The Minister announced in January his proposal for a microgeneration scheme in the summer, which will be a first phase.  That will start at the domestic level for domestic consumption only.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanley has published draft legislation.  Some of my colleagues have been talking to Deputy Stanley's team on the outline of the Bill.  There are many good points in that Bill that the Minister is keen to try to facilitate where we can do so.</p> <p>  We are working closely with SEAI on gathering the evidence and the appetite among the public for the take-up of domestic microgeneration.  Our sense is that there is a good deal of enthusiasm, but we want to do it on a phased basis to ensure we get it right.  We want to ensure that we do not necessarily make some of the mistakes that we have seen in other jurisdictions.  That is very much the plan at the domestic level.</p> <p>  More broadly, solar photovoltaics technology has been assessed as part of the new renewable electricity support scheme.  Again, Deputy Stanley probably will be aware that we undertook a major consultation in this area and a second and final consultation late last year.  The Minister's intention is to go to Government for approval of the overall scheme design shortly.</p><p>Thereafter, we will begin the formal state aid notification process.</p><p> According to international analysis, the costs of solar PV have decreased dramatically over the past six or seven years and the indications from the International Renewable Energy Agency, IRENA, and others suggest that costs still have a way to travel in terms of reductions.  This is good because while electricity support schemes do not have a direct Exchequer impact since they are funded through the PSO levy, we are keen to ensure that we do not lock in too high in respect of some of these technologies.  The indications are that solar PV costs will continue to fall, which is good, and that it will have a role over the next decade and out to 2030 because, as Mr. Carroll mentioned, the targets are challenging in all sectors.</p><p> The cost trajectory for offshore wind energy generation is positive.  Costs continue to fall and there is renewed interest in a number of projects, particularly on the east coast, among developers who would like to take the projects forward.  Offshore wind has also been assessed as part of the new support scheme.  We are encouraged by the trajectory of prices and we are working closely with colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the necessary legislation for future offshore renewable energy because of the licensing and consenting process that will be needed.  The Minister will be going to Government shortly in respect of the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS.</p><p> The other issue related to biofuels.  Last Friday, the Minister announced his intention to increase the biofuels obligation to 10% by volume as of 1 January 2019 and to increase it again to 11% from 1 January 2020.  A policy document was published by the Department on that front on Friday evening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.86" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gannon" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018042400002#F00200"><p>I will reply to the Chairman's question first.  With regard to the 100 homes and our deep retrofit pilot scheme - as opposed to the more commoditised schemes under which we have, over the past few years, decarbonised the offering and upped the performance level required in tens of thousands of homes annually - this will build an evidence base for policy decision-making.  We are establishing the level of performance required in the housing stock by 2050 to meet our carbon goals and then we are looking at the different home types within that - be they apartments, rural cottages or semi-detached houses in Dublin - and asking which technology solution gives the best return on investment for either the Exchequer or the individual, whether the supply chain is robust enough to deliver that solution, what an individual will think about the value of that and whether he or she can finance it.  We are interacting with the European Investment Bank and high-street banks to establish how we get finance to individuals if not through a grant or tax incentive scheme.  We need to do a small number of tests and to go deeper for that.  That is why the numbers appear low for the scheme but it is targeted.</p> <p>  On Deputy Stanley's queries, it is inevitable that we will see an electrification of heating and transport in people's homes in particular.  The cost curves of technologies are helping that to happen.  Solar PV costs have reduced by 85% in the past five years while the cost of electric vehicles, although incentivised, is narrowing and will continue to do so.  What is telling in that industry is that the manufacturers are sending the same signals as governments regarding the fact that they will stop making diesel and petrol engine cars over time.  They will lead the consumer because we are all consumers and we are convinced sometimes that a mobile phone is worth $1,000 because we are told that is the case.  If the products we are offered move in the direction of electric vehicles, we will buy them.</p> <p>  In addition to this cost curve and consumer offering, the EU brought out a clean energy package prior to Christmas 2016 which articulated three principles, namely: people should have a right to generate electricity in their home; a right to export; and a right to a market price.  It is not clear how that will come about down the line but it is coming.  Part of the tests we will run when we satisfy the request from the Department to run a solar PV grant scheme for homes will examine that.  For example, if a human was to receive a payment from the grid or have an electric vehicle in their home or a battery in their home how that would that work?  Our focus will be on having people deal with their homes first before turning them into a business.  They should examine their consumption and how to improve that.  That will be knitted into our general programme.  We will also work with companies such as the ESB to ensure that transformers on estates will be able to deal with that demand and to research the cost of that because the electricity system will be used in a way that it has not been previously.  We need to make sure the balance of costs, if we give individuals this opportunity, is appropriate and does not increase prices too much.</p> <p>  I will now deal with the cost of electricity, large-scale renewables and auction systems internationally.  We currently have a feed-in tariff system.  The auction systems force private sector companies to bid against one another in a competitive process to provide a renewable electricity service.  The premium Ireland should have to pay for that should continue to decrease for the consumer such that the loading on to the consumer will discontinue.  However, that will take time to catch on.  Ireland is a costly country in which to do business.  Our licensing and consenting schemes are complex and there is uncertainty about timelines, particularly in the offshore sphere.  The work being done by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department under whose aegis we sit is, therefore, important and timely.  There is increasing interest in projects off the eastern and western coasts on the part of not only technology developers but of finance houses that do not generally care where they put their money to work.  It is important that the opportunity is recognised in Ireland and that we leverage from that.</p> <p>  Switching rates comes under the remit of the CRU.  Its officials are doing work with the PRICE Lab on that and how to make it easy and clear for people to switch.  We are supporting them in that work through our behavioural economics unit and will continue to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Matthew Crowe" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018042400002#F00300"><p>I will deal with the agriculture question.  There is no silver bullet.  My understanding is that that was discovered on a farm close to the coast.  The cattle were grazing on a particular type of seaweed and then the farmer noticed differences in them.  Work is ongoing.  There is a possibility of an additive that could be fed to animals being developed at some point.  However, additives have many downsides, including the possibility of trace elements being left.  There are food supply issues which have to be thought through in this regard as well .  Ireland's agriculture system is extensive.  The animals are outside eating grass most of the year.  This type of thing might be applicable in Ireland but it may be more applicable in systems where animals are indoors most of the time and fed in a different way.  The issue for the EPA in respect of agriculture in the context of the plan is the policy statement states, "Developing an approach to carbon neutrality for agriculture and land use, including forestry, that does not compromise sustainable food production".  That is a complex sentence.  What we want to see - and we will work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc and others - is the approach figured out sooner rather than later.  This will get us into the issue of the balance between the way the land is used for agriculture and forestry and how peatlands are used and getting a much better understanding of how our land performs overall in terms of carbon.  Depending on how it is managed, land can absorb carbon and be a sink for it or it can release carbon into the atmosphere.</p><p>We need to become a lot more knowledgeable on this issue in order that we can start to plan for carbon neutrality, where land in Ireland is managed in a way that it will be a net sink for carbon as opposed, in some cases, to being a source, as it is currently, particularly in the case of peatlands and the manner in which they are managed.  We would like to see the plan developed sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

They were published last year and showed a shortfall in meeting our 2020 targets.  We are working on updating the numbers, but the overall message remains relevant.  On what we would like to see happen to bridge the gap to our targets, what is required is full implementation of the national mitigation plan and delivery on the ambitions and commitments contained in it.  As policies and measures are developed and elaborated on by Departments, we are reliant on them to give us the detail in order that we can work them into our projections and analyses and thus determine how we are doing in following the trajectory to meeting our 2020 targets and outwards.  We are here to talk about overall implementation of the national mitigation plan.</p> <p>  On the individual sectors and what we would like to see happen, we have already touched on many of the issues which arise.  Heat and transport are the two most difficult sectors.  On the heat side, what is required is a combination of energy efficiency, about which we have heard much today, and a ramping up of the scale of energy efficiency in buildings and businesses, while also looking at the use of cleaner renewable energy.  The Government has already committed to providing a renewable heat incentive which should help us to make strides on the heating side.  </p> <p>  On transport and the ambitions in the use of biofuels, again, a combination of measures is required.  Transport is a really difficult sector.  It is about the use of alternative fuels and technologies such as electric vehicles and also looking at other issues outside technology, including integrating land use planning and transport investment.  Much of our investment has already happened in this space.  As we look to the future, we must ensure that where we build houses, businesses and schools we have transport investment such that the reliance on private cars will be reduced.  This may include the provision of fiscal incentives.  We have seen some success in the rebalancing of VRT and motor tax rates to encourage people to buy cleaner vehicles.  It is always going to about be a suite measures.  There will never be one solution.  These are really difficult sectors in which to achieve progress.  Given their dispersed nature, we will need to move on all fronts.  The national mitigation plan provides us with the start.</p></speech>

The departmental review of this issue is quite depressing.  I direct that view towards the Government rather than the officials present.  The Government has not shown the political will needed to address what is now a crisis based on what the EPA had to state.  We have known for some time the extent to which we are going to miss our targets.  For a while there was a denial at Government level that we would miss them.  The expectation was that we would catch up, but it has been known for some time that this is not going to happen.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for the departmental officials.  Has the cost, in terms of the fines we will have to pay for missing our targets, been estimated.  Has there been any advance planning in that regard?  When do the officials think we will hit our 2020 targets?  Given that we know that we will not do so in 2020, in what year are we likely to hit them?  On reading through the material provided by the Department it crossed my mind that, just like the gambling addict, we were putting everything on the next race, namely, the 2030 targets, even though we have not figured out how to address the 2020 targets.  The presentation is peppered with ifs, buts and maybes.  We know that technology is improving, but 2025 is beyond the cycle of the Government and many of us here.  It appears that the Department is in the position of not being able to do anything.  It cannot bring forward proposals that would make a serious stab at addressing the crisis; therefore, it is pushing the issue out to the future and hoping for the best.  At that time it will be somebody else's problem.  If one takes that approach, whoever is in government in 2025 could take the same approach because at that time there will be different technologies and new ways of doing things.  That has always been the standard cover for not doing anything and leaving an issue for somebody else to address.  </p> <p>  I have considerable sympathy for the departmental officials, given the Government's lack of support for them.  There is a lot of talk, as well as a lot of plans, dates and acronyms, but no action.  Some work is being done by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, in developing pilot programmes and projects, but I do not get the impression that there is money available to roll them out in a meaningful way.  We still have the Government buying diesel buses because, we are told, the alternatives will be cheaper at a later stage.  Some 120 diesel buses were purchased recently.  We are told that the next fleet of buses will use an alternative fuel or be battery operated and thus be more economical.  I have been hearing about 50,000 electric vehicles for a long time, but nothing has materialised.  Anybody who takes an interest in this issue and reads the blogs will know that the people who have bought such cars would readily part with them in the morning if they could do so.  The reality is that the infrastructure to support fast-charging is not in place.  The issue is not range anxiety but range reality because no effort is being made at a central level to support those who have made the shift.  We know how behaviour has changed.  It is about ensuring the people who make a change will be supported, but those who have bought electric vehicles have not and are not being supported.  My eyes glaze over when I hear the Minister make announcements about electric vehicles and the provision of support for their purchase.  There was nothing in the budget in that regard.  There was talk about benefit-in-kind being eliminated for three or five years, yet in the Finance Act it was only captured for 12 months, with a review promised with a view to it being continued for a further three years, which is ridiculous.  Companies that are buying fleets need certainty, but there is not that certainty.  All we are getting is lip-service and announcements.  The Government is great at doing that, but the people who are attempting to change their behaviour are not being supported.</p> <p>  Perhaps all of the delegations might get together, with a view to identifying three or four steps that they would take that would have a meaningful impact in addressing the 2020 targets.  It is not acceptable for the Government to state - again, I am not attributing this to Mr. Carroll, but he is here representing the Minister and the Government - that we are only one quarter of the way there, that there was a downturn and that there is nothing we can do.  When will the targets be reached and is there anything the Department can do to fast-track its approach to getting closer to the targets than what is anticipated?</p></speech>

Wearing another hat, I know that, when completed, the proposed data centre in Athenry will add between 6% and 8% to Ireland's electricity consumption.  There were plans - I do not know if they are still in place - to have at least four such centres in Ireland, which, on the face of it, would look like an uplift of between 28% and 35% in our electricity demand.  I appreciate that electricity demand differs in that some of it is constant, while there are also peaks and troughs.  It appears that IDA Ireland has been pursuing a policy of attracting data centres to Ireland and that it is Government policy, writ large, that Departments seek to attract multinational data industry investment to Ireland.</p><p>On the other hand, since we are talking about an increase of 32% or 28% from four centres or plants alone in Ireland, someone seems not to be talking the same language as other people.  We have to make up our minds.  Do we want data centres in Ireland?  Do we want to increase our demand for electricity by that amount?  How can we possibly diminish our demand for electricity in the gross while increasing it in four locations in that way?  Who is going to call a halt to this plan?</p><p> It may very well be the case that some of these international companies would like to have their data centres in Ireland and I do not blame them for that.  I have no doubt that it probably makes for good economics and politics to attract them to Ireland by holding out the possibility that they can locate such centres in Ireland.  However, if we are going to increase our electricity consumption by the order of 30% for four centres with minimal employment consequences no matter where they are &ndash; they are care and maintenance facilities &ndash; then surely at some stage we must admit that we can no longer afford to pursue that policy, especially when we are missing all our targets.</p></speech>

I assume everyone here accepts the science of climate change.  I believe if the deputations were able to be honest &ndash; they probably cannot say what I can say &ndash; they would agree that the national mitigation plan is rather depressing.  It does nothing to get us to where we need to be.</p> <p>  The projection given by the Environmental Protection Agency in the presentation is frightening.  I assume that it is scientifically absolutely accurate.  Anyway, it is frightening to look at the graph and see how we came from 1990, when we were at a given level of CO2 emissions per tonne.  The level went up during the boom and then back down again during the recession.  We are beginning to climb again.  The last figure we have is for 2016.  Where do we need to be by 2050?  The target is 5 megatonnes.  How the hell are we going to get there when it has been said here today that it is not possible to set out a plan to 2050 and that it is a working document?  I can see why it is not possible.</p> <p>  One thing that illustrated this to me above all in recent weeks was the excited announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of a new deal with China for thousands of cattle and thousands of tonnes worth of dairy product.  That was followed quickly by the discussion in the D&aacute;il and the debate among farmers on the fodder crisis.  We had a fodder crisis because climate change meant that it had rained heavily not only this winter but the previous winter as well.  We had a fodder crisis because the big producers bought up all the fodder when the climate responded as it did.  Thus family farmers cannot manage to feed their cattle and cattle are dying.  Yet, these family farmers have admitted to us that they are coming under increasing pressure all the time from the Department and their own organisations to breed more cattle and dairy cows because the market is dictating the pace.</p> <p>  I can see why the market is attractive.  Certainly, it is not attractive to family farmers in this situation but it is attractive to mega-producers.  We need a plan whereby Departments speak to each other and whereby the economy has some level of grip on what is happening with climate change.</p> <p>  I come from the left and therefore I have more interest in a planned economy that does not allow the free market to reign supreme.  I believe that at some point the free marketeers are going to have to sit up and take notice.  Otherwise they are going to destroy the planet and bring us to the point where there is no return from climate change.  That is why I am keen to see a Minister and Department that scream at other Ministers and Departments to stop doing this and explain we need to talk to one another, join the dots and plan this out together.  I realise the deputations must be extraordinarily frustrated and angry that this is not happening because they are all scientists and they all know what is going on.</p> <p>  I wish to put some specific questions to the Department.  Why does the national policy position not mention industry, manufacturing, waste and other types of energy emissions?  Why are these left out altogether?  I am not going to make any assumptions about it.  Can the Department representatives expand on the point a little?</p> <p>  I am keen for the discussion about transport to be teased out a little.  I hear other Deputies referring to the need for non-diesel buses.  To be honest, however, the real problem is the amount of private cars on the road.  The level of emissions from private transport is far higher than emissions from public transport.  If we could reduce private use of cars on the road to a fraction of what it is at present, we would be doing ourselves a major favour in respect of our emissions.  One need only be on the M50 early in the morning to see gridlock on a four-lane motorway in both directions and then understand that the private use of cars is far out of proportion.  The reason is bad planning.  When industry, homes and estates are built it is clear planners and developers do not take into account the need for transport hubs to be nearby.  Such considerations may be in the development plans of county councils &ndash; when I was a county councillor I recall working out the plans for transport hubs - but the plans are never implemented in a reasonable way that takes private cars off the road in large numbers.  Will the EPA representatives and others comment on that point?  Perhaps they do not see it as the role of the agency to comment.</p> <p>  I know it might be seen as a gesture but would the organisations represented here, including the Department, support the Bill on climate emergency measures to leave fossil fuels in the ground?  The Bill will be before the committee in July.  Does the Department see that as a positive measure in contributing to reducing CO2 emissions and sending out a signal that we need to wake up, smell the coffee and take this seriously?  There is nothing in the plan to show us that we are plotting and managing what has gone off the radar in terms of our emissions.  The EPA graph says it all.  Everyone should look at it because it is startling.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018042400002#H00400"><p>Yes.  I will continue with the aforementioned graph because it tells us a great deal.  First, it shows that one can reduce emissions.  Reducing emissions plummeted from 2008 to 2011.  We were on our way to our targets.  What happened between 2008 and 2011?  Half of the cause was the recession but I remember the EPA analysis published in 2012 suggested that half of the reduction was because of political commitment in government at the time and a range of different measures that were introduced.  That was my experience.  It is possible to do it.  It is good for the economy.  It is the new economy.  It is where the jobs and opportunities are.</p> <p>  I utterly refute Mr. Carroll's argument that we are not good at climate because we have had an investment shortage for the past ten years.  I have heard Ministers trot out the argument time and again.  What investment shortage is behind our increasing emissions?  What particular investment was the Government unable to provide in the past seven years that is the cause of our shameful climate record in the past seven years?  I do not believe that argument.  The reason is because of a lack of commitment in the public service and the political system to do what has to be done.  There has been no sense that this is a priority.  When we went to Europe the priority was to use all our political capital to try to get out of climate commitments.  We pleaded to save Irish agriculture and to be allowed to sell as much cheap beef to the Chinese as we could.  That is why our figures are so poor.</p> <p>  The graph is dramatic because it shows the possibility of more ambitious targets.  I do not see how we can have any emissions in 2050 at the level of 5 million tonnes.  That holds even if we accept the unambitious Government target, as Deputy Smith put it, of 800,000 tonnes per annum.  The latest EPA figures show that the energy, built environment and transport sectors are growing.  Instead of shrinking by 800,000 tonnes, the level is increasing by 1.8 million tonnes in these sectors.  That is the scale of the problem.  I am certain that the 2017 figures will show a further increase of 1.2 million tonnes.  We are further away.  We have to make a bigger jump or leap.  I trust the EPA figures.</p><p>The series of reports presented to us, including last year's update in terms of where we are heading, even with additional measures such as shutting down Moneypoint, project an increase of 34% by 2035, including 5% in residential emissions and an increase in transport emissions.  This is in spite of all the additional plans.  We, therefore, have a problem and serious change is needed.  It is a political and public administration problem in that we have all these plans and structures but emissions are increasing.  Does the EPA agree that if we were serious about emissions, the State would stop peat extraction immediately?  How many million tonnes would that save?  If the officials cannot give me the figure now, perhaps they can write to me separately.  If all peat extraction was stopped, how many million tonnes would that save us in the jump we have to make?  How much might the State get paid under the new Paris Agreement climate commitments?  How much would we benefit by showing what we have done internationally to make significant cutbacks?</p><p> There are many energy-related questions but I will go back to the process.  We have a national climate dialogue, climate advisory committee, national mitigation plan, and a new European climate and energy plan, all of which are iterative processes.  The best analysis was presented by the Citizens' Assembly.  Its members recognised the scale and pinpointed the problem.  They said it is a lack of political leadership.  It is not that Irish people are bad at this; it is that there is no leadership.  They came up with strong, positive suggestions such as ending peat extraction, reversing the transport budget ratio from 2:1 in favour of roads to public transport, which we need to do anyway or else our cities will be gridlocked, and adopting a proper national land use strategy under which forestry is taken seriously.  None of these is mentioned in any of the national plans.  We must take this issue seriously.  As a committee, we will have to consider the Citizens' Assembly recommendations.  What should we do with them?  How will we get the public administration and political systems to realise we must do something about this now and not, as the Taoiseach has said, by 2030 or 2045?</p><p> Mr. Carroll's submission said the new national energy and climate action plan, "will revert to taxation, regulation and behavioural change actions".  What will be the taxation measure?  We introduced the carbon tax during our time in government and I am proud to have done it but taxation will not be the key change.  Regulation and Government decisions to dramatically invest in retrofitting will be key and not just putting in &euro;8 billion.  The Government should aim to have every house on an A rating.  Why stop at a B rating?  Why will the Government not introduce regulations tomorrow to ban fossil fuels?  Why are fossil fuel heating systems being installed in 67% of new houses when there is a brilliant heat pump alternative?  Those buildings would work for heat pumps because they are properly insulated under improved building standards but we need to stop Fine Gael gutting them all the time.  That scale of political commitment and pulling everyone together because it will be a new economy and it is what the country will be good at, is required.  We would benefit in many ways, including a lower fuel import bill and not being shamed internationally, with Irish people feeling good about themselves by helping to prevent a fundamental crisis.  The problem is a lack of political will.</p><p> How do we as a committee turn that around and instill that in our consideration of the Citizens' Assembly's work?  Currently, there is lots of effort and gazillions of plans but our emissions are increasing by between 3.5% and 6% per annum in different sectors.  I bet the figures for 2017 and 2018 will not be different.  I am sure our emissions will increase by 5% again this year, which will push us further away from our targets, while nothing is happening, 67% of new homes are burning fossil fuels and peat is being dug up as if that is clever.  Our agriculture policy is to increase emissions as if that is clever and the Government is taking a negative stance according to the European files on all the climate and energy packages.  At an informal Council meeting last week, all the leading member states, including Denmark and Portugal, said they want a higher renewables target.  If the Government parties were serious about climate change and our economy, they would have supported this call.</p></speech>

There is little that we can do between now and 2020 to alter the fact that we will be between -4% and -6% against a target of -20%.  The end of 2020 is approximately two and a half years away.  Deputy Dooley asked how much this would cost.  It is important in understanding this to recognise the difference between complying with an EU architecture and decarbonising.  Deputy Ryan talked about us decarbonising and emissions falling from 2008 and starting to rise again.  That pattern has tracked the economic downturn and the pickup in economic activity having come out of the downturn.</p></speech>

For a number of years, we were below the ceiling because of the economic downturn.  We can bank that as credit for years we exceed the ceiling.  The combination of being under it for an extended period and exceeding it now means that we have to purchase few allowances to ensure compliance by 2020.  We have banked the amount under the ceilings which offsets us being over it, and there is a few years for which we will have to purchase allowances.  We do not know yet how much they will cost.  It will depend on supply and demand but we anticipate a surplus of allowances will be available and the cost of purchasing compliance will be relatively low.</p> <p>  Looking beyond that, the focus is very much on 2030.  I will move on to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's questions and then return to other issues.  She asked about the issue of industry and so on.  Ireland's legally binding obligations arise in the non-ETS sector.  Agriculture accounts for 45% of our non-ETS emissions.  When transport emissions are added, that brings us up to 73%.  When the built environment is then included, we are dealing with the bulk of the emissions.  There are emissions from a variety of sources relating to manufacturing combustion and industrial processes and they are in the main regulated under the EU ETS system.  That is a cap and trade system and, therefore, there is no legal obligation on the State.  It is up to the installations to manage their emissions and to buy and sell allowances.</p><p>I will address Deputy Ryan's question and after that I will hand over to colleagues to address the question on data centres.</p><p> Reference was made to the national mitigation plan and the follow-on of the national development plan.  I believe there is a significant commitment in the national development plan.  The Exchequer and the fiscal arrangements are relevant.  One thing we had to comply with as a result of the bail-out meant that the Exchequer's capacity to spend or borrow was limited over a period.  We are coming out of that period now.  The additional investment in the national development plan largely kicks in from 2021 onwards.  There is a serious commitment.  Over half of transport emissions come from private journeys.  There will be a total of 500,000 vehicles by 2030 with additional charging infrastructure.  There is a commitment to no non-zero emissions private cars to be sold in Ireland post 2030.  There is a commitment to issuing no NCT certificates for non-zero emissions cars post 2045.</p></speech>

That is in the national development plan.</p> <p>  The transition to low-emissions buses includes electric buses for the urban public bus fleet.  A commitment to no diesel-only buses to be purchased from 1 July 2019 is in the national development plan.  Decarbonising our public transport is important in cities for air quality reasons and to bring about the necessary modal shift.  The scale of the challenges are relevant since 4% of our transport emissions come from public passenger journeys while over 50% come from private car journeys.  That is a where one big issue lies.</p> <p>  I fully agree with Deputy Ryan on retro-fitting of houses.  The figure of 45,000 per annum from 2021 to 2030 represents approximately one third of the stock of existing houses.  Clearly, it is not all about Exchequer spend.  Taxation has a role as does regulation, but we have an existing stock of houses that are going to exist for a long time and they need to be dealt with.  Earlier I referred to 500,000 one-off houses that are remote from the gas network and that burn fossil fuels for heat.  Some 170,000 of these are to be transitioned over the decade.  That represents one third of the one-off houses that are remote from the grid.</p> <p>  I believe these are significant commitments and step-ups in the national development plan.  Earlier, I referred to the national energy and climate plan &ndash; I accept that we have a series of different plans, but the nature of mitigation policy is that as time passes and technologies change, we have to constantly add to policy.  That is not going to change.</p> <p>  One thing raised by one of the Deputies was the need for Departments to be talking to one another.  We have the structure in place now through the high-level steering group chaired by the Minister that brings all the Departments together.  Sitting under that we have the technical research and modelling group.  This is a research group that brings in Departments agencies and the likes of the universities to give the sort of analysis we need to choose cost-effective and appropriate policies.  I will pass over to my colleague to address the question on data centres.</p></speech>

Deputy Dooley asked about fines.  I can set out the position on the outline costs on the renewable energy side.  The expectation is that we will be several percentage points short of the 16% binding target to be met for renewables by 2020.  We will probably be in the range of between 2% and 3% short by 2020.  Work undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland some years ago indicated that the cost per percentage point of not meeting a renewable target would be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;130 million for each percentage point.</p> <p>  The 2009 renewable directive provides that member states who may not meet their 2020 targets can purchase what are called statistical transfers to allow them to achieve compliance.  In 2017 Luxembourg was one of the first member states to sign a co-operation agreement with Lithuania and Estonia to provide for statistical transfers.  Our estimation of what that deal meant is that the costs for Ireland could be below the lower end of the range that SEAI indicated some years ago.  I suppose it is a market and it will certainly depend on market conditions if and when those purchases come to be made.  We have already begun some informal discussions with several member states that we believe may be in surplus and that Ireland may end up having to purchase from.  From an Exchequer point of view, any potential shortfall would be spread over several years.  The cumulative costs would not be known until 2021 because that is when the final accounts for 2020 are put together.  Certainly, we are keeping Government apprised of the potential exposure on that side.</p> <p>  In the meantime, our focus is very much around bringing forward the different schemes that have been mentioned.  For example, the support scheme for renewable heat will hopefully open later this year or early next year.  That will certainly target facilities in the commercial and non-domestic sector, in other words, the commercial and industrial sectors.  One of the Deputies asked what we were doing on that side.  I believe that will have a significant impact, especially given the renewable heat challenge that we face.  It is challenging for reasons of our settlement patterns and so on.  They make it especially challenging on the heat side.</p> <p>  I already mentioned renewable electricity and the new renewable electricity support scheme.  The expectation is that the Government would approve the scheme in the coming months.  That would certainly open for auctions in 2019.  Jim Gannon made a point earlier on this.  It will represent a change from the fixed tariffs that we have had to this point.  It will be very much arranged on a competitive basis.  I hope we will be reaping the benefit and reward of those lower technology costs that I mentioned earlier, especially around technologies on solar, offshore wind and onshore wind, which remains one of the cheaper forms of technology that we have successfully connected to our system in large numbers.</p> <p>  Senator McDowell asked about data centres.  He mentioned a particular development in Athenry.  I will outline what the Government has been doing in the meantime.  All the relevant Department and agencies, including IDA Ireland and EirGrid, have been meeting since last autumn to bring together a strategic response.  What does that mean?  There have been amendments under way to the planning Acts to try to designate data centres as strategic infrastructure.</p></speech>

That is making it easier to construct them by getting one single permission.  That has nothing to do with whether we are going increase the demand for electricity in Ireland by 28% to 32%.</p></speech>

Senator McDowell is right.  The EirGrid analysis, through the tomorrow's energy scenario reporting, suggests that if all the data centres in the pipeline, as it were, were to come on-stream, then it would lead to a trebling of demand.  That is a significant impact on the electricity system.</p></speech>

The answer, from our perspective, is not that we are going to allow all these to be developed willy-nilly because that would be irresponsible in terms of policy-making.</p><p>We have to be cognisant of its impact on electricity demand and on security of supply.  The difficulty we have is that many data centres wish to connect in the greater Dublin region and there is already tight supply in Dublin.  We want to move to a plan-led approach involving more balanced regional development, rather than a developer-driven approach.  The Government is trying to respond effectively to that.  The benefit of taking some of the demand out of the Dublin region would be that it could be moved to other regional locations and, ideally, to areas that already have a grid footprint and fibre connectivity.</p></speech>

I understand transmission system constraints like security of supply and the need to spread it around the country.  I am asking a more fundamental question.  Is it, or is it not, the policy of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that it is okay to increase the demand for Irish electricity by approximately 30%, regardless of where these four centres are built in Ireland?  Is the Department in favour of this happening?</p></speech>

It is not all negative, in fairness.  There could be options for offshore and renewable energy to provide some of the energy needed for data centres.  This would ensure the demand on the Dublin area is not as significant.  The Senator mentioned the peaks and troughs that are experienced as part of load management.  Data centres can assist with more balanced load management because they are run on a 24-hour basis.  The further decarbonisation of the transport sector will also be of assistance in this regard because electric vehicles can be charged at night.  I do not disagree with the thesis that data centres present a challenge for the electricity system.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is trying to formulate a broader Government response that ensures we do not walk in blindly and allow those involved with these centres to locate them in the locations they want.  Instead, we will encourage them to locate in places that are more preferable from our point of view.</p></speech>

I am going to bring in Mr. Gannon of the SEAI, who will be followed by Dr. Crowe of the EPA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gannon" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018042400002#L00500"><p>In responding to questions that were directed specifically at the SEAI, I will try not to repeat what others have already said.  Deputy Dooley spoke about how we can increase our budget, our ambition and our activity in a short timeframe.  We find it quite positive that a good proportion of the &euro;22 billion which has been provided for the next ten years has been attributed to climate action.  In the past 20 months, since my appointment, our budget has increased from &euro;75 million to &euro;150 million.  Demand for our generic capital schemes with businesses and home owners has increased in line with the increase in our budget.  The challenge has been to ensure there is robustness in the supply chain, for example among the contractors who are going to deliver the work on the ground.  Many of our efforts involve working with those involved in the supply chain to increase quality and volume, to give them confidence that there will be a demand for these services over time and to assure them that when we come to the end of this period of high-profile activity, there will be something to blend down at the tail end, although we would be lucky to be set with that challenge.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Dooley's comments about electric vehicles, it is worth noting that sales of such vehicles increased by 50% last year and have increased by 50% again in the first quarter of this year.  If one tries to order an electric vehicle now, one will be waiting between eight and ten months because of a shortage of supply.  The demand is there.  I do not see people parking them on the side of the road.  The purchase of second-hand electric vehicles is a significant growth area.  People are buying such vehicles on the domestic market and importing them.  This shows that people in all segments of the market, and not just new car buyers, are able and willing to go out and buy electric vehicles.  It is likely that the type of person who is buying a second-hand vehicle already drives an older car.  We are doing more to incentivise people and to inform them of their options in this regard.  The initiative in this area that we launched last week is not a public awareness programme; it is designed to inform consumers about these matters.  Separately, when we took over the provision of support for domestic chargers in January, we made a change to enable someone who wants to buy a second-hand electric car to apply for support for a domestic charger.  Prior to this, support was provided to those buying new electric vehicles only.  We are working hard with the Department to put procurement in place in respect of the fast-charging network.  We expect to be able to go to the market in the third quarter of this year and the fast-charging will follow soon after that.  This dovetails with the decision-making process in the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and the ESB regarding the existing infrastructure.</p> <p>  I would like to return to a point Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith made earlier and with which I do not particularly disagree.  I suppose transport planning, at its root, is a spatial planning challenge with socioeconomic considerations.  By the time there is a discussion on switching from diesel or petrol to electricity, the wrong question is being asked.  The question that should be asked relates to the number of people who are having to drive in a car to a place.  I was very thankful for and heartened by the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly with regard to switching towards public transport from roads infrastructure.  There is a tendency in that direction.  We have to acknowledge that the capital development plan looked at more sustainable forms of transport and at a modal shift away from cars.  By the time these issues get to my door, we are answering the wrong question and we are mitigating a symptom as opposed to anything else.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on some other specific points that were made.  I sympathise with some of the views expressed by Senator McDowell.  As far as I can see, work is ongoing.  We face a certain challenge.  Just as there is a perceived conflict, if not an actual conflict, between some of our agricultural policy and our climate policy, there is a similar conflict between our business and enterprise policy and our climate policy.  We will continue to face such challenges.  It is important to ask questions about the methods used to address those challenges and the infrastructure used to face them.</p></speech>

I am nearly at the end.  I will respond to one or two of Deputy Eamon Ryan's comments.  Certain activities are under way in response to the work of the Citizens' Assembly and in response to some signals that were sent.  They were under way by the time the report came out.  The Deputy mentioned the assembly's recommendations relating to land use, public infrastructure and peat.  I have gone through the specific recommendations made by the assembly in respect of electric vehicles.  Community ownership with regard to renewable electricity is embedded in the new renewable electricity support scheme.  I spoke about grid electricity from a microgeneration payment earlier in response to Deputy Stanley.  It is up to us to design that into a grant scheme and see how we can make that valuable as the clean energy package comes down the line.</p> <p>  Deputy Ryan also asked about public sector leadership.  We work with all public sector bodies, including Departments and the bodies under their aegis, to look at their commitments and achievements.  There was a significant tonal shift at the start of last year when the public sector energy efficiency action plan moved from making people responsible for reporting to making sure they are accountable to perform.  I think that was quite important.  We experienced an upsurge in the level of interest in the technical and grant-giving supports we can provide.  We have provided a number of million euro over the past couple of years.  We have worked with the OPW and the Department of Education and Skills to look at the leadership roles they can play in communities, for example by upgrading their business beyond what would be considered to be a normal energy upgrade.  I will give a separate example.  Hearteningly, the HSE recently tested the use of electric vehicles in a rural environment, as opposed to an urban environment.  Local taxi fleets were regularly being used in County Donegal to bring patients on dialysis in County Donegal in and out.  We have shifted them towards electric vehicles to see whether that could or should work.  If it works, the HSE may be in a position to roll such a service out across other areas.  I think part of that is coming in as well.  I think I have covered the questions that were directed at the SEAI.</p></speech>

Dr. Crowe wants to make a couple of comments on behalf of the EPA, after which I will bring Mr. Confrey back in because I cut him off earlier when he had more questions to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Matthew Crowe" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018042400002#L00900"><p>I would like to answer the questions asked by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  I am glad she referred to our graph.  We consider it to be a particularly important graph because it is stark.  It shows the scale of the challenge.  It also shows the reversal of the trend that existed, for whatever reason, in the period before the current period.  The point I want to make is that the EPA will continue to report annually on the emissions inventories and the projections.  As Dr. Cotter mentioned, we will use verifiable information when we are developing the projections.  It is absolutely crucial for the things that are set out in the plan and in the national development plan to be implemented.</p><p>As those plans start to evolve and develop, they will then find their way into our projections.  Obviously, the obverse, if they do not happen, is that they will not find their way into our projections and the projections will continue to portray the kind of picture that is presented in that figure.</p><p> We are required by the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 to produce a state of the environment report every four years.  The most recent report was in 2016.  We have started work on the next one which will be for 2020.  In the 2016 report, we looked in some detail at energy, transport and agriculture.  We included in the submission to the committee a summary of the key messages from those chapters for those three particular sectors.  In terms of the provision of a roadmap for where to go with all this, those chapters provide good information as to what we need to do in Ireland to head in the right direction here.</p><p> Collaboration is hugely important in this area.  It is significant that all the State agencies are collaborating and working together on this.  We do work in other areas, for example, the Water Framework Directive, which is only looking at water.  It is complex enough to get everybody to collaborate in such a space.  This is covering the entire economy and society and it is very complex.  The collaborative structures are being put in place.  They take time to bed down.  It is about building the structures that enable the different Departments and agencies to work together on a common goal.</p><p> Deputy Dooley asked what we can do in the shorter term in this regard.  It is difficult to see what can be done up to 2020 that will make a major impact by 2020 merely because it is now the middle of 2018 and it is not that far away.  The type of things we all need to focus on are, for example, changing the way that we make electricity.  If one looks at the key message for energy in our submission, currently, fossil fuels provide approximately 90% of Ireland's energy.  That is for everything, including electricity for housing and for transport - the entire energy system.  We have a long way to go to get to the point where we have a decarbonised system but if we can figure out how to make electricity in a different way that is not dependent on fossil fuels, that then opens the door for a lot of other things.  For example, if we all bought electric cars, which we would plug in, the electricity charging those cars would not be generated by fossil fuels whereas at present a significant proportion of it is.  That is centrally important to getting the transition right.</p><p> The second point, which Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned and with which we would agree with, is about doing as much as we can, and more if we can, in the area of improving the efficiency of our homes because we all live in a home.  Everybody lives somewhere.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for that.  People can understand that the home they live in can be more energy efficient.  Of course, the heating issue comes back to the type of fuel that is being used to heat the home.  There is an opportunity there to do something which can engage almost the entire country which is worth considering.</p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned the Citizens' Assembly.  I wanted to make a couple of observations about that.  I was fortunate to be able to sit in on the first day of the discussions on climate change.  It was a superb process.  There is a great deal that we can learn from the process as well as from the report that was published in the past few days.  As the climate dialogue is evolving, there are many lessons to be learned from the way it was done, and the fact that one had 99 citizens in a room discussing a fairly complex topic such as climate change over two weekends, being given the information in a dispassionate way by a bunch of different people from different organisations, and then discussing it themselves and coming up with the conclusions  they did.  It is incredibly powerful.  There is a lot of richness in that report and we can all benefit from looking at that, working through the report and seeing how we can best evolve it.  In terms of engaging citizens, there is a lot to be learned just from the process of how the Citizens' Assembly was run.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.125" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eimear Cotter" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018042400002#M00400"><p>I will pick up two points to add to what Dr. Crowe stated.  First, on the data centres, I cannot add anything in terms of the nub of the question and the overall national position.  However, from the EPA's perspective, I can tell the committee that we continue to provide the evidence on Ireland's future emissions.  In looking out to 2020 and beyond, we work in the impact of data centres.  I would make the point that our national emission projections include the impact of data centres.  Many of those data centres fall within our environmental regulatory regimes, such as the EU emissions trading system, ETS, that regulates CO2 emissions, albeit with a very low price signal at present, and more recently, within the Medium Combustion Plant Directive.  That is by way of supporting information.  I recognise it is not getting to the nub of the question.</p> <p>  On the peat question, we have been consistent.  Our director general spoke at the Citizens' Assembly.  We have mentioned in the state of the environment report that we need to move away from fossil fuels and we need to do that with a greater sense of urgency.  As we have heard, over 90% of our energy consumption comes from fossil fuels.  That includes, of course, carbon intensive and inefficient fuels, such as peat.  We can come back with more detailed information on the impact of that.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. Treacy, who has been going through our large national inventory report to give some estimate of the impact of peat extraction and combustion currently.  They will be rough figures and we can come back to the committee later with more information.</p></speech>

We are talking about at least over 4 million tonnes, just on extraction and burning.  As I stated, I would like to come back with a more detailed response to give the committee the full information.</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier all the work and the analysis in terms of the Departments and agencies that have been around the table.  Colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation will shortly be bringing a policy statement on data centres to Government for its approval.  It will try to balance those arguments in terms of the opportunities but also the challenges.  For our part, on the energy side of the equation, we are definitely articulating and working on the analysis from EirGrid in terms of what it will mean for electricity demand.</p></speech>

The other point made by Deputy Eamon Ryan was in regard to the recent informal meeting of EU Energy Ministers in Sofia and on the clean energy package more generally.  To answer the Deputy's question, Ireland is supportive of the EU ambition across energy efficiency and across renewables.  I suppose the point is we certainly have been articulating the need for some flexibility around some of the sectoral areas.</p></speech>

We are not yet at the point where we have outlying higher targets on the table.  In December, by way of a general approach, the energy council signed off on at least 27% on renewables.  All the expectations are that is going to go higher.  In respect of energy efficiency it will be at 30%.  We are inching towards the June council where I expect Ministers will be asked to agree on the overall package.  However, as I said, we are broadly supportive of the EU ambition across the clean energy perspective.  We need to see that Ireland can achieve its contribution to what will be an EU-wide target and that it can be done cost effectively.  The work that Mr. Carroll mentioned earlier in respect of both the TRAM analysis, and indeed the SEAI modelling that is under way, will inform the policies and measures that we as a collective are going to have to put together as part of the first national energy and climate plan.  I ask Ms Minch to comment on the built environment and the public sector.</p></speech>

It is clear there is a strong understanding in the room of what has to be done and the sheer scale of it.  We are working hard on understanding how that should be done.  We are mindful, as are the Deputies and Senators, that ultimately it is about people deciding to act.  It is not just about the technical measures we put in place to be carried out.  I refer to the capacity we build among different sections of the economy and society to make that decision to act.  Then there will be the opportunity to undertake work in our homes and our businesses.</p> <p>  That is why we are seeing a really important shift occurring in how incentives are designed.  I will give one example of how this is tapping into the level of demand people have rightly pointed out is needed.  I refer to the warmth and well-being scheme we got going in 2016.  It is a joint policy initiative between our Department and the Department of Health to provide comprehensive energy efficiency upgrades to the homes of people at risk of energy poverty but also suffering from chronic respiratory problems.  We put together the criteria for the scheme in co-operation with the Department of Health and on the advice of the HSE.  It is jointly delivered by SEAI and the HSE, hence the importance of the supply chain as Mr. Gannon pointed out.  The critical lesson being learned - and this is an important issue for all of us to remember - is the importance of supporting people in their decisionmaking.  I refer to supporting the client then on his or her journey through what can be quite a significant undertaking, particularly in their own homes.  </p> <p>  To be frank, while that might sound quite soft, it is proving to be the catalyst that could really unlock this.  When we put those  measures in place - those kinds of supports for warmth and well-being - that is been carried out in a relatively small geographical area among a very specific cohort of people.  By the end of this year, we will have upgraded a thousand homes.  We are on course to spend &euro;20 million over the three years of the pilot programme.  When people hear about this through intermediaries they trust and see as independent, and they are supported by the SEAI and the HSE on the journey, the response is there.  That tells us much about how we need to go about this.  Providing that kind of support is obviously demanding on the system.  </p> <p>  I will briefly address the public sector.  There is no basis for complacency but it is important to note that, based on the robust data gathered and analysed by the SEAI, we know the public sector has improved its energy efficiency by 20% since the baseline of 2009.  That is the national target.  It has achieved that already.  It shows the importance of the public sector getting out in front.  The emphasis in the public sector has been a great deal on the built environment.  There is no doubt that there are huge opportunities in transport with public sector fleets.  That is something we know we need to get at and we are working closely with colleagues in transport.  That is definitely going to be the next chapter in that work.</p></speech>

I refer to its report of April 2017.  It estimated that the commercial and public services sector would see an increase, with all of the additional measures, of 19.6% in emissions between 2020 and 2035.  Can the EPA break that down between the public services sector and the commercial sector?  I do not doubt that people in the public sector are doing things around energy efficiency and have a real commitment to it.  However, we see figures where the EPA says that emissions are going to increase by 20% when they should be reducing by 80%.</p></speech>

As policies and measures we have heard about, such as the warmth and well-being scheme, become more developed and embedded we can work the impact of those into the projections.  It is a technical answer to the issue.</p></speech>

I am prepared to give some latitude, but a conversation with members and answering their questions can be better.  The opening statements will be followed by engagement with members.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin who is unable to be present, like a number of other members of the committee.  There is actually a long list of members who cannot be here, for which I apologise.  Some of them are not in the building today.  <br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise that any opening statement made to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  <br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I thank all of the representatiives of the organisations before us for the time and effort they are putting into the meeting.  It takes considerable work to prepare for and attend these meetings.  I call Ms Irwin to make the first opening statement on behalf of the Teachers' Union of Ireland.</p></speech>

The Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, represents more than 17,000 teachers and lecturers employed by education and training boards, community and comprehensive schools, voluntary secondary schools and institutes of technology.  We welcome the opportunity to address the joint committee on this very important issue.  </p> <p>  As members will know, Ireland has an internationally acknowledged, high performing education system.  In 2015 the OECD made it very clear that an education system was only as good as its teachers.  However, the education system is being undermined by a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention.  That crisis has been documented in separate research carried out by our own principals and deputy principals&rsquo; organisation and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools and the Joint Managerial Body.  I will not go into the research carried by these organisations.  I am sure they will do it themselves.  It has also been referenced on a number of occasions by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Teaching Council.  Unless it is addressed properly, the scale of the crisis will increase even further, given that there will be an extra 70,000 students in the education system by 2025.  All of the research at which we have looked in that regard has shown that there is a direct link between the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention and the discriminatory pay scales introduced in 2011.  For teachers and all workers in the public sector, there was a pay cut in 2011.  Unfortunately for teachers, they were hit again in 2012 when they lost their qualifications allowance.  In 2014 the honours diploma, HDip, which was a one-year programme became a two-year programme.  All of these factors layered on top of each other have made teaching less attractive as a profession.  We believe that, unless pay discrimination against those who entered the profession since 2011 is ended, the position will only get worse.  </p> <p>  I make it very clear that for post-primary teachers, pay equality means not only removing the two additional points of the scale but also restoring the HDip allowance, particularly now that it is a two-year programme, as opposed to a one-year programme, and incremental recognition for pre-service training which teachers received prior to 2011.  In September 2016 there was explicit recognition that pay was at the heart of the problem when the TUI; the Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation, INTO; the Department of Education and Skills; and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reached an agreement to restore one of the allowances.</p> <p>  The key points made in our submission are the following.  The cuts to pay and conditions for new entrants since 2011 have exacerbated the entire problem.  The majority of applications for post-primary teaching are processed through the Postgraduate Applications Centre, PAC.  Since 2011 there has been an alarming and unprecedented decline of 62% in the number of applications received.  The output of graduates from these programmes has also declined by 27%.  In 2011 there were more than 2,800 applicants through the PAC.  As of today, there are 1,100 applicants and that is after the programme was extended.  A total of 1,100 is not enough to meet the need.</p> <p>  There has also been a huge increase in the number of teachers emigrating.  In 2008, 4% of teachers emigrated.  According the the Higher Education Authority, HEA, that figure has increased to 21%.  We hear daily that it is increasing even further.  At a recent recruitment fair in an Irish university for teachers who were soon to qualify, there were 42 stands, 36 of which were hosted by international recruitment agencies or groups of schools.  They are coming to Ireland to take abroad the teachers whom we train and educate here.  </p> <p>  Most important is the service we can provide for students in schools.  There is severe disruption because of timetable changes and restrictions necessitated by the lack of qualified teachers, including teachers for substitution.  Students are losing out on educational opportunities both inside and outside school.  There is an absence of subject specialist teachers to cover for colleagues who are engaged in work for agencies such as the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA; the State Examinations Commission, SEC; and the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST.  Schools are now reluctant to let teachers go and work in these organisations because they cannot get substitute cover for them at home.  In many instances, schools cannot get teachers of Irish, mathematics or home economics.  However, it is not limited to these three subjects.  Our own principals and deputy principals carried out a survey in March which found that 96% of schools were having difficulty in recruiting teachers across a range of subjects, not just the ones about which we hear a lot such as the science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects.</p> <p>  There are many more attractive opportunities in other graduate entry employments.  This year the HEA found that graduates in the areas of science, mathematics, engineering, construction and health and welfare were in a position to earn considerably more in other graduate entry employments than they would in teaching.  Teaching is no longer an attractive profession.  One has to complete a three or four-year degree and then decide whether one can afford to stay on or to attain a two-year teaching qualification.  The Minister has announced various short-term patches or fixes to try to resolve the issue, but we make it very clear that the only solution to the teacher supply crisis is the abolition of the discriminatory pay scales for new entrant teachers.  It is very worrying that the average age of people entering teaching is now 26 years.  We believe this is firmly linked with the cuts in teachers' pay in 2011, 2012 and 2013.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Irwin, general secretary of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, to make his presentation.  I did give Ms Irwin some latitude on time, but we aim for a statement of three minutes.  The problem is that it all builds up.  We have all read the delegates' submissions.</p></speech>

The submission we made is quite dated at this stage because it would have been submitted a number of months ago.  We welcome the initiatives which have been taken on board since such as the establishment of the teacher supply steering group by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton.  We also the work the Teaching Council has been doing in facilitating stakeholder meetings to identify difficulties in teacher supply and explore possible solutions.  We are delighted to engage in this very significant work and will obviously continue to do so.  However, over the course of the last year to 18 months, the most dominant issue raised by principals and management teams when we meet them which we do regularly at regional meetings across the country is teacher supply.  The committee will note from our submission that schools have been experiencing difficulty in the past 12 months even in filling full-year regular part-time, RPT, contracts, while accessing qualified teachers in the relevant subject areas for casual substitutions is next nigh to impossible at this stage.  It is very difficult.</p> <p>  The survey we conducted is consistent with others which have been carried out in identifying shortages in nearly all subject areas, but there are particular difficulties in areas such as home economics, modern foreign languages, mathematics and STEM subjects.  It has been a concern this year that that shortage is beginning to spread into nearly all subject areas.  The survey also highlights a significant fall in the number of applicants for positions advertised.  On occasion it has been necessary to readvertise owing to a lack of any applicant.  The obvious shortages are, for example, in the area of an Ghaeilge where 48% of positions in the past year required readvertising.</p><p>The figure for Spanish was 50% and the figure for mathematics was 15%.  The number of qualified candidates applying for positions has fallen substantially.  We acknowledge the work and the focus on targeting by the Department of Education and Skills under the Minister to address some of these issues since the submissions were made.  That work is ongoing.  We, as stakeholders, would also support that.</p><p> The problem now appears more pronounced in the east, or the further east one travels.  There are obviously significant staff retention problems for schools in the Dublin area.  There is the dynamic of higher living costs and the acute accommodation shortage.  This, on occasion, has resulted in schools offering contracts that might be exited when an opportunity presents itself in a more affordable living space to candidates looking for positions.</p><p> I very much concur with what Ms Irwin said on the globalisation of the teaching market for graduates in Irish schools and Irish colleges.  We can see that ourselves.  In surveys carried out, it can be seen that there is an economic reason, with the introduction of the two year PME.  While we understand the Teaching Council will say that this is predominantly to ensure and maintain standards, we would indicate that there could be an unintended consequence of reducing numbers applying and creating financial difficulty, particularly among those from less socially secure or socially disadvantaged backgrounds.  The latter might not enter the profession, which in the long term is poor for the profession.  There are many statistics that we have submitted that members can read and take on board.</p></speech>

We have been experiencing difficulties with teacher supply since 2014.  The problem has been getting worse over the four years.  We are delighted that this is finally being taken seriously, after four years.  We have consistently surveyed the problem since 2014.  In the area of Irish, modern languages, home economics and the STEM subjects, particular difficulties have arisen.  In my case, for example, there was maternity leave by an Irish teacher at the beginning of the summer.  After advertising for the third time in August, I got one qualified applicant.  When I contacted the person, the reply I got was, "What can you offer me, Father?"  Therefore, it is a difficult space.  I ended up doubling up classes; I could not get a teacher.  That has been replicated across the country.</p> <p>  The technical working group began its work and completed it in 2015.  The report was not published for two years.  As I said, we are delighted this is finally being taken seriously.  I am not going to go over the ground of our submission.  We suggest, however, a number of things that will help to alleviate the problem.  The Minister has announced a number of initiatives.  We welcome those, as my colleague Mr. Irwin said.</p> <p>  In the area of retired teachers, encouraging some involvement by retired teachers would help to alleviate the situation in terms of abating the pension issue and so on.  Some incentives could be given there.  With regard to teachers now considering retirement, the retirement age is being raised to 70.  Teachers on job-share are not allowed to do substitute work.  Some would be available to do a small amount of substitute work, which would help greatly the schools that are in difficulty.  That should be considered.  Also, teachers on career break can act in a substitution capacity for up to 300 hours in the year.  That could be extended.  Again, that would help.</p> <p>  Another situation we find ourselves up against is the five-day rule.  This was introduced to solve a perceived difficulty, particularly in the national schools, in which there were many unqualified teachers teaching.  By restricting the number of days that unqualified teachers could teach, the objective was to solve that difficulty.  It has caused a severe difficulty for us, however.  Over the past two weeks we have had oral and practical examinations in our schools.  We can on these occasions get hold of people who might not be qualified teachers but who have very good language skills.  They could do very good work for perhaps ten days of the two weeks but cannot be hired for more than five school days.  That is a matter that could be examined also.</p> <p>  The old higher diploma has now been extended to a master in education degree of two years.  Serious consideration should be given to allowing conditional registration, which means those concerned could be paid for doing work in schools.  If one considers apprenticeships in other areas, one notes there is payment for working, as in nursing and other professions.  Therefore, I do not see why it cannot be extended in some fashion to teaching.  This would really be a big help.</p> <p>  Mr. Irwin mentioned affordable living space, of which the committee has to be mindful.  We find the problem with teacher supply is exacerbated in Dublin, particularly in areas of Dublin where it is very expensive to live and very expensive to travel owing to traffic and other factors.  The pay issue was mentioned by the representatives of the TUI.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that the third level colleges say their remit is more than teacher training but they have a role in this.  The whole mismatch of supply needs to be addressed urgently.  There is an issue with having a huge supply of teachers in subject areas for which we do not need them and none in areas where they are needed urgently.  Something has to give and something has to be done about that.</p> <p>  These are the areas I wanted to highlight.  The committee has our submission.  I am thankful for the opportunity to contribute.</p></speech>

I appreciate it.  Hibernia College is almost 20 years old now.  We have put approximately 10,000 teachers into the education system at primary level and, more recently, post-primary level.  We have made a submission.  I will just highlight the three main points we have made and drill down a bit in respect of each.  We are recommending incentivising the teachers' careers, being more flexible and mobile in our preparation of teachers, and making more use of technology-assisted solutions.<br/><br/>With regard to incentivising careers, we ask for a return to the issue of pay.  We all agree that paying less to people coming to the profession now is psychologically problematic.  It is not even about money.  It is about going into the classroom, having been recently educated with one's master's degree, and being told one is being paid less than the teacher next door.  It is not about blaming politicians, the Department or anybody; it is simply a matter of natural justice.  We need to address it.  I understand it is being addressed.  It is time to put this to bed and finally bring parity on the issue of payment.<br/><br/><b></b>We also need to examine the qualifications and the recognition of qualifications in the teaching profession.  Teachers are continually upgrading their qualifications, whether through formal degrees or continuous professional development.  I am sure all providers of continuous professional development want it recognised for their teachers.  It improves the quality of teachers in our classrooms and, as a result, our students do much better.<br/><br/>On the second point, on being more flexible and mobile, we are examining the idea of &quot;subject knowledge enhancement&quot;, whereby one would add to the qualifications of the teachers we have.  It is a matter of asking whether a graduate-level course or recognised accredited education at third level can be offered by any provider for the person who comes to a school as the English teacher so that teacher might be able to teach two or three subjects at school level.  It has happened recently in Ireland, and it certainly happens in other countries.  One takes the science teacher and adds mathematics, or one takes the mathematics teacher and adds physics, making the teacher much more employable, for a start, and also much more valuable to the students.<br/><br/>We also recommend cluster panels.  If one is a physics teacher in Mayo, where I am from, one might be teaching in three different towns but with no permanent job.  One does not get travel expenses.  One is basically moving one's bag of tricks from one school to the other.  It is not a professional way to treat a teacher.  An ideal solution, which is quite successful in other countries, is to have a cluster teacher who would be recognised as a full-time permanent physics teacher in the region and be set to work full time each year.</p><p>If a situation arises where there is no longer a full-time position, either relocate him or her or terminate his or her contract.  I know that last suggestion sounds harsh, but we are in a situation where we need horses for courses.  We need the proper teacher in the proper classroom.  In addition, we need to look at where we are now-----</p></speech>

When the taxpayer goes shopping for teachers, and let us say he or she wants six apples, six oranges and six pears, right now he or she buys 18 pieces of fruit.  We do not know what they are.  However, we want maths teachers, science teachers and physics teachers.  Let us buy them in from the people who can provide them.  We have plenty of people who can provide them.  Are we spending money on teachers we do not need?  I would highlight the idea of drilling down a step further into teacher recruitment, considering what we are actually purchasing with taxpayers' money and making sure it is what we need rather simply meeting a number.  We know the numbers.  We have very good in regard to numbers compared to other countries.  I suggest we drill down a little more there.</p> <p>  I refer to mobility and flexibility.  We have hundreds if not thousands of unqualified degree holders abroad who could qualify in a distance learning programme, come back and become members of the Teaching Council.  We can all bring them home.  Many of them are not coming home because they are not qualified.  Things have changed so much since they left.  The Teaching Council has arrived, and it is a great arrival.  It has brought a professionalism that has raised the level of teaching.  However, these people are no longer included because while they have the degrees, they need to qualify, particularly in areas of pedagogy and teacher education in general.</p></speech>

Dublin City University's institute of education is Ireland's newest and only university faculty of education.  It is in its second year of operation.  It was created through the incorporation of four separate institutions, all involved in teacher education, namely, St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra, the Church of Ireland College of Education in Rathmines, the Mater Dei Institute of Education and the DCU School of Education Studies.  We now have more than 4,000 undergraduate and post-graduate students of education on the St. Patrick's Campus of DCU, along with almost 140 academic staff and some world class researchers.  We cover all phases of education, from early years through to adult and community education.  I should add that we have not experienced the fall-off in applications or demand that other people have reported here.  The number of applicants to come into teacher education continues to exceed the number of places we have in our programmes.  That includes all our programmes, whether it is English, history, science or mathematics.</p> <p>  The review of initial teacher education carried out in 2012 in Ireland said that we should prepare our teachers in university settings and move away from smaller colleges of education, so that those preparing to be teachers can work with staff who are also researching in their specialist field.  Our students have opportunities to work with scientists, writers, mathematicians, musicians, social and business innovators and the wide range of expertise found in contemporary higher education institutions.  That is a really important policy direction in the context of the supply issues we now face.</p> <p>  Our education system has committed itself to a highly qualified teaching profession and to high-quality teacher education.  For some, the path to teaching can be six years long.  It is a long time.  It is about the same qualification period as for doctors.  We have a shortage of doctors in the health sector and despite the many solutions proposed, no one has suggested that we should just get doctors trained faster.  Teaching, like medicine, is a complex job, and it is harder than it used to be.  We do not claim that our graduates are ready for every situation that a classroom will present to them, but we aim to provide our teachers with enough technical and professional knowledge and understanding to form a basis for further learning and sound judgment.  It is salutary to remember that many of those who graduate as teachers in 2018 will still be teaching in 2050.  We have to ensure that they are as ready to learn as they are ready to teach.</p></speech>

Additional places in teacher education programmes, new programmes and flexible modes of delivery are contingent on the resources to support them.  Committee members have seen the facts, figures and tables about Irish higher education funding.  Let us now give two very practical examples.  One of our colleagues is the president of the European Educational Research Association and in that capacity hosted a recent meeting of the executive.  The outgoing president leads the faculty of education in Utrecht in the Netherlands, with 600 students and 400 staff.</p></speech>

The head of Utrecht does not know how we do it.  He just wishes us luck.</p> <p>  The reality of that ratio hits home when we sit down to plan new programmes.  The newest programme we are planning is a BEd post-primary concurrent degree in Gaeilge and modern languages, which is an area of heavy demand and heavy shortage, as outlined by other speakers.  We hope have that on the books for 2019 to respond to the shortage of teachers in these areas in the post-primary system.  This innovative degree will see students spend time in European universities and in the Gaeltacht, and will include modules taught in the target languages.  It is already generating inquiries from students in fifth year and transition year.  It draws on DCU&rsquo;s reputation for applied linguistics, Irish and education, but our biggest challenge will be funding the staff to teach it, providing classrooms and library spaces for students, and providing the administrative staff needed to support placements in international and Gaeltacht settings.  We agree with the Department of Education and Skills that we need to expand our number of concurrent post-primary programmes, but we need to discuss how these programmes will be funded in the future.</p> <p>  In working with the Higher Education Authority and the Department on generating additional places for next year, we have signalled, as have other institutions, where additional places can be made available.  There has been a positive response from applicants.  These places will not be realised unless additional human and capital resources are provided and action is taken by the Department and the education partners to secure opportunities for school placement for the additional students.</p></speech>

They simply cannot attract enough applicants into teacher education programmes, which is not Ireland's problem.  However, all these countries can remember the good old days when teaching was highly regarded and teacher education programmes were over-subscribed, as they currently are in Ireland.  If we want to avoid joining the very long list of countries with chronic teacher recruitment issues, then we need to take care when we describe our current difficulties.  We need to draw on data rather than anecdotes, patterns rather than perceptions, and above all else we need to avoid taking actions that may curtail the enthusiasm of those preparing, or choosing, to teach.  We need to avoid using language that might seem to blame those currently teaching for wanting to broaden their professional experience or save money for a house by leaving the country for a period of time.  Equally, we need to make sure that in every announcement made about system expansion or system development, account is taken of the impact on teacher supply and confidence therein.</p> <p>  We are confident that the new task force established by the Department has the appetite for this task, and for the longer-term goal of securing better data for workforce planning for the teaching profession in Ireland.</p><p>Like our colleagues, we are working actively with it.  For some of our students in DCU, however, it is too late.  More than 300 students are preparing to teach religious education and either English, history or music in post-primary schools, on one of those oversubscribed and in-demand concurrent teacher education programmes.  They recently woke up to an announcement from the Department that new arrangements for the teaching of religious education in ETB schools were to be put in place.  The announcement sent them online looking for international options, as the jobs they expected to move into in the fastest growing sector in the Irish education system appeared to them to have been swept away.  We wonder too, if those graduating next year as primary teachers may be more inclined to get international experience on graduating if the career break that has long been a part of the experience of the young Irish primary teacher may not be as readily available to them in the future.</p><p> If teacher supply issues are to be managed effectively, then all future system developments and announcements, whether about school places, new subjects on the curriculum, new arrangements for subjects, new policies, additional resources and even reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio, have to include consideration of the obvious and sometimes not so obvious impact on teacher supply.  We are very happy to discuss the points made, and any others, with members of the committee.</p></speech>

All of the submissions and statements were extremely useful and also challenging, both to the committee and I am sure to the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister as well.  I will make a couple of points before I go to members.</p> <p>  DCU is on the record as saying it does not favour the quota system.  Could Dr. Looney speak briefly about that?  Could I also have her thoughts on Dr. Rowland's idea that we would have remote classes via video.  I did a postgraduate course where that worked really well but it was never my vision of education.  I would like to have a little to and fro discussion on that point which is not something I had envisaged coming in very quickly.</p> <p>  The statements by the Joint Managerial Body by Fr. Connell, John Irwin and also by Joanne Irwin speak for themselves.  They are really stark.  I do not have specific questions but that is not to say I do not take their submissions seriously.  I am sure the other members will have questions but the statements were self explanatory.  I might ask those speakers to address those points before I seek questions from other members.</p></speech>

He can respond to that and then I will take questions from Deputy Funchion.</p></speech>

The problem is that it is a completely unnecessary measure.  There is not a competition for places between subjects.  We do not have a situation where I need to say to somebody applying for a programme in teaching: "Mick or Mary, congratulations, we are delighted that you are interested in teaching.  It is a really important profession, but I notice you want to do English.  Have you thought about physics?"  In the post-primary sector it is really important that one has a passion for one's subject.  We need to provide our students with people who are passionate about their discipline and have an in-depth subject knowledge.  We have no evidence that we are producing too many English teachers.  We could do with producing more maths and science teachers but I do not think we need to penalise those who want to be English or history teachers on that basis.</p></speech>

I have had constituents come to me who have not been able to get jobs in that particular sector.</p></speech>

I do not have the data in front of me on whether there are people without full-time jobs in business or in any particular area but, equally, business is one of the areas within the professional master's in education, PME, in which the numbers have been restricted for a number of years.  There are controlled numbers in business and I think that is a recognition that we do produce a lot of business studies graduates.  Overall, I think it would be taking a mallet to a nut.  I am not sure it is the issue.</p> <p>  In terms of the technology, some of our teacher education programmes are blended in that we would have students who would be face-to-face and with new technology as well.</p></speech>

That is what I wanted Dr. Looney to comment on as an educationalist - whether she would see that as an issue.</p></speech>

Where there was not a higher level maths teacher available, many schools already took the initiative to connect a school to another school using the broadband service so the higher mathematics teacher in one school was supporting maths in another.  Within the ETB sector there are teachers teaching physics who may be sharing with another school, and certainly within the post-primary level with good support I see no reason that could not happen.</p></speech>

We have a supply but they are not local to where they are needed.  We looked at the United States - some creative principals have done it here - where they found participation and co-operation with each other helped.  If there is a good maths teacher in Cork who is qualified and is a member of the Teaching Council, schools can live stream her into a classroom in Galway to teach mathematics in fifth year for a maternity leave or a substitute position.  We are piloting that right now in a small number of schools to see if it is what schools want.  This is a warts and all analysis.  We have a small pilot project which will be followed by a second pilot project and then we will discuss it.</p></speech>

We are looking at live streaming which will give each of the students an opportunity to ask questions of the teacher.  What we highly recommend is that there is a teacher from the school in the classroom with the students.  I have been in teacher education for a long time.  One of my colleagues mentioned that we were in the same class so I will not mention that we are 40 years in teacher education.  One just has to make sure that it is quality, it is productive, there is discipline and supervision and that it is fulfilling the requirements of the Teaching Council and that the teachers are Garda vetted.  All the requirements have to be filled except the teacher is on the other side of the camera.  The teacher involved must be a fully qualified teacher, not some teacher covering while students study maths.</p></speech>

We are dealing with teenagers aged from 13 to 18.  You are an adult, Acting Chairman.  You can sit down and watch.  You are motivated.  Some of our students are motivated.  We have teachers in disadvantaged areas.  We have teachers in Youthreach centres whose day-to-day task is to ensure that the student shows up for class every day.  That cannot be done by a remote delivery.  Who meets the parents?  Who corrects the work?  How can one teach materials, technology and woodwork via remote learning?  It sounds great for a highly motivated student in a south Dublin school but that is not what we are dealing with.</p> <p>  We are dealing with schools all over Ireland.  This is a resourcing issue.  We would not have an issue with recruitment and retention of teachers if all teachers were paid the same.  We have done a survey and found that 94% of teachers who started since 2011 would stay in the profession if they were treated the same as their colleagues.  There are practical issues and health and safety issues that are of concern.</p><p>There are motivational issues involved.  There is a lot to be considered here.  We are not dealing with adults.  Some students are very highly motivated but others are not and for some, the biggest challenge is ensuring that they are actually in school every day.  Sometimes we lose sight of the fact we are dealing with a cross section of education, not just schools in south Dublin.</p></speech>

In a situation where one does not have such a teacher, as happened in mathematics, for example, schools can partner and, as Mr. Rowland said, there is a teacher in a room for some subjects, particularly for senior classes.  That may be something that a school would want to do but it would not want to be doing an entire leaving certificate course in that way.  Certainly in the longer term, schools would need to be looking to have a qualified person in the room for that age group.</p></speech>

I thank all of the speakers for their presentations.  I would be completely opposed to any sort of live streaming of classes.  As the mother of two boys, I would absolutely refuse to send my children to school if that was the level we reached.  That is completely unacceptable.  Students need to have a teacher to whom they can speak if they have a difficulty or problem.  They need to be able to speak to teachers after class and so on.  We all know that there is a recruitment and retention crisis in the education sector but live streaming classes is not the solution.  That is not the answer to the problem.  We need to figure out why people are not staying in teaching and why graduates are not choosing the profession and, as Ms Irwin has said, it has to do with the wages.  There is nothing there to motivate people.</p> <p>  It really angers me to hear live streaming being proposed as a solution.  We are failing students and their parents again here.  Parents will have to pick up the slack in such scenarios and will end up paying for grinds when the virtual class falls apart.  If we start settling for second best, which is what live streaming represents, then we may forget about ever getting any sort of equality for the newer teachers coming through the system.  I am 100% against that and hope that we never see that developing.  It is fine at third level or for mature students who know exactly what they want to study and who are totally motivated.  However, it is not fine for students who are already having difficulties, such as those with learning difficulties, anxiety issues or issues with just getting in to school.  We should not settle for that at all.</p> <p>  What we need to see is equal treatment for our teachers.  They must all be paid at the same rate.  It should not be the case that those who qualified in 2000 earn a better wage than those who are qualifying now.  We need to make sure that we incentivise our teachers to stay here and to continue to teach.  We need to ensure that they are not dragged into other professions or dragged abroad because of wages.  At the moment that is happening because teachers' wages are inadequate.  A lot of newly-qualified teachers simply cannot afford to stay here or to stay in the teaching profession.  They would love to teach here but they will not be able to get a mortgage or to meet the general costs of living here.  These are the issues that we need to focus on rather than coming up with get-out clauses for the Government in the form of virtual classrooms or the live streaming of some subjects.  I do not think that would be acceptable under any circumstances.  It is also not acceptable that we have teachers teaching subjects in which they are not qualified.  That is not fair to the teachers or to the students.  That said, live streaming is not the answer under any circumstances.  I feel very strongly about this.  </p> <p>  I am like a broken record at this stage because at almost every meeting of this committee I say the same thing.  The key issue in all of this is the impact on students.  It is so unfair that the person who did the leaving certificate ten or 15 years ago has a better chance than someone doing it now.  That is completely wrong.  We must take a stand on this.  This committee must be a lot more vocal about the fact that we cannot allow this situation to continue.  Teachers are leaving the country in droves and leaving the profession in droves.  It is clear that there is a crisis.  I really want to support the unions on this, particularly the TUI.  We need to see pay restoration; that is key in all of this.  It is not the only thing, but it is one of the key things.</p></speech>

Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is next.</p></speech>

I missed most of the conversation on live streaming and am not sure exactly what was involved but I would agree with what Deputy Funchion has said on the issue.  We are talking about young children with different levels of ability, different backgrounds and so on and they really need personal contact and interaction with a teacher.  Learning is all about action and reaction.  It is not about talking down to children and sending them a message that they are supposed to take in and pull out again at some point in the future.  That is all I want to say on that because I missed the earlier part of the conversation.</p> <p>  In terms of the issue of salaries and teachers going abroad, this committee is supportive of the restoration of pay for teachers as soon as possible.  That said, in Ireland teaching has been a very desired profession.  It is an area into which young people still want to go and the points for teacher training courses are still high.  We want to make sure that continues but the fact that so many are going abroad is a genuine concern.  The cost of housing is contributing to that, along with a number of related issues but that is something that this committee cannot sort out.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' views on how we might deal with the issue, apart from addressing the pay inequality, which is the issue that Ms Irwin in particular has highlighted.  Are there other things that can be done to encourage people to come back? </p> <p>  There are lots of non-Irish people living here now.  Could they do conversion courses to become teachers of certain subjects, including foreign languages?  I am thinking of people who have qualifications in their own country but who are working in restaurants or in other areas and not using their qualifications at all.  I would welcome the witnesses' views on that.</p> <p>  I have some knowledge of the conversion programme for mathematics in the University of Limerick.  I think NUIG is involved with the Irish or Gaeilge side of it.  I have been present at a few of the conferring ceremonies and the graduates come from all over the country.  The course is delivered through local education centres, as well as in the two universities.  It seems to be very successful in terms of enabling already qualified teachers to qualify to teach mathematics specifically.  Could the same be done for other subjects?  I am not sure of the statistics but if there is an over-supply of teachers in some subjects, perhaps they could be encouraged to upskill and qualify in another related subject.  I am not saying that people should start from scratch on something about which they know nothing but is there some scope in that regard?  These are all short-term responses, in some sense, but it is not that long ago that we had teachers who could not get jobs because there were not enough teaching posts.  The current problem is relatively recent.  Obviously, the population spike will happen soon.  Actually, at primary level, we are beginning to work our way down again but the spike will hit at post-primary level in 2024.  In that context, we need to have short-term responses as well as longer term ones.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.211" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor P&aacute;draig &Oacute; Duibhir" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018042400002#F01000"><p>I am happy to address some of the questions posed by Deputy O'Sullivan.  One issue that colleagues of mine who work in the post-primary area would talk about is the fact that 700 post-primary schools is a relatively large number, given our population.  In that context, school size tends to be smaller here.  While upskilling teachers so that they are qualified in three rather than two subjects would give greater flexibility to school principals, it could give rise to issues around pay and contracts.  I am sure Ms Irwin has exact figures but I know that over one third of post-primary teachers do not have a full-time contract.  That is a serious problem.  Conditions, as well as pay, need to be addressed.  There are issues around flexibility of employment and the fact that we have smaller post-primary schools relative to other countries.</p> <p>  If language teachers from abroad have a recognised teaching qualification, they can register with the Teaching Council here.  If there are any shortfalls in their qualifications, institutions like DCU and other universities would be happy to fill in those gaps.  I was previously a member of the Teaching Council and am aware that it is just about to announce a scheme whereby teachers with qualifications can undergo an adaptation period or do an aptitude test for certain areas to make up for any shortfalls.</p><p> The maths conversion programme has been very successful.  It was an incentivised programme, and Deputy O'Sullivan probably dealt with it when she was Minister.  The same could be done in other areas where there are shortages.  The programme we are launching on Gaeilge and modern languages is a way to address quotas, in the sense that the professional masters of education process tends to deal with general application and whatever subjects the applicants bring with them, whereas a concurrent four-year programme would be cheaper for the students to get fully qualified in two subjects, and the numbers could be controlled in those areas.  This is part of the addressing it.  There are a number of issues that could possibly be addressed through short-term solutions.</p></speech>

Some of them had mathematics as a first year or second year subject and the course was designed to get them up to degree level in mathematics.  No fees were charged and it was a lot of hard work for the teachers involved.  There were exams and essays.  It was a serious course led by UL.  It has delivered a situation whereby most second-level students in Ireland are now taught by a degree level qualified mathematics teacher.  It does show that when the system gears itself up, puts the resources in place and works with the higher education institutions it can respond to a need that is there.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's observations on numbers and shifts in the population, the situation does change over time and it is very important that we take the opportunity now to put in place really good data collection measures so we know what we will need in future and can plan better.  We can never predict that something will happen to the property market that will incentivise people to go and get money for a house, but we need to be able to see those things coming and put in place measures early whereby we can keep the supply of teachers steady.</p> <p>  Our experience in DCU is that our teachers who are overseas want to come back.  They do not intend to live a life or teach a career over there.  There has been an established tradition of teachers taking career breaks and going overseas and working abroad.  This has been part of what younger teachers in particular did, but now, because of the property market, there is a real incentive for people to move to earn, but they do want to come home and that is their plan.</p></speech>

Parents, teachers and lecturers need to see there is some value in it rather than writing it off.  We were written off 20 years ago.  All I ask is that committee members are open minded and take a look at how online services can help students.  I totally agree that by no means should these services ever replace a teacher.  It requires very disciplined approaches and it will not suit all children, all schools or all teachers.  I invite committee members to come and see how it works because it works very successfully in some cases.  It may alleviate our short-term problems and let us focus on dealing with the long-term problem, which is that today, every constituency has students with unqualified people in front of them in the classroom.  We must ask committee members to help us because we cannot do it on our own.  It will take time and energy, and the support of the committee, to get programmes that will create more teachers.</p> <p>  Bringing back teachers is an answer we can all help with.  We need to qualify them, because many of them will not be qualified to tick all of the boxes for the Teaching Council, but this is very doable.  Hibernia College is actively working on putting in place a programme.  Five years ago I opened a college in London which focused on subject knowledge enhancement for teachers.  It meant an extra subject for a teacher who was already registered with the Teaching Council and already teaching in, for example, Glenamaddy and needed another subject.</p> <p>  The mathematics programme introduced here and completed in Limerick is a successful model.  The Irish programme is also a model.  My colleagues here are from many institutions that can deliver for the State.  We can get these teachers educated.  It will be a matter of money and we all have to face this big elephant in the room.  Everything costs, and this is a time when we have trolleys in hospitals and there are shares of the pie, but the committee is in a very strong position to state it is the Government's job to provide qualified teachers for each of our primary and post-primary students so let us start there and get this sorted.</p> <p>  I am old enough to remember when that happened before.  At the time, the education committee, the Government and the Department ended up putting their shoulders to the wheel and getting everyone qualified.  We went through a grace period and then we went through a period when we thought there were too many teachers and that Hibernia College was flooding the market with teachers.  As far back as when Ruair&iacute; Quinn was the Minister, we were warning there would be a shortage of teachers.  It is definitely cyclical.  I ask the committee to focus on the now to get the short term sorted, with a view to putting systems in place for the long term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.215" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Irwin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018042400002#G00400"><p>There are two areas that must be looked at.  I am delighted to hear about the additional concurrent courses addressing specific subject areas that have been announced in DCU.  They will provide a medium-term solution.  Obviously, it will take four years for people to be qualified and the course will begin in 2019.</p> <p>  The immediate issue we have is in two phases.  The first is dealing with regular part-time contracts for an entire year.  When we look for people to fill these positions, if we look at the overseas market, people chose to leave here for economic reasons at the end of completing a two year professional master of education, which is quite a costly process for teachers, and while there are people who want to come back we do not have the structures in place to bring them back easily and facilitate them coming back into the process.  We know commercial companies are quick enough to be able to get them out, but we have to apply the same type of rationale and create return pathways, such as there are in some of the UK regions, to try to facilitate people coming back into the Irish system.  An element of this is that they have to be able to access decent contracts, preferably 22-hour contracts for qualified teachers on full-time contracts.  There are full-time vacancies that are very difficult to meet.  We can look at the returning market.</p> <p>  We also need to look within Ireland, where there are people who may have gone into business and have experience of the private sector who would like to consider returning to or getting involved in education and bringing the experience they have into the classroom, which would also be valuable, but this quite difficult to do.  It is hard to imagine giving up a salaried position for two years to do a professional master in education in order to return to the classroom.  We do not make it easy for people, if they are not initial graduates, to come back into the teaching profession and bring their skills with them.  We also have to look at the short-term vacancies that exist in schools.  The survey we carried out highlights a particular problem, which is for the vast majority of short-term placements a qualified teacher will not be found.  Recently, we have had oral exams going on in schools, which were facilitated by teachers leaving their own schools to conduct the examinations, but we cannot get qualified teachers to replace them in the classroom.  To do this as a short-term measure, we have to consider, as Fr. Connell has mentioned, the five-day rule for people who have language skills.  We also have to consider whether we can access people who have retired to come back in, and whether we access, which we cannot do at present, people who are job sharing in schools.</p><p>Those on job-share in schools may be able for that period of time to take on additional hours but they are prohibited under terms and conditions from doing so.  We can also look at teachers on a career break - that was a positive initiative - to try to see if they can come back in.  Therefore, we have a number of different issues that we need to examine and we have a number of different ways that we can address it.</p><p> There are possibilities overseas.  There are possibilities for people who are currently qualified to come back in.  There are possibilities of some who are retired coming in for short-term vacancies.  There are possibilities of those who are currently in schools, for example, on career break, who are prevented from doing additional substitution work.  It would help to alleviate the immediate problem.  The medium to long-term will depend on the concurrent courses.</p><p> I am delighted to hear that there is not a drop in applications for education courses.  That is not what is being indicated.  If one looks at the surveys that are coming back from schools, there does not seem to be an oversupply in certain areas.  The reality is that certain areas are not indicating any problems filling posts while others are.  Trying to increase the number of science and mathematics graduates coming into the profession is really important.</p><p> On terms and conditions, pay is an issue.  It is the elephant in the room.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Irwin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018042400002#H00200"><p>In response to Deputy O'Sullivan, a great deal of this is about the pay.  The reason it is about the pay is because there are 70,000 teachers across the primary and post-primary sectors.  In every primary and post-primary school in Ireland, there is somebody in that staffroom who is paid differently because of when he or she entered the profession.  That has resulted in the conversation in every staffroom being about teachers being treated differently from their colleagues.</p> <p>  Morale is now at an all-time low and that is not fair to students.  It is not fair to teachers either but it is ultimately not fair to students.  We recently compiled a survey and 95% of respondents told us that the status of teaching has fallen.  Anybody who goes in to teaching does so because he or she loves teaching or has experience of having a great teacher in school.  That is why I went into teaching.  A teacher made a huge difference to my life and I would like to be able to make that change to someone else's life.  However, we now have 70,000 teachers up and down the country telling their sons and daughters not to go into teaching because it is no longer an attractive profession.  Some 52% of all new entrants since 2011 stated that they would not tell a younger relative to go into the profession because they are sitting in a classroom and being treated differently.</p> <p>  We are supposed to teach our students about equality.  It is a very important issue.  We are doing it at the minute.  We have referendums going on.  Equality is a big talking point in all of our schools yet teachers are not being treated equally.  It is a major issue.  The unions are not helping in this because we are saying that teaching is not an attractive profession, and we will continue to say it until we have pay equality across the board.</p> <p>  The committee will see a dramatic increase in the number of applicants to go into teaching if this issue is resolved.  We know it will not be resolved overnight - we are realistic - but it needs to be resolved so that we can focus on the other aspects of education.  Since 2011, the focus at every branch meeting, certainly those I have been at, is the fact that teachers are paid differently.</p> <p>  Some of my own family are in Dubai teaching.  They ask: "Why should we teach here?  Why should we be here to be treated differently?  We cannot afford to live here.  We are tax free in Dubai and get two flights home every year."  They see it as a great life but it is not right that we are educating teachers to go abroad.  That is a waste of taxpayers' money.  It is not right that we would treat our citizens like that either.</p> <p>  People say it is not only a pay issue, that we need reliable data and other mechanisms.  However, that is only kicking the problem down the road.  It is only dealing with the symptoms, not the disease.  If pay parity is finally restored, the committee will see a dramatic increase in applications.  I am glad that DCU has not experienced a drop but the applications through the post-graduate application centre have dropped by 60% from the date that discriminatory pay scales were put in place.  That is the major issue.</p> <p>  Finally, 22% or one in five of all new entrants do not get a full-time contract when they start out.  Something that could be addressed straightaway is that they would get a permanent position, obviously, on probation.  They are entitled to probation for the first year.  It could be addressed that they would get full-time positions from the start.  Even if it is not permanent, to get a full-time position from the start would solve the problem also.  Teachers will not stay on three or four hours in a school to teach physics when they can get a job in industry and start off on &euro;70,000 a year.  It is a big difference.  We need to address the core issue, which is the pay scales.</p></speech>

Paul Connell" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018042400002#H00300"><p>I welcome some of the initiatives mentioned about the continuing courses, etc.  It is important though that we incentivise them for teachers, and particularly that we fund them.  Teachers have gone through an expensive process in graduating and getting through college, and if they are incentivised to go and do further courses, that will work.</p> <p>  We also have to come back to the skills mismatch.  I note some our colleagues here have stated there is no evidence of that but at school level, we are seeing the mismatch all the time.  If one advertises for particular positions, one will get a lot of applications for certain positions and very few for the STEM, the modern languages and that kind of subject.</p> <p>  We should try to find some creative way of dealing with the substitute teacher.  There is always a case that if one has too many teachers for permanent positions, there are substitute positions that will be coming up, for instance, for maternity and other leave.  These leave types need to be looked at because it is not feasible for a teacher to hang around expecting to get work - six weeks here and seven weeks there.  If there was some way of getting a substitute contract for the year where the teacher would have certainty about what he or she could expect, that would go a way towards solving some of the problems we have.</p> <p>  Finally, and I do not want to be in any way misunderstood about this, we also need to take account of the new initiatives, such as parental leave, paternity leave and unpaid leave.  These pose a particular difficulty in secondary schools because it can be difficult to get a teacher in a particular language area or whatever, for example, for a three-week or a four-week break.  In other areas of employment, it is much easier for people to cover for each other.  It is not that easy at second level.  We need to give some thought to that.  I am not in any way saying such leave should not be availed of - of course, it should - but we need to make some provision for it within the system.</p></speech>

Connell, he referred to the five-day rule.  Has he any suggestions as to how that can be changed or what should be proposed?  I understand that the five-day rule is causing a problem for some schools.</p> <p>  We have referred a great deal to the shortage of substitute teachers.  The fact that 5,000 full-time posts have been created over the past two years is probably having an impact on substitutes being available.</p> <p>  We referred to the fact that there is a shortage in the STEM subjects.  Is there any data to show that there are shortages in any other areas?</p> <p>  We have incentives to encourage students, in primary school and then in secondary, to take an interest in the STEM subjects, for instance, the BT Young Scientist which encourages them to look at the STEM subjects in terms of teaching posts down the road.  Is there anything we can do to start to encourage pupils at a young age, as they go up through their education, to be interested in some of the areas where there are shortages?</p> <p>  Some substitute teachers have one or two subjects.  On how to add to one's portfolio, is there any way of fast-tracking or shortlisting or are there any subjects that are complementary to one another that we could put together?</p> <p>  Recently the Minister set up the steering group.  How are they finding their input in relation to that?</p> <p>  We all support the issue of the different pay scales but my understanding is talks are to start shortly with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER.  My understanding is it will be in the next couple of days.  The witnesses might comment in that regard.</p></speech>

The concern of teachers is that those pay talks will look at the length of the salary scales across the public sector because of all of the public sector had two additional points added to their scale.  We are hopeful, but do not know, that it will deal with the fact that teachers were disproportionately hit in that they lost the HDip allowance.</p><p>We do not know if this will be part of the talks.  The new teachers lost incremental recognition for pre-service training.  Will this be part of the talks?  Although the talks are welcome, we do not know if they will address the full list.  We hope they will because the three teachers' unions have a joint motion on this and we have action to take if the talks do not address the three issues.</p><p> On the evidence of teacher supply and other subject areas, our Principals and Deputy Principals Association, PDA, conducted a study of all our schools in February and March.  They found that they cannot get teachers in the areas of biology, French and material technology - wood.  This is as well as the Irish, home economics and maths areas, which we spoke of earlier.</p><p> With regard to the steering group, we welcome any initiative that will improve the crisis in the teaching profession.  We also note, however, that there is no teacher representative on the group.  There is also no representative from management bodies on the group.  There are no plans that we are aware of to converse with us on that issue.  For years we have said there will be a teacher supply crisis.  The steering group has been established now but it is important that there is some sort of mechanism for the steering group to liaise with the management bodies and the teachers' unions to address some of the issues we have discussed today.</p></speech>

Of the 96 schools, more than 70 replied.  The response was consistent with what has been reported, but the problem becomes exacerbated as the year goes on.  Now we find, in the context of short-term substitution, that it becomes very difficult because, if people cannot access contracts at the end of September, they are emigrating.  These teachers are going further afield to get jobs and they can get those particular jobs.  Obviously we are not involved in the pay talks, but we sincerely hope they are successful and that they can bring that issue to an end.</p> <p>  We are delighted that the steering group is in place.  We hope it will drive the initiatives that are very much required in the coming year.  I note that Dr. Se&aacute;n Rowland, president of Hibernia College, is back.</p></speech>

There are excellent examples of collaboration between Irish schools and schools in foreign jurisdictions in the area of language learning.  This is very valuable.  Students can converse in the target language with native speakers.  All of this is very valuable.  I can understand the point around trying to access collaboration but we need teachers in our classrooms.</p></speech>

Obviously we do not wish in any sense to incentivise unqualified teachers in the classroom.  That is an absolute.  If, however, it were relaxed to allow for 30 days pending registration, this may help the situation.</p> <p>  A question was asked about what has particularly exacerbated teacher supply.  There have been a number of issues.  The increases in enrolments in schools and the growth in numbers form a big issue.  There was also an unfortunate by-product of the new junior cycle and the way it was managed.  We as the management bodies, including Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS had suggested a different approach.  The 40 minutes allocated for teacher training each week, which is very important and which we support, ended up having to put another 700 teachers into the system.  If this had been done differently, it might have avoided that difficulty.  A number of issues have come together to cause the crisis.</p></speech>

We are not saying we will replace the teacher or the school.  We would certainly not be in favour of the school that delivers to the child at home.  I have seen this in the United States of America and I believe it does not work.  My God, it is so antisocial and so bad in so many ways.  Trust me when I say that I share anyone's fears that children's educational experience might be replaced by a laptop.  That is not what is in question here at all.  Young people in Ireland today and around the developed world are on their keyboards night, noon and morning.  They are so ready and able to deal with this technology as a piece of a solution to a problem now.  This is not the thin end of the wedge.  Someone might say they are not going to have teachers and they will not have any play, but this would be nothing of the kind.  This is an auxiliary teaching opportunity and it is at a pilot stage.  Of those who were asked to take part we had a 100% "Yes".  It is small currently and we will report back directly to the Department on it.  We do not want surprises any more than anyone else.  It will work if it is educationally sound and if it complements what is happening in schools, which I believe it will because I have seen it work so successfully in schools, especially in the United States of America and in the UK.</p> <p>  There are one-year programmes for upskilling teachers.  These are one-year intensive, accredited programmes with good faculty that are delivered to every teacher who wants to take it up.  This could be online, on a campus locally, or both.  There is room for a massive upgrade.  Where I have seen this operate in the United States of America and in the UK, there is no question that if one pays the teachers, they will do it.  This is a guaranteed way for the State to get more maths or language teachers.  It is going to cost some money but it is money very well invested.  It is not a huge amount per teacher but it saves going back to the drawing board to put a teacher through a four-year or a six-year programme.  This upskilling programme is a one-year programme that would enhance the teaching profession big time.  In the two-year online programme we can reach out to every county across the State.  We can also reach out to the Middle East for teachers from Ireland.  We are doing more than just looking at it.  We are delivering teachers through this model.  These are teachers who will join the unions of the witnesses present and these are teachers who will join the schools belonging to the representatives here.  We benchmark against the best in the world.  Our international partners in research at graduate level are Harvard University, which is ranked number one in the world, Boston College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Plymouth University in the UK.  I would definitely urge the State to adopt the one-year programme.  It has worked and the University of Limerick is an example of that.  I believe that Deputy Jan O'Sullivan has been engaged in that regard and she may be able to speak on that better than I can.</p> <p>  The bottom line is that it is incumbent on all of us to use whatever means that are available to us and that we can afford so that we can get more teachers into the classrooms and before the children.  They only have one chance at fifth year and sixth year to get through.  It is a tough time for students and the least we can do is get a good teacher in front of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.233" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Anne Looney" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018042400002#J01200"><p>Senator Maria Byrne asked about the STEM subjects.  There are a number of initiatives in the early years system and the school system to encourage children and young people, especially girls, to consider courses in STEM subjects.  When we consider the data from the Higher Education Authority relevant to teaching, we graduate three arts, humanities or social sciences graduates for every one STEM graduate.  This is just how it is.  There is an imbalance in the system anyway, so the number of science graduates that are available to go into teacher education is relatively low compared with the number of graduates in history or English who are available to go into teacher education.  There are, however, a number of initiatives in that context and we do recruit a number of people who have gone into science and technology careers who, at a certain point, would like to consider teaching.  We give them the option to come back.  This is important.</p> <p>  There is a perverse positivity around the fact that we are losing some teachers internationally.  They are in very high demand.</p><p>My colleague from the TUI mentioned that.  It is evident when one travels internationally.  The quality of people whom we get into initial teacher education is exceptional, as is the quality of our graduates.  It is why countries are queuing up to recruit them.  We are doing a good job on that front and the taxpayer and people who are paying fees are getting bang for their buck.  Unfortunately, we may be contributing to the improvement of the education system in Dubai more than we are to an improvement in Dublin.  That is important to remember.</p><p> Something that we have not mentioned so far is that there are populations of people who are reluctant to move into teaching.  In particular, students from backgrounds where there might not be a tradition of attending college will often believe that teaching is not for them.  A number of initiatives in the system are giving students who would never have thought of teaching an opportunity to move into that field.  We in DCU are proud that 14% of our undergraduate primary students come through our Access programme and that, through the programme for access to higher education, PATH, fund next year, we will be accepting students into teacher education from schools that have never sent such a student to us before.  That is an untapped source of teachers.  They are excited about entering teacher education and will be significant role models for their schools and the teaching profession in the future.</p></speech>

The Teaching Council prepared a report, entitled Striking the Balance: Teacher Supply in Ireland, in 2015.  As a result, the Department has set up the steering group.  From memory, the report made 16 main recommendations, one of which was on primary education.  The needs in primary education are relatively straightforward to analyse because every primary school teacher is qualified to teach all subjects.  Analysing post-primary is more complicated and complex.  As Dr. Looney mentioned, we need good data.  When there is a crisis like this one, nothing beats having good data, as it allows us to analyse and get to the root cause.  Everyone will offer an opinion on what he or she believes is the cause and people will be inclined to speak in promotion of their agendas.  Having good data is key and can help to avoid the cyclical nature of the crisis.  The steering group set up by the Department needs to be supported and given the resources and time to produce data and implement the recommendations in the Striking the Balance: Teacher Supply in Ireland report.</p> <p>  Regarding complementary subjects, languages are a relevant area.  If someone has French, perhaps he or she could upskill in Spanish since he or she has the methodology and knows how to teach a second language.  I understand that some modern language teachers have a certain amount of Gaeilge and could upskill to teach it.  In upskilling teachers, though, we must be careful not to rob Peter to pay Paul and create a gap somewhere else.  Maths and physics were mentioned by Dr. Rowland.  There are complementary areas.  The key is to incentivise teachers.  If I as a teacher have a job teaching two subjects, why would I want to put myself through all of the pain and sweat of learning and getting another qualification?  It could be a way for people to renew their enthusiasm, but we would probably need some incentives to get them to do it.</p></speech>

I had to give a presentation elsewhere.  I wish to make a couple of comments and observations and perhaps ask one question.  I am not completely set against the idea of live streaming classes.  I support many schools that lack resources and whose classes I would love to see live streamed as opposed to how they are currently provided.  I have told the committee of how my daughter's school did not replace an Irish teacher during the leaving certificate year for more than three months.  That absence meant the class did nothing.  In such a situation, there was an opportunity for another teacher's class to be live streamed.  Rather than using it all year round, though, live streaming could be very useful in providing cover where crises or small gaps occur and where the only other option is to provide no education.</p> <p>  My next point might be tied to the issue of the teacher shortage, that being, how our young people are being failed by having teachers handle subjects that they should not be teaching.  Are teachers in those positions because there is a shortage and they have to take the jobs?  For example, if an entire Spanish or French class is failing, it is suggested that it has to be the children's fault, not the teacher's.  Are teachers being shoehorned into classes that they are not qualified to give?  I do not know whether this has always happened or whether it is because of the shortage.  Has it always been the case that some teachers are just not up to a certain standard of quality or interest in the subjects they are teaching and that this has had an impact?</p> <p>  I agree with the points about pay scales and so on and I understand how we could transform this situation were we to improve teachers' conditions.  In most of the schools that I have attended and visited, though, I have seen teachers giving classes to foundation and higher level students in the same room.  Those kids are being dragged into having the same standard of teaching even though they are all at different levels.  Virtual learning could play a role in this regard, but does the fact that these schools are not creating enough classrooms to meet the individual needs of their teachers have anything to do with the teacher shortage?  Would it be addressed by tackling the shortage?</p> <p>  Is the shortage of teachers causing them to be in classrooms where they should not be?  Thinking back to my own education, which was nearly 20 years ago, I sat in many classrooms where we were just handed out a worksheet or workbook, especially where Irish was concerned.  Regardless of whether there has been a shortage of teachers, there has been a deficit in the teaching of Irish in schools for a long time.  Can we diversify the teaching profession in terms of how Irish is taught, particularly DEIS schools, and can we create more opportunities for the migrant community and kids from working-class communities to become teachers?  Many of the people in those populations are rooted in their communities and would be less likely to move to Dubai, or they are mature students who have no education and do not have a standard of maths or Irish.  Is there room to create targeted programmes to get them into teaching?  For some, the maths and Irish requirements can be an obstacle to entering the profession.  If we diversify the profession, can we address the shortage with that long-term view?</p></speech>

There are many good ideas floating around and I compliment the witnesses on their contributions.</p> <p>  It is disappointing that this problem has been allowed to develop to the point of becoming critical.  We have given Dr. Rowland a bit of stick about his plan.  Everyone, including him, accepts that there is no substitute for a teacher in the classroom, but his plan is not something that I would dismiss as an idea to address the critical situation facing us.</p> <p>  Ms Irwin put her finger on the issue.  We can dance around it, but the reality is that, if we are serious about solving this problem, it will take money.  Yesterday, we heard a report about the capitation grant for primary schools and how parents were contributing approximately &euro;46 million per year for basic services like light and heat just to keep our schools open.  I will not be political about this, but it comes down to choices that Governments make about which services we value.</p> <p>  Dr. Looney referred to another matter.  To use my words rather than hers, there seems to be a vacuum.  Judging from the witnesses' contributions, the Department does not seem to be listening to what their organisations have been telling it for a long time.  Be it in terms of junior certificate reform or, as Dr. Looney mentioned, religious teaching in former VEC schools, the Department occasionally throws stuff overboard without any consultation or warning.</p><p>That exacerbates an existing problem, and it is very frustrating.  First, do the witnesses believe they are talking to themselves when they are talking to the Department and how long have they been flagging that this problem was coming down the tracks?  Second, regarding substitute teachers, what is their view of a proposal whereby a basic salary would be paid to a substitute teacher?  Regardless of the hours they would work, they would be guaranteed a basic salary, which might encourage people to take up the position.</p><p> I have two brief final questions, and I thank the Acting Chairman for the latitude.  First, if there is goodwill on the part of the Department, what do the witnesses believe is the period of time it will take to address this issue?  Second, if each of the witnesses were given one solution outside the financial end of it, which we believe is the critical issue, what would be the key recommendation they believe would have the maximum impact?</p></speech>

We have had a tremendous exchange between the people who have given evidence, which is rather interesting.  There has been great dialogue and clarification with regard to issues.</p> <p>  In regard to equal pay, I would say to Ms Joanne Irwin that Senators Lynn Ruane, Maria Byrne and Robbie Gallagher were elected two years ago.  I was elected 16 years ago and they are getting equal pay.  That is the standard we have here.  Deputies who were elected two years ago are getting the same pay as Deputies, like the former Taoiseach and others, who have been here for a very long time.  We set a standard here to which we should adhere.  I am sure my colleagues here would be very disappointed if they were getting &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 less than what I am getting, yet I am participating in this meeting.  I want to make that point.</p> <p>  I have knowledge of the training and recruitment work of Dr. Se&aacute;n Rowland, president of Hibernia College, who is accompanied by Denis Cummins, the academic dean of Hibernia College, which has trained more than 10,000 teachers without any subsidy, to my knowledge.</p></speech>

I have experience of the work of some of the teachers.  Initially, there was resentment and pressure from the primary schools and now the most sought-after teachers are those who were trained in Hibernia College because most of them want to be teachers and have a passion to be trained and educated.  That is where the rigorous standards, assessments and masters courses come in.</p> <p>  There has been a misunderstanding about the issue of distance education.  I picked up on that a long time ago.  I refer to circumstances where someone with the required knowledge can give one hour per week or whatever.  It is not a replacement or a substitution.  It is an addition.  To get somebody from Harvard University to give a one-hour lecture in a supervised class is a magnificent idea.  It broadens the mind of young people to see the technology and the interaction between that lecturer and the classroom, but it is not a replacement.  Let no one misrepresent the position.  That is done only in the circumstances of enhancing the educational experience of the young people who want to be educated.</p> <p>  I have a question for Dr. Rowland.  How can he increase the capacity to cope with the current demand?</p></speech>

They are much appreciated.  The main question is how we can increase the numbers coming in to Hibernia College.  To be fair, Dr. Anne Looney and I had an exchange a moment ago and we are not experiencing drops in our numbers, so let us start from that point.  How do we build from where we are?  I will talk about Hibernia College but I am sure all the other colleges can build from-----</p></speech>

The numbers have dropped at least 50% in the past ten years, some would say even 70%.  Of the 10,000 we educate, 8,000 are educated at our primary level.  We have only started educating at post-primary level in recent years.  Our numbers were always low.  They are where they are, but to answer the Acting Chairman's question, if we needed to get another 100 mathematics teachers, we would pay them.  It is that simple.  Money is the answer, as awful as that sounds.  If we pay the tuition fee for them, and we do not get any money from the Government, so it is highly unlikely that will change suddenly, and our students-----</p></speech>

We will get qualified teachers.  Is that unfair?  It is very fair to the students who are sitting there this week without a mathematics teacher.  The situation is that we will have to pay the piper.  We cannot get teachers on the cheap, and we should not.  Let us see if we can get the best people available who will say they are finishing a degree and they want to go to anywhere in the country.  We should pay them and see how many we get.  They should be given a three-year contract with whoever it is and set out exactly what is wanted.  Find out what everybody wants within the scope of paying them.  I am just saying we should pay for their tuition.  If they are travelling to a college, they will then have to take care of that cost.  If they are coming to us, they do not have to travel.  They can stay at home.  If they are travelling to a different college, they will need to pay rent, but if their tuition is paid, I believe we will get somewhere.  That is the most obvious answer to this issue.</p> <p>  We have people running around doing four and six hours.  That is not fair on them or on the profession, and it is certainly losing our applicants.  We will go to where the United Kingdom went in terms of its applicants.  Having been involved in it for a number of years, I would say they are not at the standard at second or primary level that all of ours have reached.  They certainly have great people but they do not have as many going into teaching now who would be of the calibre of those we get to interview.  We interview everybody - primary, second level and post-primary - and we turn people away who do not pass the interview.  We are looking for traits like empathy, just a regular personality.  The committee should look at that because it is very simple.</p></speech>

I suspect when it comes to the magic question asked by Senator Gallagher about the two key solutions we would choose, the answer would cost money, so I will leave that side to my colleague.  Some of Senator Ruane's points, particularly about the way classes are organised, might be better addressed by colleagues from the management body.  I would say to the Senator that I mentioned in an observation I was making that we are trying to widen the population of people coming into teaching and that we are proud of our partnership.  We have two hubs on Dublin's north side where we are working with young people and older people to enable them to come into teaching.  We have experienced some success, and we will be welcoming them in September.  That is broadening the base of people coming into teaching.  That is important in ensuring we get a more diverse teaching population, not just high quality but also from a wider range of families.  Some of those are coming from non-traditional backgrounds and are the children of immigrants.  That will be an important development within the teaching profession and we in DCU are very proud of that.  Other institutions are doing that as well.</p> <p>  On the issue of data and the numbers, I would remind the committee that the PME used to be called the HDip, which took one year to complete.  In 2012, a decision was made to lengthen the period of teacher education in Ireland.  I mentioned some of the reasons for that but additional resources were not provided to the higher educational institutions, which meant that most of them reduced their numbers of students by half because they had to keep the students twice as long.</p><p>This resulted in a reduction in the number of students and applications, but those numbers have steadily returned.  Last year, DCU experienced a 10% increase in its post-primary PME places.  We are up 25% this year on last year for those places.  This year, on Central Applications Office first choices, education as an undergraduate choice is up just short of 10% overall.  Therefore, the idea-----</p></speech>

For us in DCU, all our undergraduate places - that is, concurrent and primary concurrent - are up.  We are very pleased with that.  We went out actively promoting teaching as a career and we are looking forward to welcoming, as I said, that wider, diverse population.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher asked the magic question: what is the one thing we would do?  We had a quick consultation.</p></speech>

The type of concurrent programme we are developing in Gaeilge and languages is to address these types of issues in order to produce language teachers from the very first day of their four-year university programme, education and languages running concurrently.  They will spend time abroad and in the Gaeltacht and there will be a strong emphasis on how to teach language.</p> <p>  Does the Department of Education and Skills listen to us?  At primary level, the Department determines the numbers that go into primary teaching when it comes to the publicly funded colleges.  The Department therefore determines our B.Ed. and professional master of education numbers.  If there is a shortage, the Department can lift the cap or increase the numbers.  It does not cost the Department anything to increase the numbers doing our professional master of education, the two-year postgraduate programme, because we get no subvention.  While Hibernia does not get a subvention, neither do publicly-funded colleges for their professional master of education programmes, so there is no extra cost to the State.  We currently have 60 students.  The Department could up that to allow us to take in double that number and it would not cost a penny.</p></speech>

Senator Gallagher referred to a salary for substitute teachers.  In many jurisdictions - for example, the UK and many other countries - there is a supply panel on which there are a number of teachers for whom substitution is their role for the year.  They are contracted to be supply teachers, so if a teacher is out sick or on professional development, a teacher from the supply panel comes in.  There were two pilots in Ireland throughout the 2000s but they were ended with the advent of austerity.  We and, I think, the unions would suggest that such a model needs to be implemented, although perhaps slightly revised from what was previously implemented because it seems the Department feels it was too expensive.  The answer to the question of primary schools being able to get teachers is to have a supply panel to be able to get substitute teachers.  That is one suggestion.  At post-primary, we would suggest full-time contracts.  As Ms Irwin said, 22% of new entrants do not get a full-time contract.  That will not attract teachers to stay in the country.  To a parent faced with his or her son or daughter having perhaps &euro;20,000 a year versus &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000, it is clear what the choice would be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Irwin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2018042400002#M01400"><p>In response to Senator Ruane's question, there absolutely are teachers who are teaching outside of their fields.  In fairness to the management of the schools, however, they must have teachers in front of the class.  It all comes back to the issue of resources.  If resources were put into a school, this would not arise.</p> <p>  Mixed ability classes suit some students.  They can learn from one another in mixed ability classes.  They do not suit all students.  The reform of the junior cycle is moving to common level papers.  That may alleviate the problem somewhat as well.</p> <p>  I could not agree more with the Senator's comments on the diversification of the teaching profession.  Students relate to the teachers who are in front of them.  The teachers in front of them need to be in reach of the students' own perspectives and where they are from.  I work in adult and further education and we have programmes that can be done by students who are adults or for whom the second-level system just did not suit them.  They come to us to overcome the shortfalls to be able to progress to third level.  It might take them longer to get there but they get there in the end.</p> <p>  To respond to Senator Gallagher, we have been beating the drum on the issue he raised for seven years, since 2011.  Lack of consultation is always the problem.  We have found that things progress when we are consulted.  We saw this when we worked with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan on the junior cycle.  We see it in the technological universities project in that when we are involved and consulted, things move forward.  The Department of Education and Skills, in fairness to it, is not our problem in this regard.  The Department and the officials do what their political masters tell them to do.  This is a political decision as to whether or not to fix the new entrant pay scales for teachers, for example.  All these issues are political decisions, so it is members across the table who can rectify them because it is they who tell the Department of Education and Skills officials what to do, essentially.  Sometimes we speak of the Department of Education and Skills in this regard.  Ultimately, it is not the Department but the politicians.</p> <p>  One of the key recommendations is permanent contracts from the outset.  I agree with Professor &Oacute; Duibhir on this.  That only 22% are getting full-time hours is ridiculous when we have such a shortage of teachers.  On paying substitute teachers, the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, recently conducted research in conjunction with ICTU, ourselves, the ASTI and the INTO.  What we suggested is that in the second year of the PME, when the students are out on their work placements, they would get paid for that, rather than being out in the schools effectively teaching classes for free.  This would alleviate much of the substitute crisis as well.  These teachers could register with the Teaching Council, albeit conditional registration for their second year.  They can register for further education and then be paid.  They would not get the qualified rate, but they would be paid.  That would alleviate some of the problem.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Leyden, I am delighted Senators are finally acknowledging that there is no two-tier pay structure in Leinster House.  If all the politicians in Leinster House acknowledged this, I do not think we would have two-tier pay scales anywhere in the public sector.  As a result, we absolutely welcome his comment on that.</p> <p>  To respond to the question that was put to my colleague from Hibernia, publicly-funded higher education institutions are effectively capped in what they can take in because of the budget cuts and staffing restrictions.  Those restrictions do not apply to private for-profit organisations.  They do apply to publicly funded education.  The universities have seen their funding cut by 26%, the institutes of technology by 32%, and at the same time they have had a 10% cut in staffing.  Hence, they have restrictions placed upon them that private for-profit organisations do not.  I just wanted to make that point.</p></speech>

She asked about the teaching of Irish.  I suspect, and I would like to see some research done on this, that the success of getting Irish as a full EU language has helped to open up the world of work in many ways to Irish graduates in a way that was not the case before, except perhaps in teaching or the Civil Service.  Regarding substitute teachers, it is a reality and has been for some time that there must be a teacher in front of a classroom.  Put simply, on our level, we cannot get substitute teachers qualified to teach the particular subjects of an absence because one does not know from day to day what teachers might be absent.  One knows about some that are flagged within the service but one does not know about others.  I welcome the suggestion that a basic salary be looked at for substitute teachers.  I think that would help.</p> <p>  If I had one choice, entry to the PME would comprise perhaps an interview as well as just an application.  I concur with my colleague from the TUI: there is a subsidy to Hibernia in the sense that Hibernia is treated exactly the same in our schools as the State colleges are in that we provide the same service for the PME students at no cost to Hibernia.  Therefore, there is a difference between a publicly-funded institution, such as a third level college or ourselves, and Hibernia, which is a private company.</p></speech>

I understand how, given the shortage of teachers, we will end up with someone who is unqualified to teach a certain subject taught by an absentee, but I am wondering about teachers who are actually permanent employees, who are three, four, five, six or seven years into their employment in teaching a subject that they clearly should not be teaching.  Is this a whole other problem?</p></speech>

Charges were made against the latter, so I will have to get his response to them as well as to queries.</p></speech>

I would concur with Ms Irwin fully on that.  The Department is quite open and I would say that a number of the initiatives which have been taken in recent times are through the dialogue that has taken place.  That dialogue has been facilitated by the Department and by the Teaching Council.  There are initiatives taking place.  I would find the Department very open, to be quite honest, when meeting with it.</p> <p>  Going back to the teaching of Irish, Ms Irwin said that the Irish education system was a high-performing education system.  Through the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA, results, OECD comparisons and so on, we are performing very highly, but one area where the improvement has not been as dramatic as in other areas is in Irish but I think that has to do with a lot of historical baggage that has been attached to Irish at times.  There has been a huge initiative and a lot of support is going in to try to improve the profile of Irish within schools.  In certain cases, students resent having to study the language and that has been detrimental to the success of the language in schools at times.</p> <p>  Looking at key recommendations in terms of how we solve the immediate problems, we can look at the second year of the Professional Master of Education, PME, and how it provides the opportunity for second year PME teachers to teach in schools and to be paid.  This will also assist in alleviating some of the costs they have in terms of achieving their qualifications.</p> <p>  We have to look at two other areas.  I refer to return pathways for those who are away and how we encourage them back into our system and how we make it easier for them to come back and identify vacancies easily.  I refer also to the entry of experienced people from the private sector if they want to become involved and bring that experience to education and making that access easier.</p></speech>

Hibernia College would be very strong on the teaching of Irish.  This year alone our students will spend over &euro;2 million in dedicated Gaeltacht areas.  We would be very supportive of our Gaeltachts and of them being of the highest calibre.  Arising from this meeting, all I can say is that we would all agree that we should pay teachers equally and then move on from there.  Our model must evolve.  Our returning teachers are vital.  The budget shows that the State sector has been crucified, with which we certainly empathise.  Our State budget is zero.  However, as pointed out, schools are extremely helpful when it comes to teaching practice, or TP as it is called.  In some cases over the years, we have been told we are sponsored because the Department provides us with candidates who already have primary and secondary schooling.  That is another way of looking at it.  The bottom line is that we are providing a substantial number of teachers.  We are doing the very best we can to make sure they are the best teachers for children and young people in this country.</p> <p>  Taking shots about whether one is private or public really does not matter.  Some of the best institutions in the world, and which are in the top rankings, are private.  We try to do our best and we do a very good job with a very modest budget.  We should all be able to work together, whether private, religious, public or State, as long as we are doing accredited honours work.</p></speech>

I am not allowed to put down a motion without giving three days notice, but I would like to wish the unions and, indeed, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the very best of luck this week as the talks start, pursuant to the clause in the public pay agreement on newly-qualified workers, which includes teachers but not solely teachers.  From what members of this committee have said, I do not believe anybody disagrees with the proposal that teachers and, indeed, all public sector workers should be on identical pay scales and that pay scale equality should be brought in.  We certainly hope there is a positive outcome.  I believe I am expressing the view of the committee - looking around there is no dissent - that we support the talks this week and we wish and expect them to reach a successful conclusion.</p> <p>  It is proposed to go into private session to deal with a number of housekeeping matters.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.284" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Carol Boate" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018042400002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to provide an overview of the operation of the national lottery.  This is my first time to appear before the committee.</p> <p>  To facilitate the committee in understanding the operation of the national lottery, it is useful to provide members with a timeline of the changes which came about when the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform awarded a 20-year licence to Premier Lotteries Ireland on 27 February 2014, which began operating the national lottery on 30 November 2014.  The first regulator was appointed on 17 November 2014 and resigned on 3 May 2017 to take up a post elsewhere.  I was appointed on 9 October 2017.  In the period before the first regulator was appointed and the interim period between our appointments, the Minister acted as the regulator. </p> <p>  I would also like to draw the members' attention to the respective roles of the operator and the regulator.  These roles are set out in the National Lottery Act 2013 and the licence to operate the national lottery.  Under the Act, the operator of the national lottery has the sole purpose of operating the national lottery in accordance with the terms and conditions of the licence.  The operator must report to the regulator on its activities and it must appear before this committee when requested to do so. </p> <p>  The functions of the regulator under the Act are to procure the holding of the national lottery; to monitor and enforce compliance by the operator with the Act and the licence; to manage and control the national lottery fund; to consider for approval certain matters relating to the national lottery, including schemes for national lottery games; and to exercise the enforcement rights of any trademark of the national lottery.  The regulator must exercise these functions with the objectives of ensuring the probity and long-term sustainability of the national lottery, that the interests of participants are protected, and, subject to those objectives being met, maximise returns for good causes.</p><p>Thus, the regulatory role centres around ensuring that the requirements of the Act and the licence are being met, with statutory powers to support this.  Some aspects of the operation of the national lottery require regulatory approval in advance and I have statutory powers to investigate any apparent breaches.  Operational matters which do not require approval or are not a breach of the licence are entirely a matter for the operator.</p><p> The Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery is staffed with relevant expertise to support its functions.  This includes expertise in accounting, audit, law, psychology, data analysis, risk management and regulation.  I am trained in regulatory governance and have a background in regulating for effective competition and consumer protection.  I am joined today by the deputy regulator and head of audit and finance, Mr. Derek Donohoe, who was previously a partner in a leading Irish accountancy practice with significant experience of auditing, forensic accounting, corporate governance and compliance.</p><p> In order to monitor and enforce compliance by the operator, my office has a range of information-gathering mechanisms in place.  These include 31 different regular reports from the operator; real-time access to data from the operator&rsquo;s business systems; regular meetings with the operator; oversight of the processes and controls applied by the operator; monitoring the marketing and PR activities of the operator; and other proactive reviews, investigations, and requests for reports or information on specific matters.  The information we glean from these monitoring activities is combined with my powers under the Act and a risk-based approach to ensuring compliance.</p><p> A range of the operator&rsquo;s activities require the written approval or consent of the regulator.  These include new lottery games, new service providers, and changes to codes of practice for sales, advertising and promotion, participant relations and employee vetting.  Every request for approval or consent is scrutinised to assess whether it complies with the Act and the licence.  Each assessment involves a wide range of aspects of the request and of the licence.  If the regulator is not satisfied that a request is compliant, the operator may be asked for further information or explanation.  Often, the operator submits an amended proposal or an explanation that removes any concern and the request is ultimately approved.  If the operator is unable to address the concerns within the required time limit, the request is rejected or withdrawn.  Since the commencement of the licence, the regulator has received 113 requests from the operator that have been considered and concluded.  Ultimately, 87 were approved, 19 were rejected, and seven were withdrawn.  I have attached to this presentation an up-to-date list of these requests.</p><p> A key function of the regulator is to manage and control the national lottery fund.  Every week we thoroughly review detailed financial reports from the operator and receive and disburse funds appropriately.  We can cross-reference these weekly reports with both the real-time access we have to the operator&rsquo;s systems and other reports we receive.  The fund is audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Under the licence, prizes must, on average across the portfolio of national lottery games, be at least 50% of sales.  The amount allocated to good causes is 65% of the difference between sales after free ticket prizes and retailer&rsquo;s commission, and prizes.  Returns to good causes have increased each year since the start of the licence.  In 2017, over &euro;226 million was transferred for good causes.  The amount for 2016 was &euro;218.9 million, &euro;7 million of which related to sales in previous years, and in 2015 it was &euro;193.3 million.</p><p> The operator has provided the following information.  In 2017, 1.45 million people played lottery games on a regular basis, that is, in the past month, representing 41% of the adult population.  Ticket sales for 2017 amounted to &euro;800 million and in 2016 to &euro;750 m.  Sales for draw-based games were &euro;559 million in 2017 and &euro;530 million in 2016.  Scratch card and online instant win games accounted for &euro;241 million in 2017 and &euro;220 million in 2016.  With respect to the sales channel, 93.5% of sales in 2017 were in retail and 6.5% were online.</p><p> The number of retail outlets increased from just over 3,700 at the start of the licence to 5,780.  The largest part of the increase resulted from extending the network from one third of post offices to all post offices, including sub post offices, in 2016.  Some 1,811 of the new retail outlets operate a restricted range of draw-based games and scratch cards.  Some 500 of these are post office outlets co-located within an existing national lottery retailer.</p><p>The same codes and controls apply to every retail outlet regardless of its ownership or size.</p><p> In 2017, on average over the whole network, terminals were available to sell tickets 99.98% of the time.  Availability of website services varied from 99.81% to 99.99% of the time.  This performance is in line with the 99% standard required under the licence.</p><p> I hope the information in my presentation has been helpful to the committee in providing an overview of the operation of the national lottery and the role of the regulator.  I look forward to answering members' questions.</p></speech>

In terms of young people and online gambling, how does Ms Boate ensure that people using the national lottery online system are over the age of 18?</p></speech>

There are also triggers involving specific identification checks.  If one wins a prize of &euro;500 or more or withdraws &euro;200 or more, one must provide identification to receive the money.  Spot checks are performed every month on a random selection of online players to ask for identification and ensure they are of age.</p></speech>

The requirements contain deterrents to such a practice.  If young people knew they would not be able to claim a prize or win, they would have less incentive to gamble.</p> <p>  Another mechanism in place is that the national lottery is not allowed to have games or advertisements that particularly appeal to children.  I do not know enough about the previous licences to say if that has always been in place but it has been applied very rigorously under this licence.  For example, the Senator will see in the table I have provided of all requests to date that the game "Monopoly" was put forward as a proposal by the operator.  It is one of the biggest-selling scratch cards in the world and there are online versions of it.  That was refused by my predecessor because it would be of particular appeal to children.  We also try to ensure the national lottery games are not attractive to persons under 18.</p></speech>

They can set that exclusion for a few days, for a month or six months and throughout that period, they cannot get back into their account.  They do not receive any marketing emails or messages throughout that period and the operator goes a step further and also does not send them any marketing emails after the period has expired unless they come back and engage.</p></speech>

I have a very narrow role, which is to regulate the national lottery.  It is possibly unique as I have not yet found another regulator who regulates only one company.  That is what I do.  My job is to procure the services of a company to run the national lottery and ensure that the company runs it in line with the Act and the licence.  How the entire wider gambling sector is regulated is not a matter for me and I do not think it would be appropriate for me to comment.</p></speech>

I am glad Ms Boate is here because I have been asking questions about her role as regulator and also about the licence that was allocated to Premier Lotteries Ireland, PLI, in 2014.  I am interested in the sales code of practice of the national lottery.  Will Ms Boate explain how that came into being and the interaction of the regulator with the code of practice?</p></speech>

The operator was initially required to draft the code and present it to the regulator for approval.  Every year, the operator must review each of these codes and consider whether they require amendment or improvements and submit that to the regulator for approval.  The regulator's role is to approve it or to approve it with modifications.</p><p>If something came before me and I disagreed with the improvement, I could reject it, but I would have to give the reasons that it was not compliant with the Act and the licence.  I could make modifications to it, but I would have to justify why that is in compliance with the Act and the licence.  There is a process set up to look at that.</p><p> The sales code of practice, as the name suggests, applies to how national lottery tickets are sold.  It applies to the operator and to every retail outlet that sells national lottery tickets.</p></speech>

The idea that Ulster Bank would submit a proposal to the regulator in the Central Bank of Ireland showing the way the bank wanted to deal with an issue would not be a runner.  We would call that light touch regulation.  I am conscious that the regulator of the national lottery has to work within the Act.  The national lottery has done a great deal of good and has served this State well in its contribution to good causes.  We can see its fingerprints across society.  As my colleague, Senator Rose Conway-Walsh, said, it is also gambling.  We have to be very careful and there is a need for sufficient and robust regulation.  Does Ms Boate think it is appropriate that the sales code of practice would be drafted by the entity that the national lottery regulator is regulating?</p></speech>

In fact, I find that when speaking on my role as regulator, I have to explain my role as being slightly different from the norm.  People may say that a regulator will do a consultation on some new standards that his or her office is thinking of bringing in, make a decision and apply them.  That is perhaps what would be done with a code in the financial or any other sector.  In this case, however, there is only one licensee and the State has signed a contract with the licensee to run the national lottery for us.  It is our national lottery, but essentially they run it for us and they can take the profits.  They paid &euro;405 million for that licence and my job is to ensure that the contract is enforced.  It is unusual, perhaps, because there is only one company involved.  It is they who draft the codes and the licence does specify what those codes must cover.  The sales code is not the easiest example to talk about.  Perhaps the advertising code is easier to understand in the sense that one of the major exercises that was done in 2016 and 2017 was to put all of the rules about advertising gambling that are in the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland's code into the advertising and promotion code applying to the national lottery.  It definitely should not be any weaker, and if anything it should be stricter, because the conditions were lifted, lock, stock and barrel into the advertising code.  We keep abreast of what the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is doing, what else is happening in the general space of the online world, and what the Oireachtas is saying about social media and online selling.</p></speech>

When he or she drives down the street in any place in rural Ireland, there will be a sign on a lamp post outside of a shop saying "National Lottery", there will be a lotto checker at the door as that person goes into the shop, and there will be a terminal sitting on the counter where that person must go to pay for the goods he or she wants to buy.</p><p>There are big billboards with a local person or someone from the county who may have won a prize on them.  They show gigantic cheques, which we are used to thinking of in connection with People in Need.  There are big flat-screen televisions showing how much the lotto prize is.  If one happens to download the app to check lotto tickets, one is reminded on a daily basis to play the lotto.  There is a huge difference in the aggressive marketing by this private company and the marketing when the State had the contract.  Is Ms Boate not concerned?  The national lottery is important and it has done a lot of good but it also has gambling at its core.  Aggressive marketing is very dangerous.  Is Ms Boate not concerned about that in terms of what we have seen happening since PLI took over the contract?</p></speech>

My role in advertising relates to the content and not to the amount of advertising.  The advertising code is very strict in terms of what advertising PLI is allowed to do and not do.  For example, it is not allowed to suggest in any way that playing the lottery is a valid financial investment or solution to a person's money worries.  It is not allowed to use children in its advertisements.  It cannot use the heroes of children or anything that might appeal to children.  There is no restriction on the volume of advertising it can engage in.</p></speech>

I contend very strongly that the balance has been all wrong here since a private company came over and took over the contract.  It is paying for it but it is also making huge profits as a result.  There is a figure that screams out to me.  When the State handed over to PLI in 2014 there were 3,700 retail agents in the State.  In the three years and a bit between 2014 and now, 2,019 new retail agents are selling the national lottery.  It is out of control.  It is a runaway train.  If we continue with this trend between now and the expiry of its contract, there will be about 16,000 retail agents.  It is not only retail agents because one cannot go into a post office now without being hit by all of the promotional material.  There is absolutely no restriction on the number of outlets where it can target individuals to play its games.</p></speech>

National lottery tickets cannot be sold where alcohol is served or in a shop that is mainly for children such as a toy shop or one selling children's clothes.  There are no restrictions on the numbers but that is what the licence says.  My role is to implement what the licence says.</p></speech>

It has always been Government policy to grow it.  The minimum was increasing all the time.  I read the Act and the licence very carefully to be sure I understand what the Oireachtas has asked me to do, and what the licence requires the company to do, and it is clear the policy has always been to keep growing the national lottery.  The licence is a continuation of that.  My personal view on what the State ought to be doing is not relevant.</p></speech>

When the licence was handed over by the State to a private company in 2014, nobody thought that within three years there would be 64% more outlets selling the national lottery in the State or that there would be the type of aggressive marketing I have referred to.  Nobody thought we were going to go to that level.  The Central Bank has a role in saying something is not in the law but it thinks the Oireachtas should look at amending the law.  Has Ms Boate taken that position with the Minister?  Is it something she would consider doing?</p></speech>

I understand the point he is making.  I will tell the Deputy what is of concern to me and what I am doing right now.  Perhaps after I have done the things I am planning to do, I will consider the question the Deputy has understandably asked me.  I am concerned that the increase in the number of outlets is matched by an increase in the resources going into overseeing, monitoring and supporting every retail outlet.  What is very important is how national lottery tickets are sold or not sold.  As I mentioned earlier, the sales and advertising codes apply equally to every type of outlet and to every individual outlet.  It is the operator's responsibility to make sure every outlet is selling tickets responsibly.  That includes things like having very visible signs about it being an over-18s product.  It should be very clear it is only for over-18s.  They are obliged not to sell to anybody under 18 and if they think a person might be under 18 they must ask for identification.  They are obliged to engage in responsible selling and there are training videos, posters and materials to support that.  The operator is obliged to monitor this and make sure it is happening.  I then monitor the operator and hold the operator to account.  If there is a large increase in the number of outlets, as the Deputy has correctly pointed out, there should be a corresponding adjustment to the resources and tools being used by the operator to oversee them.  I launched a number of reviews and initiatives this year to ensure and check it is actually happening on the ground.</p></speech>

A number were not approved.  I am not familiar with these games but I have children.  I have four young boys and when they talk about prize ducks they think of little yellow ducks going around the water at the fair.  It is a gambling game that was approved by the regulator.  The name "sweets and treats" is something that would appeal to kids.  It is not really something that is targeted at over-18s.  It was approved by the regulator.  Snap poker, horoscope, Blackbeard's gold, fish for gold were all withdrawn.  There has been a huge expansion in the number of games the company is applying for.  Some of their names seem to be targeted less at over-18s and more at under-18s.  If I went to any marketing company and asked it whether a game called "sweets and treats" or "prize ducks" was targeted at me or my kids, it would be a no-brainer.  I do not know the games or the regulation but it is clearly hovering and pushing the boundaries, if it is not well over the boundaries, and trying to target young people.  There is also the appearance, including the colours that are used, the images of sweet wrappers.  That is what it is about.</p><p>I have no problem with responsible gambling.  I do the lotto myself.  I place a bet on horses the odd time and so on.  I also recognise the danger it has to society.  I would argue that some of this is seriously concerning.  It is clearly targeted at children.  Will the witnesses answer that question?  Do they believe that Sweets and Treats is targeted at over 18s or under 18s?</p></speech>

Monopoly, for example, had not been so there was an opportunity to consider whether it was suitable under the new licence.  I think our regime is quite strict compared with other countries and sometimes compared with the old regime.  As we learned, much more is understood about these kinds of products, the harm that can arise from them and the issues that some people can develop with them.  We are particularly vigilant about under 18s.  We spent a good bit of time looking at ways to ensure that the products will not be sold to under 18s and do not appeal to under 18s.  Hamper Sweets and Treats is a Christmas-themed game that has been on sale every Christmas.</p></speech>

It is played online.  Risk assessment was done, it was considered with regard to its possible appeal to children and, on balance, it was approved.  Importantly, no branding was associated with that which would be recognisable to children.  For example, if a children's character was associated with it, it is unlikely it would have been approved, but because "prize ducks" is a generic term and was not of particular relevance or appeal to children, it was approved by the previous regulator.</p></speech>

For some people, the idea that their numbers would come up and they forgot to put them in would be too much.  They like the idea of being able to play every week or every draw.  The financial mechanism or instrument used is different in every case but the idea is that one pays money every draw or every month to facilitate that.  The company decided to propose something like that facility for Ireland.  It was refused on the basis that I believed it raised too many risks, was not sufficiently protective of the interests of players and presented too many risks to the reputation and sustainability of the national lottery.</p></speech>

Some of this is outside of the control of the witnesses.  There are serious questions for the Department and Minister about the 2014 contract, specifically the changes to that contract, which I understand happened midstream and which allowed for unclaimed prizes to be used by the company to promote and advertise the games.  Before this, unclaimed prizes all went back into the pool of winnings.  The company now gets to use unclaimed prizes for operational costs.  I have been trying to get information on the level of unclaimed prizes, how much has gone into special draws and how much is being used for advertising.  Are the witnesses aware of those numbers and will they inform the committee about those numbers?</p></speech>

Previously, unclaimed prizes all went back as prizes in another way.  They were used to top-up prizes, maybe at St. Patrick's weekend or such.  Under the new licence, unclaimed prizes may still be used for top-up prizes but may also be used for advertising and promotion of the national lottery.  If anything is not spent within the 365 day period, that group returns to good causes.  My role is to make sure that the right amount of money is in the right place at the right time, that that is what unclaimed prizes are being spent on and nothing else, and that only unclaimed prizes go into that money.  I know the amounts.  We monitor this regularly.  We have a number of different reporting mechanisms to make sure we keep an eye on unclaimed prizes, the value of them and where the money is going.  I know all of the figures involved.  Some of the coverage of this issue has been a bit unclear.  There is no question of the company not doing what it is supposed to do under the licence.  It is supposed to spend the money on the three things mentioned, on top-up prizes and promotion, with anything left over going to good causes.  Based on all the information I have and all of the reports and reviews we have done, there is nothing to suggest that the company is doing anything other than that.</p></speech>

If they were unclaimed, they went back in to players as top-up prizes.  For example, we might put an extra &euro;1 million on the lotto jackpot for a certain weekend.  It is important to be clear that unclaimed prizes are never zero.  People always lose tickets or forget to check their numbers.  Some people do not bother collecting a prize.  Regardless of where they were going to go, we would always check-----</p></speech>

It is important that we know how much in unclaimed prizes this company is using to deal with operational costs.  We do not know that.  We have no transparency about that.  The argument from the regulator's office is that this is commercially sensitive information.  I am baffled about how it can be commercially sensitive information given that this is a monopoly.  The company has the contract for the next couple of decades.  There is no competitor.  Nobody is bidding and nobody can bid for the national lottery licence for the next couple of years.  The reality is that during this tender process, the conditions were changed that allowed the company to use unclaimed prizes for its operational costs.  I am not sure if the other bidders were aware of the significance of that change at the time.  We have no transparency.  The company is making a mint out of this contract from 2014.  I think the hundreds of thousands of players - I am one of them - should know where their money is going.  If it is going into advertising, that ties into the earlier point about aggressive promotion of the product for one purpose and one purpose only, which is to increase the profitability of this private company.  Why can we not be given the information on the ratio of unclaimed prizes?  How much of it is going into special games?  How much is going into top-up prizes and how much is being used as the operational expenditure of this company, that is advertising and promotion?</p></speech>

I will be clear that I know the numbers.  There is only one reason I cannot give them to the committee, which is the confidentiality of that material and the clause in the licence which says that I am not allowed to release the firm's confidential information.  It specifically refers to the management accounts of the company and this information comes from its accounts.  It does not have to be commercially sensitive, only confidential and not in the public domain, so without the company's permission, I cannot release it.  I asked for the company's permission to release it since I knew the Deputy was looking for it but the company was not inclined to give it.  I understand the Deputy's frustration in not knowing the amount.</p> <p>  I would like to point out some facts which may be of use to the committee.  The first is that, for every cent in profit that the company makes on a national lottery sale, good causes earn three times as much.</p><p>The licence is quite robust.  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with what happened in the United Kingdom, where profits went up and contributions to good causes went down.  That will not happen here as we have a far more robust model.  The advertising and promotion that goes to drive sales also drives good causes.  As the Deputy said, the licence is designed in this way and my role is to enforce it and ensure the company complies with it.</p></speech>

The problem is that Ms Boate is enforcing a flawed licence.  The 2014 licence is deeply flawed, as is the process.  We now have a situation where Ms Boate cannot provide transparency - I do not accuse her of avoiding it - in respect of this information.  We have situations where operators are writing their own codes of conduct for sales, advertising and members.  It is deeply undesirable.</p></speech>

The array of games available on the <i>lottery.ie</i>website is mind-boggling.  The days of one weekly draw and one Winning Streak scratch card are long gone.  How many games are now approved and in a position to be marketed under the various headings?  There are instant win games, for example.</p></speech>

There are 24 online instant win games.  There are 19 varieties of scratch card on sale.

Is it correct that that is quite a dramatic increase on what was available before the licence was awarded to the current operator?</p></speech>

That only becomes apparent when one looks closely.  All of those draw-based games were available before the licence changed.  A similar number of instant win games and scratch cards were available.  The scratch cards are a little more visible in shops than previously.  They were often hung behind a sweet display and were not as visible to customers as they are now, but there has always been a variety on offer.  The way for lottery games to work, scratch cards in particular, is to provide a variety of games at different price points which will appeal to different people.  Regular scratch card players, who enjoy them and play them regularly rather than occasionally buying them as a gift, know the various games and have their preferences.  Before I took up my role, I decided that if I was going to be tasked with approving them, I should understand what they felt like to play, so I played all of them.  There is a scratch card which involves a crossword.  I like crosswords.  On that scratch card, one has to match letters rather than figures.</p><p>It takes me ten minutes to play it.  At the end, one counts how many words one has matched.</p></speech>

More than 19 have been approved.  Next Christmas, the operator will consider which of those to resurrect and sell at Christmas time.  Each year, the game may be slightly changed.  The scratch cards on sale 25 years ago would look very old-fashioned to us.  They would be in pounds and the amount of money may not seem exciting to us.  Scratch cards always change over time.  A lottery is unusual because the same thing is being sold over and over again but it must be kept fresh such that it does not look dated and it must be kept interesting.  Operators regularly change the games and may make the jackpot higher or put in a new set of prizes at a certain value.  It may seem odd to have all of these approvals but only a certain amount on sale, but that is because they become outdated and a new version comes out the following year or two years later.</p></speech>

They are broad-ranging.  Deputy Doherty is no longer here and I did not get a chance to say all of the things we are doing.  It is not clear from looking at the licence on our website.  We have enormous power in some ways.  I can ask for any information and the operator has to give it to me.  It is given it to me and on time.  We have 31 different regular reports coming into to us.  I mentioned this earlier.  It is like having tentacles into the company.  We get all of this information from its finances, how it operates and its security controls.  That is fed into us regularly.</p> <p>  We have real-time access to their data.  We can see the sales of every single scratch card and lotto ticket throughout the country as they come in.  We use all of that information to check, for example, that more than 50% of sales are going into prizes, that 6% is going to retailers to pay their commission, the right amount is going to good causes, and what we are told is being sold is what is being sold.  We have huge power in that respect.  I refer also to the power to pre-approve.  We do not run the company.  The operator does.  We check it is in compliance.  Having the power, with some aspects, to say certain things are not compliant before they are done is a great help.</p></speech>

The licensed operator has raised this issue.  It has been presented that they are masquerading as being the national lottery or certainly giving people the impression that, by betting through on these platforms, they are betting on the national lottery.  They are in fact, because they are betting on the outcome of the national lottery, as I understand it.  They have a remote bookmaker licence issued by the Irish national excise licence office.  There have been 15 such licences issued.  However, they are unregulated in the Irish market.  Is that correct and what impact are they having?  Is there any quantification of how much money people in Ireland are spending through these unregulated offshore betting operators?</p></speech>

I only regulate the one company to provide the actual national lottery.  I do not have any of that information on what other companies are doing.  I know that the Department is actively looking at it and consulting the Attorney General, the national lottery operator and, I believe, the companies to which the Deputy refers to answer the questions he has posed.  It is beyond my remit and my powers of information.</p></speech>

They are betting on the outcome of these draws using these bet on lottery products through these operators who are licensed, it would appear, but are unregulated and are offshore.  It does present a potential loss of revenue for the regulated operator and also a potential loss of revenue for the good causes which benefit from the consumer spending in the regulated area.  I know it is not directly within the remit of the regulator but is indirectly relevant in that it affects the operator that is being regulated by her.  There is no handle on the quantum of the money or the preponderance of these operators in the market.  There are 15 of them, for example, <i>Jackpot.com</i>, Lottoland, and Play Lottery Online.  They are clearly masquerading as being the lottery.</p></speech>

I do have responsibility for enforcing trademarks, and I think every day about the integrity of the brand of the national lottery and how to ensure its long-term sustainability into the future.  People play the national lottery out of trust as well.  They play it for fun, for the dream of winning, and they trust, when they buy that little slip of paper, that it has gone into a draw that is correctly supervised, monitored and regulated, and that, if they win, they will be advised of it.  Anything that would threaten the brand of the national lottery would concern me.</p> <p>  It is not clear what the scale of each of these operations is.  What is clear is the number of them is growing and it may continue to grow.  I would not be so worried about the scale as much as if they represent any threat to the brand of the national lottery.</p></speech>

The answer is not obvious or clear-cut because while one is allowed to set up a national lottery monopoly under EU law, one is not allowed to do everything one would wish to protect it.  The Department is actively looking to see the exact scale of this industry, the scale of threat it represents, what would be a response that would be in line with EU law, and to what extent they are attracting euros from the national lottery and good causes into these offshore or other companies.  None of that is clear, so that needs to be established and then an appropriate response chosen.</p></speech>

The sale went ahead and the change was how the unclaimed prizes would be dealt with.  That was the only change.  The office of the regulator has nothing to do with that licence.  The regulator regulates the content of the licence and ensures the operation is as per what was agreed.</p><p>Am I correct that the office of the regulator has oversight of all sales?  In other words, the figures are not just given to it.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, the codes are evolving.  There are sanctions that can be applied for breaches.  The investigative powers are very important.  Some things are visible.  For example, in the case of an advertisement that I felt was in breach there would be clear evidence and the argument then would be around whether what is deemed to be a breach is actually a breach.  I have the power to send in an investigator if there is an apparent breach.  There is also the sanction of withholding money.  Money can be withheld from the operator for breaches.</p></speech>

Have you ever looked at the media coverage of this and the lack of transparency that has given rise to people working out the amounts over a 20 year period?

As I said earlier, the amount is never zero.  In some countries it goes directly to good causes.  That was the case in the UK.  It goes straight into the good causes fund there.  I am not overly familiar with the old licence in Ireland - I have enough to be doing to enforce this one - but I know that under the old licence the money went straight to prizes.  The new licence is a hybrid whereby some of the money goes to prizes, some goes to good causes and some goes to advertising and promotion.  My job is to ensure that is where it goes.</p></speech>

Some shall be used for the purpose of top-up or additional prizes, some may be used for incremental marketing and some may be used for other methods of promoting the national lottery as agreed with the regulator.  Unclaimed prizes, therefore, can only be used for the sole purpose of promotion of the national lottery.</p> <p>  The amount used for marketing is for incremental marketing.  That cannot be used in lieu of the base marketing budget.  Under the licence, the operator must submit a base marketing budget to the regulator.  Base marketing is an operating cost of the operator.  Incremental marketing, which is marketing other than base marketing, is a marketing cost that is allowed to be paid out of the unclaimed prizes.</p></speech>

The licence was sold for &euro;405 million and over the next 20 years, the company is in a position to have discretion over the disbursement of &euro;15 million annually, which amounts to &euro;300 million over that period.  I am not laying that at the regulator's door; I am just trying to establish where this began.</p></speech>

That is not his fault-----</p><p>The Chairman is correct in that we have no role in the proportion that goes into, say, three buckets with one being for prizes, one for the promotion of the national lottery and one for what is left over for good causes.  We have no role over the ratio going into each of those.  We just have to make sure it goes into those three.</p></speech>

It seems from some media reports there is a basis for doubt around how that contract was constructed and put in place but I am not asking the regulator to comment on this.  Deputy Pearse Doherty mentioned earlier whether the other bidder in this case knew all of this.  I am only posing that as a question.  I am coming to the point of transparency.  It would be far better if there was greater transparency around that contract and the figures which Ms Boate knows because of her oversight of the licence and its operation.  It would ease the minds of those who are concerned about this.</p> <p>  That brings me on to the issue of marketing.  It ties into the notion that the company can have a pretty significant figure for looking for extra business basically.  If one goes into any of the outlets there is a massive amount of publicity or promotion material in what could be determined as family friendly spaces.  People going into the post office to transact their business who may have family members with them are exposed to all of that.  It is not hidden away from people, it is their face when are going about their business.  The company has the power of money to continue to do it like that because it is contained in the licence.  The Government, through its sale, has made it possible for that company to push as much as possible the licence and the promotional material.</p> <p>  What information can the regulator make available under the freedom of information legislation?</p></speech>

Essentially, we apply it the same as every other State agency in that we cannot reveal commercially sensitive business secrets but we can reveal a bit about the way we work.  It is very important that my office is held accountable and is transparent about what I and we are doing.  The Freedom of Information Act is one of the tools that does that.  We had a decision and one of our freedom of information decisions was appealed to the Information Commissioner, who decided that we had applied the Act exactly correctly.  We have that decision and it is very useful for us to have that confirmation that we are applying the Act carefully.  That is where it becomes different because it is commercially sensitive information and not just confidential information.</p></speech>

I hope that she makes her voice heard in the appropriate manner because - forgive me for using this language but I am trying to think of a better way - hiding behind what it says in the Act is not good enough.  What the regulator is overseeing is a hugely aggressive promotion of the national lottery.  I read an article that appeared in <i>The Sunday Times </i>last year and it was about a pilot project in a number of stores, including Tesco, Dunnes Stores and SuperValu, where scratch card card dispensers containing up to 19 different games were installed in every checkout aisle.</p><p>When I read that I was reminded of when I got elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas first.  I was in the Seanad and I had the pleasure of sharing the backbenches with former Senator, Feargal Quinn, who imparted many stories during the couple of years I was there, one of which was that he was the person who moved sweets from the checkouts.  First he made one aisle free of sweets, because of the pressure it placed on parents, and then he went further.  Now we have gambling in every single aisle with these dispensers.  What do the dispensers look like?  They look like the same thing from which one would buy a packet of Mentos, a Mars bar or such like.  It is a nice plastic cage, designed in that way not by accident, but deliberately.  This is how one sells sweets in shops and this is how we now sell scratch cards, which surveys show is the most accessible type of gambling for our teenagers.  We have not heard any public commentary on that in the context of the regulator.</p><p>I suggest the regulator needs to make her voice heard.  Maybe she thinks it is okay but I would say it is not okay, and we will say this to the Government and to the Minister.  There is a responsibility on the regulator.  It is the job of the regulator to apply the law, and I see no fault in the way the regulator is applying the law to her job, but there is an onus on regulators to say the law is not robust enough or does not go far enough.</p><p>I have not heard that from the regulator in respect of what is happening with the national lottery.

I am joined by my departmental colleague, Ms Sarah Neary, principal housing adviser.</p> <p>  While Ireland is a relatively young country in comparative terms, one of the key challenges facing it is planning for and addressing the needs of the rapidly ageing population.  In recognising and valuing the achievement and benefits of the population living longer, we need to ensure quality of life is maintained and nurtured.  Government policy on housing for older people, as set out in the programme for Government and Rebuilding Ireland, is to support older people to live with dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Research has consistently shown that older people wish to age in a place close to their family and friends and in the community where they may have lived for many years.  This policy approach is also seen as being both cost effective and contributing to a greater sense of well-being for older people.</p><p>For many, living in adapted or specialist housing reduces reliance on health and social care services and can result in measurably improved health status.  My colleagues in the Department of Health are best placed to speak about these issues.  However, it is important to acknowledge that housing policy on older people is broader and more complex than the mere provision of housing.  Addressing the needs of older people requires a cross-departmental approach and inter-agency co-operation.  The provision of housing for older people, particularly as we look at the future needs of the ageing population, will require a good mix of housing and health policy.  Towards that end, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Health have been working closely together in recent months.  We are finalising a joint policy statement on housing for older people which it is envisaged will be published this summer.  We want to ensure older people will have a wider choice of appropriate housing options suited to their needs, including housing with care services and supported housing, and to give them an opportunity to plan for their changing needs in good time.  As consulting key stakeholders and interested parties is a crucial part of this work, we may develop policy options that are responsive to the diverse needs of older people.  </p><p> The policy statement will be a first step in the broader process and it is proposed to hold a conference later in the year.  It will be a consultative forum for all stakeholders and interested parties to identify and discuss the range of issues ikely to emerge.  The conference will be hosted jointly by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Damien English, and the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Jim Daly.  St. Michael's estate in Inchicore has been identified as a housing with support pilot model under Rebuilding Ireland and will deliver 52 care homes which are due for completion in 2020.  It is a collaborative project between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Health, the HSE, Dublin City Council and the Irish Council for Social Housing.  It is intended to set a new standard for the future of housing provision for older people to act as an exemplar for others to follow.  The project has been approved for funding of almost &euro;15 million under the Department's capital assistance scheme, with a contribution of &euro;450,000 from the Department of Health towards additional communal facilities for the residents.</p><p> On the challenge we face on housing generally, I reassure the committee that Rebuilding Ireland contains specific commitments to meet the housing needs of the vulnerable in society who include older people.  In addition, local authorities have been advised that the delivery of social housing targets under Rebuilding Ireland should be consistent with the housing need identified in the annual summary of social housing assessments, which means that the housing needs of older people will be addressed.  It should be noted that Part M of the building regulations also sets out the minimum statutory requirements a building must achieve in respect of access and aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment underpinning the principle of universal design.  If the committee wishes, further detail can be provided on Part M requirements, the implementation of which is very important in meeting the needs of a range of individuals, including the older population.</p><p> In line with a commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, the Department, in collaboration with the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, ran the homes for smart ageing universal design challenge which aimed to stimulate and encourage the design and construction industries to be innovative in designing and delivering housing solutions for older people.  The challenge attracted more than 60 high quality entries, which was testament to the high level of engagement by the industry in designing and delivering innovative housing solutions for older people.  The competition winner, the Abhaile project, has established itself as a new enterprise and is actively pursuing pilot projects and clients with its innovative housing solution.</p><p> As members are aware, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government provides significant funding for social housing projects incorporating housing for older people.  In addition, we support adaptations to private housing through the housing adaptation grants scheme for older people and people with a disability.  The Department also provides funding and policy support for the local government sector in respect of the age friendly Ireland initiative which is active across all local authority areas.  These supports are aimed at facilitating the changes needed to make the homes of older people and people with a disability more suitable and to enable them to continue living independently in their own homes for longer, as well as facilitating early return from hospital stays.  Rebuilding Ireland has committed to increasing the funding available for these grants.  In fact, funding has increased year on year since 2014.</p><p>Total funding in 2018 is &euro;62.2 million, which represents an increase of 11% on the total for 2017   Further consideration will be given to increasing this funding in the  coming years in the context of Rebuilding Ireland.  The grants are also being made more accessible with a new single application form to be issued soon, with an easy to read guide to filling in the form.  </p><p> With my colleague, Ms Sarah Neary, I will be happy to take questions from members and engage on the issues raised during the course of the debate.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Niall Redmond, principal officer, services for older people.</p> <p>  People are living longer than ever before.  Success in improved health and extended life expectancy has been achieved in recent decades and should be acknowledged and celebrated.  Life expectancy for a woman aged 65 years in 2015 is estimated at 21 years, up 22% from life expectancy for a woman aged 65 years in 1995.  For men, the figure is 18.4 years, a rise of 36%.  However, as well as opportunities, the ageing population poses significant challenges that need to be recognised and addressed across a wide range of areas.  Every year there is an increase of 20,000 in the over-65 population.</p> <p>  People of all ages make up a community.  By and large, engagement with senior citizens clearly indicates that they would prefer to stay at home for as long as they can.  We all recognise the benefits the older population has to offer society as a whole.  The Department of Health, with its partners in the health sector and beyond, is looking at how we can facilitate and support their wishes and preferences.  A particularly important factor in realising this objective is improving home support services in order that people can live with confidence, dignity and security in their own homes for as long as possible.  This year the budget of the Health Service Executive, HSE, for the provision of home support services is &euro;408 million, which will deliver over 17 million home support hours to about 50,500 people.  While the existing service is delivering crucial support across the country, it is recognised that home support services need to be improved to better meet the changing needs of citizens.  The Department of Health is engaged in a detailed process to develop a new stand-alone statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services.  A range of community services aimed at supporting older people are also funded at a cost of approximately &euro;300 million by the HSE.  They include short-stay beds, day care centres and meals on wheels services.  Many of these services are provided by voluntary organisations.</p> <p>  The report of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, Sl&aacute;intecare, supports a significant shift in the model of care to one that is focused on prevention and early intervention and which will provide the majority of care in the community.  It is crucial that the appropriate supports be in place to match each person&rsquo;s needs at whatever point he or she is at in his or her interaction with the health care system.  The national positive ageing strategy has shown us that a whole-of-government response is required to address the range of social, economic and environmental factors that affect the health and well-being of older citizens.  The Department of Health and the HSE engage with many stakeholder groups on issues of concern to older people.  The Department also funds TILDA, the national longitudinal study of ageing, which provides valuable evidence which feeds into policy development by Departments and, in association with the HSE, Age-Friendly Ireland and Atlantic Philanthropies, leads the healthy and positive ageing initiative, HaPAI, a research programme aimed at measuring progress towards achieving the objective of making Ireland a great place in which to grow old.</p> <p>  I am pleased to inform the committee that the Department of Health and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government are working together in finalising a high level policy statement, to which my colleague, Ms Hurley, has referred.  It will provide a framework by which the Government can facilitate and promote a variety of housing options, including housing with care services and supported housing for older people.  In tandem with it, the Department and the HSE are participating in a demonstrator project in Inchicore in partnership with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Dublin City Council, the HSE and the Irish Council for Social Housing.  The project is aimed at offering older people who do not require nursing home care the benefits of living in their own homes, connected to their communities, with support and care provided in a cost-effective way.</p><p>We envisage that this demonstration project will be adapted and replicated in other areas.</p><p> The overall aim is to develop new models of housing for older people where care, support and community dimensions are provided on-site, integrated into the community and designed with the active participation of older people themselves.  The results of an evaluation of the first phase of the project will be published shortly.  It is hoped that this project and the learning derived from it could act as a blueprint for the future.</p><p> I hope that this provides an overview of the Department of Health's involvement in housing for older people and we will be happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

Among its many findings, it concluded that the vast majority of older people, 89%, wanted to stay in their current homes, as we have already heard.  That means, for the vast majority of our elderly population, continuing to live in our suburbs and in the countryside, but are our suburbs and our countryside ready for the changes that demographic forecasting promises over the next decades?  I want to look at the why, the where and the what of housing our aging population.</p> <p>  In the first case, as to why, as we have heard already, in Ireland, as elsewhere, people are living longer.  The population of Ireland in the 2016 Census was 4.8 million with projected population increases for the next 30 years ranging from 8% to 25%.  The population aged over 65 has increased by 19.1% between the last two censuses with an increase of 67,500 aged over 85.  However, the pattern is not uniform.  Fingal and Kildare have the youngest population, both rapidly growing urban areas with office-based employment.  Kerry, Mayo and Leitrim, Ireland's least densely populated rural counties, have the oldest population.</p> <p>  Most of the housing built in Ireland over the past century has been three and four-bedroom houses.  Of the 2 million homes in Ireland in 2016, according to the Census of 2016, 1.7 million of them were family houses.  There were 860,000 families with children in the State at that time.  There were, therefore, 900,000 more family homes than families.  We need one and two-bedroom apartments in villages, towns and cities, both as starter homes and step-down homes for older people.</p> <p>  The RIAI housing policy of 2016 expands on the principle of densifying our suburbs and of rejuvenating older neighbourhood centres into higher density urban village centres by examining the principles of what makes a good neighbourhood.  These are the sorts of neighbourhoods with a mix of homes to satisfy the needs of all members of society, not just families but also single people, young couples and, in particular, our older citizens.</p><p>These are places that have a mixed population in the sorts of numbers that make public services, neighbourhood amenities, shopping and public transport affordable and accessible.  The question is whether our current suburbs and neighbourhoods can accommodate both an increase in population while also allowing older people to remain in their community.</p><p> The architect, David Dwyer, director of Box Urban, has looked at the issue of increasing the population in our existing suburbs.  He analysed two typical suburban neighbourhoods in west Dublin.  Ballycragh, built in the 1990s and Ballyroan, built in the 1960s, both at a density of 17 to 22 units per hectare, that is, eight to ten to the acre, the standard old-style density in Ireland.  He defines a good neighbourhood as being able to provide all one's daily needs within a five minute walk of one's home and as needing a population of between 7,000 to 10,000 people to support a financially viable modern neighbourhood village centre.  The study investigated the opportunities to rejuvenate existing neighbourhood centres and increase the numbers of houses within a five minute walk.</p><p> Ballyroan neighbourhood centre serves a population of 4,000 within five minutes walking distance.  Ballycragh neighbourhood centre serves a population of less than 1,500.  Therefore, they significantly underperform on the viability test. </p><p>The study concluded that by making better use of the existing neighbourhood centre lands, by removing existing barriers to pedestrian movement within the area, by making better use of corner sites and back-lands and by building along the edges of main access roads and redundant open spaces, it was possible to increase the five minute walk catchment in Ballyroan from 4,000 people to 11,000 people and in Ballycragh from 1,500 to 10,800.</p><p> The figures confirm that in Dublin if we build out all currently zoned lands at the minimum recommended density of 50 units per hectare and densify just 40% of our suburbs at the quantum that he achieved in his study, we would comfortably accommodate population increase over the next 30 years without having to rezone a single acre of new land.</p><p> Realistically, however, there is a job of education needed, firstly to demonstrate to people that building more homes and services in their backyard will bring real benefits and, secondly, to have support from our public representatives to promote sustainable mixed communities.  It is necessary to halt the sprawl of our cities and our larger towns.  It is unnecessary and unaffordable.</p><p> We all recognise that our rural towns and villages have suffered the consequences of recession and consequent migration.  Meanwhile, there are large numbers of older people living unconnected lives in the countryside.  A possible win-win situation would involve encouraging them to move back into their local towns and villages.</p><p> Local authorities are starting to plan for the future densification of their areas, whether urban, suburban or rural, and to prepare masterplans that promote the principle of densification and the provision of universal access.  With careful planning, we should be looking at regenerating our towns and villages by adapting existing domestic housing for older users, improving the public realm, services and amenities and centralising our services to encourage older people to move into town.</p><p> We need to revisit the concept of downsizing.  It is not a bad word.  Downsizing can be liberating for those who wish to enjoy less encumbered lives and may wish to be nearer the centre of a supportive community.  We must plan it properly and architects are well positioned to make a significant contribution, not just in designing exemplar homes, but also exemplar places.</p><p> Currently in Ireland there are just two types of housing for the elderly, either at home or in a home.  In the private sector, as a housing architect, Mr. O'Mahony's  experience of over 50s planned living, as it is known in the UK and USA, and which he has looked at in some detail over the past couple of decades, is disheartening.  Rather than replicating the good neighbourhood model of young and old, single people and families living together in a supportive community, what he has seen is gated communities of considerable means living lives segregated from the surrounding community in what he termed as "gilded cages".  He considered that we should discourage this model and while not a lover of regulation that is not backed by evidence, regulation needs to be introduced that ensures a quantum of age-appropriate housing is delivered in all our private housing schemes and mixed tenure developments.  Currently it is necessary to audit the availability of local cr&egrave;che facilities, for instance, before making a planning application.  Similarly, local retail capacity studies are required to accompany commercial development applications.  The same should happen with housing for older people.  It is now time to propose that housing typologies in housing developments, particularly private developments, match the age demographic of the area in which the development is being proposed.</p><p>Community facilities provision in large scale developments, including build to rent housing, should also be carefully assessed to complement the needs of future older residents.<br/><br/>In public sector housing, there have been social housing options in the form of old people's dwellings, OPDs, and sheltered housing facilities in the past.  However, there are no options for those who are above the financial thresholds to access social housing but do not have sufficient means to support their older age accommodation needs.  The research identified a very large grouping of older people who did not want to be in residential care at any cost.  They still have the facility and mobility to live independent lives but require some supports to allow that to happen.  Over the next 30 years, we must provide for these people with housing options to downsize within communities that include an element of care but reinforce independent living and are affordable.  The &quot;Thinking Ahead&quot; study called it housing with support and public sector proposals for an exemplar scheme in Inchicore are being developed by Dublin City Council in collaboration with the approved housing body, AHB.  In its vision document, the following carefully considered thoughts of a future occupier are shared with us</p><blockquote>I would like an opportunity to live in my place, with my books and music, with people I like and some whom I love - who will know when to talk and when to stay quiet.  I would like that place to be where I can be myself, I would like that place designed to be a gathering place and a place of contentment and a place of aloneness.  A place where I can be as independent as I can be and dependent when I have to be.</blockquote><p>Who could ask for a better definition of home than that?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Hurley, Mr. O'Mahony, Ms Spillane and Mr. Tynan for their contributions.  We had engagement about this at a previous meeting and we have loads of information.  I do not think anyone in this room needs to be convinced about the need to have support housing.  I am glad to say that the witnesses have overlapping coverage of a recurring theme, and it is positive that we have looked at design, health and planning issues.  It is complex.  The other big issue is isolation.  I am familiar with gated developments since I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I will talk about them in the private sector.  People tell me that they have had to rent in these little schemes in townhouses.  They are locked and gated.  Many people leave these gated communities every day to work.  There are opportunities for integration and such.  When one looks at the demographics, ageing and elderly people, we have to talk about that key word, community.  In some parts of the country, we have wonderful libraries where old people can go and sit down.  They would have been thrown out a few years ago.  The reality is that there are elderly people who live on their own in this city, the county and all over the country who have very little income.  They are lonely and isolated.  They literally walk the streets or go to caf&eacute;s, train stations, public libraries or, in some cases, the waiting rooms of hospitals to interact.  Sad as it is, that is the reality.</p> <p>  I will address a few issues, starting with social housing targets in this context.  I am disappointed in the social housing targets but that is another debate for another day.  It might have occured to the policymakers that they might have set down, as part of the social housing targets, a breakdown of those targets.  What percentage of those would be specifically for downsizing?  We talk about downsizing and I want to ask Ms Hurley if she might share with us.  There has been much talk about a downsizing pilot scheme in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and we might hear a little about that and its success.  I am conscious of a place in St. Laurence's Park in Stillorgan which I have shared with people here for months.  Two elderly people live in isolation in local authority units because they do not want to leave.  They want to stay there.  I do not hear much support from the Department for those two people who wish to stay.  I want to use this opportunity to make an appeal that those two vulnerable old ladies are allowed to remain in their homes in St. Laurence's Park in Stillorgan.  If we are to be meaningful about our dialogue, discussion and policy formulation, we have to put it into reality.  How can we stand over a public housing policy that has spent years emptying out 16 maisonettes in Stillorgan which are next to doctors, a leisure centre, a library, churches and various supports?  If we are talking seriously about engagement, this is the type of site that we should keep and maintain, and support elderly people to live in.</p><p>The reality is it has been de-tenanted for years and slowly people are being picked off.  Now two vulnerable ladies are living in two houses that are being described as holding up the potential for development.  I do not want to be too specific but I want that site to be identified for downsizing and support housing for vulnerable people and elderly people because of the importance of community.  I ask representatives of the Department for breakdowns in any further social housing targets to identify the percentage of one-bedroom and two-bedroom properties.  </p><p> Let us deal with the facts we were told about last week.  We have a rapidly ageing population.  We have a large number of people over 55 on all our social housing lists who are unable to get accommodation.  Many of them are single, elderly and vulnerable with very low incomes.  What are we doing about that?  How are they worked into our social housing priorities?  There is an increasing elderly population particularly on our social housing lists.  Right across the spectrum it is a demographic with chronic health issues and disabilities.  Are we setting aside some of this accommodation for people with disabilities?  We are not.  If we are, we are certainly not delivering.  We know there are a number of occupiers in the private sector who have no mortgages and who are willing and want to downsize in line with everything the witnesses have advocated and yet we know there are no small units for them to downsize to in their communities.  We know that older people, and for that matter younger people and all of us in this room, thrive best when we have community supports and loved ones, family and friends around us.  It is something we all want by our very natures.  </p><p> I will ask some questions.  I will address the first one to Ms Hurley, not because she is from the Department but because it concerns the central tenet of the policy contained in Rebuilding Ireland.  Can she provide an update on the two - she should note the emphasis on the word "two" - items contained in Rebuilding Ireland on providing housing for older people?  I want her to deal with that.</p><p> Reference was made to the cross-departmental approach and inter-agency co-operation.  I have touched on that.  It is excellent.  The Department is currently finalising a joint policy statement on housing for older people which it is envisaged will be published this summer.  Will Ms Hurley keep the committee in the loop as that progresses?  I look forward to being at the launch, not reading about it but being there and hearing about it.  There will be a conference hosted jointly by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Damien English, and the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, Deputy Jim Daly.  I ask Ms Hurley to keep the committee informed on the progress on that work.  She might indicate a timeframe for when she thinks she will have that work complete.  Everyone knows what the challenges and issues are.  It now must become policy.  The emphasis is on these social housing targets and breaking them down specifically with a focus on demographics and ageing and the challenges and priorities that need to come from that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.563" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Hurley" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018042400002#L00200"><p>I will work through that range of issues.  The targets that have been set for social housing have been set on foot of a very detailed analysis of what is in the pipeline and what the different needs are in each local authority area.  When we started the exercise to set targets for each local authority, we provided guidance and wrote to each local authority area.  We are very clear on the particular needs.  The Senator is right about singles and two-bed apartments, in particular.  There is a huge need.  Our social housing list shows that over one third of our population is single.  In framing the targets, we have worked very closely with local authorities and have established, on a scheme-by-scheme basis, the type of delivery we expect in the coming years.</p> <p>  In terms of older persons, we can see what we will deliver through the CAS programme.  In terms of sustainable communities and mixed developments across various sites, we can see how many of the units will be for older people and how many will be for people with a disability.  That was the target-setting process.</p><p>When the Minister attends later in the month, we can touch on that matter further.  In setting the targets, we had regard to the waiting list in each local area and the mix and types of need in areas.  There was also engagement with each local authority on its particular needs.  In 2018, targets have been set across building, leasing and acquisition.  This issue is very much on our minds.</p><p> I will work through some of the other issues that the Senator raised regarding downsizing.  It has to be done sometimes.  It is an option.  Some people want to downsize and some do not.  We have an adaptive policy.  For example, we had two projects in Dublin last year.  At Broombridge, we delivered 51 housing units for older people with a mix that included downsizing.  A number of the committee members might have attended the opening of the second project, that being, Annamore Court in Ballyfermot.  An interesting project, it delivered 70 units last year, 16 of which were for people who wished to downsize.  Those units were designed and developed in a particular way that was supportive of older people with needs.</p><p> We view the St. Michael's project, which is advancing, as important.  As my colleague from the Department of Health mentioned, this model sees the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government working with Dublin City Council, the HSE and the Department of Health to get the best possible housing for older people.  That will be reflected in the design.  In order that we might learn from the project from the outset, we have developed a toolkit, which we will provide to local authorities so that what is best for older people's social housing can be determined.  This part of the learning process is important.</p><p> The social housing agenda is about the mix and meeting the needs of older people, people with disabilities and a range of other persons.  That is reflected in our targets and is something to which we are committed.  We will work on it.</p><p> The Senator mentioned the St. Laurence's Park project, which is close to his heart.  He has been working with the Department in this regard.  It is an important project.  We have been liaising with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, to which I expect we will revert over the coming days so that the project can proceed.  The local authority will work with the individuals in the premises to whom the Senator referred.  It is a good project that will advance shortly.</p><p> Regarding design, my colleague, Ms Sarah Neary from our building regulations section, has been working with the National Disability Authority and the Centre for Design Innovation on how we can design homes that are Part M compliant and meet older people's needs.  A great deal of innovative work has been done in this regard, as evidenced by the competition that we ran last year where 60 applicants sent in interesting ideas.  The Abhaile Project won that competition and we are moving forward with some of the ideas.</p><p> I will focus on the community piece, which the Senator mentioned.  We have a collaborative and close working relationship with the Department of Health.  We are also working with our colleagues in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Be it through a seniors alert scheme grant or a housing solution, we must all join together to keep people in their homes.  As such, the question of community is on our radar.  At our cross-sectoral and interdepartmental meetings, we are conscious that housing the elderly is not just about the house, but about home care, security and feeling safe.  That is something we are progressing with the housing piece.</p></speech>

It very important that they made joint submissions.  Joined-up thinking is what it is all about.  The one thing I did not hear mentioned yet is the question of the conservation of energy and heating in homes.  One of the most important things to keep older people in their homes for as long as possible is to make their homes as energy efficient as possible.  I welcome the schemes that the SEAI have and the community groups.  I know that in my county, in Dunleer, for example, people sign up for a scheme and it is ensured that their energy needs are met.  Notwithstanding everything else, will the witnesses comment on that?  What priority are they giving to that?  Is there any survey done of the energy deficiencies, if any, in local authority estates?  The older people are, the more likely they are to have been living in their home when the area was built.  There is a significant deficit in older homes.  How do the witnesses propose to address that?</p> <p>  I refer also to people who suffer from dementia.  That is a big problem that I find locally.  If one of the people living in a home suffers from dementia, the changes that have to take place, which I know are done through the housing adaptation grant in some cases, concern downstairs facilities such as toilet and shower facilities, and there is the expectation that might be done more quickly.  While I welcome the increase of 11% in the housing adaptation grants, the problem is at the local authority end of the business.  Some local authorities do not provide matching funding or enough matching funding in many cases to meet the demands in their communities.</p> <p>  I the architects, I think it was, mentioned two or three counties where a proportion of people who are older live for whatever reason, perhaps due to emigration etc.  Can we match up actual need to the moneys that are there?  Is there an index of age related residents and the housing adaptation grants for those counties?  There are inequalities in different counties.  I mentioned that County Louth did not provide the matching funding two years ago because of the county council's debt.  In discussions with the Deportment of Housing, Planning and Local Government last year there was a significant increase in the availability of money.  Once the need is identified, should there not just be a one-stop shop, be it the Department or the local authority, rather than having matching funds?  Unfortunately, it mitigates against people when they cannot get the grant and they have to live for a year with a significant disability with no action being taken because the council has not applied for the funding or does not have enough matching funding to meet their needs.</p> <p>  The key thing for me is the Department of Health and keeping people out of long-term care.  More than 22,000 people live in long-term care.  Many of those, I believe, should be living at home.  They are not living at home because the facilities and community network are not there.  In respect of proposals and research, I refer to the Great Northern Haven in Dundalk where a lot more technology is being put in.  Obviously, that is a new build. The technology helps people when they get out of bed at night, when the light goes on in the bathroom, when they are reminded that water is spilling out of the basin or whatever.</p><p>When they leave the window open in the middle of winter, they know it is open.  How much of that technology is in our plans?  How can it be adapted and what key elements can be put into existing homes?  Not everybody will be able to move into a state-of-the-art home right now.</p><p> Local authorities had a policy in the past of building perhaps 200 houses in the community that might be some distance from town centres, shops and facilities.  There might be six, seven or eight older persons' dwellings, OPDs, in an area where they are squeezed in and very badly placed.  They are often subject to vandalism and the actions of young people who might be out of control and causing problems for people in those sorts of neighbourhoods.  I support mixed residential areas but the problem is having OPDs far away from facilities.  I agree with the analysis by the architect who spoke about building in existing infill sites in the centre of towns or cities.  We should maximise that and zone such areas specifically for older people's residences.  Nobody else should be allowed to use those sites for any activity.  There would be connectivity with nearby shops and services.  I welcome the advances that are being made but we are not doing enough.  I welcome the reports and preparation to deal with the issues identified by other speakers.</p><p> I am seeing increasing examples of dementia in my community and there is a lack of ability of family members to cater for those who are affected.  This is an illness that brings significant problems for people living in housing on their own.  I have met families where a person with dementia is mobile 24-7 in a house.  The person is up and down the stairs and usually never rests, so the families are exhausted in trying to look after that person.  I say this to the architects more than anybody else.  Is this an issue?  Are there dementia-friendly environments so we can adapt homes to make them more accessible?  When a diagnosis is given, there should be a fast track for people to change their downstairs bathrooms, for example, or whatever they will need.  There should be adjustments to the home to help the other people living in the house to care for the affected person.  I would not underestimate the importance of what I am saying about dementia.  I do not know if other public representatives have the same findings but I am finding increasing instances of it.  When I speak to older people they mention that there are not as many heart attacks as there have been, cancer remains a big killer but, more frequently, dementia is coming up.  I will leave it with the witnesses.</p></speech>

It is very specialist housing.  A professor came from Britain who has highly developed ideas about housing.  In particular, dementia is almost like a separate housing typology requiring minute detailed issues such as carpet colours and the nature of lighting.  It almost separates it completely from traditional housing.  Does this mean we cannot adapt traditional housing?  We can do so but the care issues are very much about communal care.  When a person reaches the stage where the dementia is taking hold, he or she would be suitable for very specialist housing.  It is important to emphasise just how specialist it is.  People like us must be well educated on the design issues associated with that.</p><p>It is very specialist care and very specialist design.</p></speech>

There are three levels of housing for the aged.  There is independent living, independent living with care and dependent living.  The big problem at present is that we do not have enough one and two bedroom apartments for independent living, let alone for independent living with care.  The standard apartments we design and build at present satisfy Part M.  They satisfy two ends of the spectrum, the starter home and the downsizer, as long as the downsizer is independent living.  However, we do not have enough.  There are plenty of family houses that are not adapted for older living but we have a huge shortage of one and two bedroom accommodation which allows for communal living and facilitates the mixed tenure communities one is trying to create.  The level after that is how one adapts that type of housing for the housing with care.  That is quite easy to do and relatively inexpensive if we apply the current Part M and other regulations.  It is when dealing with highly specialised dependent care that there is a need to look at sheltered housing and so forth.  Unfortunately, at present, the only example we have of housing for the aged is the sheltered, highly specialised care type.  It is the other types that we need to build.</p></speech>

Currently, there are approximately 55,000 people in Ireland living with dementia and approximately 4,000 new cases per annum.  One can see where this is going in the future given that we have an ageing demographic.  Interestingly, this year a new model of residential care, called CareBright, opened in Bruff.  It is specifically aimed at dementia.  It is not quite a nursing home and not quite independent living.  It is almost in between.  It is largely based on models designed in the Netherlands and has been brought here as a testing model.  It opened at the beginning of March, so it will be interesting to watch how that develops and to see what it brings to the table in terms of a particular model for dementia, which is particularly challenging.</p> <p>  From the Department of Health's perspective, we published the national dementia strategy in 2014.  As part of that work we have introduced intensive home care packages for dementia largely on a trial basis.  We are supporting 150 people at present.  These are very intensive packages that allow people with dementia to try to live at home for as long as possible.  They are also being independently evaluated by Genio in NUI Galway to try to understand their effectiveness and whether they are something we can pursue in the future in a more mainstream model.  At the end of January this year 301 people had benefited from those packages since they were introduced in 2016.  There is a great deal of work happening with dementia.</p> <p>  As a matter of interest, we will publish a mid-term review of the dementia strategy in the next couple of weeks.  That will also point out some of the other work we are doing in this area.  Obviously, it is broader than the issue of housing but it links closely to it as well.</p></speech>

That is in objective 30 of the national planning framework.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy English, is advancing a piece of work on urban renewal.  We would consider it to be very important that older people are in areas where they can access community supports, transport services and social supports.</p><p> On the issue of energy efficiency, the Department has a retrofit programme and provides funding for energy efficiency measures.  We work directly with local authorities on that.  The SEAI has a separate private grant scheme which is also very important.  There is some provision under the housing adaptation scheme to provide heating support.  If a person's heating is not working at all, he or she can apply for grant assistance.</p></speech>

The housing adaptation grant is very much at the discretion of the local authority.  Local authorities would work very closely with the HSE and with occupational therapists in an area to make sure that the needs of individuals are met.  The continued funding of the scheme is important.  The housing adaptation scheme is great because it allows people to stay in their homes.  It makes life easier for people through the provision of rails, bathroom adaptations and so forth.  It is a scheme for which we have sought increased funding over the years.  At the moment, the Department provides 80% of the funding and the local authorities provide the remaining 20%.  Generally, additional funding has been provided throughout the year for housing adaptation grants.  Local authorities prioritise the works for those who need them most-----</p></speech>

In that context, should the grant not just be provided by the Department without the involvement of the local authorities?  If a person qualifies for the grant, he or she should not be on a waiting list.  People have to be in category 1 or practically dead, to get the funding and that is unacceptable.</p></speech>

The 20% requirement is important from the point of view of additionality.

It is the additionality that is important with the 20%.</p></speech>

My mother had a long leaving of 14 years, suffering from dementia.  Thankfully, she moved from an isolated rural house to a house in the middle of Athy and therefore lived within 500 metres of the town square, the church and all other amenities.  She was also in a small community which looked after her.  The housing unit helped, as did the support of the community.  That is extraordinarily important in terms of how we move forward.  We have spoken about intensification in terms of identifying sites within towns that could be used for supported living or at least for smaller units that are mainstream in one sense but with some support.</p> <p>  That brings me to a bigger issue about our towns.</p><p>I am originally from Athy, a town that is in serious difficulty in terms of its urban fabric and what supports it.  Rather like the Department's living-over-the-shop initiatives which are not really working, tax incentives do not generally begin to ensure implementation of such policies.  There may be a policy to incentivise the conversion and rehabilitation of lots of existing housing stock that could be used as housing for general use and as housing suitable for elderly people.  It may take a policy of saying there will be a grant of &euro;50,000 to &euro;75,000, but I would have thought - I am not involved with the Department - a sum of that figure would be needed to actually persuade people to do it, rather than saying they can avail of a capital grant which they will receive in the next five to ten years.</p></speech>

We are playing catch-up in this area as we have an ageing population.  Even in my area of Fingal which has a young population in parts there are towns with an ageing population.  I want to focus on the supply of houses and what we can do to plan suitable housing for the age cohorts.  I have specific questions for the Department of Health that are related to the housing adaptation grants scheme.  How does the HSE prioritise applications for housing adaptation grants based on need?  We have all come across people who remain in hospital because their home has not been adapted and they cannot be discharged.  If the medical need has been identified in so far as the patient cannot be discharged because works such as the installation of a shower or wetroom or whatever else may be required in the home have not been undertaken, it does not make any sense to me that a direction is not being given for the work to be done.  The Department of Health will probably need the assistance of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to do that, but we should look at this solution and actually do it. </p> <p>  I wish to elicit information from the HSE on occupational therapy reports.  What is the average turnaround time to process a needs assessment or an occupational therapy report?  Again, to avail of a housing adaptation grant, that is required.  The occupational therapist needs to go into a house to see what is needed to allow Mr. Darragh O'Brien to be discharged from hospital and live independently.  The position varies from county to county and also from area to area in a local authority.  If we want to do some practical things, without the need for a conference or the relaunch of a programme, let us see what we can do on the ground.  Does either Mr. Redmond or Ms Spillane believe we have sufficient occupational therapists in each area in an ageing Ireland to process all of the work required?  Is there another way to do it?  Could it be done privately and paid for by the Department or do we have to wait for HSE-appointed occupational therapists to complete the reports?  I know that this is a major problem.  </p> <p>  I was very glad when Mr. Tynan mentioned, on behalf of Mr. O'Mahony, that "downsizing" was not a bad word.  It has become a bad word because of the hamfisted way in which housing for the elderly has been approached in some, but not all, instances, particularly when people are described as bed blockers which makes them feel bad about being in hospital or when the Government makes announcements that there are 900,000 more family homes than families which make elderly people or those in the seniors category feel that they should be getting out of the family home, the house for which they have paid.  One of the reasons 89% of people want to remain in their own home is there are no alternatives.  If there were alternatives and choices, people would look at the options.  I speak for my own parents, seniors who have recently downsized.  It was not a bad word for them.  It has actually made a lot of sense for them.  </p> <p>  Before I turn my attention to the contributions of the Departments of Health and Housing, Planning and Local Government, in its contribution the RIAI stated: "However there are no options for those who are above the financial thresholds to access social housing but who do not have sufficient means to support their older age accommodation needs".</p><p>That is blindingly clear to everyone.  What would the representatives from the RIAI do to address that problem?  Would they insist on it being provided for in development plans by local authorities?  </p><p> Mixed unit developments are of importance.  Where is it being done well?  I have seen a couple of places where it has been done well.  The apartments in those schemes have not been designated specifically for elderly people and I do not think that should be the case.  There should be a mix of duplexes, semi-detached houses and apartments in open settings which allow people to see others.  I am fortunate to know of such areas and the developments work very well.  Having a community mix is also of great importance.  What three things do the representatives from the RIAI think are doable relatively quickly?</p><p> I thank Ms Hurley for her statement.  I am struck by the fact that the delivery of social housing and housing for the elderly is very important and may be the focus of the Department.  There was discussion of a couple of semi-independent living schemes.  On the housing mix in local authority or social housing estates, is the Department setting the mix to be used in new estates being delivered?  I know of such estates in my area of Fingal.  Is the Department stating 10% or 15% of units are to be set aside and that it will design them for life such that they can be used by young families, elderly people or those in the middle?  What directions is it giving through the planning and possibly building control elements and also to approved housing bodies?  I have seen a couple of magnificent schemes delivered by the St. Vincent de Paul housing trust.  One such scheme in my town of Malahide, St. Benedict's, is being extended.  Is the Department aware of the level of demand for the extra 16 units?  There are hundreds of people looking for them.  That puts the housing association and the local authority in a difficult position where they will have to make a Solomon's choice between persons who are desperate to access housing.  What do the delegates think we should be delivering per annum and how does it compare to the actual targets set?</p><p> Ms Hurley mentioned the joint statement, which is important.  Without giving us a sneak preview, what will it state?  What is the Department's objective in real terms and will it be backed up by policy?  I am sure a report will accompany the statement.  Reports are welcome, but more important are the actions contained therein.  I am jumping back and forth, but I will try to stay within the five minutes allocated to me.</p><p> In terms of the HSE's perspective, does the Department have statistics for the numbers of elderly people in inappropriate accommodation such as long-stay or other beds in hospitals because their homes are not appropriate for them or they are waiting for occupational therapy reports to receive housing adaptation grants?  Does the Department track that information for each local authority such that it can identify what the council in, for example, Fingal or Roscommon is doing, what the turnaround time is and how it can be driven through?  Like Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, it is welcome that &euro;62 million has been made available, an increase of 11%, but what are we getting for it?  Is the service improving?</p><p> Is there a local authority to which Ms Hurley would look in terms of best practice in the provision of private and public housing?  Will Mr. Tynan and Mr. O'Mahoney also offer their views in that regard?  There probably is not; there is not.  Perhaps the delegates might identify the best of a bad bunch, without being unfair to anyone.  I do not wish to be unfair and did not mean my last comment.  Where is there a better focus on trying to deliver a proper housing mix?</p><p> The delegates have provided figures for increased densities in existing areas and making them into communities.  There is a role for local and other politicians in that regard because if one tries to increase densities anywhere, there will be a furore among existing residents who will say it cannot happen because a lovely field would be lost or they like the car park or because of some other issue.  It is about having a proper mix and people getting real.</p><p>Like every aspect of housing, these are ticking time bombs.  I hate to say this two weeks in a row, but they are.  We can, however, deal with this with proper planning and design.  I would love to know if the Department is instructing local authorities for private developments.  We have to be able to look for more mixed developments and more whole of life developments.  Are we going to instruct the local authorities by way of planning guidelines for when they put together their local development plans and their planning bibles to say "this is what you must do"?  The private sector will have a major role in this.  The Department will not solve it by delivery of social housing.  There are people who have already paid for their three or four bedroom family home who do not want to be there anymore.  They will stay there, however, because there is nowhere else for them to go.</p></speech>

There is unmet need for therapists in general in the health services.  This applies to older people and also to services for children and adults with disabilities.  In budget 2018 an additional &euro;1 million was provided that will allow for the recruitment of an additional 40 occupational therapist posts.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about how long it takes for an occupational therapy report for a housing adaptation grant.

They have finished their acute phase of care in the hospital and are discharged but, for various reasons, they cannot leave immediately.  One of the reasons is housing adaptation.

At the beginning of the year there were six people in acute hospitals waiting for discharge where housing adaptation was required.</p></speech>

There are a number of local authorities who are ahead of others.  One I will refer to is Limerick.  Last year 81 homes were delivered in Lord Edward Street, which was a very large capital project.  Reference was made to mixed developments and this project's mix is really excellent.  It is not just about older people; there are one bed units, two bed units, families and older people.  It is a really good development and I can organise a visit to the development for the committee at any time.  It is a model.  Dublin City Council has a range of schemes under way.  This council is particularly good at delivering mixed developments.  We have been doing some work with the Deputy's own local authority in Fingal, along with Age Friendly Ireland, which is particularly good.  The Deputy also spoke about private housing.</p><p>Fingal has been working with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and with developers on best practice not just for social housing but for private housing which is a key element.  There is work under way on that and I can get further information from Fingal.  Age Friendly Ireland has been working with the 31 local authorities.  There is a big body of work being done.  </p><p> Ms Neary will talk about the projects, the approval process and how we endeavour to make sure that in local authority areas there is a mix of one and two-bedroom homes and homes for disabled persons too.</p></speech>

We are not keen to set targets because we have the comprehensive information from the housing needs assessment.  We take a more tailored approach to each local authority.  There are different age mixes in local authorities and different types of accommodation required.  We set the targets for developments in each local authority.  Our stage 1 approval, the capital appraisal process, examines the specific needs, the different types of houses and age profiles and ensures that projects are coming on stream to address that mix.  Before the formal approval stage we have a technical meeting and discuss general schemes, density, types of unit.  It works on a case by case basis.  Age Friendly Ireland is doing great work in Fingal in training and dealing with private sector and social housing.</p> <p>  The capital assistance scheme, CAS, is a unique funding mechanism for sheltered housing or housing with supports.  We encourage that and work constantly with local authorities to bring it forward through approved housing bodies, AHBs.  We also encourage the use of existing units in towns and villages for social housing through the repair and leasing schemes and the buy and renew scheme. </p> <p>  On the private housing side the national planning framework has set the overall agenda, on the basis that our population is ageing and it has tailored the vision for that which will be translated to each local authority through the development plans, and that will cater for the range required in each local authority.  Each local authority also has to produce a housing strategy which finds the needs in the area.  That affects planning permission------</p></speech>

The number of one-bed or studio-type apartments has gone up to 50% which represents our changing demographic.  There is no target required for three or four bedroom apartment types.  It is geared to the one and two bedrooms.</p></speech>

It applies immediately and we are already seeing it come on line because it is more affordable too.</p><p>This is a good thing in terms of this debate about downsizing.  It provides choice for people.</p><p> The other aspect, and Ms Hurley mentioned it in regard to the urban renewal side, is that we now have vacant housing officers in the local authority with vacant housing plans.  They are doing surveys on who owns the units and on how we can bring them back into use.  These are ideal for the step-down situation, or where people want to move, but within their community.  In regard to the statistic of 89%, I believe that is more about staying in a community rather than in the specific accommodation people are in at the moment.</p><p> We are doing work on guidance in terms of making it as efficient and as economical as possible to bring forward those vacant existing units.  We hope to see more of those units will be brought back into use, which will be particularly good for the demographic we are talking about at the moment.</p></speech>

That whole point about mixed community is really critical.  I refer to one of the areas we have been looking at, particularly since apartments are moving outside the range of affordability.  The studies of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, and of Department have shown that it is proving very difficult to try to bring traditional apartments - core, served apartments - down to a level where they fall within the affordability range so we have been looking at is other models.   When one looks at density, currently there are densities that are as low as 20 to 25 per hectare, the old traditional eight to ten to the acre jobs.  Then one has the 150, the typical apartment.  What we have been working on is a model that bridges that and Ms Neary referred to this a few times and is aware of this.</p> <p>  What we have been doing is building up models of walk-up apartments which are three or four storeys high that effectively treble the traditional density; that provide one and two bed apartments and surface car parking; that minimise the amount of service and maintained elements that one needs; and that minimises the amount of managed space so all the while trying to keep it as efficient, as easy and as economical to build as is possible.  We have been pricing those models and we find that they fall right into the affordability level.</p> <p>  There is very good scheme, which was carried out in 2004 and which would need adapted.  To me it was the perfect model of how one uses public land and private developers to deliver an affordable model of housing.  It was carried out in Ballyfermot on Dublin City Council land.  There was a competition, the rules of which were: to provide affordable housing at the same cost as traditional housing and apartments, with no underground parking and surface parking only; to use modern methods of construction; to be built as quickly as possible; to cover as wide a need as possible;  to be sold within the community at a fixed price which would be less than the market; that there would be a clawback; that no developers or investors would be allowed to buy into the scheme; and that the developer would build it and give back 30% as social housing.  One effectively had 30% social housing, and the balance was affordable housing.  This model worked and 375 units were completed.  The density was close to 95 per hectare.  It was sold out, although there was a high demand at the time.  The developer made a profit, the council got its housing back in return, and it was an exceptionally successful scheme.</p> <p>  We are again seeing that as a model for a public private partnerships, PPP, delivery system.  Unfortunately, what we find is that local authorities are really well-intentioned but delivery is highly bureaucratic and even housing architects in our local authorities are tearing their hair out because the delivery programmes are so slow.  We could mix and develop both, bring in the efficiencies of the private sector and deliver on the public sector land bank.  It would not have to be sold on either in that it could be leased on.  Why give it up if one can come up with a leasing model that allows one to get a long-term value back on one's land while delivering affordable housing?</p><p>We have asked for the system we are currently looking at to be priced.  We are doing this with one of the large contracting companies.  The idea we are trying to fix is that one of these properties can be built for the same price as a domestic house.  It works.  We have got the prices back.  We are looking to develop that.  We are looking at models like new suburbs with no traditional housing that start with the intermediate model of housing before going to the higher densities.  Given that we have 900,000 family houses, as has been mentioned, why should we be building more?</p><p> One of the difficulties we have is in convincing the private market to stop building houses.  It is easy for financial institutions to provide short-term funding for developments that are sold in phases because they get their money back quickly, and Bob's your uncle.  The problem is how to convince them that there is a market for other types of property.  It is starting to happen.  I know of a developer who was building duplexes as an add-on because he had to achieve a certain density.  In order to get up to the minimum density, he threw in a few duplexes.  The duplexes walked out the door so quickly that his mind was changed.  It is a case of changing attitudes.  One bedroom and two bedroom properties satisfy both markets.  They satisfy first-time house buyers and they also satisfy the independent living requirements.</p><p> I want to make the point that this is about places as well as homes.  We have spoken about how towns, villages and suburbs can be adapted.  Suburbs need to be densified.  Local authorities have to identify where that densification will take place.  Now that we have the 2040 framework plan, the next thing is to look at where we densify and how we achieve densification.  It is like a softening-up process.  People are going to have to accept densification.  It is a question of where it is going to happen.  Local authorities can start looking at that now.  They can start the process of convincing local populations of what those changes are going to have to be.</p><p> I would like to explain the idea behind the urban design toolkit that is being developed by the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland.  The toolkit will be offered as an award within the Tidy Towns competition to a town that wants to participate.  Architects will engage with particular villages and towns that will be selected to develop plans for how to improve the public realm by adapting it for older people, etc.  The aim of this approach is to start to convince people that design is not just about the house one lives in - it is also about the place one lives in.  That toolkit is going to be available to everybody.  It will probably be available this summer.</p></speech>

It strikes me that we have not mentioned An Bord Plean&aacute;la in all of this.  It will be a major influence over what we deliver and where it is delivered.  The planning guidelines are crucially important, particularly where they can be legally strengthened by way of directives.  Mr. O'Mahony made a point about duplexes, apartments and mixed developments.  They absolutely work.  Such developments ensure questions are not asked about what we are building for seniors and young families.  If they are done properly, communities are built.  I would love to know how An Bord Plean&aacute;la will adhere to the guidelines.  I have seen some decisions of the board that make sense and follow the guidelines.  Those who propose developments of more than 100 units will go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I do not know what interaction, if any, the Department has had with the board at a policy level regarding the specific question of mixed development.</p></speech>

While there is good work going on in the Department to identify ways and means of helping elderly people to stay in their homes, I have to say frankly that it is nothing like what it should be.</p><p>It falls far short of where we should be as a first world society in terms of providing housing for the elderly.  Unfortunately, I cannot spend much time on the issue because I have another commitment.  I would like to have the time to drill down into the failure of the Department to a large extent in this area.</p><p> As regards housing adaptation grants and housing aid for older people, when is the last time the criteria and guidelines were updated for either of those schemes?</p></speech>

Deputy O'Dowd raised the issue of local authorities providing 20% of funding for the scheme.  However, that a local authority has incurred debt as a result of purchasing land that is probably still lying vacant is not a reason for people in need of the scheme to suffer.  There must be some wriggle room.  Although I buy into the local contribution, it is not good enough that citizens suffer as a result.</p> <p>  Furthermore, the scheme is being abused.  It should be far more uniform.  Local authorities that are not drawing down and spending their allocation should be asked to justify that.  It should be properly audited and transparent and published.</p> <p>  The scheme is being abused by some members of the public.  I know of several applications to the scheme involving elderly persons who are on the verge of passing away or going into a nursing home.  I mean no disrespect to them.  Their families draw down money from the scheme and upgrade the property, thus increasing its value.  The elderly person then goes into a nursing home and we discover that the property is rented out.  In other cases, sadly, the person passes away and the taxpayer has pumped &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000 into a property and upped its value.  The person has died and there is no recourse.  I gave the Minister a position paper 12 months ago to which I have received no reply, wherein I stated that there should be some sort of safeguard on a 60-month basis whereby if a person passes away within a year of benefiting from the scheme there would be a clawback of 50% of the moneys allocated under the scheme if the property is sold or rented.  That would reduce to 40% in year 2 and continue to reduce annually such that after five years there would be no liability.  More people would benefit if there were safeguards in place to ensure that those who should not benefit from the scheme do not do so inadvertently.  </p> <p>  It annoys me more that the Department accepts the word of local authorities in respect of the scheme.  As I understand it, a person applies to the scheme and an inspector or engineer then visits the property.</p><p>He or she inspects the work, says what needs to be done and then allocates the jobs.  They go into a queuing system and the work is done.  Possibly the same inspector or an engineer comes out to inspect the work and says, "Yes, it has been done."  Does the Department at any stage cross-reference or perhaps take a sample of 5% of the grants allocated?  Do its officials go to see if the work has actually been done in an appropriate way, from its perspective?</p></speech>

Realistically, in the intervening period all we have for older people is the housing adaptation grant or some funding from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Does the &euro;66 million come from the Department or from the Department and local authorities?</p> <p>  Sometimes there is a need for flexibility in the schemes.  I refer to a specific SEAI scheme.  An elderly couple in their 80s have come to my office on a nearly monthly basis to see if there are upgrades available.  As they live in a terraced house, they do not qualify for the wraparound insulation scheme, even though they should.  There is no flexibility in any scheme to allow this to happen.  Many older people do not even know that there are housing assistance grants for older people available.  I do not know how we get to the people who need these grants and are not aware that they are available to them.</p> <p>  Reference was made last week to universal design.  The potential cost of having a universal design for a new build is an additional 3%.  What element of Part M would the delegates change in the building regulations?  I am aware that it is very trendy to have wetrooms and that everybody is putting them in.  We must all have a walk-in, if not a drive-in, shower, yet they are the very things older people need.  Is it fair to say we should incorporate this feature into Part M of the building regulations?</p> <p>  A statement was made that 85% of us wanted to stay at home when we were older.  I can understand that.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien made the point well when he said it was because there was no alternative for us.  The only option is to stay at home.  People also want to live in communities.  If we were to provide the right community and the right facilities within it, people might be willing to downsize or move out.  They would not see it as a negative.  In County Wicklow in the 1980s we looked at this matter more than we do now.  Carnew Community Care centre provides 28 homes with independent living.  There is also a day care centre attached to the facility.  Crinion Park was built in Wicklow town beside the old health board building.  Back then we were planning for older people better than we do now.  People living in these areas want to move into such facilities when they see how well they actually work.  They do not see a move into them as a negative.  We could do more in that regard.  </p> <p>  I might come back in to make one or two more points later.</p></speech>

I do not mind waiting until the end because the discussion has been very interesting.  </p> <p>  I appreciate that part of Ms Hurley and Ms Spillane's job is to present the best possible picture of what their Departments are doing.  I am also aware that they are extremely limited by resources.  The reality, however, for many older people in almost all of our constituencies is very different from what the delegates have presented.  Part of the problem is - a little like the position in the provision of accommodation for Travellers and people with disabilities - that older people are left as a peripheral element of the discussion.  The fact that two years into the term of the committee we are only having these dedicated discussions thanks to the Chairman's initiative shows that, as a committee, we are as guilty of not fully integrating the issue into the overall discussion on housing policy as the local authorities and the Departments.</p><p>The fact that Focus Ireland had to launch a campaign last week highlighting a 40% increase in older persons' homelessness proves that point.  Probably more shocking than the 40% increase is that we are only talking about 119 people.  The idea that we cannot find housing solutions quickly for those 119 people is probably more of a scandal than the fact that it has increased by 40%.</p><p> The Chair's proposal that we have these hearings and prepare this report is timely.  As social and private housing delivery ramps up, albeit not as fast as I would like but at least it is moving in the right direction, now is the time for us to put in some more substantive solutions and get it right to ensure we are not here in a decade's time or more having the same conversations.  </p><p> I direct my questions, first, to Ms Frances Spillane of the Department of Health.  Will she elaborate on the funding for home care teams both in terms of total allocation of funding and funding versus the demand?  We all know there are very significant demands that are not being met.  Does she have figures for the number of delayed discharges that are a result of the lack of sufficient home care packages?  Those figures would be interesting.  Will she indicate, from the HSE and the Department of Health's budget, cost comparisons between nursing home settings versus supported housing?  I presume supported housing, in terms of year costs, are significantly cheaper.  If she has figures on that, I would appreciate them.</p><p> I am not convinced there is very much co-ordination at local authority, HSE and community care regional level in the way we manage the bricks and mortar element, the community element that the local authority does, and the care packages and support for independent living for older people.  Are there protocols in place.?   How do we ensure at a departmental level that whatever the policy is at the macro level, it is feeding down to the practice on the ground?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.651" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018042400002#Z00300"><p>Moving on to the officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, I do not want to go too much into the adaptation grants because in some senses part of the Chair's report will be about much bigger items than that.  The amount of &euro;60 million odd is nowhere close to the demand that exists.  In my local authority, and we are not unique in this, one can have to wait for a year to be processed and for two to three years for the adaptations to be put in place.  Those are for cases where is a clear and evident medical need for the adaptations.  The process is far too cumbersome.  On the eligibility criteria, the hiking of the age up to 65 is unjustifiable.  I know that is a political decision, not a departmental one, but that urgently needs to be reviewed.</p> <p>  The occupational therapists' reports highlight a remarkable situation.  For example, in the South Dublin County Council area where I live, half of the county council is in HSE area 6 and the other half is in HSE area 7.  In HSE area 6, the HSE covers the cost of the occupational therapist's reports for council tenants.  In HSE area 7, the HSE does not have the staff and has not had for many years.  The cost used to be covered by the local authority and it is now covered by the council tenant.  We have a bizarre situation where, depending on which side of the Naas Road a person lives, he or she either has to pay for it himself or herself and is never reimbursed if that person is a council tenant or the HSE provides for it.  To what extent is that lack of consistency prevalent throughout the country?  That is not only an academic matter.  I know of cases where people with significant adaptation needs, including older people but also people looking for the disability adaptation grants, have had their application delayed for a year or more because they have not been able to scrape together the money to cover the cost of the occupational therapist's report.  In all of those cases, there is a need, notwithstanding the comments of my Seanad colleague before he left, to review the scheme again and, in light of increased fiscal space in the budget for next year, to revisit some of these issues.</p> <p>  A pertinent point was made by some of the older persons' advocacy organisations last week about the scheme, which point I believe needs to be mentioned, namely, that a person applies for it at the point of crisis.  Somebody has a crisis, urgently needs adaptations and only then gets into the system.  I appreciate that is because there was limited funding, but we need to move to a position where there must be some mechanism for trying to future plan to a greater extent and ask if something else can be put in place.  Rather than waiting until someone has gone for an operation and they are discharged needing significant mobility adaptions for which they have to wait a year, two years or three years, something could be put in place for that person in advance.</p> <p>  On the bigger ticket items, I have a concern that local authorities in their social housing construction pipeline are not paying adequate regard to the need for a supply of accommodation for older people.  I do not believe the Department should set targets but it should expect the local authorities to demonstrate clearly that they have that planned not just with respect to individual projects but also their overall social housing construction pipeline.  If that is happening, the officials might give us more information about that.</p><p>When I sat on a council, however, and it is a council that has a better record than some, it was never part of our discussions on the social housing programme at that stage, so that needs to be examined.</p><p> On underprovision of units for singles, to what extent in the social housing construction pipeline are local authorities being asked to come forward and demonstrate provision for singles?  One third of the South Dublin County Council waiting list is for singles but there is no corresponding one third of the units in the social housing construction pipeline for singles.  When I refer to singles I mean units for single persons or a couple household that does not need a second bedroom.  That is crucial.</p><p> "Downsizing" is not a bad word.  I have a list as long as my two arms of council tenants who are desperate to downsize.  They would love a bungalow in the housing estate in which they live or nearby, which would free up a three bedroom family home for a family on the housing waiting list or in emergency accommodation, but they are just not available.  I am aware that some dormer bungalows are beginning to be included in the social housing construction pipeline but it is nowhere close to what is required.</p><p> Universal design is probably one of the big issues we will examine in the report.  While we can fix the other problems in terms of the stock we have, if we are not more ambitious in the requirements for both the public and private sectors in the new housing that will be developed, we will not fix the problem in the long term.  In terms of the Department, will the witness tell us what type of discussions are happening about mainstreaming universal design into planning guidelines?  I am acutely aware that there will be a need, not just in terms of the county development plans but also given that there will be strategic housing developments, for central Government guidelines to ensure anything that goes straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is captured.  Has the Department started discussing the potential cost implications?  One of the people who made a presentation to the committee last week said that it could add approximately 3% to the overall construction price of the house.  How can we manage that in a way that it does not prevent producing the right type of guidelines?</p><p> Then there are older renters.  We are seeing an increasing number of people renting at a later stage in their lives.  Part of the difficulty is that people might have an income that puts them over the threshold for the housing assistance payment, for example, and social housing eligibility, but they know that in five years they will be out of work and on a small occupational pension or the State pension and eligible for social housing.  People can only join the list at that point and the list could be five to seven years for older persons' accommodation.  Is there any attempt to look at that?</p><p> Will Mr. O'Mahony and Mr. Tynan give their thoughts on universal design?  I am aware it is a spectrum and can be a range of things, but what would they like to see the committee highlight in the report it will produce in terms of the key game-changing policies the Government could introduce with regard to universal design?  What would be in it?  Should it be in the county development plan or in central Government guidelines?  Do they have any thoughts on cost and cost implications?  I was struck by Mr. Tynan's comments on housing typologies in private developments.  Perhaps he could tell us a little more about those and how he thinks we can achieve them.</p><p> We hope to produce a report that will contain many recommendations.  If there are a small number of recommendations the witnesses think we could make, what would be their top two or three?  I would invite the Department's officials to give their top two or three but they might not be at liberty to tell us what they would like to see change in Government policy.  However, they could send it anonymously to the Chairman by email or somehow at a later stage and we will be happy to see it.</p></speech>

We are aware there is huge demand in local areas for these grants.  This year the target is 10,000.  We provided 9,000 last year.  As regards the funding, in response to Deputy Casey, the &euro;66 million includes the contribution from the local authority.  That is the amount at present.  As in previous years, where there is additional funding in the Department, we know this is an area of need so we will move the money over to that area.  Local authorities are aware of that.  That is the funding piece.</p> <p>  Regarding prioritisation of grants and meeting the needs of those who need the grants most, we are very flexible with local authorities.  They have discretion in respect of particular cases that arise.  The group last week raised a good point in terms of future-proofing and anticipating where people will need a grant in the future.</p><p>Obviously, we must prioritise those who need an adaptation, but there are certain circumstances where we know that a person will be going into hospital for a particular procedure and it makes sense to carry out the adaptation that will be required by him or her after discharge.  We are very flexible with local authorities in these circumstances.  They should be doing it, where possible.</p></speech>

I am not talking about years in advance but where we know that someone is going into hospital for a particular procedure and if he or she is working closely with the local authority, it has happened.</p> <p>  On the scheme and the issue of consistency, one of the reasons we undertook a review in 2017 was to streamline the scheme.  We have issued guidelines on it and more streamlined, single forms will be issued shortly.  We have worked with Inclusion Ireland on their design because we recognise that forms can be very difficult at the best of times but for people in their later years, they can be especially daunting.  Work has been done on the forms and guidelines have been issued to the local authorities, which should improve the consistency of the scheme.  We have told the local authorities that there is scope for discretion.  There will often be special cases in local authority areas and it is a matter for local authorities to assess and deliver on them.</p> <p>  On the supply of accommodation, Ms Neary's team and the social housing team have technical meetings with each local authority on a quarterly basis.  We sit down with the local authorities and "older people" is an item on our checklist.  The aim is to ensure we get the right mix of accommodation.  The Deputy is absolutely right that one bedroom and two-bedroom units are very important.  We are encouraging and working with local authorities to move away from the standard three-bedroom unit.  We need more one-bedroom units.  Extensive work is being done in that regard.  We are also telling the local authorities that where the opportunity arises to acquire particular types of unit under the capital assistance scheme, they should proceed to take it.  Last year under the scheme 10% of units purchased went to older people.  The units were spread throughout the community.  Therefore, work is being done on that issue.</p></speech>

It is defined in the Disability Act as:</p><blockquote>the design and composition of an environment so that it may be accessed, understood and used&mdash;(i) to the greatest practicable extent,<br /><br />(ii) in the most independent and natural manner possible,<br /><br />(iii) in the widest possible range of situations, and<br /><br />(iv) without the need for adaptation, modification, assistive devices or specialised solutions,by persons of any age or size or having any particular physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual ability or disability.</blockquote> <p>There is no doubt that to apply the concept of universal design and capture every single piece or part of the built environment is a huge ambition or vision and that it will cost money.  In providing for older people, rather than talking about a bespoke or very different unit, we are talking about slightly smaller units, including apartments.  We are talking about one or two-bedroom units or about two-bedroom units for three people, rather than two-bedroom units for four people, for example.  The units do not look very different from standard units.  They are not accommodating every type of physical, sensory or mental disability, but they are certainly very suitable for older people.</p><p>It is a question of community and wraparound supports.  There are over 400 units, many of which have already been built.  It is about examining different aspects of universal design but perhaps not to the full extent of the definition.  It is about considering urban renewal and some units being lifetime adaptable using assistive technology.  There are such elements in the case studies.  It is not a matter of one size fits all.  </p><p> The National Disability Authority, under the national disability inclusion strategy 2017 to 2021, has been assigned the task of considering universal design solutions for new houses and will make an impact assessment.  We are watching it and the timeframe for it is quarter 2 of 2018.</p></speech>

Could there be elements of universal design in an increasing number of dwellings, with a percentage having an even higher level of universal design?  The two are not mutually incompatible.</p></speech>

That is where the research is going.  Part M is the first step and there are features embedded in it that embrace the principles of universal design.  We work very closely with the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, CEUD, and the 'Smart Ageing' competition that we ran last year was based on the principles of universal design.  Rather than be absolute in meeting the definition, we have always supported the principles and tried to incorporate them as much as possible.  In respect of Part M, we refer to accessible approaches to dwellings, level thresholds, having a WC downstairs, suitable door and corridor widths.  These are suitable for everybody, regardless of age, as a base level for housing.</p></speech>

Within the private sector housing developers want to identify the widest market possible.  Nowadays wetrooms, low profile and accessible showers are becoming almost standard elements of the interior design of apartments.  There is also wheelchair accessibility.  There has been a huge improvement.  Retrofitting is the area that really needs investment, when we consider the number of houses that are not adaptable.  That is why the Abhaile project which won the award last year was very interesting.  It was predicated on the simple idea that a typical three-bedroom semi-detached house, that one could walk around blindfold in most parts of the country, could be adapted to two units which could create an income for an older person whose only asset was their home.  It allows for an element of community because there is contact with the other person in the house, produces an income and allows for adapting access to the house.  The cost is &euro;50,000.  Grant-aiding that work would be of huge benefit.</p><p>If a person is on a limited income even &euro;50,000 it is going to be tricky.  Perhaps a way could be identified of grant aiding that element of it.  When the &euro;14,000 tax-free income that is allowed for renting a room is taken into account, suddenly it starts to look like a very attractive option.  That also helps to increase the density in our suburbs in a very simple way.  Mr. Tynan will refer to exemplars, and I keep going back to the big picture.  We have been warned now and we know it is coming.  We know that by 2050, Ireland could have a population of 6.5 million people, 25% of whom will be a huge demographic of 65 year olds.</p><p> When we as architects identify density, it is units per hectare.  This is a blunt instrument because units per hectare does not mean anything, it does not look at the demographic and it does not define the real housing need.  With private development especially, we have to start forcing the issue that it is not suitable just to provide family houses in a development.  It may not suit the demographic.  Developers must do demographic studies.  We do this for retail and other elements when we apply for planning permissions.  We should look carefully at who we are building for and if it satisfies the demographic in the area.  Is a suburb with predominantly three and four bedroom apartments a sustainable way of developing housing?  It probably is not.  The issue can be forced and the densities can be forced to increase so that appropriate housing can be provided that is more suited to starter homes and older people as well as families.  This leads to the issue of family-sized apartments.  The solution lies in higher density development.  The vision, the look, the scale and the size are going to be completely different.  As architects we can demonstrate this and show what it is going to be like.  In some respects it can be very advantageous and a much more well-adapted suburb with better and more high-use facilities.  It can keep the population close.</p></speech>

The total HSE home care budget in 2018 is &euro;408 million.  This includes an increase of &euro;18 million in this allocation.  There is, however, unmet need in the area of home care, especially in home care for people who are still living in their own homes.  The Department recognises that there is a policy vacuum in the area of home care, particularly when compared with the nursing home care scheme.  We are actively working on a plan for a new statutory home care scheme and also for the regulation of home care.  The funding available is an administrative scheme.  Last autumn both of the Ministers launched a consultation process on the new home care scheme.  We received 2,600 submissions in response to a discussion paper.  We will publish the results of that consultation in May.  This will help us in formulating proposals and so on.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the cost of nursing home care compared with the cost of supported housing.  The average cost of nursing home care is about &euro;1,100 per week.</p></speech>

The last figure I have in my mind dates from 16 March, which was the tail end of winter, so it would have been particularly high.  The figure for people who are destined to go home and who are waiting for home supports was about 136 at that point.</p></speech>

Typically there is a report every Wednesday on delayed discharges for the week.

We measure in terms of bed days, with three categories of 30, 60 and 90 days.  This would not be specific to people who are waiting to go home.  It relates more generally to delayed discharges.  Delayed discharges as a whole category probably average around the 550 mark.  This is a mix of long-term residential care, rehabilitation, home care and the small number of people awaiting housing adaptation.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey referred to the more than 90% of people who would prefer to stay in their homes.  If there were more options, these people would look at the other alternatives.  The Department has a piece of work that was done under the healthy and positive ageing initiative as part of the national positive ageing strategy.  This research has not been published yet and is due to be finalised in the next while.  It will be published later this year.  I can give the committee a snapshot as it homes in on what has been said here.  The study looked at 10,500 adults aged over 55 and their attitudes to future housing options.  A total of 30% of people in the study said they were positive about moving towards an adapted housing type such as housing with care style models.  This builds on the points made here and shows the evidence base for this type of development.  It is an interesting statistic.</p></speech>

As a practice that now does more student accommodation than we would like to and which does not do the 40% of social housing that was our business back in 2008 and 2009, we are well aware of the requirements under the variation of the development plan to quantify the percentage of student accommodation in any particular area.  That is part of a planning application and it is very easy to put that in place.  Likewise, one could have the regulation where it is stated that the developer must advance the issue of housing for older people.</p> <p>  As Mr. O'Mahony has said, it is an issue of demographic change.  This is true for smaller units, be it for general mainstream housing or housing for older people.  This is where the challenge is.  Whether this is for 100 units per hectare, which I would call the "missing middle" where we would have to increase that density, or for larger schemes, we have to look at the models and develop those.  The Netherlands has been far better than the UK in this regard.  I recently came across the Housing our Ageing Population Panel for Innovation, HAPPI, which the committee may have heard of.  It is five or six years old and is a series of exemplars of Dutch, Swiss and German principles for smaller unit, higher density five and six storey accommodation.  I believe this is where we need to be.  The difficulty is that the bungalow model will not work as we go forward.  We have to look at encouraging and incentivising people into larger-scale buildings that can accommodate their needs and which are adaptable, in response to the Part M regulations.  In the majority of cases, what we are building now is suitable for people of reasonable mobility as distinct from people who need specialised care.</p></speech>

I lived there for nine years.  It strikes me, having lived there, that its methodology for densities is incredible.  The problem here is cultural.  We are used to older people living in their family homes and it is no longer smart living.  It is inefficient in many senses.  It is not efficient to adapt the house because it is three bedroom and maybe one person is living there.  What communication mechanisms does the Department have in place?  What the witnesses have identified here is clear, that we need to change the way we do business with regard to housing for older people in Ireland and housing in general.  The models are there in other countries.  What is the Department doing to inform older people of the options?  The witnesses identified that if older people are provided with options, they may consider it.  How will we do that cultural shift to help people to go into secure, proper, energy-efficient housing?  If we do not communicate the message to older people, we will keep coming up against friction.  The point is to help and empower older people to make good choices about housing.</p> <p>  How do we support families who support older people?  This issue of housing for older people is not just about the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or the Department of Health but also the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  In the Netherlands, when an area is being developed, the infrastructure, such as roads networks, is developed first and the housing often goes in afterwards.  Here in Ireland, older people have reduced mobility when walking and have difficulties going to services and supermarkets.  We have a real problem with overall support for older people.  Housing is part of that but we have to give the older people the chance to live in their communities.  We identified living in the community as important.  To access services of libraries, supermarkets and community centres, they need to be able to get around, both inside and outside of their houses and to access services.  How are we doing that?  How are the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Department of Health supporting people to live decent and fulfilled lives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.683" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018042400002#FF00500"><p>I was late coming in but I too want to agree with previous speakers.  My concern relates to all the Departments.  The lack of housing for elderly people is a massive issue.  We speak here about all the funding that is meant to be there but it is not there.  The grants to local authorities include housing aid for older people and adaptation grants.  Grant money is given out at the beginning of the year.  Many people apply and are disappointed because they get letters back to say that there is no funding there for the grant.  One has to reapply the following year.  One cannot leave one's file in and have it there as a priority.  One is told that there is no funding and to apply again.  That is unacceptable.  I know people waiting for grants who have died.  It is uncalled for, there is no joined-up thinking and I am concerned about it.</p><p>The other issue is the age change from 60 to 65 without local authorities knowing.  That is massive.  That six-year gap is crucial for an elderly person to get work done.  The maximum grant, as the witnesses know, is &euro;30,000.  Those are all means-tested.  When a grant is means-tested, all the income is taken into account.  Therefore, the highest grant I have seen in my years as a councillor and now a Senator would be &euro;16,000 to &euro;17,000.  I have never seen the maximum grant given out for any housing aid for the elderly or adaptation grant.  One submits a figure and a builder will come back with a quote.  There were four cases in my clinic yesterday where people had got the grant.  They have been given maybe &euro;14,000 but the builder had given a quote of &euro;22,000.  They are falling between the stools because they are not able to get the work done and they are losing the grant.  Nobody is helping them.  There is nowhere they can go.  I have put in appeals.</p><p> I have another concern.  I presume there is an occupational therapist in most local authorities, as there is in my own, who works through the local authority in a private capacity.  Occupational therapists do not work for the local authority but are given a grant to assess a person's situation.  There are many grants which the occupational therapist has not approved and many appeals have gone back in through the doctor.  There are cases where the occupational therapist has said what is recommended and I have had a man or woman come back to me.  I have said it is not good enough and to go to a doctor and that the doctor needs to appeal.  I feel that I am in an appeal system the whole time.  A doctor can seemingly overrule an occupational therapist, and rightly so.  I am not saying anything bad about the occupational therapists as I am sure they are doing their jobs.  They only give a certain amount then doctors come in.  I put in appeal after appeal.  People may need to go back to doctors and get another assessment from them and work with the occupational therapist.  The situation is unacceptable and should be examined.</p><p> Quality of life is crucial for the elderly.  I know through the HSE and the councils that it is important.  I believe there is a system for stove installation in some local authorities.  In the past year, the biggest number of queries I have had from the elderly relate to stoves.  People find them safe if they have to go out for a message or such.  Even with medicals - I am going in with doctors' letters - there is no money for stoves.  Can the witnesses work together and put a system together for elderly people where there is a grant scheme for stoves?  I am told that it goes back to local authorities which then say there is no money there.</p><p> It is a nightmare if one is looking for windows and doors for the elderly because there is no money.  People are living longer but funding is not being provided for grants.  That is a major problem.  I want to talk about the HSE.  The HSE would originally have worked through local authorities.  When one gets a grant, whether for a chair for the shower or if one has an elderly person who is looking for a walking aid or such, one has to go back to the nurse or doctor.  Years ago, with local authorities, the HSE had a massive say and the local authorities, with the HSE, would say that a particular lady needed a walking aid.  The other day, I was trying to get a ball for a lady for her hand as she has arthritis.  I have to go back to the nurse then to the doctor.  These are simple things but there does not seem to be joined-up thinking.  Can the witnesses work together to produce a system, whether for a stairlift, a chair for a shower, a walking aid, a ramp or rail?  The timescale is not working.  If the funding is gone at the beginning of the year, and one does not get in quickly, then one is left to the following year and has to reapply.  There is even a system in the HSE which is letting elderly people down.  Fair play to the nurses, they are doing a great job.  I am not knocking anyone here.  Maybe the HSE would work more with local authorities to see what could be done.</p><p> Recently, two or three elderly people came in to buy their house.  Last year, a new tenant purchase scheme was given to local authorities but an income level of 50% must be met.</p><p>I know people who have retired.  They are elderly and have lived in local authority houses all their lives but they do not qualify to buy them.  These people have worked all their lives and have the money but because the 50% income level is not being met, they do not qualify to buy the local authority house.  I do not mean to be critical but there must be joined-up thinking so the elderly can get the chance to buy their houses.  I know there was meant to be a review of the tenant purchase scheme.  The couples coming to me were devastated that they could not buy the house in which they had lived all their lives.  Will the witnesses do something about that?</p><p> Overall there must be a full assessment of people in three bedroom or four bedroom houses that need to downsize.  I can understand this is not for everybody but the choice should be given.  Recently I dealt with one or two cases of people in local authority houses that have three bedrooms and they now want properties with one or two bedrooms.  They are being told there is no money to buy them a house.  We have people looking to downsize but there is no programme in place.  Could such a system be put in place?  There is a massive issue with awareness of how people qualify for the fair deal scheme.  People ring my office and I try to help but there must be a programme in place so people can be aware of what they need to do to qualify for the fair deal scheme.  This also applies to families seeking respite, as there is no respite.  People are ringing hospitals and trying to get respite or cataracts removed.  Ultimately, elderly people are being forgotten in certain areas.  Respite is one area where people must wait for months.  I have contacted the Health Service Executive and hospitals and people are in queues because there are no beds.  This must be addressed.</p><p> Elderly people might have to wait for up to two and a half years for a cataract operation or even a hospital appointment.  In my area of Carlow and Kilkenny, people have been waiting for over a year just for an appointment.  These are not all elderly people but some of them are.  We need to prioritise the elderly and get the HSE, local authorities and the Department together to form a system where everybody can work together.  I am not being negative but I am dealing with these areas.</p><p> I know everybody is doing their best.  Will different programmes be put in place for the rebuilding of houses for elderly people or the system for grant applications?  Will there be a revision to the process of working through the HSE, the nurses and doctors in different areas when people need to access services?  The staff are being put to the pin of their collar but there is not enough time for them.  All of us are here today and it is important that everybody works together so there can be delivery.  I know from dealing with the different Departments that everybody is doing their best.  Funding is a massive issue and unless it is put in the right areas, the whole system will fall.  There must be accountability, as I have said that it is a major issue too.  We need to look at accountability in different areas.</p></speech>

I brought it to the committee but it has been endorsed as something we can do as a joint committee.  It is not mine, rather it comes from everybody within this committee.  It arose on the back of a weekly programme on Fridays that had a couple of irate panellists who said the Government had some cheek in asking them to give up their homes.  We had to really take it on the chin because although it was not the aim, it came across that way.  We cannot ask people to downsize or move unless there are options for them.  We have a duty to provide solutions or options.</p> <p>  If I am being parochial, allow me to go back to social housing for all age groups and not just older people.  There is a difference between "older" and "elderly".  I am referring to older people who are absolutely not elderly but who might not need a home with three or four bedrooms.  They might want to be in a village or community setting with supports that may be required now or in future.  My local authority sold council houses through the tenant purchase scheme and we reinvested the money into all our social housing stock, retrofitting properties to bring them up to proper energy efficiency with the likes of insulation and new windows, doors, boilers and guttering systems.  We brought them to a certain standard and in turn this meant we could turn over the properties more quickly if tenants moved to a different type of unit.</p><p>I know that is not happening in all local authorities but some local authorities such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown are very proactive in such matters.  We must give recognition where it is due.  I know Ms Sarah Neary has done much work with building standards and guidelines to bring us where we need to be now.  There has been a massive deficit for nearly 20 years in this respect.  All of a sudden we are trying to get these schemes up and running, having ignored them for decades.  We must recognise that Ms Neary has done much work in the Department on this.</p><p> My fear about this process relates to cost.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned a figure of approximately 3% being bandied about last week.  Do the architects see this as a factor?  I am acutely aware that the construction industry is all the time trying to make it more affordable to build or to streamline, whether it is by eliminating lift shafts or parking, but not reducing the standards we now have.  Is the 3% figure a barrier to us developing age-friendly and appropriate homes in mixed tenure developments?  I know we are discussing Part M but the debate has even got down to saddle boards, handrails or handles and walk-in showers in houses or apartments.  Is the 3% a prohibitive factor?</p><p> I am reluctant to use the word "incentivise" but how can we encourage applications for housing for older people?  We have done it before in other sectors, whether we agree on it or not.  Could there be initiatives such as tax incentives to encourage applications, especially in areas where we know there is a higher population of people over 65?  There is one local authority in Dublin that would have a higher population than the other three.  I do not want to be biased so I will not mention one over the other.  Could we encourage applications so as to give people the choice of downsizing; this could lead to financial security or lessen the burden of cost in heating a larger dwelling while also facilitating family visits or other amenities?</p><p> Mr. O'Mahony mentioned planning requirements and possible resistance in this respect.  I get excited when I hear such comments as it means there is something good in this that needs to be pushed.  It might be difficult to deliver but sometimes the harder thing to do is the right thing.  I will be led by the witness on whether a planning requirement is something we should push.  Nothing is insurmountable and if there is a will, there is a way to deliver.</p><p> There was mention of particular sites for public private partnerships delivering schemes like this.  I know of four sites with nothing on them right now but with plans somewhere in the ether.  With those we could deliver public private partnerships at the level we need of mixed tenure.  I would like some comments on that.  Would it be a better mechanism for delivering housing for older people, whether in assisted or independent living, or merely within mixed tenure development?  Would it be the best or fastest way of doing it?  Is it a long-term solution or all of the above?  Would the witnesses favour public private partnerships to deliver housing for older people rather than local authorities?  They might not want to answer but I welcome their comments.</p><p> The witnesses might have examples of best practice in our European counterparts, although they may not have them here.  Perhaps they could be sent to the committee so we can make informed policy decisions or refer to them when we put together the document.  I know we have gone well over time and I am biased but I have found this really interesting for a long time.  We can put together a lovely glossy document, and there are many in these Houses from all Departments, but there is no point in it sitting on a shelf.  What key actions or recommendations can we put into development plans or national policy so as to encourage and deliver housing for older people across the country but in particular in population areas where it is needed?  I am looking for the key actions.</p><p>Like many on this committee, I do not want a glossy document.  I want a return for the time we are giving.  Yes, it is 20 years away, but we have just lost 20 years in this area.  I do not want to lose the next 20 years.  The will is there - cross-party - to deliver housing for older people across the board.  What key actions can we take and how can we implement them in order to get that return?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.689" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Mahony" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018042400002#KK00200"><p>I refer to the cost of universal access.  If one can get it early enough and if it is defined clearly enough, then it should cost virtually nothing.  The Part M elements that we already incorporate are the expensive ones, including simple things like the widths of doorways, accessibility and so on.  When it is brought down to a much more defined and specific level, if the specification is there, it can be designed in early.  Retrofitting is where the cost is.  Unfortunately, it goes back to regulation.  The developer works to what is specifically on the page, not maximum or minimum standards.  If one wants to make change, sadly it involves forcing people to accept it.  As we have said so many times, the cost of houses is not the cost of building.  The cost of houses is the other 53%.  There is a recent study by Housing Agency which looked at our costs against four other European countries of equivalent wealth, standard, etc.  Our building costs are pretty well in line with those in France, Germany and the UK.  In fact, we are cheaper than the UK.  This is all about designing in early.</p> <p>  I refer to retrofitting.  I am really interested in retrofitting because I went to the Netherlands and I saw this extraordinary retrofitting scheme, where they took a terrace of local authority houses built in the 1950s.  In four days they completely retrofitted a house.  I think it cost &euro;80,000.  A front wall, a back wall and a roof arrived and they were fixed within a day and a half.  Then they went inside and they retrofitted the bathrooms and the kitchens and plugged in a whole new heating system in the back.  They did it all in the space of four days.  They asked all the tenants on the street whether they were going to buy into it.  All of them did, except one who was left out of the scheme.  It was paid back through a long-term rental system where the money was deducted from rent over a payback period of something like ten years.  It was extraordinary.  It was all very carefully designed and the retrofitting brought it up to the standards we are talking about, which is A2.  It is just a thought; there are ways of doing it.</p> <p>  The question was asked as to whether public private partnerships, PPPs, were a good idea.  I mentioned one.  For some reason, there may have been a notion that the developer was being aggrandised, which is a political issue as opposed to a factual one.  However, it delivered what it said on the tin.  I think PPPs are the most efficient and effective way, assuming the rules are very clear and it is an open book, so if one is dealing with a developer, everything is on the table.  The profit margins, all the costs and everything should be out in the open, so everybody can see very clearly what is happening.  The difference is the traditional developer can deliver efficiencies that it is very difficult to do under a public tendering system.</p> <p>  In the example I mentioned, there was a competition which decided who one would go with.  Having done that, it was possible to define all the elements of that PPP.  I think it is a very good way of doing it.  I am inclined to believe there has to be a better and more effective way of realising the value of land in the long term rather than giving it away just like that and taking the money.  The family jewels should not be given away.  If that can be squared, that is a very good idea.</p><p>Dublin City Council has advertised a number of PPPs over the years.  The same land kept coming up and then nothing would happen.  It seemed to founder on the basis of what the PPP format should be.  Therefore, let us look at the effective, efficient ones and the ones that worked.  </p><p> We were just saying among ourselves that the whole issue of housing the aged and health issues to do with the aged mean we probably need a Minister for the aged.  If 25% of the population will be over 65, it is so complex and needs such tying together of all the issues, that it probably is deserving of a junior Ministry anyway.</p></speech>

We have been involved in a couple of schemes where the payback to the local authority has been a certain number of turnkey units.  In other words, if there is a piece of land for which there is a design and bid competition, that is developed by the developer and the payback to the local authority is a certain percentage of those units, whether directly to itself or to an approved housing body.  That is a means of bringing the value of the land, which is there in the first place, back into the stock.</p></speech>

There are models of doing that which are in existence and useful.</p></speech>

Senator Grace O'Sullivan asked about the communication piece which is really important.  In terms of our interaction with the local authority, the framework is set through things like the national planning framework, housing strategies, development plans, guidelines and building regulations.  What will be important for people on the ground and citizens is the strategy and policy statement we will issue because that will set out the different issues around urban renewal, connected living and delivery in centres for older people.  That will be an important communication tool.</p> <p>  In terms of the services that are offered, one of the things we always require local authorities to do is to have good information up on their websites.  Through Citizen's Information, people are made aware of the various different grants.  Hopefully, through that mechanism, people will be aware of what they are entitled to, or what is available to them.  When we publish the older persons' policy statement, we would see ourselves doing a lot of work on communicating the different things that are available to people so that they know.  It is important in terms of our work, the work of the Department of Health and the HSE that there is a joined up approach on the ground.  People should hear about what is available through their GP and through the different health services they go through.</p> <p>  We have spoken a lot about the delivery and the type of mixed delivery that older people need and want.  The approved housing bodies piece is important in terms of delivery and the type of homes that come through for older persons.  We have seen some very successful schemes where approved housing bodies can give the supports that are required on the ground to those older people.</p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the issue of stoves.  That is not something that is encompassed within our housing adaptation grant criteria and that we have funded in recent times.  In the past they may have been funded, but it is not something that is encompassed at the moment.</p></speech>

It has become a massive issue for elderly people and I am sure it will be noted by local authorities.</p><p>Climate change has resulted in colder weather.  I urge the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to put a scheme in place to help local authorities to provide stoves for elderly people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Hurley" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018042400002#MM00200"><p>When the Senator was not present, we spoke about the things that were funded under the housing adaptation grants scheme.  In certain instances, local authorities when carrying out inspections have discretion to decide whether to fund some heating element in a person's house.  Stoves are not encompassed by the initiative, but there is a piece on heating.  I will ask somebody in my Department to liaise with the Senator's local authority and discuss her suggestion.</p> <p>  Earlier a question was asked about whether the Department inspected the works carried out under the housing adaptation scheme.  We work very closely with local authorities on works carried out.  The Department receives clear documentation on the works carried out as part of various projects and invoices.  The work is certified by local authorities.  It is important to the Department that the works are certified, carried out appropriately and to the required standard.</p> <p>  The issue of public private partnerships and land has been raised.  My colleague, Ms Neary, will say a couple of words on the matter as she has done some work on same.  We are advancing a number of the ideas mentioned.  I also ask Ms Neary to mention the costs associated with universal design.</p> <p>  On downsizing, we have mentioned that 89% of people want to continue living in their communities and that it is about providing a suite of other options.  If there are other options available, it may very well suit people to live in supported accommodation where would they feel more safe and stable.  We are working on various options for older people.</p></speech>

The review of cost report contains a recommendation which calls for more active State land management.</p> <p>  On mixed tenure developments, we are very encouraging.  We are working with local authorities on a number of such projects.  We really like to have a mix of social, affordable and private housing.  That is very much the principle of sustainable communities we have espoused for years.  Projects at O'Devaney Gardens and Corkagh Park in south Dublin are being advanced.  As Mr. O'Mahony outlined, the industry has responded very positively to the projects.  The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, is another area in which funding is being pumped into lands to facilitate greater housing delivery into the future, certainly at an affordable level. </p> <p>  I wish to address the two questions asked about An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Like any other planning authority, An Bord Plean&aacute;la abides by guidelines, rules and regulations.  The local authorities zone land and set the context for development.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la then applies the regulations and guidelines as a planning authority. </p> <p>  The work of the NPF will be advanced through the regional assemblies.  In 2019 revisions to development plans will be required on foot of the spatial and economic regulations.  </p> <p>  On the costs associated with universal design, the housing elements we incorporated into Part M are the least onerous.  There are various levels which can be seen in some pilot projects such as the one in Cabra, from which we are learning.  The National Disability Authority is carrying out research into universal design, the findings of which will inform what my Department might incorporate into Part M.</p></speech>

I mentioned in my opening statement that approximately &euro;300 million is provided to the HSE to provide community supports.  A lot of that funding is given to voluntary organisations and is used for a variety of purposes in local towns throughout the country, including day centres, transport to day centres, meals on wheels and so on.  I am talking about groups like Care of the Aged.  There is also an interesting project involving dementia-friendly towns, in which this committee might be interested.  I shall send that information to the Senator separately.</p></speech>

In general, there is pretty good joint working between the health side and the local authorities.</p> <p>  The Senator may be familiar with the age-friendly cities and counties initiative.  The committee may have met the people involved.  The empowerment of older people is important as well.  There are older people councils in many parts of the country at the moment.  It means older people have a voice in decisions that are relevant to them in their communities.  The Department of Health, in its own right and through the Healthy Ireland initiative, is very involved in many of these local initiatives.</p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor mentioned publicity about the fair deal or nursing homes support scheme.  Many quite strict rules attach to the scheme but it is well advertised.  In view of the amount that the scheme costs it is inevitable that many stages must be gone through.  It is a statutory scheme.  There are strict criteria to do with care needs as well as a means test.  My colleague, Mr. Redmond, may wish to comment.  </p></speech>

The HSE, in partnership with the ALONE organisation, has conducted a pilot project for the past nine months in community healthcare organisation area 9 on support co-ordination.  ALONE staff or volunteers deal with referrals from, for example, general practitioners, GPs, primary care teams and acute hospitals, and act as a point of contact for individuals who need to access various services.  The pilot scheme has been very successful.  The HSE has provided further funding to extend the scheme a bit further.  Last December, the scheme won the HSE Excellence Award For Innovative Support Coordination for Older Persons and 300 projects were in the group.  We must consider whether the scheme can be scaled up and brought to a national level.  As many as 1,500 people availed of the project last year.  The project gives an opportunity to co-ordinate the various services whether they are adaption grants, access to aids and appliances or whatever they might be and provides a focal, single point of contact for older people.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues, Ms Ann-Marie Horan, a fellow pharmacist and member of the IPU executive committee, and Mr. Jim Curran, IPU director of communications and strategy.  The IPU has 2,200 members and is the representative and professional body for community pharmacists in the community.  Members are committed to delivering a quality, accessible, personal and professional pharmacy service that puts patients first and has as its primary goal the optimisation of the health and well-being of society.</p> <p>  Crime against businesses, and pharmacies in particular, is not a new phenomenon but is an issue that has been impacting on our members over a considerable period.  Pharmacies throughout the country have been subjected to criminal activity on an ongoing basis and the problem continues to get worse.  I intend to briefly run through the following areas: types of criminal activity our members are facing; the cost and impact of crime against pharmacies; reporting of crime; and what needs to be done to protect pharmacy staff.</p> <p>  Our latest crime survey, which was issued in February of this year, found that four out of five pharmacies had been the victim of crime in 2017.  This represented an increase on the previous year and was up nine percentage points since 2012.  The survey reveals that crimes against pharmacies are not isolated incidents with 81% of victims reporting having experienced two or more incidents during 2017.</p> <p>  The type of crime perpetrated against pharmacies varies from staff pilferage and shoplifting to more serious crimes, including break-ins and raids.  For example, 89% of pharmacies that were victims of crime experienced shoplifting, 17% were victims of a break-in and 16% were victims of fraud.  The number of pharmacists who experienced a raid, at 13%, had more than doubled since the previous year.  This highlights the ongoing threat that remains.</p> <p>  Of particular concern is that almost one case in three involving a robbery or raid was described as violent or involved the use of a weapon.  A knife was used in 77% of robberies or raids where a weapon was presented, a syringe was used in 15% of cases and a gun 8% of the time.  The more violent crimes committed against pharmacies involve gangs who come in with a syringe, knife, gun or hatchet demanding prescription drugs such as benzodiazepines, opiates and z-drugs such as sleeping pills.  They are more likely to come into the pharmacy when it is open because they would not be able to access the drugs or cash themselves in an out-of-hours raid.  In one out of every four cases controlled drugs or prescription medicines were taken and cash was taken in 21% of cases.  In 11% of cases over-the-counter drugs were taken.  Cosmetics and fake tan are the most likely items to be shoplifted in pharmacies.</p> <p>  The cost and impact of crime against pharmacies is significant.  In 2017 the average cost per pharmacy of criminal activity was &euro;4,300.  While this does not seem like a large figure, it does not take into account the significant additional costs that pharmacies face to protect and insure their premises.  For instance, 97% of pharmacies have CCTV, 96% have alarms, 20% are using tagging systems and 6% need to have a security guard on the premises.  The most significant costs, however, are the hidden costs.  These include the impact on pharmacy owners, their staff and their customers.  As I have already outlined, a significant number of robberies involve violence.  It is difficult enough to run a pharmacy in the current environment without repeatedly being the target for criminal activity.  Not only do these crimes have significant cost implications but, more important, they have a very real and detrimental impact on the people working in the pharmacy.  Crime has a negative impact on staff morale, with the psychological aftermath and traumatic effects of these crimes, especially violent crimes, leading to increased levels of absenteeism.  We are also aware of several cases in which customers have indicated a reluctance to return to a particular pharmacy in the aftermath of a violent incident.</p> <p>  There is a perception that crimes against business are victimless.  Consequently, they are not treated as seriously as they should be.  The safety of pharmacists, staff and customers is being put at risk by criminals and this cannot be tolerated.  Crime also damages businesses, threatens jobs and negatively impacts on staff morale.  These hidden costs can have a far bigger impact on the pharmacy business than the direct costs of damage and loss.</p> <p>  Almost three quarters of pharmacy owners who experienced crime reported the case to the Garda and four out of five were happy that their case was dealt with effectively and adequately.  However, almost half of those pharmacists who decided not to report a crime refrained from doing so because they believed the perpetrator would not be charged.  One in four indicated that they had no confidence in the Garda response.  Of those who decided not to report the crime, almost half had a lack of faith that the perpetrator would be charged.  This issue raises a wider question about the confidence pharmacists have in the law and the enforcement system.  We are aware from research and anecdotes that there are major concerns within pharmacy about the ability of the law enforcement agencies to adequately deal with the threat of crime and that appropriate penalties for criminal activity are not being applied.  Several respondents to our annual crime survey were frustrated with the lack of deterrents for criminals.  One respondent said that the culprits know the law better than anyone and so they know how to work the system.  He said they often know that they will get away lightly and are not deterred by the prospect of being arrested or jailed.  He also said that they do not care about the costs to the business and recommended that there should be a system in place whereby they are made to repay at least some of the costs.</p><p>Other respondents were critical of the follow-up to reported crimes, with many confirming that they have received no feedback.  They stated:</p><blockquote>It is very difficult to obtain status updates on reported crimes.  I have reported crimes on many occasions but have rarely received feedback.  </blockquote><p>Another respondent stated:  &quot;On several occasions in the past, I have printed off photos and provided visual footage of thefts taking place, but have never been informed of any conviction.&quot;.  There are serious reservations with regard to the ability of the justice system to identify and adequately convict perpetrators of crime.  There is particular annoyance over the judicial system, primarily due to the leniency in sentences and the feeling that perpetrators are not adequately punished as a deterrent to prevent those committing further criminal acts.  One respondent to the survey outlined:</p><blockquote>Thieves need tougher sentences.  The garda&iacute; make the effort of looking at our CCTV, get the criminals but the problem is with the judges and the court ... the criminals are getting off way too lightly.</blockquote><p>Another respondent had an issue with the whole judicial process, confirming that he had to take four days out of his pharmacy to attend court just because the perpetrator &quot;who was caught by the guards coming out of my property at 3 a.m., through a window a witness saw him break, had pleaded innocent.&quot;.  These comments are typical of the feedback we receive from our members.<br/><br/>There is a general sense that the Garda is doing its best in difficult circumstances and most pharmacy owners are aware of and use the services of their local crime protection officers.  Many, however, remain extremely frustrated by Garda response times, the lack of Garda response and follow-up in some instances, and by the general lack of visibility of garda&iacute; on the ground.<br/><br/>What needs to be done?  A number of key measures need to be introduced, including more visible policing.<b></b>There needs to be an increase in the number of garda&iacute; on patrol.  One potential way to do this is to increase the civilianisation of administrative duties so that garda&iacute; can concentrate on policing.  There must be a fast Garda response to reports of crime.  Garda&iacute; have had great success in reducing the level of burglaries since the start of Operation Thor almost two years ago and the high level of crime against pharmacies and their often violent nature indicates there is now a need for a similar targeted Garda operation to specifically tackle crimes against pharmacies.  There should be increased installation and use of public CCTV, particularly in town centres.  There should also be tougher sentencing.  The role of the Judiciary quite clearly needs to be evaluated as the pharmacy sector continues to have very little faith in its ability to address business crime.  There needs to be a reassessment of the sentences handed out by the Judiciary when dealing with business crime to ensure that it is an adequate punishment and deterrent.  There should be development and implementation of business watch initiatives, ensuring they are promoted effectively to businesses to encourage engagement.<br/><br/>It is not an exaggeration to say that crime against pharmacies has reached crisis levels.  Pharmacists who are victims of crime say they are sick and tired of the &quot;revolving door approach&quot;, with many complaining that even when the criminals are caught, they are not sufficiently penalised and are allowed to continue with their criminal activities.  A zero tolerance approach is urgently required from the Judiciary and the Garda.  We need tougher sentencing and a more visible Garda presence to address this scourge.  Otherwise, this sinister and frightening pattern of crime on pharmacies will continue to the detriment of our members' pharmacies and staff and the local communities we serve.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-04-24a.733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damian Duggan" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018042400002#D00400"><p>Thank you.  I am secretary treasurer of the Association of Fine Jewellers, formerly Retail Jewellers of Ireland.  We changed our name a year ago.</p> <p>  The first matter of concern is the 23% VAT rate.  With shops across the Border paying 20% VAT, coupled with a strong euro, we are losing customers as we cannot be as competitive as our Northern counterparts.  The loss of revenue to the Exchequer is considerable and combined with the non-policing of flights from the USA, South Africa and Dubai by customs, the loss of revenue is very large.  Online sales mean cheap imports are available with no VAT implication for the consumer and no duty is paid.  We plead with this committee to encourage the Government to bring forward legislation to make all the online markets liable for VAT and duties.  We need fair competition for all Irish retailers that would increase revenue for the Exchequer.  When we are facing these mounting obstacles to our business, we find there are more jewellers closing rather than opening.</p> <p>  There is the matter of compliance.  While all businesses strive to be compliant in every way, we are finding more red tape is making it harder and very costly to implement compliance procedures.  We understand the necessity for policing businesses but we saw an example recently of an independent retailer being threatened with a fine because although the required correct signage was visible in the store, it was not within 5 ft. of the door.  The jeweller can be fined but department stores selling jewellery that have no signage whatsoever on display are ignored.  Small businesses are a very easy target to for authorities as they have easy access to the decision maker in the business.  The General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, is going to be implemented next month and we are putting in measures to make sure we are compliant but the small retailer is the low-hanging fruit and will be the first to be policed and fined if not compliant, taking up more time and money.</p> <p>  In the jewellery business we must keep ahead with our security measures to protect staff, stock and our buildings.  The lack of visible policing is certainly not helping all retail and if it was more evident, the amount of retail crime would decrease.  The effect would be cheaper insurance, along with a safer environment for all.  Our legislation would have to buy into supporting our police.  Arresting people with 18 previous convictions while out on bail, with no jail time or punishment served, means there is no deterrent to stop crime in retail shops.  This makes things frustrating for the retailer and police.</p> <p>  Retail business is a tough life.  To be busy and have plenty of footfall is every retailer's dream.  All of the above taken together, however, mean it is not an easy life for the Irish retailer in 2018.  I know from speaking with many people in the retail sector, they certainly will not encourage family members to take over because they know how hard they work.  They are last to get time off and last to be paid, and they have very little down time.  Many small Irish retail businesses are "living to work" rather than "working to live" and when the present owners retire at 70 or 80 years old, the businesses will close.</p> <p>  On a positive note, people running their own business need to be encouraged because in general they are passionate about what they do.  As food for thought, a coffee shop pays 9% VAT and we would gladly pay double that at 18%.</p> <p>  With regard to security, much crime is not reported.  The first reason for this is the impact on insurance but there is also no confidence in the judicial system.  There is also the threat of litigation and false accusations to consider.  Moreover, there is the cost of security staff and the fact that our doors are generally locked.  Even with a small business and quiet days, our insurance companies insist that two staff are on the floor at all times.  At the front of the shop we are suffering an epidemic of graffiti, so we start our day at that.  All shutters now must have ground locks.  Working our way through the shop we can consider what we must implement to make a shop secure.</p> <p>  I mentioned litigation.  Two jewellers were recently visited by two characters who were checking cases in shops, trying to open them without staff assistance.  When they wanted to see the most expensive items in the shop, staff would not open the case, and a day later the owner got a letter in the post from a solicitor threatening legal action because of racial discrimination.</p><p>That is the sort of thing we are up against every single day of the week.  I personally have been stabbed in the chest, while my staff have been threatened with needles.  My father was beaten up during a robbery and died five years later.  I have been through it and know what it is like.  I am very passionate about what I do, but staying in business for the love of it is not getting any easier.  I have been involved in the business for 38 years and given everything I can to it.  Last year I took only six days' holidays.  One tries to make it as simple and enjoyable for one's customers and staff and oneself as possible, but it is not easy.</p></speech>

As someone with an uncle who was a pharmacist, or a chemist as they were known then, and who also ran the local jewellery store, this combination does not surprise me at all.  It must be said my uncle worked in happier times when crime levels were a lot lower.</p> <p>  The role of the pharmacist, about which I know most as a GP, is integral to the health service.  Pharmacists are often the first line of contact for patients who come seeking advice.  They are respected by their clientele in their communities.  They provide an essential service and it is critically important that they be supported.  The committee is about business, the cost of doing business, reducing red tape and helping business people to stay in business.  The SME sector, of which pharmacists are part, is hugely important to the economy and communities.  That is something that is sometimes lost when we talk about the economy, finance and money.  The SME sector is about real people.  </p> <p>  What the delegates have outlined is very reasonable.  They have called for more visible policing and a faster Garda response.  They have both raised an issue about the Judiciary which is clearly something we have heard before at this committee, namely, the disparities in the sentences meted out and the awards made by judges.  It can be particularly galling if someone breaks into a shop, injures himself or herself and then sues the shop owner.  That seems to be a rather inappropriate set-up.  The Irish Pharmacy Union's submission refers to tougher sentencing and an increase in the use of public CCTV systems.  The latter are improving all of the time and it is something of which I would be very supportive.  I would also be supportive of real consequences for those who transgress, particularly if an assault is involved.  That is violent crime and needs to be dealt with very seriously.  Obviously, Mr. Duggan's personal experience is horrendous.  To be stabbed in the chest is something I am sure he will never forget.  He has described his family business and the fact that he is still committed to it, despite all of the challenges he faces in securing it, as well as dealing with all of the red tape involved.  </p> <p>  Perhaps we might afford the delegates an opportunity to get back to the committee with some specific recommendations that they would like to see acted on.  We heard an excellent presentation last week by the Alliance for Insurance Reform in which it outlined many of the problems to which the delegates have also referred, while also pointing to solutions as they saw them.  They made concrete recommendations on which we can act by putting pressure on the Government.  For example, they spoke about the fraud squad in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being involved in dealing with false claims.  They said that if a claim fell in court, there should be an automatic follow through, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na investigating to ascertain whether the claim was vexatious in the first instance.  If the delegates could come back to the committee with simple suggestions such as that, it would be helpful.  I am trying to afford them more time to come back to us with specific ideas.  On the issue of tougher sentencing, for example, the Judiciary, rightly, is very jealous of its independence, which makes proceeding in that area difficult.  Certainly, the Government is increasing the numbers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, from which quicker response times should follow.  The main issue is that there should be consequences for the offender.  It is great to have the delegates here to hear their views.  I ask them, particularly Mr. Duggan, to revert to the committee with specific recommendations.  I would like to hear one or two concrete recommendations which could realistically be included in legislation.</p></speech>

These are ongoing themes, not just in the context of this committee but also in discussions in society in general on the visibility of policing, follow through by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the courts, the leniency shown by some judges, the revolving door and the never ending cycle of criminality.  For the professions and trades represented, evidently there are two types of criminal at work.  There are those who are at the very end of life in being drug addicts and there are the more professional elements who engage in shop lifting and steal jewellery and so forth.  There are probably varying levels of crime which has an impact on businesses, staff and employers.</p><p>Will the representative of the Irish Pharmacy Union tell us whether there is any correlation between proximity to drug addiction centres, including methadone clinics in certain areas of the city, and the levels of crime experienced by its members?  Is crime more prevalent in inner city and more built up areas?  Is the lack of drug support therapies having an effect in the increased prevalence of crime?  Mr. Connolly said crime levels had increased by 9% in 2017 in comparison to the levels in 2016.  There is obviously an issue in that regard and I ask him to comment further on it.</p><p>Delegates also referred to the non-reporting of crime.  While I understand people may have lost faith in the judicial, prosecutorial and investigative systems, there is an onus on organisations such as the IPU to encourage members to report crime.  The delegates might think that sitting here it is easy for me to say that, but it is important that all crime be reported, even if only from the point of view of having accurate statistics which can show up deficiencies in the capacity to follow up on crime.  If crimes are not reported, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will not have the right statistics and pressure will not be put on the political system to allocate additional resources to policing, as well as the prosecutorial and judicial systems.  </p><p>Reference has been made to insurance companies.  Are they placing additional burdens on businesses, over and above what the delegates believe to be reasonable, in protecting property?  For example, are they insisting on there being two staff on the floor in a jewellery shop at all times?  Do they expect CCTV equipment and other security devices of a certain standard to be installed?</p><p>Perhaps I look at the streets of Ireland in the past through rose tinted glasses, but I remember An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being more visually present.  Do the organisations represented link with other business groups or chambers of commerce to make their views known on this issue on a continual basis?  I have been talking<i>ad nauseam</i>about the need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be visually present on streets as visible policing has a deterrent effect.  Do the delegates believe things are improving in that regard?</p><p>On threats to staff, society is becoming more violent.  Statistics show that the number of violent burglaries has increased, as has the number of assaults on streets.  A lot of it is due to the new tiger, or whatever it is called now.</p><p>Alcohol consumption is increasing, while drug consumption is probably also increasing.  What steps do the delegates take when an assault occurs on their premises or there is a violent raid?  Do their respective organisations provide support or do they depend on statutory bodies such as the Health Service Executive to provide support such as counselling services?</p></speech>

The most recent robbery was probably the worst because it occurred while my children were on the premises.  It was a Saturday morning and my husband had just brought them from football.  They were in the dispensary and, as such, would not have been visible from outside.  The pharmacy was busy at the time and I had my back to the door because I was fetching eye drops for a customer.  When I turned around, there was a knife at my neck and someone was pushing me and telling me to open the till.  Two men had come into the pharmacy.  They were muffled up in the way they were dressed and looked odd.  Martina from the credit union next door had seen them walk across the car park and telephoned the police.  The customers in the pharmacy had left the premises, but I was too stressed to realise what was happening.  I was screaming and had a huge desire to press a panic button.  In my mind, I was telling my husband to get the boys out the back door but, of course, the boys came closer because I was screaming.  The robbers told me not to press the panic button.  We have a panic button on the till and another in a different part of the shop.  I opened the till and the second man who had a gun asked my husband for the Z-drugs, valium and so on.  My husband said he did not know where they were as he was not a pharmacist.  They turned to me again and I pointed out various drugs to them before pressing the panic button.  One of the men told the other that I had pressed the panic button and that they both needed to leave.  At that, they left the pharmacy.</p> <p>  The experience was extremely stressful and particularly scary because my children had witnessed the entire incident.  Although they did not feel physically threatened, they could see that I was being physically threatened and asked my husband if the man was going to hurt their mummy.  The problem is that this type of crime can take place at any time in a pharmacy.  The men simply walked out of the pharmacy and that was that.  They disappeared or perhaps they were caught for a different crime at a different stage.</p> <p>  The back of my pharmacy is fitted with steel doors and windows, while the upstairs floor is rented out to dentists.  Two weeks ago someone broke an upstairs window, climbed in and set off the alarm.  The person in question was unable to enter the pharmacy but did damage to the building.  I would not dream of claiming on my insurance for the damage caused because it provides cover for unlikely, rather than likely, events.  If I were to claim every time small amounts of money were taken, I would no longer be able to get insurance cover, which means that we would have to bear the costs of all these events.  That being said, the worst part is the psychological element.</p></speech>

He was acting very strangely, as if he had a broken leg, and I thought he was about to rob me.  I was surprised, therefore, when he handed over &euro;5 and left the premises.  However, the pharmacy was very quiet at that stage.  The school next door holds Saturday classes, but they had not started at that point.  It was the same man who robbed the shop because we saw on closed circuit television recordings that one of the robbers was wearing the same unusual running shoes as the man who had entered the pharmacy earlier who had clearly been casing the shop.  It was quiet when he first entered.  The robbers did not change their plan when they entered the shop at 11.30 a.m. and found that it was very busy.  There were four or five customers in the pharmacy and lots of people walking up and down the street outside.  The pharmacy is located in a suburb.</p></speech>

As members will be aware from the experience recounted by Ms Horan - I have had similar personal experiences - no element of training will ever make someone fully <i>compos mentis</i>, as it were, in terms of what to do when faced by someone pointing a gun.  However, we do as much as we can to get pharmacists to talk to their staff about what to do in the event of a robbery.<br/><br/>Deputy Billy Kelleher also asked how we helped staff who had been through the psychological trauma of a robbery.  We have a link with VHI under which it provides a private and confidential telephone line which any member of the IPU can call to arrange counselling.  The matter can also be dealt with by the particular pharmacist speaking to people locally.  We know that those who have used the VHI service the IPU provides as part of membership are glad that it is available.  Sadly, accessing such a service through the Health Service Executive or the public health system would probably take too long.  It is good, therefore, that we can offer this service to our members.<br/><br/>Deputy Billy Kelleher asked a good question about the types of criminal we encountered and whether they were professional criminals or desperate individuals looking for drugs.  The Irish Pharmacy Union made a submission in the previous D&aacute;il to the joint committee with responsibility for justice matters.  We indicated that we agreed with decriminalisation of the possession of small amounts of drugs.  International experience shows that people become engaged in petty crime because they are found in possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use.  They then enter the revolving doors of the criminal justice system and are unable to access the health services they need.  They are entering the judicial system when they should probably be entering the health system. <br/><br/>To respond to the Deputy's question on the reporting of crime, I have experienced instances of shoplifting and so forth.  On one particular occasion, a young couple entered my shop and were in the process of stealing cosmetics from me.  In the ensuing altercation I was punched, spat at and kicked by the girl, rather than the guy.  I called the police who knew who the couple were.  Curiously, one of the garda&iacute; asked me if she could view CCTV recordings for the three hours preceding the incident.  When I asked why she needed this material, she replied that it was in case I had said anything to the person who had kicked, spat at and punched me that might have offended her.  Despite having 20 years' experience as a community pharmacist in Dungarvan, I had to prove I had not said something which could have offended the young girl who had come into the shop to steal from me.  When the case eventually went to court, I was advised by the Garda that the girl would plead to a lesser charge of affray, rather than assault.  I asked what would happen if I sought to have her charged with assault - I had been assaulted - but was advised by a garda that I would need to take a day off work and employ a locum pharmacist at considerable expense while I was away from my business for the day.  Ultimately, the perpetrator would probably say she had a headache and did not want to go through the trauma of having to see me, which could mean that the case would be thrown out or not proceed.</p><p>The Garda told me to take her advice and let her plead to a roll-over charge, in which two or three charges are taken together.  She will plead guilty and the statistics will show that a crime has been solved.  I do not know if the woman did any time or had to answer for what she had done in my pharmacy on that day.  The incentive is not there for a pharmacist because we have to have supervising pharmacists' cover in the pharmacy for us to go to court for something that might not happen at all.</p></speech>

There are 1,850 pharmacies in the country and 950, roughly half, dispense methadone.  In the majority of these pharmacies, the regular patients do not even know that methadone is dispensed there.  In isolated or deprived areas where there are methadone clinics in pharmacies, and where patients interact well with a programme, anecdotal evidence is that petty crime levels are lower because people do not use street drugs.</p></speech>

We have an annual audit and when we renew our insurance, they come in and check everything, from how good our cameras are to the locks and the safes.  I moved from one shop 17 years ago to another which had 11.5 mm banded glass in the windows.  On the day I moved in a square was cut in the glass to see how deep it was and, that night, the phone lines were cut to see if I had a radio alarm.  That is what we are up against.

I am 99% more likely to be robbed during the day than at night because of the security measures I take at night.  Every single night we clear out the windows and clear out a lot of stock from the shop and put it into safes.  When a jeweller dresses their shop in the morning, they are putting their stock back out.  It takes an hour in the morning and three quarters of an hour in the evening.  We are most vulnerable when we are filling safes, when they are open and everything is stacked nicely for whoever wants to come in and rob the shop.  The professional will rob the shop during the day because it is far easier as he can get access to everything.  Security systems are so good now that they find it more and more difficult to access a shop at night.  With our steel roofs, we are virtually a safe.</p></speech>

If a person continually puts in claims, it will either be too expensive or the company will not insure him or her whatsoever.

Mr. Curran called for the segregated recording of business crimes.  I have been told by community groups that they feel disheartened about reporting crimes to garda&iacute; but they need to continue to do so.  At the political level, crime statistics need to be recorded to identify black spots, etc.  If something is brought to my attention I can put down questions asking for the statistics.  I also understand there is a person behind the statistics.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses flesh out the points they made about the decriminalisation of small amounts of drugs?  This is connected to petty crime.  Have studies been carried out into this suggestion?  Can the statistics be benchmarked against other areas?  The counterargument is that people progress from one form of chemical dependency to a deeper form of dependency.</p> <p>  As part of the action plan for rural Ireland, CCTV is being rolled out in a number of different towns, including in my own area.  Have the organisations been consulted by the local authorities about the positioning of these cameras?  When I was growing up, banks were the target for crime and there was a lot of security in a bank, although there is not so much now as many transactions take place electronically.  There now seems to be a shift towards luxury products or chemicals.  Are there differences in the way luxury items and chemicals are pursued?</p></speech>

There is no legislation to stop a five year old kid taking his mother's wedding ring and going into a shop to get cash for it.</p><p>We met with the Department of Justice and Equality a number of years ago and suggested that such shops offer cheques for gold rather than cash for gold because cheques are traceable and one must have a bank account with a name and address in order to lodge them.  A person selling five or six rings to a shop would be traceable.  There is a sign in my shop which states that we do not buy gold and that is because there is no legislation governing its purchase or that of other precious metals.  All of these points must be considered.  Some quite easy options, such as the proposed implementation of the cheques for gold measure six years ago, would have prevented many house break-ins and meant that many jewellers would not have been so easily targeted for what people can very quickly get rid of in another shop.</p></speech>

Two other representatives and I met his departmental officials and gave them a list of ten items which we recommended for implementation, the first of which was the cheques for gold proposal.  They thought it was wonderful.  However, we did not receive any feedback after the meeting.</p> <p>  We recently tried to contact the Revenue Commissioners.  We have been sending it emails for seven months regarding an idea of ours relating to things being smuggled into the country.  It responded to say that a certain person would phone us within the week regarding VAT on imports.  If one buys a high-value item anywhere in the world and wishes to have it insured in Ireland, Irish insurance companies will insist on it being valued here.  We recommended the imposition of a charge similar to the vehicle registration tax, VRT, whereby one must register one's car when one brings it across the Border, on jewellery, paintings and other high-value items, which would entitle the importer to a registration certificate for the item.  If one wished to sell the item, one would have to produce the certificate stating that the duty had been paid, and it could not be insured unless the duty had been paid.  That is a very simple way of addressing this issue which would bring in a lot of revenue for the Exchequer.  We have sent numerous emails to Revenue but have not heard back from it.  If I owed it VAT, I would hear from it very quickly.  It is quite disheartening.</p></speech>

We know that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is under a lot of pressure to do its job and is up against it within the judicial system.  It is a professional law enforcement agency and knows its punters as we know our patients in our pharmacies.  The Garda has no legal discretion as to whether to arrest or not arrest a person who has a small amount of cannabis for personal use, for example.  When the joint justice committee of the previous D&aacute;il considered how other jurisdictions deal with this issue, it recognised that the system in Portugal works best.  The amount of petty crime there has decreased because people are not sucked into a world of criminality.  A criminal record for drug use stays with a person for life, and that person then starts to move towards criminality rather than the ordinary life we would wish for people to have.  It also diverts people away from a healthcare system because they have been labelled as criminals.  That is not to say that people there do not have an interaction with the judiciary but, rather, that they are assessed on medical need rather than by the judiciary.  It is a big and complex issue and it is probably fair to say that no jurisdiction has completely gotten on top of it.  However, in countries such as Holland, Sweden, Switzerland and Portugal where the healthcare approach has been taken fewer teenagers use illicit drugs and fewer persons die of overdoses or have problem addictions.</p></speech>

I understood that the cost of doing business is the topic under discussion, so I might make a few general comments on that.</p> <p>  Does crime predominantly affect pharmacies in cities and towns rather than those in rural areas, such as mine in north Kerry?  Anecdotally, rural pharmacies are not affected by crime to the same extent as those in towns and cities.  Listening to the story told by Ms Horan, I tried to imagine something similar happening in my or any other pharmacy.  It must have been an horrific ordeal.  Having heard of her experience, I will try to avail of the training that is available for staff because I have not yet done so.  Many rural pharmacies would, perhaps, be well advised to take up that offering because an experience such as that endured by Ms Horan would leave a pharmacist and his or her staff very traumatised.</p> <p>  As regards the continually evolving issue of data protection, do the witnesses envisage any problems in that regard in terms of the sharing of CCTV footage and so on to aid the investigation of crime?  Could that be an issue for pharmacists and, if so, should that be clarified?</p> <p>  I was struck by how the person staked out the premises in the morning and later carried out the crime.  Are repeat offenders responsible for many such crimes?  Are the same people repeatedly doing the same thing?  Would it be possible for a pharmacists' body or union to consider a general bar on repeat offenders going into pharmacies?  Those with a criminal record might be entitled to enter a pharmacy.  They may have to make an appointment or similar to do so.</p> <p>  The cost of doing business involves expenses such as insurance, rates, rent, ESB bills, computer systems, backup for the computer systems, packaging and data protection.  We were last week issued with letters relating to Garda vetting.  There is continual pressure on businesses in terms of costs and there no longer seems to be an opportunity to recover cost.</p> <p>  Is there any sign of a reversal of the FEMPI cuts that were imposed on all pharmacies?  I asked a question last week relating to GP issues.  Pay restoration following FEMPI for most, if not all, public servants, such as teachers, garda&iacute;, politicians and so on has begun but no progress seems to have been made on pay restoration for GPs or pharmacists.  Has any progress been made in that regard or is something preventing that from happening?</p><p>Such restoration would prove beneficial because we provide a very valuable service.</p><p> Last year, at the IPU conference reference was made to a study conducted in either the UK or Canada on the impact of not having a pharmacy as a first line of care for many people.  The study concluded that the payments we receive would fade into insignificance if we did not exist in the first place.  That fact should be conveyed.  Even though I am a pharmacist I wish to state that pharmacists provide a very valuable service and need more recognition. </p><p> In terms of crime, I have closed circuit television, CCTV, operating on my premises.  Before installing the system I talked to the publican who runs a business across the road from my pharmacy.  I did so in order to ensure that we cover as much area as possible so that if something happens and the criminals park their vehicle opposite his place that we can link in.  Have community police linked as many businesses as possible on a street or in an area in order to maximise coverage?  If so, the systems would provide enough recordings of the criminal activity to secure a conviction.  I shall reiterate the simple suggestions of more visible policing, fast responses and tougher sentencing.  I believe we should have more visible policing, in particular.  If garda&iacute; patrol the streets then there is less chance of something happening like what happened to Ms Horan.  The presence of a garda would act as a preventative measure.  </p></speech>

A consultancy company called Tonic Consultancy was specifically engaged to consider this matter and concluded that to comply with pharmacy-specific legislation, for Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, requirements, cost on average &euro;20,000 per pharmacy per annum.  That is an additional cost that would not be imposed on other retail businesses.  That cost does not include maintaining computerised patient medication record systems, which cost a minimum of &euro;3,000, as Deputy Brassil is probably aware.</p> <p>  Another big issue is registration costs.  Pharmacists must pay PSI registration costs, which are well in excess of the amount charged internationally.  In Ireland it costs &euro;3,325 to register a pharmacy the first time yet the equivalent fee in the UK or across the Border is &euro;250.  A pharmacist must also register and the typical annual cost is &euro;540 the first time and &euro;380 annually thereafter, which is a significant cost.  If one is a pharmacist who wishes to operate a pharmacy business then before one opens the door one must pay &euro;3,000 per year to simply register with the PSI.</p></speech>

Our survey did not specifically analyse the situation in provincial towns.  We surveyed different regions and discovered that, on average, 79% of pharmacies nationally were the victims of crime.  The figure was 89% in the eastern region, which is a region that is more urban dominated.  In the south east we found that 92% of pharmacies were the victims of crime.  The lowest figure of 56% was in the north west, next was the midlands at 69%, the mid-west at 84% and the south was 75%.  There was not a massive variation in percentages.

I know that the perpetrators of previous robberies were repeat offenders because the police recognised them.  For one robbery in my pharmacy a guy entered the premises wearing a balaclava and wielded a knife.  He moved towards the controlled drugs safe and as he left he asked to shake everybody's hands in the pharmacy.  He wore gloves but he said: "You know, Ann, remember to tell the police that I did not hurt anybody."  The police said that the perpetrator was in and out of the prison system, expects to be caught and does not want to get a maximum sentence.  I mean the perpetrator understands the categories of crime for which he can be sentenced.</p></speech>

I learned that on another occasion the first guy had put a sawn-off shotgun in the window of a police car and pulled the trigger but, thankfully, the trigger jammed.  The same guy had beaten up an elderly woman in a shop in Sutton during an earlier robbery.  He had been caught quite a few times before.

Two people had to man the floor at all times.  Even if somebody went into the back office to put a battery in a watch one was always conscious of security.  Like Ms Horan said about working in the pharmacy where she was attacked, one constantly feels uneasy and must watch everyone who enters the premises.</p> <p>  I shall recount an incident in which, thankfully, I was not injured.  The minute I saw a particular man come in the door of the short I knew I was in trouble.  He asked to look at some engagement rings that were displayed in the window.  I specifically remember asking him whether he wanted to see rings containing white or yellow gold and he said platinum.  I told him that we did not stock platinum rings even though we did.  To cut a long story short, I took the cheapest tray of silver rings from underneath the display.  It was obvious to me that he was high on something but at the same time one is obliged to serve the customer.  </p></speech>

The tray contained silver rings and a few rings in white gold and cubic zirconia, CZ, rings so they were not highly valuable.  The average value of each ring was probably &euro;200.  I placed the tray on the counter.</p><p>He got two rings.  I made a great racket.  I actually followed him.  A guy outside tackled him.  The Garda was called.  We got the two rings back.  Afterwards the garda&iacute; came back in and reprimanded me because when they searched him, they discovered he had a knife.  It was an automatic reaction that kicks in when people try to save their stock.  It can be the best-dressed person whom one might think could buy half the stock, who needs to be watched.  It is a horrible situation to be in.  Obviously jewellers depend on the public to come to their shop but because they are selling high-value items, they must be constantly be aware.</p></speech>

The credit union next to me has a buzzer on the door and has people behind glass panels.  However, that would be detrimental to how a pharmacy works.  A huge portion of my time would be spent on consultations with people.  People come in casually and ask for my opinion on something or they might be worried about something.  That patient would not come into a pharmacy.  People would only come in if they were definitely going to buy something or they had a prescription.</p></speech>

We also would lose the personal touch and would lose the consultation.  All pharmacies now have consultation rooms so we can spend some minutes discussing a specific concern a patient might have.  One would lose all that.  A buzzer does not guarantee that someone who is planning on robbing the pharmacy will not come in.  A pharmacist who works for me also works for another pharmacy in Clondalkin.  Around Christmas a guy buzzed the door at 6 p.m.  The staff looked at the CCTV and saw he was wearing a baseball cap but they thought he looked fine and let him in.  He had a shopping bag that contained a hatchet.  He was looking for money from the till.  They had buzzed him in.  Nothing guarantees security.</p></speech>

The advice I have been given is that provided I state in my pharmacy that I am using recording equipment and that the person knows or should know they are being recorded in what they do, it does not statutorily affect them that there is a recorded image of them.  If somebody comes to me and says, "I am not comfortable that you are recording me", I will then say to them, "Well, you may be more comfortable going to another pharmacy that does not have it."  I do not know if there is one.  That is my understanding regarding CCTV.</p> <p>  As all pharmacists do, we have a very good rapport with local crime prevention officers and with the Garda in general in local communities.  Members of the Garda often come to us to see if we have footage from a previous night.  I just let them have it because they have complete access in law to the street-facing cameras that look out at the public.  Along with other businesses we help one another.  We try to co-ordinate as best we can as to where those cameras are.</p> <p>  Deputy Brassil asked a very good question about the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI.  The headline figure I can give is that pharmacy has given up &euro;2.2 billion since those cuts were introduced.  The headline figure of the totality of the cuts that pharmacy has suffered in that time is &euro;3.1 billion.  I am very disappointed that we have had no engagement with the Minister for Health, the Department of Finance or any Government officials about the unwinding of FEMPI.</p> <p>  The IPU has offered the Department of Health at least 12 different ideas to make the healthcare system better and to save money for the healthcare system.  Sadly we have only been able to advance on one of those, which is the access for patients to emergency hormonal contraception in the pharmacy, irrespective of whether they are public or private patients.  That is a great advance, but pharmacists can do many more things to add value to the healthcare system because we know the pinch points are with GPs and in accident and emergency departments.  We know we can do much more but it can only be done in the context of paying us properly for what do currently.  The pharmacies that are most affected by the FEMPI cuts are not the pharmacies on high streets or in affluent areas; they are the pharmacies that are needed most by those local communities that have difficulty in accessing healthcare, namely, rural pharmacies, pharmacies in deprived areas and pharmacies in isolated areas.</p> <p>  I would love to be able to tell the Deputy that we were engaged in a process about the unwinding of FEMPI, which we have been promised and which exists for all other people whose take-home pay was cut by FEMPI, but it has not happened yet.  We are hopeful because the Minister has promised we will have an engagement before the end of the year.</p></speech>

There are 96 million interactions between Irish people and their pharmacists.  On average people see their pharmacist 13 times a year.  As community pharmacists, every day we listen to people who are hugely frustrated at not being able to access very simple healthcare.  We have come up with really good ideas which are only a reflection of international best practice that can save money and increase access to healthcare, which then has the downstream effect of not making things more complicated later on where we can actually deliver.  It is hugely frustrating that we have not got the traction that we believe Irish patients deserve.</p></speech>

Sometimes other committees are scheduled at the same time.  I was in another committee room next door.</p> <p>  I have read the submission.  I am shocked to hear of stabbings and knives being held to people's necks.  I cannot believe it is that bad.  I come from a rural constituency in County Mayo and have not heard such reports.  That type of crime may be more prevalent in some of the cities.  However, I have certainly heard of the theft of goods from many local pharmacies.  It is a daily or weekly occurrence that cosmetics, fake tan and other things that are quite expensive are stolen.  Unlike in clothing shops, in a pharmacy it is not practical to put a security tag on everything.  Are State supports available to help pharmacists prevent against these things and protect themselves?  Does the IPU offer any supports?  I know it has made submissions about more visible policing and tougher sentencing, with which I agree.  Can the pharmacy community do anything for itself, on which it might need help, to try to protect premises from these occurrences?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe the increase in crime against pharmacies will discourage people from entering the profession?  Would they advise their sons and daughters to follow in their footsteps and take over if they have had a very difficult time in running their business?  Will it impact on future service?</p></speech>

We often have representatives on the road who visit pharmacies and provide advice.  It is a two-pronged approach, providing advice and going out externally in an effort to support pharmacists on the ground.  We are not aware of any specific State support which is available.  </p></speech>

It is now harder for pharmacists for find locums.  A higher proportion of pharmacy graduates do not want to work in community pharmacy and are working in hospitals and industry.  This is not the only reason but it is a factor for it being a less attractive career than it was.  My children would not think positive things about pharmacy after that raid.</p></speech>

I have a trade, I do all my own watch repairs, jewellery repairs, valuations and so on.  It is still very tough in retail, which is due to a combination of many things.  There are all the overheads, to which the robberies and so on are added.  I have two sons, 21 and 17 years, and I would not encourage them into this business in a million years.  I love it and am passionate about it but between online shopping, things being bought abroad and generally how tough retail is, if it was not for the services that I provide, I would be gone as a retailer a long time ago.  I do not see a future for my lads in that trade.</p> <p>  Also, as I said earlier, I had six days holidays last year which was split over three weekends.  I work six days a week.  I am the secretary treasurer of an association that supplements my income.  It is not easy.  There are issues with banking.  We are told that banks are giving loans to small and medium enterprises but as far as I am concerned that is rubbish.  I say that because banks are removing overdraft facilities from businesses, putting them on term loans and calling it new business.  They are telling politicians that they are doing new business with small and medium sized enterprises.  The banks are doing nothing for us.  I own my own property but were I to walk into a bank tomorrow to ask for a &euro;20,000 loan, I guarantee I would be refused, even though I have very good stock and a healthy business I am running at a profit.  It is not a huge profit but it is a healthy business.  There is no money out there to be lent to small retail businesses.  Everything is smoke and mirrors as far as I am concerned, and I hear this across the board, not only among jewellers.  I have a friend who runs a hardware store.  It is a family business which has been around for over 100 years.  When he leaves, which will probably be in around five or six years, that will be the end of the family business because he would not have his daughters or his son go into it.  That is a really sad reflection on retail.  When we are all gone, people will scratch their heads and say there are no more retail business around and will ask what happened.  All they will have is big superstores or online shopping.  There will be no service industry whatever.</p></speech>

Some 80% are aware of the service and about the same percentage of members use it.  Perhaps more should be done on that area, where one has a service that appears to be good.  Some members in different areas have said that the crime prevention officers, CPOs, are fairly thin on the ground but if the service is good, it should be looked at.  It would be a positive move to have more CPOs available and more interaction with them.</p></speech>

From a continuity of supply perspective, 60% of medicines on my shelf or that of Ms Horan are made, labelled or boxed in the United Kingdom.  Overall, 80% of the drugs in our pharmacies are transited through the United Kingdom, so there is an extra 20% on that figure.  We saw that the snowstorm at the beginning of March caused a huge disruption in the delivery of everything but unfortunately people seemed to be able to get bread more quickly than they could get medicines.  The supply chain is very fragile because it is so lean.  Because of the FEMPI cuts imposed on us, we cannot hold the stock.  FEMPI cuts were also imposed on wholesalers who now no longer hold two weeks or a month's worth of stock, stock is now measured in days.  We have considerable fear in respect of Brexit regarding the continuity of supply.  There is a broader question of how it will affect the economy but specifically from a pharmacy perspective we are very worried, first about continuity of supply and second, that as the only English-speaking member of the European Union, we perceive much of our product here as being overspill from the UK market.  As the only English-speaking member of the EU the cost of medicines will increase if it costs more to do business here, relabelling and repacking medicines for another jurisdiction.</p></speech>

We have a very good rapport with our wholesalers.  It means there are extra checks and balances around that to make sure that all the stock that is ordered arrives and that any discrepancies are alerted very quickly.  There are also very lethal controlled drugs in those vans, as they go around the country.</p> <p>  On another thing to note on Brexit, I qualified in the United Kingdom and came back to Ireland to practice.  It was seamless to do so.  We know of 60 to 90 Irish undergraduates who are studying in the United Kingdom each year.  We need to know that those early career pharmacists will be able to practice pharmacy in Ireland.  </p></speech>

We have asked our members to look inward at Irish manufacturers and to encourage young Irish people to develop products we can sell rather than looking overseas.  We are also looking to Germany and France and similar places where we hope we can develop a good relationship.  There will be implications.

The Chairman was talking about crime, we think it is a crime that we are paying 23% and they are paying 20% when they go across the Border.  That is a small charge but one should also take into account that the overheads for running a business are much less there than they are here, with rates and everything else.</p> <p>  It can be flipped both ways.  There are a lot of negatives.  We have many educational things which happen in the UK, but we are also trying to do many things here ourselves now.  Overall, it will not be as bad because we are a member of the EU.  </p></speech>

I can associate entirely with what Mr. Duggan said about his children and whether he would let them consider going into business.</p><p>What I have learned since becoming a Senator is that in Leinster House we talk the talk but the rubber does not hit the road.  I would welcome a comment from the witnesses on those issues.  I apologise in advance if they have already responded on them.</p><p> Following on from research on the small and medium enterprise sector, which is being conducted at my behalf, what I am hearing from the SME sector is that the key issues for it is the cost of doing business, insurance, rates and access to finance, which as already mentioned is a huge issue.  It is not true to say that the finance is available: it is not.  The terms and conditions to access finance are practically impossible to meet such that a person would have to sell his or her soul to get it.  In the Celtic tiger era the banks were making a margin of about 1.5% over prime.  Now, that margin is between 3% and 4%, which means it has more than doubled.  There is little or no talk about this.  I would welcome the witnesses' comments on the issue and also on staff recruitment.  </p><p> Mr. Connolly mentioned that pharmacists are going elsewhere, as is the case with every industry in the SME sector.  As the larger companies can offer better terms and conditions they are cherry-picking graduates in advance of their going into small businesses.  According to the statistics, there are 248,344 SMEs in Ireland, which between them employ approximately 1 million people, which is a lot of small business and a lot of employees but we are still behind the curve from an EU perspective.  The EU Commission strongly supports SMEs.  In Ireland, we have been behind the curve in this regard.  </p><p> At a meeting last week with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation the officials set out what they are doing, particularly in regard to Brexit, and two or three weeks ago they sent documentation in this regard to all Deputies and Senators.  The Department is being very proactive but we need a lot more of it.  I am very concerned about the future of the pharmacy industry in Ireland, for a couple of reasons.  Owing to consolidation, small pharmacies are being squeezed out.  A couple of weeks ago a large Dublin pharmacy announced its plans to further consolidate.  It is becoming tougher for small operators to do business.  They cannot buy in bulk and get the same discounts as the large operators.  Many of the UK pharmacies are setting up here.  I would welcome a comment on whether Brexit will impact on the large UK pharmacies based in Ireland remaining here, if the cost of doing business will increase and if it will affect smaller operators.  I think it will have an effect on small operators.  The online pharmacy sector is also making it difficult for smaller operators to do business.  I would welcome the witnesses' thoughts on this issue.</p><p> As the witnesses will have noted, I am very passionate about this area.  We regularly introduce legislation in the D&aacute;il and Seanad which has serious unintended negative consequences for SMEs.  I ask that this committee do some work on the effects of that legislation on small and medium-sized businesses.  I have been a Senator for two years and as far as I am aware there has been no discussion on the effects of various pieces of legislation on SMEs.  I am involved in this space and my business has been hit many times with an tsunami that has screwed it up.  If some my of questions have been already answered the witnesses need not respond again if they do not want to.</p></speech>

At the time, I did not know anything about carer's leave but I learned that I was legally obliged to allow her to take it and I also had to keep her job open for her.  As such, I could not offer her replacement permanent employment.  As this lady was expecting a baby, she also took a break in carer's leave and went on maternity leave and was out of the shop for three years.  She did not come back and, thankfully, I had staff in place that I had trained, as I had trained her.  Legislative provisions such as this do not serve small business.  It may be suited to the Civil Service but not a small family shop.  It does not make any sense.</p> <p>  On SMEs, the agriculture sector is represented by a Minister and two Ministers of State.  There is nobody representing retail in Ireland, which is a crying shame.      </p></speech>

The recruitment issue of which he spoke has been already addressed and the consequences for SMEs has been handled nicely by Mr. Duggan.  I will speak to the make-up of community pharmacies, the ownership of same and on Brexit.</p> <p>  I am a third generation pharmacist.  My grandmother qualified as a pharmacist in 1925.  She should have qualified in 1922 but there were a few things going on in the make-up of our State at that time.  Every generation of pharmacists, retailers, businesspeople and entrepreneurs have to develop new ideas to suit the new circumstances in which they find themselves.  I am very proud that pharmacists are entrepreneurs.  We use ingenuity and our business practice.  What we use most is the rapport that we have with our patients in our communities.  The most liberal laws around the ownership and operation of pharmacies in the world are in Ireland.  Anybody can open up a pharmacy anywhere.  Across Europe a pharmacy may only be owned by a pharmacist and he or she is only allowed to open a pharmacy in an area where there is a demonstrable need for such a service.  As such, in terms of investment in a community that does not have a service, a pharmacist would have security of tenure.  We have none of that in Ireland.  </p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh spoke about international ownership of pharmacies in Ireland.</p><p>Interestingly, international ownership sits very well with the ownership model that Ms Horan or I use, whereby we own our own pharmacies.  Looking at the statistics around pharmacy ownership in Ireland as reflected in our membership, roughly 15% of pharmacies are owned by public limited companies, plcs, which probably have an international flavour.  The committee members will probably know what firms I mean without naming them.  Some 85% of pharmacies are owned by people like Ms Horan and myself or our families.  Believe it or not, I actually think that is a good mix.  The Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, represents all types of pharmacies with all types of ownership models.  I am very happy to be the president of an organisation like that because I think we can speak with one voice to legislators here in Leinster House and to the Department of Health when it comes to driving change.</p><p> I will be very specific about the question of what we can do to adapt.  A pharmacist can pick up the phone to the Irish Pharmacy Union and speak to Mr. Darren Kelly, a colleague of Mr. Curran.  Mr. Kelly will come to the business and carry out a retail review.  He will start out on the street and go from the front door to the back door.  He will look at the books and advise that the business needs to do more of this and less of that, or to move particular products to a certain area of the shop.  Mr. Kelly does three of those reviews a week.  He is very busy with that and there is a huge uptake.  When we run courses on management and on how to be a better retailer we see a huge uptake on the part of community pharmacists.  There is still an ingenuity there.  There is a spirit of entrepreneurialism and of not giving up.</p><p> In luxury items such as perfumes, we are starting to see a leakage to online purchasing, or purchasing in airports where customers do not have to pay VAT.  We have to suffer the consequence of that.  I will not go into that, because I am sure it has been addressed by other witnesses who have addressed the committee.  Those retailers do not pay rates or VAT.  Nothing comes back into local communities like Ms Horan's and my own.  It can be very frustrating when someone comes into my business with a broken bottle of perfume to see if I will swap it for a new one when they bought the bottle in the duty-free in Dubai or wherever they were.  To answer the question very specifically, we are certainly under the pump, just as everybody else is.  That is particularly the case with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, FEMPI.  We have no vision of when they will be unwound or what unwinding looks like.  It is hugely frustrating to be asking for the ability to add value back into the system when we do not get a reply from the Department.  We have put 13 different proposals forward and we have not had meaningful engagement on any of them bar one.  We are frustrated, but we are here to tell the committee that we can do more.  We can add more back into our communities from a business perspective and from a healthcare perspective.  </p></speech>

I will not go so far as to say that I am speaking off the top of my head, but I would say the Senator is correct.  We have data, because we do an annual review of the sector in which anonymous data is collected from sample groups of pharmacies.  I think Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh is probably right that particular brackets or pharmacies of a particular size may be coalescing around a different turnover model than Ms Horan or I might have.  The locations where those pharmacies are found might be a little bit different.  However, that is not to say that one is better than the other-----</p></speech>

We know that where pharmacies are likely to open is not where the healthcare need is highest.  It is where the footfall is highest.  Pharmacists make a living and get a return on investment on products that are not bought by people who do not have the consumer spend seen in more affluent areas.  We will see what is termed "honeypotting".</p></speech>

Concessions on rates and so on were given where a lot of units closed.  We cannot knock that.  I can understand the witnesses' point of view, but the local authorities were just trying to encourage business, especially in inner cities and towns.  It is important that the main streets are not empty.  I can take Ms Horan's point.  A pharmacy may be there for a long time, doing all the hard slogging, when somebody sees it is doing well and opens beside it.  That is the nature of business.</p></speech>

I think it is safe to say that the worst is over, but the retail trend has changed.  People, rightly, are much more discerning on what they will buy, and they are much more conscious of the value of their own money.  I see in my own business that what is most important now is the added value.  Where does Ms Horan's pharmacy or my own add value for the patient or the customer?  We see the most growth where we give most advice, either as pharmacists or through our trained staff, be that in beauty, cosmetics, nutrition or the different services that we offer.  I am glad to see that there is recognition of a high quality of service.  It is just not about penny-pinching and everything being cheaper.  That is a more realistic foundation on which to build retail.  However, we need the help of legislators when it comes to taxes and rates not being effective on the online businesses that are crucifying us.  As the committee will know from other retailers, if I display a bottle of perfume with the tester attached, somebody can come in, smell it, and decide to buy it for &euro;2 less online at home.</p></speech>

It is very disheartening when one sees the amount of trade one is losing on regular customers.
