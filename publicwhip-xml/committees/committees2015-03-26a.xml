Are these minutes agree?  Agreed.</p> <p>  At our last meeting there was an issue in regard to correspondence around HSBC.  The clerk, who was away on other business on the day, has confirmed that he was in touch with the chief executive's office of HSBC and had called them but unfortunately they did not take up the offer to attend the meeting.  So the correspondence may not have been there but the contact was indeed made and that was the response.</p> <p>  No. 3 is correspondence received since our meeting of Thursday, 5 March 2015. </p></speech>

They would not make themselves available.  They did not respond.  They basically said they would not be here.</p> <p>  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 2 March 2015, from Ms Julie Sinnamon, CEO of Enterprise Ireland.  It is a follow-up from the PAC meeting of 12 February 2015.  That correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p> <p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 4 March 2015, from Mr. Robert Watt re the minutes for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform re report 1, Review of Medical Card Eligibility, and report 2, Fixed Charge Processing System.  That is to be noted and published.</p><p>These are the replies to our reports; the majority of the recommendations of the committee have been accepted.</p><p> No. 3A.3, correspondence, dated 6 March 2015, from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Environment, Community and Local Government re follow up from our meeting on 5 February 2015, to be noted and published.</p></speech>

On page 5 of the letter there is a mechanism to deal with him.  The chart deals with the extent of the design, build and operate contracts in the water services sector for February 2015.  It gives a cost of &euro;123,045,700 for those contracts and breaks down the number of contracts, sites and how many are wastewater treatment and how many are water treatment contracts.</p><p>I asked all day for the total liability for the contracts.  The Secretary General is giving us the annual operating cost for 2015.  These are 20 year contracts.  In his letter he writes that it is not possible to provide a breakdown on a contract basis as the information in regard to the payments under individual contracts is commercially sensitive.  I had specifically asked that the information be provided to us even on a local authority basis to avoid that kind of problem.  The Secretary General could have been more helpful.  He was well able to give us the operating cost based on the 115 contracts <i>in situ</i>, broken down by region, the south, the east, the north west and the total.  All I am asking for is the total cost of those 115 contracts.  I do not need to know about the individual contracts for wastewater treatment plants in Ringsend, Portlaoise, Mullingar or Roscrea.  He was able to give us the information year by year on a regional basis.  I want the total liability on the same basis, urgently.</p><p>This dates from our meeting on 6 February.  I want this within seven days or I want the Secretary General to return here next Thursday for 15 minutes to explain why it is not here.  Seven weeks on we do not have the information we sought.  He said on the day he did not have it but he has been able to produce the operating annual costs.  I want to know the total liability in the format he has provided.  I will not dictate the format.  He has avoided the issue again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#C00300"><p>We will send the Secretary General the Official Report of the meeting and ask for an immediate response from him on that matter.</p> <p>  On No. No. 7, in that correspondence we asked for the unit cost of producing the litre of water.  In spite of the fact that it took almost half an A4 page to define no answer was given.  I thought that was a simple enough question to determine the cost.  As far as I can see there is nothing here but a lot of hot air.  I will ask again specifically for that cost.  It had nothing to do with the water lost.  We can calculate that afterwards.  We have not got the production costs.  I will remind the Secretary General of the question asked and the fact that it was not answered in spite of the waffle in that reply.  The other issue was the transfer of assets from the local authority.  It is listed here in terms of the book value.  I am bringing that to the attention of members.  We can consider it again in the context of the replies to the two questions.</p> <p>  No. 3A.4 correspondence, dated 9 March 2015, from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform re minute from Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform re composite reports arising from examination of (1) land sway arrangement; (2) State Pathology Building Project; (3) appointment of the Director of the National Gallery of Ireland and (4) Waterford Institute of Technology, to be noted and published. </p></speech>

I think we should discuss No. 4, lapses in controls at Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  The issues raised there had to do also with Carlow, Cork and Tralee.  We should put it on the agenda for our next meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#C00600"><p>There has been significant movement in regard to Carlow, Waterford, the HEA and education.  I understand the President of Waterford IT has left and is now working with the Higher Education Authority.  Mr. Michael Kelly who is carrying out a report on the merger between Waterford and Carlow ITs is probably finalising that work.  Would it be useful to invite Mr. Kelly to present to committee after he makes his report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#C00700"><p>I understand the report has to go to the Minister before it is available to us.  We have already agreed to bring back the Department and the HEA and we can ask them to invite in Mr. Kelly to discuss his report.  Then, we could perhaps bring into that discussion the report here relating to the WIT and the reports on the other institutes.  We are still awaiting the report from the Department on the Vocational Education Committees, which is before the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#C00800"><p>It would be useful to have Mr. Kelly come before us.  I believe the hearing we had with the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills woke some people up and that some issues were resolved after that hearing.  We should continue with that to bring this to a conclusion, if possible.  Having Mr. Kelly appear would be useful in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#C00900"><p>We do not have a date set for that meeting.  If we can find out when the report will be available after the Minister completes her examination of it, we can set an early date for that hearing.  We should also write to the Minister again in regard to the report on Cork VEC to ask when it will be laid before the House.</p> <p>  No. 3A.5 relates to correspondence dated 11 March 2015 from NAMA outlining the mediation process.  This will be noted and published.  No. 3A.6 is correspondence dated 4 March 2015 from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This is a follow-up to our meeting regarding Bord na gCon.  This is to be noted and published.  As we have now received replies from both the Department and Bord na gCon, I will ask the secretariat to proceed to draft a report on the matters covered in our examination of the topic.</p> <p>  No. 3A.7 concerns correspondence dated 16 March 2015 from Mr. Martin Shanahan, CEO of the IDA.  This is a follow-up from our meeting of 12 February and is to be noted and published.  No. 3A.8 is correspondence dated 19 March 2015 from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and is a follow-up to our meeting of 15 February 2015.</p><p>The correspondence is to be noted and published.<br/><br/>No. 3A.9 is correspondence, dated Monday, 23 March 2015, from the HSE on section 38 agencies.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  We will be able to have an in-depth discussion on this matter and other issues and the general accounts of the HSE next Thursday, 2 April.  We have indicated to the HSE that because of the number of items on the agenda the meeting may last a full day.  <br/><br/>No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated Monday, 23 February 2015, from Mr. Seamus Carroll regarding moneys owed for works carried out at Ennis General Hospital.  The committee has come across a number of these cases - Deputy Deasy referred to one such case - in relation to the payment of contractors and subcontractors.  This case involves Glenbeigh Construction which I understand is a firm that procures many public capital projects.  It appears that this small firm is losing out.  The State should not facilitate this.  The committee will again write to the HSE to ask it to review the case to see if steps could be taken which would result in the contractor being paid.  This is an issue across Departments where contracts are made available and something needs to be done to protect the small firms and individuals who end up doing this work in order that issue will not continue to arise.  The committee will write to the Department about it and will raise it again at next week's meeting.<br/><br/>No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated Tuesday, 3 March 2015, received from the HSE on the payment of allowances at St. James's Hospital.  The committee can discuss this issue next week with the HSE and will forward the correspondence to the Department of Education and Skills and the HEA to ensure salaries should not be paid to public servants for lecturing.  <br/><br/>No. 3B.3 is correspondence received from Ms Susan Gray, chairperson of PARC, the road safety group.  It concerns the recording of information by court clerks on drivers who are disqualified but who do not have their licences endorsed.  The correspondence is to be noted.  This matter was raised when we discussed the issue of penalty points.  We have made a recommendation which is being considered by the criminal justice working group, from which we should receive an update.  I propose that the committee request the secretariat to write to the group or the Minister to request an update on the matter.  <br/><br/>No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated Thursday, 5 <sup></sup>March 2015, received from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills.  It concerns the<b></b>review of spousal travel arrangements in F&Aacute;S in the period 2002 to 2008.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  I suggest the committee write to the Department and SOLAS to find out how it is planned to recoup the moneys owed.  A considerable amount of almost &euro;30,000 is involved and little progress has been made to date in collecting the money owed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#D00200"><p>It really is not good enough that such an important organisation should have operated in the manner it did for such a long period.  It is only now being brought to the committee's attention that most of the money has not been paid back.  The same seems to apply in a number of other State bodies.  The committee has seen that there is no proper policy being pursued in the HSE on travel or entertainment.  It is clearly not good enough that F&Aacute;S should have taken it on itself to provide the same services for its members' spouses as it did for its members in certain categories.  The committee needs to look at the issue on a broader basis and write to all of the agencies involved requesting them to examine their practices to ensure they are in compliance with proper standard practices.  This issue comes up from time to time in the case of the HSE, F&Aacute;S and other agencies.  In the case of F&Aacute;S, there is a legacy issue, it pertains also during the years in a number of agencies.  As well as ensuring the committee has it finally sorted out, I suggest it write to all bodies in receipt of public funds and that are using taxpayers' money to fund their operations to ensure they are compliant and that they write back to confirm the practices in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#D00400"><p>I know that in 2008 and 2010 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform took up this matter.  That Department might be a first port of call to see what progress it has made.  The committee can look at what action it took to deal with it.  Perhaps it might then revisit Deputy Joe Costello's proposal.</p> <p>Correspondence, dated Friday, 6 March 2015, has been received from Ms Eileen Creedon, Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  It concerns costs borne by the State in cases taken by the special investigations unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This is a holding matter, in respect of which Ms Creedon is going to give us some details.  We have a date set for representatives of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to come before the committee to deal with the issue.  It is relevant to the issue of costs and the committee want to have an understanding of how the office takes cases and the costs that arise.</p> <p>  No. 3B.6 is correspondence, dated Monday, 9 March 2015, received from NAMA.  It is a reply on the issue of access to contracts.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.       </p> <p>  No. 3B.7 is correspondence, dated Friday, 6 March 2015, received from Mr. Tom O&rsquo;Mahony, Secretary General, Department of Transport, Sport and Tourism on the Kilkenny central access road.  The correspondence is to be noted and forwarded to Ms Anne Marie Swift who raised the issue.  This is a matter for the local authority to which the committee will forward the correspondence and request a response.  </p> <p>  No. 3B.8 is correspondence, dated Wednesday, 11 March 2015, received from Professor Niamh Brennan concerning the DDDA and the Irish Glass Bottle site.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  I thank Professor Brennan for her submission and ask Members to take note of it, as it may be of interest to them in the context of today's hearing.</p> <p>  No. 3B.9  is correspondence, dated Wednesday, 11 March 2015, from Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, concerning vacant properties at fishery harbour centres.  The correspondence is to be noted and published and a copy forwarded to Mr. Rodney Gillen.  We are now in a position to report on the fishery harbour centres.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#D00500"><p>It appears that the number of vessel lifts at Howth shipyard was 43 in 2012, 39 in 2013 and 48 in 2014.  On average, the return in 2014 from each would have been about &euro;1,700.  This is described as an operational shipyard in which full marine repair facilities are provided.  If that is the average return from the 48 ships or boats that visited the yard in 2014, it seems that it did not do much more than lift up the boats.  There is no indication that substantial repairs were carried out, as the entire return for the 48 boats was &euro;84,000.  It does not seem as though that yard is undertaking major repairs.  May the committee obtain a breakdown of the size of the boats involved and the work that was done on these boats to determine if it was operating to full capacity because it certainly does not like that it was?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#D00600"><p>The figure represents the cost of vessel lifts.  The work to vessels is carried out by contractors, not the harbour.  Having said that, on the day the committee visited, it was quite clear that the yard was not operating to its full capability.  Contractors are also not being catered for in a way that one would expect to generate further business and prevent business from moving elsewhere.  It appears that in providing the information the underlining difficulty is being ignored - the attitude to the development of Howth Harbour.</p><p>With regard to the individuals in business whom we met at Howth there are significant questions regarding a number of matters that we need to deal with in the context of our report.  While that may be the response of the Department it certainly falls way short of what is required with regard to the response that the business people in that locality are asking for.  From looking at the different sites there the response falls far short of what a commercial operator might do in terms of the development of Howth.  There are lots of issues still to be dealt with and we can deal with these issues in the context of the report and raise the fact that there are many other issues at ports around the country of which we are aware.  Although it is in court now, the John Shine case is a typical example of how the State ignores the efforts of a businessman to conduct his business and at the same time to resolve issues.  It is no way to carry on a business, in my view.  The State has a lot to learn from the commercial world which it seems to continue to ignore.  </p><p> How long will it take for the report to be compiled?</p></speech>

I ask that we would pay particular attention to it because it is probably the best example I have seen to date of poor practice and poor commercial insights or poor commercial knowledge on the part of the State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#E00400"><p>I agree with the Chairman in so far as Howth is concerned and it is hard not to agree.  The situation might not be as bad with regard to the other State ports.  I did some checking with regard to Dunmore East where there are some vacant buildings and they are looking for leaseholds.  There is a difference of opinion among people who actually use the port as to the utilisation of certain buildings within the port but certainly it would not be as bad as Howth.</p> <p>  I am not familiar with the situation in the other four State ports but I spoke to the Minister about this after we had visited Howth.  I think it is fair to say that he has an open mind with regard to what the committee might report on.  My question is as to where we are going with this report.  Are we going to suggest that another State agency be involved in these properties to assist the Department when it comes to the utilisation of the vacant buildings?  Sometimes if one takes an adversarial attitude with the Department, one will not get anywhere, but there is probably an opportunity to get something done here.  That is the attitude that was registered.  What direction does the committee plan to take with regard to the buildings?</p></speech>

Some 48 boats is a lot of boats.  What sort of work was conducted on those boats?  Why did Howth have to bring in all that skilled work from outside?  It was suggested that other boats were not being catered for in Howth and had to go to other areas to be repaired.  I refer to the information in appendix B about the various sites and the stages of work, which shows that there are three properties in Howth which are ready to be considered for tender.  Have we any idea of the timescale?  I refer to table No. 2 which shows that five properties in Howth not currently in use are subject to legal, operational or planning considerations.  I suggest that we request a breakdown of the category of consideration, whether legal, operational or planning and the nature of the difficulty.  Such further material would be very useful before we make recommendations as to how to move forward.</p></speech>

In reply to Deputy Deasy's question, we visited Howth and we have had a hearing with the Department.  We will set out what we found and we will make recommendations arising from the input of members.  As with other reports we will set out our findings followed by our recommendations.  We will have a draft report in a couple of weeks with some recommendations.  The members can then decide on the tone and extent of the report.</p></speech>

There is probably an agreement that, in many cases, some of these buildings are vacant for too long and the processes involved are too lengthy.  If we were to collaborate with the Department I think some progress would be made.</p></speech>

If there was a collaborative effort and a willingness to co-operate, there might not be the conflicts between the Department and individuals.  Perhaps the Minister should reconsider the action being taken by the Department in relation to that particular case.  We should make that suggestion to the Minister, in view of his willingness, as mentioned by Deputy Deasy.  I think we should test his willingness.</p><p><b></b>No. 3C contains documents relating to today&rsquo;s committee meeting.

There does not seem to be any funding to commemorate the people who actually died.  Deputy Costello was involved in the conversation we had with the Secretary General, and what we asked was very clear.  We should go back and ask the Department what are its additional plans for the &euro;22 million.</p></speech>

The authority has a development remit and a planning role.</p> <p>  Members will recall previous hearings into the events surrounding the purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site in Poolbeg by a joint venture company, in which the authority was a partner.  The failure of the joint venture project resulted in significant losses for the authority, which contributed to very difficult financial challenges and gave rise to a major legal case against the authority.   Against this background, the Government announced its decision in May 2012 to dissolve the authority and transfer its planning and development functions to Dublin City Council.  Legislation will be required to give effect to this decision, and I understand this is being prepared.  The actual dissolution date has not yet been determined, and in the meantime, the authority has a transitional business plan in place to resolve the liabilities of the authority through the liquidation of assets, including the transfer of the relevant infrastructure, and to deal with any remaining litigation.</p> <p>  In 2013, the authority disposed of significant investment properties, resulting in a turnover of &euro;21 million, and reported an operating surplus of &euro;2.7 million for the year.  This compared to an operating deficit of &euro;5.7 million in 2012.</p> <p>  For 2013, the authority chose to change its accounting policy to show all fixed assets and certain investment assets that were previously held at nil value at their market value.  The 2012 comparatives have been restated to reflect the effect of the change in accounting policy on the prior period.  As a result of this adjustment, the 2012 net assets increased by &euro;5.2 million to &euro;10.2 million.  The 2013 net assets of the authority amounted to &euro;15.2 million.</p> <p>  The authority&rsquo;s liabilities decreased from &euro;24.4 million at end 2012 to &euro;12.7 million at end 2013, and this was funded through the proceeds of the sale of investment assets.  The authority continued to sell its investment properties throughout 2014 in order to meet its outstanding liabilities.</p> <p>  The 2013 financial statements were certified on the 23 December 2014, and a clear audit opinion was given.  However, on page 16 the audit certificate drew attention to the executive board&rsquo;s compliance statement, which discloses that the authority did not comply with public procurement guidelines in a number of instances.  My office is awaiting draft financial statements for 2014 from the authority.</p></speech>

I was appointed in March 2014 and I am on secondment from Dublin City Council.  I work with the authority two days per week.  I am joined by my colleague Mr. John Crawley, the authority&rsquo;s financial adviser.  We are here to discuss the 2013 annual report and financial statements and to bring the committee up to date on developments in the authority since we last appeared in February 2014.</p> <p>  Last week we submitted a briefing document to the committee, to which we will refer to this morning.  This briefing covers an update on the recommendations in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report 77, some details on the authority&rsquo;s financial position, and a report on the future development of the docklands.</p> <p>  On 31 May 2012, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to dissolve the authority.</p><p>A new council and executive board were appointed in June 2012 to the authority to oversee the transition.   The Minister envisaged that the authority would remain in place for a transitional period.  During that period the authority is required to wind up existing operations, prepare the transition to new arrangements and make recommendations to the Minister on appropriate structures for the future.  These structures should ensure the following: the docklands brand and international marketability as an attractive and prime location for investment; that high-value development is maintained and enhanced; that an appropriate fast-track planning regime remains in place; that the local community and the business sector continue to be involved in the regeneration project; and that job creation is facilitated. </p><p> In addition, the board has also considered and made recommendations to the Government on how best to achieve the Minister&rsquo;s key objectives for the future regeneration of the docklands in a way that the board considers will build on the positive elements of the authority&rsquo;s legacy in terms of social, physical and economic regeneration.  In this regard, following the Government's decision to wind up the authority but to retain an appropriate fast-track planning framework to complete the docklands project, a strategic development zone designation, SDZ, was proposed by the authority and Dublin City Council.  The Minister designated the city council as the development agency. On 16 May 2014 the SDZ was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and is now effective and operational.  Until such time as the authority is dissolved it continues to operate its section 25 planning function alongside the SDZ planning scheme. </p><p> The authority&rsquo;s board, executive and council have proposed the creation of a forum under the auspices of the city council to assist it in the regeneration of the docklands area.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht has considered the issue of the wind-up of the authority and in its recently published list of 16 recommendations is supportive of the creation of a consultative forum which we understand will be established on a statutory footing.  The authority has worked with the city council on the best operational model to be used going forward.  A docklands unit has now been established within the city council and is based in the authority&rsquo;s offices in Custom House Quay, ensuring that there continues to be a physical presence in the area to oversee the continued regeneration of the docklands. </p><p> A series of key objectives and associated risks were identified to implement the Government decision, as reported on in the 2013 annual statements and these are being addressed and resolved, where possible, in advance of dissolution.  As regards the current status of the authority, the legal mechanism for the wind-up is through a dissolution Act.  The authority has given significant input to the Department on the dissolution Bill which we understand is expected to be dealt with in the Oireachtas legislative programme during the current session.  In terms of wind-up of existing activities, the authority followed two key strategies, namely, the sale of assets to deal with remaining liabilities, where feasible, and the transfer of infrastructure to Dublin City Council.  In light of what I understand are the complexities in drafting some aspects of the dissolution Bill provisions, a new board was put in place from 1 January 2015.  This board is made up of three members from the previous board and five senior executives from the city council. </p><p> In summary, since the successful resolution of the Donatex case and the issues surrounding the Irish Glass Bottle site, the finances of the authority have been stabilised from a negative position of nearly &euro;200 million to an expected positive closing position of some millions.  This should be seen in the context of a very challenging legal environment.  A new fast-track planning mechanism has been put in place to support the delivery of 2,600 housing units and up to 366,000 sq. m of commercial property, which in turn will create up to 23,000 new jobs.  In the past week the first planning permission under the new SDZ scheme was granted by Dublin City Council marking the beginning of a new phase in the regeneration of Dublin docklands.   A framework for the local communities' continued involvement in the future regeneration of the docklands has been agreed.  Regarding the mandate given by the Minister to wind up the authority, I am pleased to report the work is almost complete.  My colleague and I are happy to deal with the committee&rsquo;s queries to the best of our knowledge and ability. </p></speech>

We received a statement from a previous chair, Professor Niamh Brennan, on this matter.  Mr. Clegg mentioned the special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding No. 77.  Professor Brennan, to quote one section in summary of what she had to say about her term as chair from 2009 to 2012, wrote:<blockquote><br /><br />I think it is a shame that the Dublin Docklands redevelopment project foundered on a single, high-risk, Irish Glass Bottle site throw of the dice, bringing the Docklands development authority from a cash-rich, successful organisation to the brink of insolvency and irretrievable reputational damage.  Irish taxpayers and the local Docklands community deserve better.</blockquote>I suppose she is not quite accurate once we go through No. 77, the special report and what Mr. Clegg has said himself in his own report, which he gave to us earlier.  It is clear that there is a total legacy of failure in the operation of the docklands authority from 1997 until roughly 2009.  There were issues of governance, financial matters and internal systems of financial control.  The board itself was not being informed about decisions that were taken; there was seemingly an internal cabal there.  There was a conflict of interests, with the CEO of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority going to Anglo Irish Bank straight from the docklands.</p><p>It seems as though the entire planning process was compromised by the development requirements with the result that, as Mr. Clegg says in his final remarks, the authority has now stabilised from a negative position of nearly &euro;200 million to a positive position.  Of course, the glass bottle site was the last throw of the dice and was a total disaster.  Could Mr. Clegg comment on that in the first instance?  What is his opinion on what happened with his predecessors in the job for a start, and on the operation of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority over a ten-year period or a little longer?  Does he agree with the summation I have given of the operation of the docklands?</p></speech>

I am in position as CEO since March 2014.  The reports the Deputy referred to predate my time with the authority.  However, I do note in the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report that the board chaired by Professor Brennan had implemented a recommendation and reviews of its planning and financial management systems.  That situation is in play to this day.  I can only comment on what I know myself in the time since the authority has been under by stewardship.</p></speech>

He says there was non-compliance with public procurement guidelines, despite the fact that this had been brought to the attention of the authority in 2010 and 2012.  Two consultants were engaged because of their previous knowledge in 2013 without any tender process.  These contracts amounted to &euro;116,383.  A third contract amounted to &euro;501,106 in 2013 and was the subject of a restrictive competitive tender process.  It was not advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union as required by the EU directives for contracts in excess of &euro;125,000.  Why did this procedure continue even though it had been brought to the attention of the authority by the Comptroller and Auditor General on a number of occasions beforehand?</p></speech>

The requirement for procuring a financial advisory service arose first in 2010 when the then finance director resigned.  There was an embargo on recruitment in the public service and the authority put out a tender for the provision of financial services.  This was done on three occasions, in May 2010, March 2013 and November 2014.  In each case, Crawley Business Consulting Limited was the successful candidate.</p> <p>  The procurement issue relating to March 2013 which is under review in our financial statements was that when the service was put in place, it was expected that the authority would be wound up eight months later.  The dissolution date at that time was November 2013 and any residual unfinished work would be carried over to the successor of the authority.  Due to circumstances beyond our control, the wind-up of the authority was delayed.  This was due to complications regarding significant planning matters.  In 2013, we were faced with the dissolution being extended to June 2014 and the board had to continue the orderly sale of assets and liabilities.  Had the wind-up taken place in November, these activities would have been carried out by the authority's successor. </p> <p>  During 2013, there was a greater workload on the authority.  This was when the authority was starting to dispose of its assets and vigorously working to collect moneys owing to it.  At the same time, the authority's staffing went from 15 down to four.  There was more work to be done, the authority was in wind-up mode and the staff were leaving.  Understandably, when staff knew the authority was to be wound up, they sought other jobs.  Therefore, given the short-term extension of the board, the financial services contract was not put out again to tender.  </p> <p>  When I came on board in March 2014, the deadline date for dissolution was June 2014 and we were working towards that date.  The wind-up did not take place in June 2014 and the dissolution date was extended to December 2014.  In August, I carried out a review of procurement compliance and put the service out to tender again.  I suppose what occurred is that the authority would have made the decision in 2014 that there would be a wind-up in November so it used a restricted procedure.  In hindsight, there is no doubt the better course of action would have been to go for an EU tender competition and we did that subsequently.  However, we need to look at the context at the time the decision was made in 2013.  The wind-up was to be in November, staff were leaving and there was additional work.  Also, the authority was operating in a complex legal environment.  It defended a &pound;100 million claim, the bankers were going to call in loans, it looked as if its overdraft facility would be withdrawn and it had to negotiate a new overdraft and it had to deal with the complexity of selling assets within the docklands.  This was a complex work environment.  All things considered -----</p></speech>

Clearly, over the years that complexity was not properly acknowledged through following good practice.  However, in 2012, the Comptroller and Auditor General brought this issue to the authority's attention, but in 2013 there was the same lack of procedure in regard to the tender and no proper tender was sought.  We are talking about over &euro;100,000 in one case and over &euro;500,000 in the other.  Once the Comptroller and Auditor General brought the issue to the attention of the authority, it should have responded automatically so that he would not have to bring it to our attention now again in the 2013 report.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to three tenders in his question.  One of the other two tenders related to VAT consulting services.  When we commenced the asset disposal programme in mid 2012, we reverted to the previous tax advisors who advised us, on the basis of the authority's records, when we acquired those assets.  In other words, the assets had been acquired over a period of time and we reverted to the previous tax advisors as we did not have in-house VAT experience.  When we went to the tax advisors we had previously procured, we discovered that a key person involved in the advice who had the particular corporate knowledge had left the organisation and set up her own business.</p> <p>  We followed the trail to her business.  At the time, we took the view that there were good technical reasons as to why we would operate that contract to a single economic operator.  We acknowledge that best practice was not followed by not putting it out to open tender.  However, we felt there was critical knowledge available and given the short timeframe we had available to sell the assets, we engaged the services of that person.  That person has been engaged to see out the remaining work.  There are no further instructions to be given to that person at this time.  In the event something new arises that is not particular to the past, we have now accessed the DCC tender panel where we can procure VAT services.</p> <p>  We had a second contract in regard to ducting networks which had been installed in the authority over the period 2000 to 2008.  A firm was procured for that piece of work.  In or around the time of the economic collapse, the authority put all expenditure on hold, including expenditure on the ducting network.  Unfortunately, the ducting network fell into some financial and operational disrepair as a result.  When I came on board, we took up that issue and reverted to the people who had been running the contract previously and asked them to finish out a piece of work.  We did not put that out to tender at that point because we felt they had the specific corporate knowledge.  Frankly, we did not have the records ourselves to be able to do the work.  Subsequently, when we got it under control, we put it out to tender and it is currently on a short-term tender, pending a strategic decision in conjunction with the SDZ as to what we want to do with ducting networking in the future.</p> <p>  In summary, we accept we did not follow best practice, but we were in a particular set of circumstances.</p></speech>

What is the current position in this regard given that some good work has been done to deal with the deficit so that there a surplus of approximately &euro;8 million in the authority?  I presume that the surplus will increase further as other assets are disposed of.  Is the Department still obliged to take on the responsibility for pensions?</p></speech>

While the authority was an operating authority it accounted for the liability on its own balance sheet.  That is not the norm in the public sector.  Normally in the public sector, pensions are accounted for on a pay-as-you-go basis.  The liability is still in the order of &euro;8 million.  On the wind-up of the authority, we started to close out issues of liability, among which were pensions and balance sheet adjustments, which I will refer to  later.  We asked the Department for guidance and it was agreed that pension scheme obligations would be taken over by the State.  Ultimately the decision as to where that is to rest remains outstanding but because it was to be taken over by the State we were no longer going to account for it on our balance sheet and we thus wrote it back.  The State is currently carrying a future pension liability of approximately &euro;8 million, based on the valuation from 2013, which will have to be met at some point in time.  Separately, it appears that the asset position of the authority will be in the order of several millions of euro, possibly as high as &euro;9 million.  As we are a State agency under the auspices of the Department, those proceeds go back to the Department, which will make the decisions on how they should be dealt with in the future.  We are still working with the Department and Dublin City Council, which will take over many of the responsibilities of the authority, to decide exactly where those liabilities will be met and how the assets can be used to fund them.  Approximately &euro;1.1 million of the liability of &euro;8 million will arise in the next five years and a further &euro;1.2 million will arise over the following ten years.  This is because the staff working in the authority were relatively young and, therefore, their deferral dates are quite far into the future.</p></speech>

There are serious concerns about standards followed on fire safety, etc.  How is that going to play out in terms of liabilities with the authority if faults are discovered?</p></speech>

This issue came to our attention in June 2014.  At the end of the day, fire safety is about the residents of Longboat Quay.  When we became aware of the issue we immediately appointed our own fire safety consultant in conjunction with the fire services department.  On the recommendation of the consultant we put fire marshals in place to ensure that a detection process is available in the event of any emergency and that people can be evacuated safely.  In working with the management company, we made sure that communication was entered into with residents.  A letter was sent from the management company to all owners and residents and Dublin Fire Brigade also sent a fire safety leaflet and a fact sheet outlining the key questions.  The next stage of work was the installation of fire alarms.  We have paid for the marshals and the fire alarms, and that work has just been completed.  Our immediate reaction was not to consider the liability issues but to make sure people were safe.  The main issue arising was a deficiency in the fire alarm system, which is in the process of being resolved.  We have put in place a good detection and evacuation process.  The next stage is to examine in detail the remaining deficiencies in each department.  This is a question of compartmentalisation, where fire proofing is done within individual units.  Through our fire safety consultant we are in the processing of assessing the extent of that work.  To date the authority has spent &euro;1 million to ensure people are safe in Longboat Quay and the next stage involves identifying the remaining work required.</p></speech>

I understand Longboat Quay is in receivership.  Mr. McNamara went into receivership.  Is it likely that the entire cost will fall on the authority and Dublin City Council in the same manner as the council had to pick up the tab for Priory Hall?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that the developer, the McNamara organisation, is gone.  There is no right of recourse to the developer.  We are currently quantifying the scale of the cost and investigating where the liability can arise.  Behind the scenes there are still some avenues that we can pursue.  As not everybody is gone, there is a right of recourse in some cases.  On behalf of the State we will follow any third party that should have been held accountable to ensure accountability.  Liability will rest somewhere between the State and the owners of the property in that development.</p></speech>

These are managed by management companies.  In most cases, professional managing agents have been engaged and they carry out their own investigations.  There are two developments in respect of which issues have been raised, one of which issues is around fire safety.  The management companies are, as we speak, actively managing this process effectively.</p></speech>

We are comfortable that we followed a process that allowed us to achieve a fair market value for the property.  The sale of this particular development arose in the context of the sales programme of the authority to cover its significant liabilities.  The code of practice for State bodies provides that in exceptional circumstances such bodies may follow a process outside of competitive tendering.  We accept that competitive tendering is the best practice.  We discussed this at the time with the National Procurement Office, which advised us that we needed to be clear in our objectives and the audit trail, and to ensure appropriate reporting in that regard, which we have done.  We engaged professional valuers, as did the people who purchased the property.  Between the two sets of valuers an open market price was arrived at.  This open market price was derived in late 2013.  There was a comparable property on the market at that time, in not dissimilar circumstances to this particular property and very close to it.  It sold for &euro;99 per sq. ft.  We achieved &euro;144 per sq. ft. for the property we sold.  We were comfortable that we did achieve the open market price, based on professional independent valuation and benchmarking it against a comparable sale that took place in or around the same time.  In terms of value for money, we are comfortable that we achieved that.</p></speech>

That was a reference to a draft proposal given to us by an insurance broker.  To be technically correct, it was not the insured value at that point in time.  What was more important to us was that we could establish what we considered to be the open market value of the property.  In this regard, we relied on professional advice and benchmarking.</p></speech>

This was a property that was on a strip of other properties that were subject to some compulsory purchase orders.  We had it in our mind at the time that those properties would all be acquired and levelled and a borderwalk-boulevard created.  That was not proceeded with because the authority ran out of funds to continue any development in or around that time.  Part of the CPO transaction at that point in time was that we were going to rehouse the people in the property.  However, we were not in a position to do that.</p></speech>

It is the site which is valuable and not the piece of property itself, which is an old warehouse.  However, no one had the option.  It was not public knowledge.  No one was offered it.  For some reason it was decided that this particular band should be offered it behind the scenes and without a proper procurement policy being followed.  It was done in a very secretive fashion.  Why was it that way?  Is that the way business was done?  This is what is described in special report No. 77 and in the report by Professor Brennan.  Deals were done behind the scenes.  Is this not what we are trying to get away from all the time?</p></speech>

We took advice on it at the time and we considered it carefully.  We had related issues with the counter parties which we also wanted to make sure were put to finality.  We did not want to have any remaining issues outstanding as we are in wind-up mode.  In the round, we considered that the process we followed was going to achieve best value money for the taxpayer, eliminate any other potential liabilities and achieve an open market price.  We achieved &euro;144 per sq. ft., benchmarked against &euro;99 per sq. ft. in a comparable transaction for a comparable property in or around the same time.  We believe we got value for money.</p></speech>

Mr. Crawley was not even aware that the lease had expired.  It seems to me that this deal was of a type which we have been very critical of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority for having conducted over the years.  Were there similar deals of this nature which were done without proper tendering and proper procurement practices being followed?</p></speech>

I am comfortable that they were tenants <i>in situ</i>.  I will come back to the committee to clarify the wording around the exact legal form.  We considered on its merits every asset we have sold since the dissolution of the authority.  This is the only transaction in which we used this particular procurement route provided for in the code of governance.  In each of the others, we offered them to the market on an open tender basis or an open sale basis.  This is the only one for which we took this particular exemption provided for under the code.</p></speech>

The final sign-off of the deal was in January of this year.  October 2013, when the negotiations were concluded, was a particularly busy time for the authority.  It was in the middle of dealing with many other transactions.  It did not at that particular point close out all the paperwork relating to the transaction immediately.  Why?  It was because we had competing priorities and the other issues to which I referred needed to be bottomed out.  We understood at the time that there were potentially other stakeholders who might be concerned about this because the new SDZ planning scheme was being put in place.  Therefore, the new planning regime which was to operate in that area re-thought the strategy for that particular area in Hanover Quay.  The SDZ planning scheme encourages and welcomes the continued presence of that area which is considered to be a cultural-heritage part of the area.  We allowed a pause period of some time in the event that someone would want to raise any issues on it.  Subsequently, we closed the transaction in January of this year.</p></speech>

I am not sure if it was raised prior to that because I was not a member of the committee at the time.  However, concerns would have been expressed about the failure to provide the proper tendering process, the lack of public knowledge about what was going on and the fact that there was a compulsory purchase order.  It would seem that in any sort of reasonable ethical circumstances, the first option would have gone to the person from whom the property was bought, if the authority was doing it in that sense and was trying to justify why it might be done without proceeding with full tendering.  All these issues had been raised, but the authority proceeded with it.  We had indicated at an earlier stage that we wanted to speak to the authority when the new Comptroller and Auditor General's report was presented.  The authority signed it up prior to this meeting taking place.</p></speech>

To repeat myself, we had competing priorities at the time.  We did not complete all the paperwork immediately and it took us some time, given that we had agreed an open market price with the buyers, to ensure all the other issues were dealt with.  We wanted to have it all wrapped up together, which we did successfully, and we are comfortable that all those issues have been dealt with.  I am aware of the issue the Deputy is raising.  There was some communication possibly towards the back end of last year.  In the round, we considered all those issues and we still looked into our hearts and were comfortable that the right decision had been made, the right process had been followed, appropriate due diligence had been done, the right sales price had been achieved and any potential outstanding liabilities or other commitments in relation to that whole transaction had now all been dealt with.</p></speech>

The word on the ground is that &euro;450,000 was way below the market value for the property.  Have there been other secret deals?  Have there been other deals since then, or are there any in the pipeline at the moment similar to that one?  Mr. Crawley said the deal was done at the end of 2013 but was not signed over until January 2015 and that competing priorities at the time slowed down the process.  He also said in passing - I do not remember the exact words used and would have checked them - that the time was being used to give others a chance to express an opinion.  I was always told that if one gives two excuses, then one does not believe the first one.  If Mr. Crawley says there were competing priorities at the time and that time was being left for people to come in on it, then he does not believe either of them.  The fact it took from the end of 2013 to 2015 to sign over on a deal that is way below market value is quite extraordinary.  Were there secret deals or are there any in the pipeline?  When making that decision, did the board know who it was dealing with and who the purchaser was at the time?  If I knew who I was dealing with, I would not sell it for way below the market value.  Will Mr. Crawley clarify that for me?</p></speech>

The board absolutely knew the counter parties involved, so we had full transparency on that.  Unfortunately, I have to reiterate that in our view, we were achieving best market price.  I reference that we got &euro;144 per sq. ft. against a comparable property for &euro;99 per sq. ft. in the market at the time.</p></speech>

If one person is selling at the wrong price, it does not make it right for another one to sell at the wrong price.</p></speech>

I have no reason to believe the other transaction that took place was not an open market price.  We believe it was an open market price.  To answer the Deputy's question in regard to the method we used, I confirmed to Deputy Costello, and I will do so again, that in this particular case, we used this particular procurement route, which was an exception and to be used in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>We took it under advice.  This is the only one on which we took this particular route.  In all the other cases we sold by tender arrangements.  We have very few transactions left to take place, and those which have yet to take place are taking place on an open competition basis.</p></speech>

Considering the three tenders we discussed earlier along with this, there is a serious issue that has already been highlighted and continues to exist.  I will return to the three tenders discussed earlier and the other one.  Two of the other tenders do not relate to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, but is there a connection between the two parties involved with those tenders and any member of the board?  The witness mentioned a lady who was doing some work for the authority.  Is there a connection between those two people and the board members that would be similar to that outlined by the witness?</p></speech>

Occasionally, board members may be involved with other business activities.</p></speech>

I am not comfortable with anything I have heard so far, and that is why I am asking the question.  With respect to the debt collection process, in 2013, bad debts were &euro;4.7 million.  That included a write-off of &euro;327,000 and a reduction in the provision of &euro;5 million.</p></speech>

How did that provision arise?</p></speech>

The &euro;327,000 write-off related to a debt where, unfortunately, the counter-party went bust.  There may have been two parties.  The &euro;5 million figure related to provisions made by the authority in previous years in respect of development contribution levies that had been billed on developers in the area who were not paying those levies.  Those levies became of concern to previous boards and they marked a bad debt provision against those debts.  We subsequently negotiated to have those debts recovered, which we are now doing.  Therefore, we were in a provision to write that provision back.  In other words, we no longer needed a bad debt provision and we are now able to secure the collection of those debts.</p></speech>

As it happens, with the ship, we had the opportunity to put it into dry-dock, and when we did so we discovered that there were difficulties with the woodwork on the boat.  We did not have a proper valuation, so we took a very conservative view and wrote the value down to &euro;150,000 at the time.

What is influencing the valuation at present is the fact that it is not seaworthy in terms of being operated as a sail training ship, which was the original plan.  If some money was spent on bringing it up to sail training standard, then obviously the value would be significantly higher.  However, the costs involved are prohibitive.</p></speech>

In view of the fact that serious water damage has been discovered on board, how much money will be required to make it seaworthy?  Difficulties arose in respect of the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>approximately four years ago and I seem to recall that it was estimated that the cost of making it seaworthy again would be &euro;100,000.  It was determined that it would not be feasible to proceed at the time.  Were repairs made in 2011 or was the vessel just left berthed in Dublin Port?  What is the history of this matter?  Given that &euro;14 million was spent on the project initially, did leaving it in the water for four years constitute adequate care for the vessel?</p></speech>

That is not to say that we did not monitor developments in respect of the vessel, and I must point out that we have a maintenance contract arrangement for it.  We are obviously able to ascertain from the inside of the vessel where issues arise from time to time.  We have also used divers to inspect the hull of the vessel externally.  It is difficult to get a full picture unless the vessel is removed from the water entirely.  Best practice would be that such a vessel would be placed in dry dock every two years.</p></speech>

At this stage we are comfortable that it is in a stable condition.  Everything under the waterline is fine and we are currently repairing damaged woodwork above the waterline.  The funding has been put in place to bring the vessel up to standard in order that it might be used as a tourist or visitor attraction.  The vessel is not at the required standard to allow it to be used for sail training.  The figure I provided is approximately 12 months old but it would cost of the order of &euro;500,000 to bring the vessel up to sail training standard.</p></speech>

In terms of animating the river, a lot of possibilities arise.

The assets fall into two categories.  There are those which we have in our accounts, and the principal ones that will be transferred to the city council are the offices at Custom House Quay and the extensive ducting network that operates throughout the IFSC and Grand Canal Dock areas.  These are the two substantial assets, and the Jeanie Johnston is included with them.  There are then a number of other assets which, in public authority parlance, we refer to as "infrastructure".  We will, therefore, also be transferring roads, bridges, lighting, the Campshires, etc., to Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

The authority was originally established as the Custom House Docks Development Authority in 1986 and it because the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in 1997.  It has been in existence for well over a quarter of a century and its activities have left a very bad taste in the mouths of the members of local communities.  Sheriff Street lies cheek by jowl with the docklands development area, DDA.  There is 100% employment in that area, but in Sheriff Street there is an unemployment rate of over 60%.  The level of community gain has been very limited.  Some &euro;7 million was supposed to be spent on a school but that development never materialised and neither did the local employment charter and the 20% commitment attaching to it.  Can Mr. Clegg indicate how this is going to be rectified in the new strategic development zone?  Many developments occurred during the Celtic tiger period and there are now many iconic buildings, office blocks, etc., in the DDA.  The area is a very desirable location for companies that are seeking to establish operations in the city.  Nevertheless, development there has led to the creation of a ghetto-type situation.  The evidence of this is now more stark than ever, and something must be done in the context of the SDZ to eliminate the poverty and deprivation that exist cheek by jowl with enormous affluence and 100% employment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.434" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Clegg" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015032600002#P03000"><p>As I said in my opening statement in respect of the potential relating to the undeveloped lands, some 23,000 jobs could be created.  Just over 50 acres remain to be developed, and that is why we put in place the strategic development zone, SDZ.  We also have a fast-track planning process in place.  As I pointed out earlier, the first planning permission was granted by Dublin City Council on Friday last.  When one is going to create 23,000 jobs, the trick is how to ensure local employment.  We are going to include a clause in our planning permissions to encourage contractors and developers to work with the city council in order to ensure that we will maximise opportunities for local people.  As we all know, however, this is not enforceable contractually.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the local labour charter, which has been taken on board in the context of the Grangegorman strategic development zone.  The Dublin City Council office in the docklands is seeking to upgrade that local charter.</p><p>More importantly, we have engaged quite effectively with the local employment services in Amiens Street and Pearse Street.  We are trying to identify the industries that are coming to the Docklands so that if we know that in two or three years a particular industry will come, the local employment service can contact this industry with a view to establishing its employment needs.  If those employment needs can be catered for within the local employment service's records, good, but if not there is an opportunity to train people.  The local employment services are quite excited about this.  There is an opportunity here to get real, local jobs.  The people to use this are the local employment services.  They are the State bodies.  They are the experts.  We are working very closely with them right from the start.  I am optimistic about this, but local employment charters are not enforceable.  There is real potential if there is close work between us, developers - NAMA is interested in this - and the local employment services to get real local jobs.</p></speech>

We had the local employment charter, which the docklands authority ran a coach and four through.  The developers brought in people from outside, who rented houses in the area, and pretended it was local employment.  The local employment services were in operation for the last 20 years as well and did not deliver the jobs.  Can we ensure in some way that the new structures that are put in place have teeth, so that they deliver on the jobs, apprenticeships, education and commitment?  In the original vision there was a statutory requirement by the Docklands Development Authority that equal priority would be given to social and economic regeneration.  That was honoured in the breach rather than in the observance.</p></speech>

Dublin City Council has an office in the docklands, in the old local authority office.  We have an SDZ.  There is a commitment from the city council to do all in our power to have real social regeneration.  We are accountable as an organisation at city council and here.  If we do not perform, we are accountable.  There is a dedicated team of people working in the docklands who have real enthusiasm to ensure we get real jobs.  We have a good platform here to get real jobs into the future but we will see.  It will not be from a lack of effort on the part of the city council that we do not have positive results on this.</p></speech>

Something is niggling at me about the statement Mr. Crawley made last week when he said that in previous years he did not have the resources to provide the maintenance and repairs for the Jeanie Johnston.  Unlike other museums, people are charged to go on the boat.  It is &euro;9 per adult.  It is not like going to the National Museum.  How much revenue has been accrued over the last five years from visitors to the boat and where did that money go?</p></speech>

Let me not give the impression that we have done nothing with the ship.  All of the revenues that come in from the fees we collect are pumped straight back into maintaining the boat.  Best practice is to take a boat like that out of the water every two years or so and do an examination.  That is an expensive process.  It costs in the order of &euro;50,000.</p></speech>

The aim is to break-even.  The river suffers from lack of animation.  The port is beyond the East Link.  I was involved in the Tall Ships Race in 2012.  Part of the strategy for the docklands is animation of the river.  The city council decided not to take the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>off the river and it will try to develop a sustainable tourism model into the future.  CHQ is developing a diaspora centre.  There is potential to increase tourist numbers going to the docklands which will have a positive spin-off effect on the numbers using the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>.  It is for the future.</p></speech>

I would like the Comptroller and Auditor General to let us know the extent of the State&rsquo;s input into it.  Regardless of how one views it, the ship costs the State a considerable sum of money every year.  If it goes to Dublin City Council it will continue to cost, unless the council has a business plan.  The taxpayer is picking up the bill.  The <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>has found the perfect home in the DDDA, given the history of the DDDA.  We now have to quantify this for the taxpayer and, as it stands, it is not acceptable.  The longer this meeting and the other investigations go on the more we find out about the different elements that are losing money behind the bigger sums we are considering.  Could we have all the information we have asked for and all the information on the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>?  If Dublin City Council has any idea for a business plan it might outline that to us.

It is not acceptable that it continues to make a substantial loss after costing so much money and because of the news stories in the past week about its water damage and having to be repaired in dry dock, which costs a lot of money, some kind of business plan and outline for its future is necessary.

We are talking about the docklands and there is no visitor centre as such in the docklands.  The docklands has enormous heritage and history.  There is a very fine group of people who are mainly ex-dockers and others who are interested in heritage and history that set up a group a couple of years ago.  They have looked at how they might preserve the history of the docklands and acknowledge the fact that it was the area where so much happened in terms of port activity, cargo and all the rest.  They have looked for a site for an exhibition area, a visitor area, a cafe and to be self-sustaining and so on.  It might just be possible that the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>could be brought into a structure that would provide a major visitor centre for the docklands which would be self-sustainable.  Those talks and discussions have been ongoing.  There is also the famous diving bell in the docklands which is unique and the port and docks which is close by as well.  If all of that was taken on board by Dublin City Council - the port and docks, the Department and a particular site that could be identified on the campshire of the River Liffey - then that type of location would preserve all the history of the docklands.  Perhaps it could bring in the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>as part of that and a visitor centre could be created.</p></speech>

Based on the losses encountered over the past five years, is it in the right place?  Would the vessel be better off located at Grand Canal Dock or somewhere like it where one has access to the DART?  There is not great access to where it is located on the quays at the moment.  If it is losing that much money surely consideration needs to be given to re-location?  Notwithstanding what has been said about the river, for as much as know about the docks and docklands, one must consider moving the vessel to a different location.</p></speech>

Session 1 this morning is a public hearing with Mr. Michael Doorly, former financial director of Independent News and Media, and Mr. Gerry O'Regan, former editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, on the role of the media in the lead into the banking crisis in the period from 2002 to 2007.  I welcome everyone to the 17th public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.</p><p>During our sessions this week we are hearing from a number of witnesses on the role of the media during the property boom in the lead-in to the banking crisis 2002 to 2007 and any changes in approach after the crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Mr. Michael Doorly, former finance director of Independent News and Media, and Mr. Gerry O'Regan, former editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Specifically, Mr. Regan and Mr. Doorly have been invited to discuss the independence of editorial policy on the economy and property boom and, separately, their newspapers' business model and sources of revenue including that from the real estate sector in the period from 2002 to 2007.</p><p>Mr. Doorly is the company secretary of Independent News and Media plc.  He is an experienced senior executive in the group and has held a variety of senior management roles in the subsidiary Independent Newspapers (Ireland) Limited, including that of sales and marketing director, finance director and operations director.  He has also travelled extensively with the group to New Zealand, South Africa and the UK.  Mr. Gerry O'Regan was editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>for seven years from 2005 to 2012.  Prior to that he was editor of <i>The Herald</i>and the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>for periods of six years and five years respectively.  Before that he was deputy editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>and held various other editorial positions on the newspaper.  Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan are welcome before the inquiry.</p><p>Before I begin I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  In whatever sequence they wish, I invite Mr. Doorly and Mr. O'Regan to make their opening comments.</p></speech>

As the Chairman outlined, I was editor of the<i>Irish Independent</i>for a period of seven years from 2005 to 2012, and I was previously editor of <i>The Herald</i>and the <i>Irish Daily Star</i>for a total of 11 years.<br/><br/>I am qualified to discuss the editorial policy of the newspaper during my period as editor, rather than matters such as advertising revenue streams.  The established policy and practice of strict separation of the editorial and advertising functions meant I was solely responsible for editorial direction.  Under line management systems, other executives were accountable for commercial activities such as advertising.  Correspondence on behalf of the committee states it wishes to specifically discuss &quot;editorial policy on the economy and the property boom (2002-2007)&quot;.</p><p>By way of background and context, I think it should be noted that the overall role of an independent media in a free society is both complicated and nuanced, depending on events and circumstances.  However, my essential point in relation to editorial policy, particularly with regard to economic coverage, is that there was no conscious attempt on my part, or on the part of the newspaper, to fuel what has been described as the property boom.  It would be wrong, I think, to retrospectively arrive at definitive conclusions regarding the coverage of the economy and the property market on the basis of subsequent events and evidence which was not then but is now in the public domain.<br/><br/>The ever-changing dynamic which is a mass-selling daily newspaper requires sophisticated analysis when it comes to assessing editorial coverage on a particular issue.  As the biggest-selling daily newspaper in the country, the <i>Irish Independent</i>has a wide and multilayered readership base.  These demographics, by definition, continue to evolve.  The primary objective of an editor is to try to cater for such readership requirements by marrying statistical data and social trends with editorial instinct.  The roadmap for editing, therefore, by definition, remains constantly subject to change, depending on changing events.<br/><br/>Coverage of the economy and related matters, such as the property market, is a key part of the journalistic remit of a paper like the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  However, such coverage cannot be conducted in an intellectual vacuum, and editors, writers, contributors and analysts cannot but be influenced by the prevailing climate at a given point in time.  Certainly, up to and including 2007, the overwhelming consensus both domestically and abroad was that Ireland had transformed itself economically.  The country had by then enjoyed a number of years of unparalleled prosperity, manifest most of all in historically low unemployment rates and a period of net immigration for the first time in the history of the State.<br/><br/>It is important to give cognisance to the economic context and background in which media reporting and commentary we are now discussing took place.  It was obviously done within the parameters of knowledge at that particular point in time.  Certain objective data statistics and facts have to be taken into account when we look back at the period we are now reassessing.  The facts show the economy grew strongly from 2002 and this continued in 2007.  National debt was among the lowest in the developed world at 25% of GDP.  The country's fiscal performance was outstanding and employment levels were at heights never seen before in Ireland.  All of these factors led to a powerful so-called &quot;national feel-good factor''.  Ongoing reporting and analysis of economic and related matters continued against this background.  Central to some of the arguments being considered by the committee is that editorial work had to be carried out within the framework of known events and facts at that particular time.<br/><br/>The overwhelming consensus was that, despite the rapid growth of the construction industry and the ongoing rise in house prices, the essential pillars of our economy were sound.  The prevailing wisdom was that if a property bubble was to emerge, the country's still high employment figures and positive Government finances would mitigate against a serious economic downturn.  Hence the widespread belief in the financial, economic and political communities that a ''soft landing'' would result from the rapid expansion of the property and construction sectors over the previous number of years.  It is important to note also that this was the prevailing economic consensus abroad, particularly at EU level, and the approach to Irish fiscal and economic strategies by various reputable international organisations could be described as removed and benign, seemingly on the presumption that the fundamentals of our economy were sound.<br/><br/>As we now know, however, and as has so often happened in similar circumstances throughout economic history, underlying trends were gathering pace which would have serious negative implications for Ireland.  Clouds were gathering in the international financial world and the storm that erupted in 2008 led to a global financial crisis, which had profound economic and fiscal consequences for the economies of both the USA and Europe, and particularly for those on the periphery of things, such as Ireland.  In time, such developments would have profound consequences, particularly for our own banking structure.<br/><br/>The consequences for the Irish economy have been well documented, but for the period I have been asked to comment on, 2002 to 2007, the full import of a changing economic landscape worldwide was still in the future, and, as such, could not completely inform editorial coverage in the newspaper.  My predominant objective as editor was to optimise the circulation of the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  By definition, in an intensely competitive environment, this meant embracing and encouraging wide-ranging and diverse views in its editorial content.  Daily newspapers articulate and reflect various dimensions of what has been described as &quot;the national conversation&quot; at any particular point in time.  Sometimes, of course, the predictions and assertions by some commentators about possible future trends may prove to be incorrect, but that really is intrinsic to the very essence of journalism, including economic forecasting.<br/><br/>The ultimate safety valve for the maintenance of editorial standards in a newspaper is the perception and understanding of its readers.  They can be influenced in making the ultimate choice, and it is a very grim choice for any editor - they can decide to stop buying the paper - if they believe certain editorial standards are not being met.  For all media, including newspapers, the consumer is the ultimate judge and jury.  For this and other reasons, which I hope will emerge in the discussion to follow, there was no hidden agenda in the <i>Irish Independent </i>to try to artificially bolster the property market for the period under review.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.557" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Doorly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032600002#B00300"><p>Good morning to the Chairman and the members of the committee.  During the period which is the subject of the committee's inquiry, I was finance director of Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited, which is the Irish subsidiary of Independent News and Media plc.  At the outset I would like to briefly address the subject of the role of the media from a commercial perspective.  It is generally accepted that one of the lynchpins of a democratic society is a free press which operates on an independent basis.  It follows that, in order to establish and maintain independence, media enterprises must be financially sustainable and capable of survival in a commercial and competitive environment.  In seeking to achieve this, the print media has two core sources of income: these are revenue from the sales of its publications and revenues from advertising.  Both income streams are vital and there is an interdependence between them.</p> <p>  The reality, of course, is that the publication is the core product which, through the quality of its content and its success in building circulation, sales and readership, creates a channel for advertisers to promote their goods and services.  Advertising revenues are, therefore, a factor of the reputation and integrity of a publication, which is built through good reporting and good journalism, and content that is relevant to its readership.  The requirement to maintain and build on this editorial integrity underpins Independent News and Media's policy of a strict and absolute separation of the editorial and commercial functions within the organisation.</p> <p>  The committee of inquiry has requested me to address a number of matters, including the company's business model and sources of revenue, including revenue from the real estate sector.  They have asked me to address the importance of property-related revenues within the overall revenue mix, the group's engagement in property-related commercial activity and the relationship between the editorial and sales functions.</p><p>The committee will understand that the company, as a commercial organisation operating in a highly competitive industry, is not in a position to disclose detailed financial figures that would be of potential benefit, and certainly of interest, to our competitors.  However, I will attempt to deal with the issues in a manner that provides the committee with substantive information which will meet its requirements.<br/><br/>Referring to the business model, Independent News and Media is the largest media operation on the island of Ireland.  It is also a public limited company.  The group has a strong portfolio of national, regional and local print titles, including the <i>Irish Independent</i>, which is the market leader among the dailies, and the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, Ireland&rsquo;s biggest-selling Sunday newspaper.  The production and distribution of newspapers is a complex operation, but in the business sense it is quite simple: we sell newspapers and we sell advertising.<br/><br/>Referring to sources of income, newspaper revenues are derived from two sources: circulation sales and advertising revenues.  Between 2002 and 2007 Ireland was a country in the throes of a major economic boom.  GDP grew strongly in each of those years and newspaper sales and advertising revenues enjoyed increases broadly in line with the economy.  Over the period, the revenues of the <i>Irish Independent</i>and the <i>Sunday Independent</i>increased by an average of 6.5% per annum.  This is a total of 37.6%.  I wish to correct the figure of 31.7% presented in my written submission.  Advertising revenues increased by an average of 9% per annum, or 52% over the period.  Circulation sales increased by an average of 3% per annum, or 17% during the period.  This is not surprising in an economy in which personal consumption was growing at an average rate of almost 5% a year.<br/><br/>In terms of the revenue mix, in 2002, 60% of overall revenues came from advertising, with the remaining 40% coming from circulation.  By 2007, 66% of overall revenues came from advertising, with 34% coming from circulation.  This movement is not insignificant, but neither could it be described as a paradigm shift.<br/><br/>Referring to the importance of property-related advertising in the overall revenue mix, it is clear that the demand for advertising space to promote housing developments increased throughout the period under review.  The increase was in line with the scale of activity in the residential property market, where house completions increased by an average of 13% per annum, from 57,695 units in 2002 to just over 93,000 units in 2006.<br/><br/>From a relatively low base, property-related revenues in the <i>Irish Independent</i>and the <i>Sunday Independent</i>grew by a similar 13% per annum, or a quantum of 89% over the period.  For reference purposes, it is worth noting that advertising of travel increased by 25% per annum throughout this period, or a quantum of 153%.  Revenues from property-related advertising represented an average of 14% of total advertising income and accounted for just over 9% of overall income - that is, income including both circulation sales and advertising revenues.<br/><br/>In his submission, my former colleague Gerry O'Regan gave an insight into the role of the media during the economic boom and subsequent crash.  The only comment I will add, specifically concerning the property market, is that the media, in my view, cannot create or sustain a boom.  Demand for property is created by a mix of factors over which the media have no control.  These include overall economic conditions, employment levels, consumer confidence, the availability of finance, demographics, the rate of home formation, and society's capacity for risk.<br/><br/>In relation to information sought concerning engagement in property-related commercial activity, I can advise the committee that INM did not engage in property development activities and was at no stage a participant in the property industry.  I would like to add, however, that as part of our normal operations the <i>Irish Independent</i>did relocate its printing business from Abbey Street in Dublin city centre to Citywest in Dublin 24 and relocated its publishing division to Talbot Street in Dublin 1 in 2004.  This was in line with other publishers in moving printing facilities out of what were congested city centre areas.<br/><br/>With reference to the relationship between the editorial and sales functions, Mr. O'Regan and I have outlined the position concerning the complete separation of the editorial and commercial functions within our organisation.  I thank the Chairman and I hope my comments are of assistance to the committee.</p></speech>

Before calling the questioners, I might address two issues with each of the witnesses.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Doorly described the link between the quality of the publication and its journalism and its ability to gain circulation and readership, with this in turn translating into the ability to attract advertising.  So there is a sort of circular motion there.  However, in his presentation he stressed "the strict and absolute separation of the editorial and commercial functions."  How did this work in practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.560" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Doorly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032600002#C00300"><p>Absolutely.  The reality is that our business is built around the product, and in this case the success of the product, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, is dependent on good reporting, on good journalism and on presenting content that is relevant to its readership.  The paper comes first, and through its success, which is measured in terms of circulation, sales and readership numbers, it does create a platform for advertisers to target their audience and promote their goods and services.  The balance that the Chairman referred to is therefore weighted towards the newspaper, and this is the domain of the editor and is separate from the commercial functions.  In practice, the editor will hold daily conferences to review the news agenda and the make-up of the paper; there is no commercial representation at those sessions.  It is the domain of the editor and it is separate from the commercial functions.</p></speech>

In his opening statement he said there was no conscious attempt by him, as editor, or on the part of the <i>Irish Independent</i>to fuel the property boom.  What were the main factors at play in the newspaper?  Regarding media coverage of the Irish property boom during the crisis period of 2002 to 2007, how would he describe the narrative that was being portrayed in the media at that time?</p></speech>

Newspapers, obviously, reflect the ever-changing panorama which is human life.  During some years when I was there, obviously, the property boom and economic growth and the subsequent economic collapse were key issues which we needed to cover.  We covered them and tried to reflect them, as I said, with the ultimate and primary objective of optimising sales, in the same way as we would cover the drama, the changes, the ups and downs, the victories and defeats in areas such as sport, politics, economics in this case, and the changing lifestyle patterns in the country.  We were trying to hold a mirror up to Irish life.</p></speech>

During the period, there was a view that people felt they had to get on to the property ladder as quickly as possible because of escalating prices.  This was creating a self-fulfilling prophesy in that it was driving up prices because it was increasing demand with the inevitable fear that &quot;If don't get in this year, I won't be able to get in next year.&quot;  What was the <i>Irish Independent</i>'s reportage of that phenomenon, or was there such reportage?</p></speech>

What I was conscious of particularly when I started editing the <i>Irish Independent</i>was to try to broaden its overall economic coverage.  I was appointed editor on 28 September 2005 and within a few weeks I met a man for lunch whose name has already come up repeatedly here at the committee meetings, Mr. David McWilliams.  I signed him up to write for the <i>Irish Independent</i>when I was ten weeks into the job.  He joined on 22 December, we both went off and enjoyed our Christmases and he started to write everything that he saw fit from early in 2006.  I have a number of key extracts here where his prognostications of the doom which was to come have been proved very much correct by what happened.<br/><br/>I recruited David McWilliams for two reasons, one of which was as part of an ongoing process to widen our economics coverage.  We had an excellent economics editor in Brendan Keenan.  I have an interesting aside to which I can speak later which was Brendan's response to that other man who has been repeatedly mentioned in relation to the downturn, Morgan Kelly.  That and a number of other key extracts show that the <i>Irish Independent</i>was willing and trying to embrace what was now a widening discussion about possible perils on the horizon.  The records in the <i>Irish Independent</i>at that time prove that was the case.</p></speech>

I follow up Mr. O'Regan's remark about Mr. Morgan Kelly.  I am not entirely clear what he was saying there.  We understand from yesterday's evidence from Dr. Mercille that Morgan Kelly had at least one newspaper turn down his second article for publication, the first one that went to <i>The Irish Times</i>in 2006, and that a second article was also turned down.  Is Mr. O'Regan referring to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry O'Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032600002#D00300"><p>I am unaware of that.  If Morgan Kelly had approached me with what I would describe not as a dissenting view but as an alternative view on our economic scenario, I would most certainly have given him a run.  What I am saying is so as to dispel any suspicion or inclination that the <i>Irish Independent</i>had a conflict with embracing an - I am uneasy about using the word &quot;dissenting&quot; - alternative, wider view of our possible economic scenario at the time.  I have an extract from the newspaper edition of 4 July 2007 when Brendan Keenan was responding to the statements made by Morgan Kelly.  He wrote in the context of an ESRI survey:<blockquote><br /><br /><font color="#111111">Actually, there is a bigger danger; that the property market - rather than having a soft landing or a bumpy landing - crashes and burns.  This was the scenario outlined in the ESRI quarterly bulletin by UCD economist Morgan Kelly.</font><font color="#111111">Although it was contained in the bulletin, it was not part of the ESRI forecast.  That predicts a soft landing, with house building falling 10pc over the 18 months, and house prices stabilising after a 3pc fall this year.  Prof Kelly takes a different view.  Based on property booms and busts in different countries over the past 40 years, an Irish crash could knock up to 60pc off the real (after inflation) price of houses over the next 10 years, he says.  The first thing to be said about Prof Kelly's scenario is that it </font><i><font color="#111111">could</font></i><font color="#111111"> happen.</font></blockquote><font color="#111111">In other words, it could lead to a massive property crash.  Brendan Keenan, as economics editor of the Irish Independent, continued, &quot;Anyone who says it is impossible is whistling past the graveyard, or a downright fibber.&quot;  I use that as a case in point that the paper was more than willing to embrace contrarian views.</font></p></speech>

I thank Mr. O'Regan for the clarification in relation to Brendan Keenan.  In the final sentence of his opening remarks, Mr. O'Regan said &quot;there was no hidden agenda in the <i>Irish Independent </i>to try to artificially bolster the property market for the period under review&quot;.  How would he describe what the paper was doing?  Was it bolstering it in any shape or form?  Even if one takes out the word &quot;artificially&quot;, was the paper encouraging, supporting or doing anything at all given that Mr. O'Regan said he had to reflect life as it was and that any editor would want to do that.</p></speech>

In fact, the essential point I was making in my submission was that newspapers and the human condition can only make judgments and continue on making statements in light of what is known at a particular time.  The debate on our economy is ever-changing.  There is a new emphasis almost by the day and certainly by the month in light of a changing scenario internationally and domestically.  It would be as if the paper tomorrow carried economic predictions for the next year.  They will often vary in the context of the writer or economist who is making the judgment.  People come to these things with their own prejudices, presuppositions, blinkered approaches or whatever it is.  Often, one has to wait for events to happen to find out who was right and who was wrong.</p></speech>

What I am trying to get at is whether his newspaper or INM Group newspapers contributed to the feeling that it was a safe bet and a good thing to buy property and that this was good for Ireland incorporated.  What role did they play?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.579" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry O'Regan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032600002#D01100"><p>I think retrospectively that some of our contributors were of the view that it was a good time to buy property at a particular point in time over those years.  It would be the same as asking someone today if he or she thought house prices will go up or down in Dublin and whether one should buy now or wait for a year.  He or she could be right or wrong.  The essential point I am making is that we were trying to cover all possibilities and going back to my other assumption, which was that I was trying to sell the newspaper.  For example, I recruited David McWilliams with that express purpose in mind.  On 22 March 2006 when I had been in the job three or four months, we put across the top of page 1 of the <i>Irish Independent</i>that David McWilliams was writing inside about Ireland's love affair with borrowing, saying our economy could turn from a crock of gold to a complete crock unless we checked this credit craze.  He wrote &quot;If the property boom goes pear shaped - and they tend to do so - not only will our feelings of prosperity evaporate, our European credentials might go too&quot;.  On 26 April, he wrote<font color="#111111"> that our economy's over reliance on the construction sector would expose us to a hard landing if there was a slump, stating &quot;much of [our] employment is coming from the construction sector.  In fact, take construction and its attendant industries out of the equation and there is not much vibrancy [t]here&quot;.  He asked if people would ask if they did not see a slump coming, that is, an end to this artificial boosting of the economy.</font></p></speech>

Mr. Doorly said in his opening statement that INM was not a participant in the property industry.  When the INM group bought <i>www.propertynews.com</i>in 2006, the chief executive of INM said, &quot;The combination of PropertyNews.com and INM's online and newspaper operations will allow the group to offer estate agents and home owners an unrivalled package.&quot;  What was the signal to the world if INM was now buying into a property website which was of course promoting the sale of property?

It was investing in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK.  The natural progression was to diversify out of just newspapers, and it started to diversify into radio, outdoor advertising and new media.  In terms of new media and some structural changes that were beginning to take place in the market, the group was developing a strategy of involving itself in developing websites in news, business and sport, but also classified advertising.  It was part of its strategy on new media.  At the time it was called "new media"; it is now called digital or online content and it is normal enough.  The company was investing in classified advertisement sites, including sites for recruitment, motors, property and travel.  It is in the context of that structural change, moving from a dependence on newspapers alone into new media, that that purchase was made.  That purchase was made in the Republic of Ireland by the UK subsidiary.  It was a Northern Ireland business, and at the time, according to the same article, it had 20,000 properties, 4,000 of which were in Border counties in the Republic.  It was a Northern Ireland play in property.  The hope was to move into the Republic, which is what we are doing now.  We have our newspaper business and our digital business and we have other streams of income.</p></speech>

I put it to him that during the period in question there certainly was growing dependence on advertising revenue, which increased from 60% of the company's revenue base to 66%.  As such, the ratio of advertising revenue to circulation revenue moved from a ratio of 3:2 to 2:1.  Advertising grew by approximately 52% during the period in question.  Within the advertising, the property-related advertising element was growing quite rapidly.  Was the business becoming increasingly dependent on revenue from property-related advertising during the period?</p></speech>

It is true that throughout the period the ratio of circulation revenues to advertising revenues changed in favour of advertising and advertising revenues was growing at a faster pace than circulation revenues, but, as the Deputy may recall, the economy was flying at that time, between 2002 and 2007.  It was expanding, income levels were increasing and within the <i>Irish Independent</i>, we were showing increases across all categories of advertising.<br/><br/>We need to put property into context.  The most important advertising stream would be general run of paper display advertising.  I guess recruitment was probably second.  We had income coming in from the magazines, particularly the Sunday <i>LIFE</i>magazine and the <i>WEEKEND</i>magazine.  We had property and motors, and travel.  All the categories were improving year on year.  In addition, as I mentioned, the group had extended overseas.  We were getting involved in radio.  We were getting involved in outdoor advertising and in new media.  The business was thriving and there was no undue focus or pressure on property-related advertising.</p></speech>

When one looks at the figures, circulation, sales and readership numbers tend to be very stable and advertising revenues are volatile and will rise and fall in line with consumer spending.  However, those rises and falls were not just in property; they were across the board.  One should look at the newspapers today.  One should look at the run of paper display advertising.  One should look at the number of jobs being advertised and the number of properties being advertised.  These are all down.  At the time, the economy was experiencing a boom and all boats were rising.</p></speech>

The range in advertising was 11% to 17% and I guess the range in terms of overall revenues was 7% to 11%.  It represented approximately 11% of the revenues of the <i>Irish Independent</i>and the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  That excludes the remainder of the Irish business and the international business.  As a proportion of the company's revenue, it was relatively small.  I do need to say there was no undue focus or pressure on advertising related revenues.</p></speech>

Obviously, in the case of the <i>Irish Independent</i>during those times, of course, I would accept the newspaper may well have influenced people in many walks of life about various issues not only on the economy, but as regards such matters as politics, lifestyle and consumer affairs.  In fact, basically, I suppose one could say newspapers are divided into two broad streams of content.  First, they report the events that have happened.  Second, one has various writers who, one could say, by definition, are trying to influence people in the sense they are trying to persuade them that their way of thinking is the correct way.</p></speech>

One person's idea of balance, as Deputy Michael McGrath will be aware, is another person's idea of bias.  No more than in the political sphere, one would try to maintain a balance, if only, as I mentioned on a couple of occasions already, to try to make the product as interesting and as readable as possible for the consumer.</p></speech>

I think, as was mentioned yesterday - I looked at some of the proceedings - the broad guidelines operating in this area are the NUJ Code of Conduct and the Press Council Code of Practice.  There is also the Press Ombudsman.  As regards accepting gifts, I do not think there is any policy as such.  I thought about this this morning.  A couple of years ago, when Kerry was in the All-Ireland final and I could not get a ticket, one of the main drinks companies invited me.  I probably should have rung Deputy Higgins, who is a west Kerry man like myself.  He probably had some tickets that I could have accepted as a gift.  I took the tickets.  That kind of thing possibly does happen, but I do not know whether it actually corrupts anyone.  I do not think I was corrupted by it, and I enjoyed the match.  I would not have got a ticket otherwise.</p></speech>

I believe the <i>Irish Independent</i>was financially sustainable, that circulation sales and readership were pretty rock solid and that advertising revenues were volatile, in that they will rise and fall in line with the economy.  This was a period where revenues rose and the company did well.  It was transient.  We are now in a different environment, but that is the business.  It rises and falls in terms of advertising revenues in line with the economy.  It was no more than in line with the economy.  As it has decreased or contracted, our advertising revenues have also decreased and contracted.  It was no more than a normal cycle of events with rising and falling economic cycles.</p></speech>

INM is a public limited company and it has 8,000 shareholders.  Some have a greater ownership than others, but we are talking about the period from 2002 to 2007.  Neither the owners of the time or the owners of today have had any influence.</p></speech>

There is another question, maybe specifically for Mr. Doorly.  It concerns the way advertising works in newspapers.  Studies will show that in an upturn in the economy there is an explosion in advertising and as the economy then contracts advertising dries up very quickly.  This is a dynamic that indicates that the economy is running very fast, and that speed is certainly measurable in the way advertising grows ahead of it.  Have any studies been done by INM into this dynamic?</p></speech>

As as a PLC we try to eliminate that volatility and de-risk.  We have, we believe, achieved this by diversifying and investing abroad, which spreads the economic risk and the exposure to cycles within each economy.  That is why we were in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK.  Also, dependence on newspapers<i>per se</i>, let alone circulation sales and advertising within them, had to be reduced.  Therefore, we began to invest in those businesses that had sub-businesses in radio, outdoor advertising and new media.  We have always been conscious of the need to de-risk and reduce our dependence on any one income stream.</p></speech>

The reason I am asking this question - I am sure other members might digress into areas that are related to this - is that if the average house price is running several multiples ahead of the national wage, that is an indication that there is something happening in the property market that needs to be dealt with.  If advertising is running so fast in media - if the advertising figures are so off the mark compared to the situation two or three years previously - does the question then get asked in the media as to what is actually going on here?</p></speech>

It has been difficult over the last number of years, but the<i>Irish Independent </i>has now turned a corner.  I think it has been widely reported that for the first time in 2014 we have increased our revenue base and we are now showing improved profitability.  Could the Chairman repeat the question?</p></speech>

It was in line with consumer spending.  It was right across the board.  It was in run-of-paper display.  There were ads for travel, motors and jobs.  There was no undue focus or dependence on property whatsoever in the commercial sense.</p></speech>

He said he had arrived at a political conclusion.  Was it an editorial position that he would then favour one political party over another?  Maybe he could expand on what he actually meant by that.</p></speech>

Any time I was editing the paper, I wrote editorials favouring a party, an issue, a proposal or whatever, and criticising also.  It is part of an ongoing judgmental process, if you like, which newspapers do.</p></speech>

We are used to other jurisdictions, which were mentioned yesterday - the UK in particular - where newspapers are associated with particular political entities.  In the United States it is even more unbraked, for want of a better term.  That is not really something that has historically been seen in the Irish context.  How does one arrive at a political position that this is what the editorial position of a newspaper is going to be<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>a certain political party?</p></speech>

Obviously one would discuss it with other people on the editorial team, and there is a feeling that would evolve, perhaps, or an instinct would emerge.  I suppose one of the key reasons would be economic issues and what we feel would be best for the country.  The <i>Irish Independent </i>would be, broadly speaking, a centrist newspaper, but it is certainly pro-enterprise and pro improving the economy because it improves things for everybody - the country at large, the media and newspapers.</p></speech>

In this instance the product is the <i>Irish Independent</i>and its success is built on good reporting, good journalism and providing content that is relevant to the readers.  That is the business.  The success of the title is measured in terms of circulation sales and readership.  What happens then is that the advertisers looking for channels to promote their goods and services will review the numbers and will or will not advertise, as appropriate.  The circulation and readership figures, as I said, are quite stable.  It is the advertising element that will rise and fall in line with the economy.</p></speech>

That happened in 2013 and reduced the debt by &euro;300,000.</p></speech>

Throughout all of this, and throughout the debt issue, and throughout the restructuring, the Irish business continued to be profitable and is so to this day.  It continued its normal cycle of business.  Yes, at a balance sheet level outside of the operation there were credit issues.  With the credit crunch the company was unable to extend its facilities.  That is what caused the problem.</p></speech>

That was dealt with through the disposal of assets, the restructuring of the pension plan, the bank write-down and raising cash from our shareholders.  Indirectly, the staff did suffer with a reduction in their pension.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting that it was like absolute rigid walls that one could not discuss "Yay" or "Nay".  Obviously one would discuss the economy or I am sure, maybe at the time, the property boom and how things were going but it would be part of general discussion.  At the end of the day it is very difficult to come up with a precise formula for what should or should not be covered in newspapers which will absolutely work by way of the newspaper.</p></speech>

In relation to the property supplement, and Mr. Doorly has mentioned that there were three, how does management view the property supplement?  Is the supplement purely a vehicle for selling advertising?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.751" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Doorly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032600002#J00800"><p>There is no doubt that management would view all supplements as having a different personality, different character, and different make-up from the main newspaper.  Supplements are primarily commercial, be it the recruitment section or the motors supplement or the travel supplement.  They are primarily a commercial vehicle.  I think the editorial content and make-up is the domain of the editor but in reality they are there to carry ads for advertisers to promote goods or services, including property, so they are primarily commercial.  Generally speaking, there would be more than 65% advertising and a lot less editorial, whereas in the main newspaper it is the reverse.  It is primarily editorial content carrying some advertising.</p></speech>

If he or she buys the prime slot on the main page, what power does he or she have over what appears on the front page of that newspaper as a result?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Doorly" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032600002#J01300"><p>None.  How this works in practice is the editor has his daily conferences with his team and he goes through the news agenda and they select whatever it might be that will make up the newspaper the next day.  There is no commercial involvement whatsoever.  There never has been.  I am in the company more than 20 years.  I have never attended nor has anyone else in the commercial side ever attended these conferences.  They are the domain of the editor and they are completely separate from the commercial side.  The answer to the Deputy's question would be a categorical "No."  I am surprised it is even asked, but there you go.</p></speech>

The <i>Irish Independent</i>, from 2003 to 2008, gave substantial coverage and sponsored and promoted the property awards.  In 2004, for example, this is the type of coverage that was over many pages and it was described in 2004 as &quot;A glittering showcase of the cream of Ireland's property and development industries&quot; and &quot;An elite gathering of over 1,000 property professionals witnessed the cream of Ireland's residential and commercial products and services at the glittering Property Awards ceremony this week&quot;.  The property editor said:<blockquote><br /><br />[T]ributes were paid to the outstanding skills and performance of the individuals and firms involved.  The winning projects and services provided by our outstanding agencies ably demonstrated the progress and innovation of this sector, which matches, if not surpasses, the high standards globally.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The relaxed black tie event was a welcome respite for an industry that has worked to full capacity in recent years ... attended by a record 1,000 property professionals with several hundred disappointed.</blockquote>The awards were followed by a casino evening.  The property editor sums up: &quot;This annual awards dinner followed a conference held earlier in the day which predicted the short-term future of the Irish property market and also saw the unveiling of a new addition to the awards - The Irish Property League - which ranked the top ten commercial agents in terms of staff, net worth, turnover, profit, and investment deals at home and overseas.&quot;</p></speech>

The world is their stage."  Going forward to Mr. O'Regan's own period particularly, in 2007 we have further very substantial coverage and again the property editor wrote, "Tribute was paid to the risk takers who are flying the Irish property flag at home and abroad ... who have demonstrated their courage by forging paths where few, if any, Irish people have ventured before", and so forth.  Among the awards was Irish investor of the year, Irish developer of the year, international property achievement, Irish commercial development of the year, Irish property personality of the year and residential development of the year.  Of those glittering awards, in 2007, the Irish property deal of the year was the Irish Glass Bottle site which cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions.  Seven of the award winners ended up in NAMA, five of whom were among the top ten debtors to Anglo Irish Bank, which cost the taxpayer billions of euro.  In view of all this, would Mr. O'Regan like to revise his statement that no conscious attempt was made on the part of the newspaper to fuel what has been described as a property boom?</p></speech>

What I would like to do is to put that in context.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>, in common with various newspapers, has award ceremonies.  We have had theatre awards, sports star awards, young entrepreneur of the year awards and, I think, maybe young scientist awards, etc.  Going back to that time, we had an award for the property industry which was, as I said, in the context of the knowledge which we had at that time whereby this was taken at a time when it was believed that the economy, the construction industry and the development of it was critical to our economic development.</p></speech>

The question was asked, but I must summarise, as we have to move on because we are way over time.  There were standalone articles about what was happening in different sections of the property market.  The question is whether there was a targeted investigation programme by the INM group of newspapers in regard to what was considered to be excessive overpricing of property and the impact this was having on purchasers of homes rather than investors.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Regan has made much about having contrarian views in the newspaper.  Morgan Kelly's piece is seen as the defining article.

That partly funded the transfer of the print facility to Citywest, where we invested in new presses and a mail room.

Alastair Campbell, a spin doctor of the former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, has written much about this.  He has articulated fairly clearly what one may describe as the constructive state of mutual antagonism which often exists, broadly speaking, between the public relations industry and journalism.</p><p>Any journalist worth his or her salt knows that there is often a conflict between what is PR and what makes news.  Most journalists can tell the difference.  That is not to say that, perhaps on occasion, those in PR utilise leaking news.  As we know, this happens relentlessly in politics.  The vast majority of journalists and PR people coexist but perhaps in an uneasy world.  That is how it always has been and, I am sure, how it always will be.</p></speech>

It is a case of everybody to his or her own choice.  I do not see the spectre of PR as some new dark force threatening the very existence of the Fourth Estate.  Nor do I see those involved in the industry getting their way with often strong-willed journalists.  The journalist is primarily motivated by trying to obtain copy that is of interest to the public.  PR material is often not of interest to the public.</p></speech>

We heard evidence yesterday to the effect that when the PR material is obtained, a journalist must then contact somebody else involved in the sector.  However, he or she has no time to carry out independent research in order to write a properly rounded article.  As a result, we tend to receive the views of incumbents rather than those of contrarians such as David McWilliams, who is, of course, an honourable exception in all of this.</p></speech>

Another aspect of the backdrop to all of this is the fact that the Republic of Ireland is one of the most competitive media arenas on the planet.  We import a great deal of media material from the UK via the BBC, various satellite television stations and different British radio stations and newspapers.  Generally speaking, Irish newspapers have been pretty competitive for the past number of decades.  They have been obliged to fight fairly hard to survive.  If a newspaper is reproducing a large amount of PR material all the time, this will not prove to be good for it.</p></speech>

Were any such nuances evident during Mr. O'Regan's discussions with his journalists?</p></speech>

However, one must recognise that the Central Bank, the IMF, the regulator and various powerful and influential people were essentially saying that matters were okay.  There may well have been some journalists who had a whiff of unease with regard to what was happening at the time.  There are many stories about which journalists have a whiff of unease but it is necessary to obtain the relevant facts and figures that will keep a publication out of the libel court.  In the context of the entire economic collapse which took place in Ireland, that was the "Watergate story" and, unfortunately, no one in the media got it.  I do not believe that was for the want of trying or effort.  Perhaps some journalists who were good at financial analysis may have had a feeling but nobody could write about it.</p></speech>

The ultimate test is whether people actually read the relevant material.  It actually comes down to what it is they want to read.  Market research surveys have been carried out by various media organisations since time immemorial in the interests of trying to find an answer to the question of what exactly it is that people want.  Ergo, it is very simple: one just produces a newspaper in which one gives people precisely what they ask for.  No more than is the case in politics, the variable of the human condition is profound.</p></speech>

I would like to put to Mr. O'Regan a comment made by Dr. Julien Mercille.  He stated that, "news organisations largely conveyed the views of political and economic elites ...

What are Mr. O'Regan's views in regard to his publication and his time as editor in regard to that comment?</p></speech>

One can say there are the establishment media, in the sense that the media are in existence and are there, so to speak.  Certainly, broad-selling newspapers, both here and in Britain, must reflect the concerns of a mass market.  The demographic breakdown of the <i>Irish Independent</i>readership more or less represents what is broadly described as middle Ireland, town and country people who are fairly well off, but a broad mass who are in the middle and some who are not well off at all.  That has been the overall market position of the paper.</p></speech>

I would be interested in discovering the facts of that particular submission, who it was submitted to and the details of it.  As I said, I have no memory of that and I never wrote him a letter.

This occurred on 30 September 2008, a crucial juncture.  Brendan Keenan said: &quot;[W]e know what the Irish banks' bad loans are, they're going to be about 1% of their loan books.&quot;  Professor Kelly's response to that was: &quot;No, that's complete nonsense.&quot;  Mr. Keenan was appearing on the programme as the economics editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>at the time.  Was there ever any discussion between him and Mr. O'Regan as to his views on banking matters at that critical juncture or was he just offering a personal opinion?</p></speech>

From what I understand of his piece, Morgan Kelly had an input into that study which was seemingly apart from the study <i>per se</i>.  Presumably because Morgan Kelly's views were in the public domain at the time, Brendan Keenan assessed his views and, as I noted earlier, accepted that he was making a valid point should events transpire in certain ways.</p></speech>

Obviously the headline reflected the essential tone of the piece, which was intrinsic to the ESRI's findings.  The essential point I was making, however, is that rather than ignoring an aside conclusion offered by Morgan Kelly, our economics editor took it on board and accepted that he had a valid point.</p></speech>

Foreign investment seems to have grown by 10pc last year.  Exports have picked up after three years in the doldrums.  Booming.  The services and financial sectors are booming, and not all of it is based on property.  What we have is not a crisis, but a big challenge of economic management and adjustment.</blockquote>In regard to Morgan Kelly, he wrote that it was not impossible but we know anything is possible.  I have another question about the piece which is relevant to how it was presented.  It included a major cartoon with the punchline of &quot;loose lips sink booms&quot;.  The cartoon depicted three people wearing gags, with the phrases &quot;doom and gloom&quot; and &quot;economists' meeting&quot; underneath them.  Does Mr. O'Regan think the placement of that cartoon was a reflection on Morgan Kelly's analysis of the Irish economy, with which Brendan Keenan clearly disagreed given his comments in the article?</p></speech>

It may be a reflection of the overall piece.  In many ways, it encapsulates much of the debate about the Irish economy at that time.  As has happened on previous occasions and as continues to happen, two economists were disagreeing about what the future holds.</p></speech>

The last paragraph of the article states:<blockquote><br /><br />In 2002, he was promoted to professor in UCD where he is &quot;highly regarded&quot;, according to one source at the university.  It can be safely assumed that after this latest comment he is a lot less well regarded in Irish banking and stock market circles.</blockquote>This was in 2008.

One of the issues at that point in time was that the overall academic economic entity in the Republic of Ireland was, broadly speaking, unified in a view that did not chime with Professor Kelly's views.  That is why we are speaking about him.  To an extent he was a lone wolf and he is to be admired for having the courage of his convictions in speaking out.</p></speech>

What was filtering down to us was to drive excellence in the product through good reporting and good journalism and to drive excellence on the commercial side, and on commercial side that involved introducing efficiencies.  We have seen a lot of references to cost reduction, unfortunately, but there were also investment.  There was investment in the people.  We have had investment in the printing presses and we have had investment in various channels of distribution, and that is with regard to the newspaper.  Then there was the expansion and the expansion into other businesses and all of that.  I am not sure if that answers the Senator's question.</p></speech>

Moving on from Deputy McGrath's comments, part of the role and work of the inquiry is not just to look to the past but also to look to the future to ensure that the type of crisis that was visited upon the Irish nation is not revisited upon us again.  Not so such in terms of regrets but are there things that they might have done differently with the benefit of hindsight?  In taking on that learning, is there something for the future that Irish media may need to learn from what happened in that past?</p></speech>

We suffered at the time almost unstoppable economic advancement and basic economic textbooks would have told us all that this will not continue the way it is going.<br/><br/>The other point is that in retrospect, from a journalistic point of view, and I adverted to it earlier, all the Irish media, including the <i>Irish Independent</i>, missed one of the really big stories of the time, namely, the problems which were in our banking sector, particularly in a certain number of the banks.  That was hidden from view from practically everybody at the time, perhaps in retrospect on the question of could it or should it have been found out. to go back to the Watergate scandal, they got Nixon but they might not have.  We did not get Nixon.</p></speech>

We probably would have experienced the property bubble with or without the media and, therefore, I do not think it is the media that can be held responsible, but it was the other factors, the demographics, employments levels and income, but, primarily, at the end of the day it was the availability of credit.  That, I think, is where the lessons have to be learned.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Donovan and Ms Kennedy who have been invited to discuss <i>The Irish Times</i>' editorial policy on the economy and the property boom and, separately, the newspaper's business model and sources of revenue, including that from the real estate sector during that period.  Ms Donovan joined the newspaper from ICC Bank in 1977.  She held a number of senior management roles in the company before being appointed managing director of The Irish Times Trust Limited in 2007.  She retired in 2010.  She holds an MSc from Trinity College Dublin and has served as chairperson of NNI, the newspaper industry representative body.  She has been a director of the International Newspaper Marketing Association, INMA, and served in the European national newspaper group of the World Association of Newspapers.  She is also a director of the Children's Medical &amp;amp; Research Foundation, the fund-raising board for Crumlin hospital and the National Children's Research Centre.</p><p>Ms Kennedy was appointed editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>in October 2002, the first woman to hold the post in the history of the newspaper, and retired in June 2011.  She has covered politics for <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, <i>The Sunday Press</i>and<i>The Irish Times</i>for most of her career.  She was a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann between 1987 and 1989 when she served as spokesperson on foreign affairs and Northern Ireland for the Progressive Democrats Party and in the role of Chief Whip.  She was a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the inaugural Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Tier.  As editor, she was awarded five honorary doctorates for her services to journalism by Queen's University Belfast, 2005; Dublin Institute of Technology, 2007; University College Dublin, 2008; Trinity College Dublin, 2009; and the University of Limerick, 2012.

If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and, as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking them to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Ms Kennedy to make her opening statement to the inquiry.</p></speech>

I am speaking as the former editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I retired in June 2011, having been appointed editor in October 2002.<br/><br/>Specifically, I was asked me to address the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy on the economy and the property boom between 2002 and 2007; the approach to reporting on the property market and the economy; and the contribution of the media to public understanding and debate around fiscal-budgetary policies and their implications.  I have also been asked to cover the business model and sources of revenue.  I will deal with that issue later.<br/><br/>I will be as helpful as I can in answering the committee's questions.  In the limited time given to me to prepare this submission I have been unable to review every single aspect of the newspaper&rsquo;s coverage in news, analysis, comment, opinion page, letters to the editor, etc.  I have been asked to account for coverage over six years - 52 weeks a year, six editions per week, adding up to 1,872 publication days.  It was impossible for me to read and review all of the material in every single issue of<i>The Irish Times</i>published in that period and I hope the committee will understand this.  Unfortunately, the archive does not easily facilitate such a detailed analysis.<br/><br/>By way of introduction, I should, first, provide some background on how <i>The Irish Times</i>operates since it may be helpful in our discussion.  Unlike most other newspapers, it is owned by a trust.  There are only a handful of newspapers owned by trusts in the world today.  The main object of The Irish Times Trust Ltd and the company which manages and operates the newspaper, The Irish Times Limited, is &quot;to publish The Irish Times as an independent newspaper primarily concerned with serious issues for the benefit of the community throughout the whole of Ireland free from any form of personal or of party political, commercial, religious or other control&quot;.<br/><br/>The memorandum and articles of association set out the policy principles of the newspaper: the support of constitutional democracy through governments fairly elected; the progressive achievement of social justice between people and the discouragement of discrimination of all kinds; the promotion of a society where the quality of life is enriched by the standards of its education, its art, its culture, and its recreational facilities, and where the quality of spirit is instinct with Christian values but free from all religious bias and discrimination; the promotion of peace and tolerance and opposition to all forms of violence and hatred so that each man may live in harmony with his neighbour [I presume they intended women to be involved also] considerate for his cultural, material and spiritual needs; and the promotion of understanding of other nations and peoples and a sympathetic concern for their well-being.<br/><br/>The objects of <i>The Irish Times</i>require that, in its journalism, news shall be as accurate and comprehensive as is practicable and be presented fairly; comment and opinion shall be informed and responsible, and shall be identifiable from fact; and that special consideration shall be given to the reasonable representation of minority interests and divergent views.  I have appended a copy of the memorandum and articles of association for the committee's perusal.<br/><br/>From the above, the committee can see that <i>The Irish Times</i>has an unusual structure where the managing director and the editor each report independently to the board.  It is designed to ensure the effective management of the newspaper&rsquo;s strategic and commercial functions and the independence of the editor, working within the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy.  There is a partnership of equals with different responsibilities.  It seems appropriate, therefore, that I address  section 1 of the committee's questions and the former managing director, Ms Maeve Donovan, section 2 because of our separate roles.<br/><br/>I was asked to address the context of the banking crisis.  Let me put the reporting of the economy and the property market in the context of some of the other major news events at home and abroad that we covered in <i>The Irish Times</i>between 2002 and 2007 because we were not single-mindedly looking at the property market or the state of the economy.  During that period there were two general elections; the invasion of Iraq; the introduction of the euro; changes in the leadership of Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna F&aacute;il;  ten new members of the European Union; Mary McAleese&rsquo;s election as President; the deaths of Pope John Paul II, Liam Lawlor and Charles J. Haughey;  the historic meeting between Dr. Ian Paisley and former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in Dublin, just to mention a few events.  There was also<i>The Irish Times</i>story in September 2006 that the then Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, was receiving moneys from businessmen while he was Minister for Finance, which was to lead to the newspaper&rsquo;s appearance before the Mahon tribunal and costly challenges in the High Court and the Supreme Court to establish the journalistic right to protect sources.  I have supplied an appendix giving more detail of the types of issue that would have preoccupied an editor at the time.<br/><br/>However, admittedly with the benefit of hindsight, the boom and bust in the economy were the major event that spanned all of these years and had most impact on the lives of the people.</p><p>Editorial policy, by definition, is found in the leaders that express the views of the newspaper as determined by, or on behalf of, the editor every day.  I was able in the limited time available to review the editorials and leaders published in <i>The Irish Times</i>over the 1,872 editions that are the subject of this inquiry.  <i>The Irish Times</i>wrote 289 leaders expressing editorial policy on the economy and the property boom between 2002 and 2007.  They were a major issue of concern in the editorial columns in those years.  There were 38 leading articles in 2002, 73 in 2003, 56 in 2004, 52 in 2005, 31 in 2006 and 39 in 2007.<br/><br/>I am taking a narrow view of what the committee means by the economy and the property boom.  Throughout those years, it is fair to say that the policy of <i>The Irish Times</i>was critical of both the establishment and operation of the Financial Regulator and IFSRA, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, believing they were not independent of the Central Bank.  The newspaper was concerned about the erosion of competitiveness and critical of benchmarking in the determination of public sector pay, cautious about the banks&rsquo; lending policies and the scale of the property market.  As an aside, the chairman of the board of The Irish Times Limited was the Financial Regulator between 2002 and 2008.  I have attached an appendix on editorial policy on the economy and the property boom.<br/><br/>From 2003 onwards, the newspaper was warning that trends in the mortgage market were a cause for concern.  This policy was consistently expressed in editorials in the following years.  By way of illustration, in 2006, the newspaper was calling on the Central Bank and the then Government to analyse the risks the property market posed to future financial stability in an article &ldquo;Rate change cause for moderation&rdquo; on 3 March.  In case I could be accused of being selective, I am presenting all editorials to the committee for its perusal.  I have also written a short summary of the policy positions relevant to the banking inquiry.<br/><br/>In their book, <i>The Fall of the Celtic Tiger: Ireland and the Euro Debt Crisis</i>, the authors Donal Donovan and Antoin E. Murphy identified four separate but related crises that resulted in the collapse of the Irish economy which required an international financial rescue.  These were, first, a property crash as the housing price bubble burst; second, a banking collapse where banks carrying too many non-performing property loans had their solvency questioned; third, fiscal failure as the economy contracted and tax revenue from property collapsed leading to the fourth crisis, sovereign debt.  <i>The Irish Times</i>covered all four crises in detail as these stories unfolded in stages over the years to the best of its ability.  The coverage involved detailed news and analysis by reporters, specialist correspondents in the finance and business fields and the economic editors of that decade.  In effect, Simon Carswell became a full-time specialist in covering the banking crisis.  Extra resources and pagination were provided to the newspaper during this period.  In addition to reporting, <i>The Irish Times</i>commissioned articles about the banking crisis and the property market from specialists and noted academic economists.  Its opinion pages were the platform for divergent views and public debate that often set the agenda and contributed to the national debate.<br/><br/><i>The Irish Times</i>was the only newspaper to publish the article by Morgan Kelly, professor of economics in University College Dublin, predicting there would be a property crash with prices falling by between 40% and 60%.  The first article was carried on 28 December 2006.  Two others were carried subsequently.  Other noted contributors to the debate in the newspaper included the current Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, then professor in Trinity College Dublin, Professors Karl Whelan and Ray Kinsella, both University College Dublin, Brian Lucey, lecturer in finance, Trinity College Dublin, and Alan Ahearne, professor of economics, National University of Ireland, Galway.  He later became an adviser to the late Brian Lenihan, the then Minister for Finance.<br/><br/>The same editorial standards applied in the property supplements as elsewhere in the newspaper.  There was no trade-off between editorial and advertising.  Advertising features were clearly signposted.  Advertisers did not write editorial copy.  We never carried advertorials in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The newspaper had occasion late in 2007 to make a complaint to the professional bodies of auctioneers and valuers that some estate agents were providing the property supplement with misleading selling prices.  The newspaper took the view that if agents were unwilling to supply accurate information or if the vendors were reluctant to disclose the true selling price, then it would be damaging to the credibility of the newspaper to carry the results.  The introduction of the national property register in 2012 was a consequence of this discovery and disclosure in <i>The Irish Times</i>.<br/><br/>This review of editorial policy and the approach to reporting on the property boom in the run-up to the banking crisis proved to be an interesting exercise for me.  I was challenged to consider whether in my then role as editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>journalists could or should have foreseen the multifaceted nature of the financial crisis, including the property crash and the banking collapse.  I do not know what we could have done differently to put ourselves in the position to predict the magnitude of the fall.  We reported the news forensically.  We challenged the consensus and canvassed all views and published them.  The media, as always, were reliant on reporting the views of the specialists, be they Government, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator or the profession of economists.  Journalists were less well-placed than others to make an accurate assessment.</p></speech>

As my colleague Geraldine Kennedy addressed the newspaper&rsquo;s editorial policy in the period in question, I will attempt to answer the committee&rsquo;s questions on the company, its business model, property-related commercial activity and the editorial-commercial relationship.<br/><br/><i>The Irish Times</i>newspaper is published by The Irish Times Limited and its controlling shareholder is The Irish Times Trust Limited.  The Irish Times Limited exists to publish <i>The Irish Times</i>.  It is prohibited from providing dividends to its shareholders.  Accordingly, all profits are retained in the company.  The Irish Times Trust Limited has certain powers under the memorandum and articles to appoint and remove directors of The Irish Times Limited, to call general meetings and the control of significant acquisitions and disposals.  The primary role of the trust is to appoint a board which it believes will ensure the company is well run and adheres to its core objects.  Thereafter, the trust leaves the board to get on with it.  The board has the responsibility of adhering to the main object concerning the quality and independence of <i>The Irish Times.</i>The trust acts a second guarantor or long stop, a responsibility grounded in the trust as a whole.<br/><br/>Editorial policy at <i>The Irish Times</i>is the responsibility of the board of The Irish Times Limited.  In practical terms, day-to-day policy is executed by the editor and team in the context of the memorandum and articles of the company.  The core requirement is trust, integrity and balance.  As managing director, I had no input into day to day editorial decisions.  The managing director is, however, responsible for the overall viability, performance and development of the business, including responsibility for strategy.<br/><br/>Regarding business model and sources of revenue 2002 to 2007, <i>The Irish Times</i>business model is a traditional one in the quality newspaper sector in Europe and elsewhere.  Newsgathering and all ancillary activities are funded by a combination of cover price and newspaper sales revenue, subscription revenue and advertising revenue, both print and digital.  During the inquiry&rsquo;s reference period, growing revenues derived from printing external publications.  The latter commenced in 2002 with the commissioning of the company&rsquo;s new printing plant at Citywest.  The ratio of advertising to circulation revenue was typically 60:40 on average.  This moved up and down depending on the state of the economy.  Key advertising sectors, particularly for quality newspaper titles, are property, recruitment, general classifieds including motors and display or run-of-paper advertising.</p><p>The classifieds include cars and small ads in various categories.  The run-of-paper advertising is largely about retail, food, financial services and so on.<br/><br/>During the reference period, the steady advance of digital media, and hence digital advertising, was a key strategic challenge for the company. This remains the case for <i>The Irish Times</i>and indeed all print media, as the pace of digital adoption continues to increase.<br/><br/>On the importance of property-related revenues to the overall revenue mix, property is a key pillar of the newspaper&rsquo;s publishing revenue.  The commercial property supplement in Wednesday&rsquo;s newspaper and the residential property supplement on Thursday are important to readers as well as advertisers.  The readers of <i>The Irish Times</i>have a strong interest in both residential and commercial property.  They are buyers for both categories and many are also property investors.  In addition to the dedicated supplements, <i>The Irish Times</i>also provides extensive coverage on homes, interiors and related lifestyle content.  In an overall context, therefore, property is a key driver of readership both print and online for <i>The Irish Times</i>.  From an advertising perspective, <i>The Irish Times</i>'s audience is of particular interest to companies trading in the sector.  This has been the case for decades and certainly through my entire period at the newspaper.  The company&rsquo;s acknowledged success in the property advertising market has attracted new domestic and UK players into this market and into the sector.<br/><br/>When I came to work for <i>The Irish Times</i>in 1977, it was the market leader in the property sector.  That position was maintained through the 1980s and 1990s, through the reference period, and it continues today.  Through the decades there have been new market entrants in both print and digital formats.  The market is highly competitive and highly diversified.  Globally, the long-standing success of newspapers in the pillar categories of property and recruitment is what gave rise, in large part, to the arrival of standalone digital websites and the resulting disruption of the newspaper&rsquo;s commercial model.<br/><br/>During the reference period, the company sought to balance increasing exposure to the property sector through a range of diverse activities.  The most notable of these was the development of strong external printing revenues from the Citywest plant.<br/><br/>The relationship between the editorial and commercial functions is clearly drawn in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Irish Times Trust.  It specifies that editorial content in the newspaper shall be &quot;free from any form of personal or party political, commercial religious or other sectional control&quot;.  That separation is carefully maintained under the stewardship of both the trust and the board.  This requirement of the company is deeply embedded in the company's culture.  It is heavily emphasised from the induction of new staff onwards, and it is fundamental to the way in which the company operates.<br/><br/>At a macro level, everybody in the organisation understands the importance of advertising to the enterprise.  At the micro level, all staff, both editorial and commercial, are aware of the necessity of maintaining the separation of editorial and commercial activities.  Customers of the business are also very much aware of this.  This does mean that clients do not sometimes complain, but the role of the business team, especially its management, is to act as a buffer between commercial interests and the producers of editorial content.  This practice is regarded within the company as a key asset, and the independence of the newspaper is emphatically stressed when the newspaper is marketed to clients.  It is one of the key differentiators of <i>The Irish Times</i>within the Irish newspaper sector.<br/><br/>On engagement in property-related commercial activity, during the reference period <i>The Irish Times</i>engaged in two notable transactions.  The first was the purchase of the website <i>myhome.ie</i>.  As early as the late 1990s, <i>The Irish Times</i>sought to secure its position in key markets as revenue started to migrate from print to digital media.  Standalone classified sites had started to proliferate, particularly in Europe and the USA.  Obtaining a market-leading property site in the sector became a key strategic objective for the company and, hence, for the management team.  Along the way, the company developed several digital iterations in the property sector.  We had <i>ireland.com/property</i>, and owned the ireland.com portal at that time.  We also had <i>irishtimesproperty.com</i>and <i>nicemove.ie</i>.  Despite considerable investment and marketing activity, none of these sites proved to be viable competition for <i>myhome.ie</i>, which was the market leader and had grown exponentially from its launch in 2000.  Therefore, our company&rsquo;s intentions turned to growth by acquisition.  The <i>myhome.ie</i>business became available for sale in 2006.  The Irish Times Limited retained NCB as an adviser for the bidding process.  There was a competitive process with at least two other bidders involved.  The acquisition was unanimously approved by the board of The Irish Times Limited and the transaction was approved by the shareholder, the Irish Times Trust.  The website became part of the Irish Times Group and today it remains a key strategic asset of <i>The Irish Times</i>and trades profitably.  <i>The Irish Times </i>has a strong position in both print and digital media in a sector which has substantial revenue streams, which will help to protect the title into the future.  Successfully making the migration from print to digital is essential to the survival of <i>The Irish Times</i>and indeed to all print media.<br/><br/>The second transaction was the sale of the D&rsquo;Olier Street and Fleet Street premises and the leasing of the Irish Times building in Tara Street from Dublin City Council.  During 2005 and 2006, the company had been examining changing work practices and creating an appropriate environment for a changing business.  Various options were examined, including extensive remodelling of its listed buildings in D&rsquo;Olier Street.  The cost of redevelopment was prohibitive and inevitably required compromising on the space requirements.  Therefore, the decision was made to seek modern accommodation within the city centre, proximate to key sites such as the D&aacute;il.  A suitable property was identified and the D&rsquo;Olier Street and Fleet Street buildings were sold in 2007.  The company transferred operations to Liffey House in Tara Street, a facility which was much more suitable for the development of the newspaper and a range of digital business interests.  The price achieved, &euro;29.1 million, was considerably higher than the company had anticipated.</p></speech>

In the first few years I was there, it did not change a lot in many ways.  The big technological change was probably the move to photo-typesetting in the first instance.  That was a huge, traumatic change in the industry.  Then, at the end of the 1980s, there was the arrival of colour.  That again facilitated growth and change in the business, but the pace of change as we moved into the mid-1990s just took off like a runaway train in the industry globally.  A large part of that was to do with the process around the disruption of any industry.  It was not unlike communications or the phone industry.  People from outside the media industry could see that a large amount of revenue was running through this business.  With the developments in technology, they were looking at ways in which they could disrupt that industry and take some of that business away.  That was not necessarily immediately apparent in the late 1990s in the Irish market from an advertising perspective.</p><p>However, it must be said that <i>The Irish Times</i>was always at the forefront technologically.  We were first into colour printing and we were first into publishing the newspaper online.  <i>The Irish Times</i>was one of the first newspapers in Europe to publish online in 1994, which was a very long time ago.<br/><br/>The ad market and the disruption in advertising, however, moved much faster than the reader transition, as it were.  We found that the information and data that we were gathering as we moved towards the back end of that decade - these were derived from our contacts internationally with the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>and newspapers throughout Europe and, indeed, on study tours that we-----</p></speech>

There may be a requirement at times for the two to talk about what is happening in the real world outside the newspaper as well.  It seems to coincide with the purchase of <i>MyHome.ie</i>that a very significant article in the witnesses' newspaper, through Professor Morgan Kelly, said that the property market was going to crash.  The newspaper was investing in a website that was promoting a product that was going to go into a very, very serious time.  Was there any awareness of that during the discussion to purchase the website?</p></speech>

Let me deal with the price.  We were, as I said to the Chairman, professionally advised.  There were other bidders, so it was a competitive bidding process.  Indeed, we did make an earlier bid that was turned down.  However, the view that we took was that we were buying a very profitable business with very significant revenue streams that were not being affected by transition.  We were taking a very long view.  <i>MyHome.ie</i>is a critical part of <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  It will be in ten years and it will be in 20 years.</p></speech>

The Senator probably knows where it operates.  It operates on the very same floor in the very same building of the Central Bank.  It was known to have been created to do what was called soft-touch regulation.  If one was going to bother appointing a regulator at all, one would give it authority and powers.  We did not know then how much it would have been needed.  I put that point in here because I anticipated that the committee would ask how <i>The Irish Times</i>could be independent with the chairman of the regulatory authority on its board.  We were independent.  That is a very good example for the committee.

It is most unusual.  One would often see it in politics, health and other areas, but not in the business and finance area.</p></speech>

He did have concerns.  What is interesting as well is that, because he wanted to investigate it further, I freed him up from other markings.  He got a paid leave of absence to write the books that he spoke to the committee about and all that.  It was a very worthwhile use of resources by <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p></speech>

I remember him getting that interview.  It would have been one of the areas where we would have demonstrated different views in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  One has to consider, I think, the position that I was in as editor as the whole story involved.  It was sort of moving in stages.  There was no point where I would have said there would be a crash or there would be a soft landing.  In any case, I would not have the expertise to make that personal judgment myself, but what we were very careful to do was to give every view on the issue and give everybody a say.  There was nobody who offered opinions to the opinions page or other pages of <i>The Irish Times</i>who was not allowed to express a view.</p></speech>

That is important.  If one says something often enough, it will happen.  If one were to keep saying now that Fine Gael and the Labour Party would form the next Government or Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael or Sinn F&eacute;in and somebody else, one is bound to get something right at some time.  Morgan Kelly offered an article in December 2006 to the business section of The Irish Times predicting a crash of the scale of between 40% and 60%.  Peter Murtagh, who is the opinion editor - I hope the Chairman does not mind me mentioning his name - contacted Morgan Kelly subsequently and invited him to write other material because he was the only one at that time expressing that view.<br/><br/>It is my clear understanding that Morgan Kelly's article was turned down by the <i>Sunday Business Post </i>and one of the <i>Independent </i>newspapers, either the <i>Irish Independent </i>or <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  I cannot say which one it was and I do not know whether members asked the <i>Irish Independent</i>team about that in the previous session because we were outside the committee room at the time.  </p></speech>

Is this an abdication by the Fourth Estate?  That is what I am concerned about.  The Irish Times has a track record, having got Milton Friedman and Morgan Kelly and it also got a strong line on the McDowell report.</p></speech>

Mr. Brady wrote an article which we published in The Irish Times.  It reflected exactly what Senator Barrett is asking.  His conclusion in the article was that maybe we had so many specialists that we did not join the dots together.  Maybe that is the case but if one looks back into recent history, is that not the case also with the child abuse crisis, the role of the Catholic Church, the Magdalen laundries, Letterfrack and everything?  It is grand to say in hindsight that one knew everything when the jigsaw fits into place years later.  I believe that is the position we are in.</p></speech>

Was that the reason Ms Kennedy was feeling pessimistic?  Would most journalists prefer to be in public relations rather than being investigative journalists?</p></speech>

As a breed, they do not like public relations people but PR people are part of life today.  I am sure the committee has a PR person.  Look at all the D&aacute;il questions that are asked about how much the Health Service Executive spends every year.  Look at how much Irish Water is spending to communicate on behalf of the Government.  PR people are part of life and any journalist worth his or her salt will deal with them.</p></speech>

In the Bowes pub kind of setting it was certainly the story that one building society in particular went out of its way to recruit journalists and give them mortgages.

In other words, it was happening in another era.<br/><br/>I wish to raise another issue, if I may be allowed, arising from yesterday's proceedings and Mr. Harry Browne's presentation.  I have some respect for Mr. Browne's views because he worked in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  However, I am also conscious and aware of his antipathy towards <i>The Irish Times</i>over the circumstances of his departure.  That being said, he made a reference yesterday which could be grossly interpreted by the committee when he suggested to Senator MacSharry or perhaps Deputy Michael McGrath that there was some big property scam in <i>The Irish Times</i>and the Senator or Deputy asked whether this meant they got bricks and mortar. </p></speech>

It happened in the 1970s and if the inquiry is interested in the issue, it was written about by Frank McDonald, an expert from The Irish Times whom the committee also called before it, on page 216 of his book, The Destruction of Dublin.  This concerned events that took place in the early 1970s.  As a result of this controversy, new ethics guidelines were agreed with the National Union of Journalists and introduced in The Irish Times.</p></speech>

The question is whether one would allow that to influence the policy of the newspaper and I can categorically say that I never did.</p></speech>

To illustrate the issue, I remember Pat Rabbitte saying at one stage or other that the article by Morgan Kelly rocked the foundations of the State.  People from the property sector were saying it would rock the foundation of The Irish Times, we would never get an advertisement again and it was damaging the credibility of the country.  I became aware of this but it did not stop from publishing Morgan Kelly again.</p></speech>

The whole tone of the property supplement is so saccharine and gushing that it must be different from the rest of the newspaper.</p></speech>

The Senator could be confusing the advertisements with the editorial material.  There has to be an editorial balance of about 40% and 60% between editorial and advertisements.  Often, the poor old property editor would be pulling out his or her hair  - there were two of them in my time - on a Tuesday when more and more ads would come in during the years of the boom because the supplement would have to be increased by two pages and these would have to be filled.  A lot of critical stories were published in the property supplement as well.  I think it was Dr. Mercille who asked a question yesterday about when The Irish Times had ever covered affordable housing.  I have ten editorials covering affordable housing and I can leave them with the inquiry if members wish.  The people who wrote about affordable housing, half of whom wrote about it in the property supplement, included Dr. Garret FitzGerald, Fintan O'Toole and Des Geraghty who was head of an affordable housing association at the time.</p><p>These issues were tackled in the property sector as well, so much so that a lot of complaints were made to the property sector.  </p></speech>

My job was to head them off at the pass.  I have lost count of the number of times over the years that various people from all walks of life and strands of business would contact me complaining about various aspects of the paper.  It could be content, positioning, price or any one of a range of factors.  In truth, where content was concerned my response essentially would be to listen.  A lot of people simply wanted to vent and decided &quot;I am going to ring <i>The Irish Times</i>and give them hell&quot;.  It was to my desk that they came.</p></speech>

We start from that process.  As I said, my instinct was generally to let them vent and talk it down.  If it was of huge interest, clearly we would have a conversation about it, but we are operating within a context in which there are no circumstances whatever in <i>The Irish Times</i>where there can be intrusion into the editorial space.  I think that is very well understood and, unlike with other newspapers, it is a codified process.  You know from the first day you walk into D'Olier Street - as it was then - what the rules of the game are.  The Deputy might consider that from a commercial perspective this was a negative, but I have always regarded it as a positive.  There was such clarity around it and our advertiser audience was very well informed about it as well.  It adds strength to the paper.</p></speech>

The way it is expressed is that the board owns editorial policy.  I gave the Deputy the principles of editorial policy as per the memorandum and articles of association.  On an operational basis, it is up to the board to see that they are implemented.  I even found this strange myself.  In a bit of research I did before coming before the committee, I had somebody go back through all the board reports for the inquiry period of 2002-07 and editorial policy on the financial crisis and the property market.  The property bubble, or however the Deputy would like to define it, was never raised or discussed.</p></speech>

It was not that it was not minuted - it was never discussed at the board of The Irish Times.  Individual board members at different times might have asked why I was not doing this, that or the other, and I would say to them "Well, that is not the policy that I intend pursuing at this time."  There was a point, for example, at which the new chairman, David Went, asked why I would not write an editorial supporting the banks and I said I had not yet done so because the haircut had not been announced and I was waiting to see how much taxpayers would have to pay.  I would not be doing an editorial in the interest of the banks but in the interests of our readers and taxpayers.  I basically said that if he had any issue with that we could have a discussion on the board about it.  There never was a discussion.</p></speech>

To clarify a little bit how editorial policy flows from the board, it is set in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Irish Times Trust.  That is devolved for discussion where there would be major issues, addressing policy to the board of Irish Times Limited.  However, the board, in large part, allows those issues to devolve to the editor and the editorial team.  On a day-to-day basis, that is how it works.  The structure in <i>The Irish Times</i>gives a more clearly defined and higher level of protection and independence to the editor than might be the case in other structures.</p></speech>

This system actually works very well and is very well understood in <i>The Irish Times</i>, in case we are not explaining it correctly.  At board meetings I have a say, like any other member of the board, as a director on strategic decisions.  I would express a view and all that, just as Ms Donovan could express a view if the board was discussing editorial policy.  One thing the board spent a very long time discussing - it came up <i>ad infinitum</i>at every single board meeting for a period - was the establishment of the Press Council and the Press Ombudsman.  Every member of the board, including me, would express a view on it.  I was delighted with that - it is great to be able to tease something out and get support on something.</p></speech>

I did not feel strongly enough about it because there was a case for diversifying in The Irish Times and property was a big revenue stream for the newspaper.

First, as Geraldine has said, she would have had reservations and would have liked to have more money to spend on other things at the time.  However, her opposition was not to what was accepted as the problem, namely the migration from print to digital.  I will give the Deputy an earlier example that might illustrate this for him.  The job of the editor and the entire journalistic team is very much focused on the issues of today and the immediate future.  It is very different for the business.  If we go back to the end of the 1980s when The Irish Times introduced colour printing, we had a very eminent editor, Mr. Douglas Gageby.   At that time, despite the investment, Mr. Gageby said that there would not be colour on the front page of the newspaper until Ian Paisley cut the tape on the Border.  I can tell the Deputy that within months there was colour from one end to the other of the editorial pages.  It took time for him to be sold on the idea.  That is the issue with strategic decisions.  The business must look at strategic issues over a very long period of time.</p></speech>

The very important point about myhome.ie is that it is a digital business.  It is a stand-alone business and it does not have any editorial content or position.  So it is a drain from our revenue.</p></speech>

Those same political parties loudly protested that those donations had absolutely no effect on their policies or how they might deal with issues in Government but nobody believed them.  Should they believe newspapers when they say that massive advertising revenue of that order would have absolutely no influence on how those newspapers dealt with the property bubble, for example, and the issues that it raised regarding developers, speculation, profiteering and so forth?</p></speech>

Ms Donovan has given a figure of &euro;100 million over six years.  In the year 2005, for example, in the annual accounts of The Irish Times, it cost &euro;45.13 million to produce the paper.  The editorial budget of The Irish Times was in or around the &euro;30 million mark for the nine years that I was there.  That is a huge editorial budget which enabled us to have a correspondent in London, Washington, Paris, Berlin, one in Moscow for a while and one in China.  We had two correspondents in Northern Ireland during that decade but there is only one there now.  That all costs an awful lot of money but it is part of the role of The Irish Times, which is to give an independent view of world events as a neutral country.  The Independent, our main competitor, has no foreign correspondent at all.  What one reads in that paper is British newspapers' views on things like the Iraq War, to which we sent reporters.  Given that a newspaper has to finance itself either by selling newspapers or advertising, I was delighted that we got a lot of money from property because it enabled us to provide wonderful coverage.</p></speech>

Research by Dr. Julien Mercille, who appeared before the committee yesterday, found a strong preference for fiscal consolidation or austerity policies in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  For example, his research outlined that 57% of all opinion articles and editorials in <i>The Irish Times</i>discussing Irish Government budgets between 2008 and 2013 supported austerity with opposition only to specific cuts voiced by 15%.  Does Ms Kennedy think that is balanced journalism to give that massive support, on the face of it, to austerity with all the effects on the victims of the bubble and to support it in that way?</p></speech>

Without doubt he was the finest conspiracy theorist I have heard in a long time.  I was disappointed that his material was not evidence based.  He gave one fact in his submission which was that there 40,000 articles written in <i>The Irish Times</i>about economic policy and the property boom and only 78 about affordable housing.  That is absolutely wrong.  It is very easy to press a button and get &quot;property bubble&quot; without taking into account all the other formulations of expressing that same phenomenon.  Between the years 2008 and 2013 the country was banjaxed, it was bankrupt.  Unless we want it to be Greece, one had to try to bring the country out of the mire.  I noted yesterday that he seemed to support Argentina and in something else I read about him he supported-----</p></speech>

That certainly is confidential to <i>The Irish Times</i>.  What I would say is that it was a very profitable business at the time and we took the view that it was a very long-term acquisition for us because of the pace of migration to digital.  It was our expectation that the primary source of revenue in the long run, not just in that area but potentially others as well, would be digital rather than print and that was the threat we were trying to mitigate.</p></speech>

The reason I am trying to get at this is not about the profitability of the company-----</p></speech>

I know Ms Donovan has said on the record before, when she was asked if she regretted this investment, that she did not.  Are they the same sentiments she has with <i>myhome.ie</i>today?</p></speech>

Our expectation was that as the business moved steadily out of print and into digital, it was critical for us to have a position there.  I will give the Deputy an example that might be of use in setting this in context, specifically about the pace of change.  There is an article in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>business pages that the Deputy might want to have a look at.  It says that in the past 12 months, &euro;1 of every &euro;3 spent on digital has been spent on mobile.  For a business like <i>myhome.ie</i>, if there were no mobile platform, that money would be going every faster.  It comes back to this issue that we must position ourselves with future technology if we are to protect <i>The Irish Times</i>for the long haul, and that, fundamentally, is what <i>myhome.ie</i>does and will do long into the future.</p></speech>

I want to take up the issue of <i>myhome.ie</i>and clarify a number of points.

This company was growing and was suddenly put up for sale in 2006.  We now know that July 2006 was a watershed in terms of the property market.  <i>The Irish Times</i>bought <i>myhome.ie</i>during 2006.  When Ms Donovan was considering the purchase of <i>myhome.ie</i>, did she reflect on the fact that three of the top estate agents and one of the top banks were the principal shareholders in <i>myhome.ie</i>and that they were selling out at a time when the market clearly was reaching its peak?  <i>The Irish Times</i>bought at the peak of the market.</p></speech>

Mr. Browne said that the political and economic elites set the agenda in Irish media circles.  In the broader context of the Irish media, what is her view on that statement?</p></speech>

I will speak for <i>The Irish Times</i>and not for the broader media because I do not know the details of how other media are run.  One could not be a quality, independent newspaper like <i>The Irish Times</i>, with a reputation around the world, without covering the Parliament - and we are the only paper in Ireland which still devotes a page to the D&aacute;il - and without covering the Government, the trade unions and what Dr. Mercille would regard as the elites.  That is what a national newspaper does.  The important thing is that we also cover suicide, social exclusion, poverty and other issues as well as representing minority interests, as we are mandated to do.  I do not know how one could be <i>The Irish Times</i>and not cover what Dr. Mercille would call the elites, which would include places such as his own university, UCD.</p></speech>

They were the media's links with corporate and governmental sectors, advertising pressures and sourcing issues.  What is Ms Kennedy's view on that?</p></speech>

I never came under pressure because of advertising to take any line on anything.

It would be very unusual to be the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>and not have the odd meeting with the Taoiseach of the day to be briefed on policy.  I remember Brian Cowen doing so and I would have had meetings with Bertie Ahern and Brian Lenihan.  They never involved pressure relating to the property sector or financial interests.  One likes to be informed.  An editor has to write editorials and reach out to readers, so he or she must be informed.  I would, on occasion, have telephoned someone for a briefing on something I did not know enough about.  I regard that, though, as a normal exchange of views.</p></speech>

Vested interests would be very annoyed if we wrote things they did not like, but that is normal.  Some very strange things did, however, take place at <i>The Irish Times</i>which surprised even me.  For example, ambassadors accredited to Ireland get their seal of office from the President of the day and they expect and demand a meeting with the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>within a week.  It is as though they have not really arrived until that happens.  On one occasion a judge made contact indirectly to say a photograph was being sent.  He complained that his photograph had not been put in the paper.  Having received his seal of office three days earlier, he felt no one would know he had been made a judge until <i>The Irish Times</i>said so.  It is a strange place.</p></speech>

I know from some of the commentary the committee has had over the last while that <i>The Guardian</i>is regarded as whiter than white in its behaviour.  With regard to digital acquisitions, <i>The Guardian</i>was first out of the traps and paid an extraordinary amount of money in the 1990s for <i>AutoTrader</i>, a car website.  <i>AutoTrader</i>subsequently bought <i>carzone.ie</i>and has had a strong presence on this island as a result.  I have never heard anyone suggest <i>The Guardian</i>went easy on the automotive industries because of that.  I am sorry as that is a digression.</p></speech>

At the peak, 17% of total revenue for the business was accounted for by property-related advertising.  We have had evidence already from the <i>Irish Independent</i>and <i>Sunday Independent</i>that, on average, property-related advertising revenue accounted for 9% of total revenue and perhaps up to 11% at the peak.  The <i>Irish Examiner</i>indicated yesterday 11% to 12% of advertising revenue was accounted for by property-related advertising revenue and it came to 7% of total revenue.</p></speech>

A significant proportion of those who read <i>The Irish Times</i>are businesspeople and property investors.  Advertising chases its most relevant audience.  That is why we have such a strong showing for property.  One of the factors with regard to the low percentage that some of the other titles have given the committee is down to the mix of revenue they carry.  In the case of the <i>Irish Independent</i>and the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, one will see page after page of advertising for supermarkets.  One will not see that in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Proportionality, the mix is different.  Recruitment would also be important to <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p></speech>

However, Ms Donovan stated in her opening statement, &quot;During the reference period the company sought to balance increasing exposure to the property sector through a range of diverse activities.&quot;  However, the largest investment the company made in its history was directly linked to the health of the property sector.  How does Ms Donovan reconcile that?</p></speech>

Did it instead rely on the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, and Press Council codes like the other newspaper titles?</p></speech>

Journalists were not to take them.  One would not accept trips from people.  The Israeli Government on several occasions would have invited journalists from Europe to go on a street trip to Israel.  When <i>The Irish Times</i>was involved, it would have expected to be able to set the agenda on where it could go and what it wanted to see.  It would be stated at the end of any such articles as to who had paid for them.</p></speech>

I do not know what I could do that we did not do.  We reported all news reports fairly and gave their views, some of vested interests, some of banks.  We particularly pursued academic economists.  We had as diverse a range of views as we possibly could in the opinion pages on the state of the economy.  We employed an economics editor all the time which other newspapers often did not do.  We were very cautious and raising concerns in leading articles for a long time up to the bust.  I do not know what we could have done.  I would love to be able to say if I pressed that button and did that, then would I have been Morgan Kelly but I would not.</p></speech>

I do not know.  If they were to go out and buy them they have to get mortgages and everything like that.  We were not telling them to go out and buy them or get mortgages.

I do not think that because we ran property advertisements in <i>The Irish Times</i>that the average reader, of <i>The Irish Times, </i>was running into the street, waving their chequebook and saying, &quot;I'm going to pay an inflated price for whatever&quot;.</p></speech>

Dr. Nyberg, I think, said to the committee that when he ranked the factors that contributed from Nos. 1 to 7, he put the media at No. 7.  Did we have some role?  Of course we had some role.

That is the greatest thing that <i>The Irish Times</i>has going for it, if one is a journalist for the newspaper.<br/><br/>There is, of course, interaction.  We have not said this but I suppose it is worth saying.  There is a weekly management meeting which would be made up of some editors, departmental heads, marketing, advertising, promotion, managing director and editor where one talks about plans for the week ahead.  It is where we would say, &quot;We are doing a series on suicide and we think you should promote it&quot;.  There would be that sort of interaction or one could not survive.  One is selling two things in a newspaper - sales and news.  One has to have interaction because one is moving at such a pace.  One has a deadline driven environment every day so of course there is interaction.  It is a bit pure to say there is no interaction because there simply has to be.  One must get on to the printing plant in Citywest and say the paper is going to be such a size on such a night.  The two sides of the house have to work together on it.<br/><br/>I would doubt myself that if we are not white as snow the <i>Irish Independent</i>is that pure.  I know that Denis O'Brien, for example, was on to me about an advertisement, to get me to insert it, about the Mahon tribunal.  I know that Sam Smith, and the committee probably know it themselves as he would tell them, went off down to cover the Mahon tribunal when Mr. O'Brien was before it yet not a word appeared in the newspaper.  That sort of thing would not happen in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p></speech>

I welcome our visitors.  There are some matters arising.  I did not interpret Mr. Browne's evidence as hostile in any way.  The matter of how I interpreted what he was saying yesterday only arose today.</p> <p>  I will move on to other matters.  Does the training of journalists equip them to deal with the kind of crisis that this inquiry is investigating?</p> <p>  Reference was made to pressures that people exercise on editors.  I think this will surprise the people watching at home.  They do not ring up a judge before a case.  They do not even ring up a referee before an important match.  Therefore, the idea that so much of this influence is being sought to be exercised is quite a serious new finding for those of us outside journalism.  I suppose it depends on what the bar of public opinion will decide about that.</p> <p>  Did the discussions with the former Minister, Brian Lenihan, include how important it was, in his view, that the banks should be bailed out?</p></speech>

Some contributor to the committee made the point that they should all be trained in financial journalism.  Financial journalism is only one aspect of a newspaper.  Therefore, we do not want them all trained in financial journalism.  We had economics writers.  We had Simon Carswell, who specialised in the banks to such an extent that the committee invited him to appear.  I thank the committee for that.  We had Frank McDonald, who specialised in planning.  Therefore, different journalists at different times specialise, often learning it on the hoof out in the field.  I do not think there is anything wrong necessarily with the training of journalists, because if the whole economics profession, with the exception of your David McWilliams and my Morgan Kelly, did not see any sort of crash, then how could I have trained a journalist to see it?</p></speech>

However, within <i>The Irish Times</i>, if what might be deemed a distasteful or garish ad or something like that came up, the advertising manager or his deputy would come to me and point out that it was going in tomorrow and might ask whether that was okay.  On some occasions I would say &quot;No&quot;.  The other thing they would be looking for is to shape ads.  They might want the ad to be a given way so that the ad was the feature on the page and the editorial was simply dressing, whereas I would always insist that it should be the other way around, because it is a newspaper and the ads should go around the stories.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was contacted by Denis O'Brien because he had put in an ad which was pulled by me from the newspaper.  He must have been told that the editor had pulled it.  Then, the next time he wanted to put in an ad he wrote directly to me and put it to me that I would be making the decision anyway.  That was the reason for that particular contact.</p></speech>

I will wrap things up but before I do, I wish to return to a couple of matters.  In her opening statement, Ms Kennedy states on page 4 that she thinks &quot;... it is fair to say that the policy of <i>The Irish Times</i>was critical of both the establishment and operation of the Financial Regulator and IFSRA, believing that they were not independent of the Central Bank&quot;.  Will she elaborate on this statement?</p></speech>

I think that is now practically an established fact.</p></speech>

For us, on the business side, it has been a very good experience to go back and review in a more forensic way our planning and so on.  I could not point to anything of any significance which has changed for us in terms of how we go about our business.  It reassured us with regard to the fact that we have a very robust model.  Given our structure, what we do is earn as much as we can to invest in good journalism, to put people out where the current editor wants them to go and to finance the type of appeal with regard to sources that Ms Kennedy spoke about earlier.  We were able to spend over &euro;1 million on appealing to the European Court of Human Rights on the protection of sources because we carry a lot of property, recruitment and motor ads.  This is the way in which we operate.  We have a very circular process.  Everything goes back into the product and into ensuring its longevity.</p></speech>

We are focusing on the role of the media during the property boom in the lead-in to the banking crisis in the period 2002 to 2007.  Our next session will look at any changes in approach after the crisis.  I welcome Mr. Ed Mulhall and Mr. Paul Mulligan, who are specifically invited to discuss RTE's editorial policy on the economy and the property boom, and separately RTE's business model and sources of revenue, including that from the real estate sector, from 2002 to 2007.</p><p>Mr. Ed Mulhall is a Trinity College Dublin politics and economics graduate.  He joined RTE as a radio producer in features and current affairs in 1979.  He was appointed assistant head of features and current affairs in 1985.  He became a television producer in 1998 before moving to RTE News as a programme editor for the launch of &quot;Six One News&quot;.  He became managing editor of television news in 1994, director of news in 1997 and managing director of news and current affairs in 2002.  Mr. Mulhall had a lead role in all the general election coverage since 1981 and was a producer and executive producer on a number of documentaries.  He retired from RTE in March 2012.</p><p>Mr. Paul Mulligan has been head of operations of RTE television since 2009.  From 2005 to 2009 he was head of operations, sales and marketing of RTE television and radio.  He is chair of the Joint National Listenership Research, JNLR, data implementation group and director of the Advertising Standards Authority.  Mr. Mulligan holds an MA in economics from Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada.</p><p>Before I begin I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and, as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking witnesses to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Mr. Mulhall and Mr. Mulligan are both very welcome before the inquiry.  In their own choice of sequence, they should commence with their opening statements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-03-26a.1468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Mulhall" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015032600002#KK00200"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  The starting premise for a discussion of RTE's editorial policy on any area of public interest is that there is no single expression of it.  RTE's output is based on a set of principles which are derived from its statutory obligations.  These principles form the framework for editorial decision-making, and there is an editorial structure in place to monitor, discuss and challenge the editorial selections being made to ensure these principles are adhered to.  In RTE News this translates into a very simple premise: inform the audience in the public interest.</p> <p>  The political scientist, Jean Blondel, in an essay written in honour of the late RTE broadcaster, Brian Farrell, calls the role to inform "the noblest of tasks" because it is the most difficult.  It requires the reporting of facts, sometimes the establishment of facts, their selection according to their importance and the presentation of them with related material to allow their meaning or significance to be understood.  Referring to a concept of a national consensus, Brian Farrell himself described it as a living, flexible and loose set of shared ways of looking and ordering experience, constantly adjusting to and affected by the changes that these experiences represent.  He agreed that the whole concept of a free press in a free society supposes that any established or emergent ideology should be constantly open to challenge and criticism.</p> <p>  This is the basis for judging how RTE and other media performed their functions in the period under scrutiny.  Did it live up to this responsibility to inform?  Did it strive to establish the important facts in the rapidly changing environment?  Did it provide vigilance and challenge to assist understanding?  It is my personal view that RTE performed its public service role well in the period under discussion.  Could we have done better?  Of course we could.</p> <p>  An expression of RTE&rsquo;s view of its obligations is found in its vision mission values statement: to inform and to connect with the lives of all the people and deliver the most trusted, independent Irish news service, accurate and impartial, for the connected age.  The Broadcasting Acts are explicit in their requirement of news to be &ldquo;reported and presented in an objective and impartial manner and without any expression of the broadcaster&rsquo;s own views".  RTE's public service statement specifically requires it to remain independent of any vested interest.  RTE prepares an annual series of commitments based on these principles and strategic objectives.  It reports on these in its annual report.  This forms part of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's review of RTE activities.</p> <p>  To ensure the delivery of these basic principles RTE has developed a series of journalism guidelines.  In my written statement I have gone into detail on the structures which deliver and monitor content.  There is no single editorial vision when it comes to RTE content.  For news, story selection has a variety of editorial inputs throughout the day, particularly from the specialist correspondents.  For programmes, each unit makes its own independent selection of what to feature, often in competition with other RTE output.  This process is overseen by an editorial conference structure that in my experience allows, and often encourages, editorial debate and challenge.  It is a structure which operates in a legal and compliance framework, requiring it to be vigilant of its responsibilities and to respond to complaints, representations and legal challenge promptly.  It is a structure with clear lines of editorial responsibility.  I can only speak subjectively about how RTE performed during the period.</p><p>There has been little or no authoritative objective media analysis that I have seen that assists any other approach.</p><p> It is worth remembering that there is a vast amount of material in the regular news bulletins and other current affairs programmes.  The two main correspondents in news have nearly 2,000 reports logged to them in television alone for this period and "Prime Time" did 120 programmes from 2000 to 2008 on the subject matter of this inquiry, with a third of those on property.  I am also conscious of something highlighted by Peter Lunn in an interesting paper on decision making biases in the banking crisis.  It is called "hindsight bias" and is defined as a "tendency to perceive an event as more predictable than it actually was, and to overestimate the degree to which we actually did predict it".</p><p> Most of the key moments or statements we remember from the crisis period were probably seen or heard on RTE programming, from Charlie McCreevy's budget in 2002 with its supports for the property market to Brian Lenihan announcing the guarantee or Patrick Honohan confirming the bailout on "Morning Ireland".  Throughout this period, in RTE news we were just reporting what was happening.  That was our job.  We followed events as they happened and tried to ask the right questions about them.  We were also open to including in our coverage, and to give prominence to, what the inquiry is calling "the contrarian view".  Indeed, because of our questioning approach, mandated by the principles I outlined earlier, some of our coverage was classed as being contrarian.  Certainly, our economics editor would have been put in that category during the period by other media outlets.</p><p> We gave great prominence to the European Commission warning of 2001 and the Government's rejection of it.  Each of the ESRI reports outlined by Professor FitzGerald in his testimony that warned of the imbalance in the economy and the need to introduce counter-cyclical measures was covered by RTE.  We covered all Central Bank reports and reports on the Irish economy by the OECD and IMF.  There was extensive coverage of the continued rise in house prices, the change in lending policy, the construction boom and the relationship between bankers and developers.  From 2007, there was a particular focus on Anglo Irish Bank, which extended to all of the banks following the share price drama of St. Patrick's Day in 2008.  Each shift in Government economic policy received detailed scrutiny, including in the elections of 2002 and particularly 2007.</p><p> George Lee's documentary "Boom" in June 2006 was particularly significant, not just for his provocative statement on the death of the Celtic tiger but particularly for his analysis of personal indebtedness, the dependence of the economy on property-related Exchequer funding and employment, and the real possibility that there could be a property crash.  The analysis done for "Boom" informed George Lee's reporting from then on, and contributed to an alertness to these issues across our output.  Richard Curran's "Future Shock" programme in April 2007 was another key programme.  It was followed by a debate on "Prime Time" between Morgan Kelly and Jim Power on soft and hard landings and led to a period of sustained criticism of RTE, including a number of formal complaints.</p><p> There was a journalistic awareness that Anglo Irish Bank should be watched as a story from the initial share price wobble in 2007.  In January 2008, for example, there was some controversy about a story David Murphy ran about stockbrokers recommending that clients sell Anglo Irish Bank and AIB shares.  The Northern Rock crisis, with queues at the Dublin offices, brought an awareness that international turbulence could have implications for institutions here.</p><p> The collapse of Lehman Brothers saw a major shift in the story.  From then to the arrival of the troika, it was continuous coverage.  As well as the pressure to be accurate in our reporting and analysis, there was the added dimension that what we were reporting could impact on events, as there was an international focus on what was happening here.  An example of this was the concerns of the Minister for Finance about the impact of a "Liveline" programme which featured callers talking about removing their money from institutions.  When contacted about this, our response in RTE news was to say it was not our role to provide assurances or to stop reporting something we knew was happening, but that if the Governor of the Central Bank or the regulator wanted to say something we would certainly get it on the "Nine O'Clock News".  One of the more detailed contributions during the period shortly after the guarantee was Patrick Honohan's Michael Littleton memorial lecture on Radio 1 on 2 December.  In it he stated his analysis that unlimited guarantees add to the cost of the crisis and that where illiquidity is obvious there is usually a deal of insolvency lurking in the background.</p><p> If there was a gap in coverage, it was the solvency versus liquidity issue in the main banks.  Although the issue was raised, most notably by Morgan Kelly, there was little evidence from within the institutions until the information from the stress tests started to be revealed.  Had we been able to discover this type of information from within the banking institutions we would have reported it.  Certainly, it would not have been an easy matter given the legal environment.  In the past RTE had fought cases in the Supreme Court to defend the right of the media to continue investigations into wrongdoing in the financial sector, and we would have again.  When we had undisclosed information such as that revealed in David Murphy's story on Irish Life and Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank end of year arrangements we reported it.  However, there were no whistleblowers.  Even when "Prime Time Investigates" went back to the issue in the "Meet the Bankers" investigation only one could be found.</p><p> There are other areas which I believe could have been explored further.  We, like other media, tended to struggle to report on regulatory and administrative structures.  Second, there could have been a greater emphasis on the interlocking of the financial structures and the implications of this for policy responses to the crisis.</p><p> The inquiry has asked me about the relationship between the editorial and sales functions within RTE.  In my experience as managing director of news and current affairs, there is none.  When RTE was restructured into integrated business divisions in 2002, with devolved finance, commercial, press and human resources functions, the news and current affairs independent business division, IBD, was kept separate from any commercial activity.  My only contact with the commercial division would be as a member of the executive board, and the only times we would have been consulted on a commercial issue would be on sponsorship options related to content position within news programming, such as weather and traffic.  I have no recollection of any representations or even queries from the commercial side of RTE on an editorial matter and none concerning the subject matter of this inquiry.</p><p> The period under review was a time of intense interest in news and current affairs, an interest which grew as the economic crisis developed.  The coverage and reporting I have been outlining were not isolated incidents in specialist publications.  They were all contained on high audience, mainstream programming.  We also know what the audience thought of this coverage.  In 2008, 79% of a national sample of the RTE audience considered economic coverage of a high quality, with a similar figure for business coverage.  The quality of the coverage is due to the expertise and diligence of the RTE staff working in this area and their commitment to public service principles.</p><p> I hope I have shown that RTE did, and does, take its responsibilities as a public broadcaster very seriously.  It is essential that we do not just explore what happened but pay great attention to the why, and what is needed structurally and behaviourally to avoid the possibility of another crash.</p></speech>

I do not intend to read the statement I have submitted in full, as it is on the record, but I will take a short amount of time to summarise the main points and, perhaps, give the committee additional information as regards the procedures which are in place in RTE which might be helpful for the members in directing their questions later.</p> <p>  RTE is a public service media provider in receipt of public funds.  It is aware that it is owned by the audience, the people of Ireland.  This imposes additional pressures, and rightly so, to protect the audience and its interests.  If a commercial company's prime responsibility is to its shareholders, a public service media organisation's primary responsibility is to its audience.  On the other hand, RTE is charged by law to maximise its commercial revenue.  This is done to supplement the licence fee it receives.  This mixed funding model is intended to lessen the burden on Irish households and the State and allow the organisation to fulfil its public service obligations.  This dual funded model is not unique to Ireland.  The model has been in general use across Europe to fund public service broadcasters for 60 years.</p> <p>  RTE is not a commercial company.  It does not make profits, nor does it have a responsibility to shareholders to deliver dividends.  Instead, any income over and above operating costs is reinvested in additional programmes, output and facilities to serve the interests of its audiences.  To document the priorities in this regard RTE produces a public service statement.  This statement is obviously available on its website but is also widely publicised and advertised.  Indeed, we are advertising at present for input to a review of that public service statement from organisations and individuals.  The statement sets out the principles that the organisation must observe to undertake its activities.  The first of the principles is of particular interest to this inquiry.  It states that RTE will remain independent of any vested interest.  I will return to this later in my remarks.</p> <p>  I will move on to speak about the commercial revenues and activities, and my experience of these over the 25 years I have been involved and particularly in the period that is of interest to the inquiry.  The major commercial revenue in the years leading up to the banking crisis was advertising revenue, driven mainly by television advertising and, to a lesser extent, sponsorship.</p><p>Despite the restrictions placed on RTE&rsquo;s ability to generate advertising revenue as against that available to commercial broadcasters, RTE&rsquo;s advertising revenue grew significantly by 55% during the period under review, with television advertising revenue growing by 60% over the period.</p><p> Throughout that period, revenue from the property and financial sectors grew, yet the proportion and relative importance did not.  Property advertising at its highest point reached 0.9% of advertising revenue; at its lowest point it was 0.3%.  The total financial sector, including insurance, building societies, credit cards, banks, credit unions and so on, accounted at the highest point for 4.6% of RTE's revenue, but generally worked out at an average of just over 3% of its total revenue.</p><p> My background is in economics and I have worked for many years in RTE generating revenue.  In more recent years my responsibilities have also encompassed the growing area of regulatory affairs.  In this regard I have been involved in European directives, broadcast legislation, submissions to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the development of commercial codes.  I am currently a board member of the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, which develops codes for all media in the Irish market, and I chair the on-demand audiovisual service, which develops codes for on-demand providers.  I mention these activities so that the committee understands that at the core of the guiding principles behind these directives, legislation and codes is the protection of the consumer of commercial messages.  My involvement on behalf of RTE in these bodies is to ensure that the principles sacrosanct to a public service organisation are as far as possible mirrored in the wider media environment.</p><p> Before concluding my opening remarks, I will return to my first point about RTE&rsquo;s public service statement about remaining independent of vested interests.  The statement goes on to clarify this in more detail, stating that it will follow these principles by "Ensuring the integrity of its services and that editorial decision-making is not subject to undue influence from any commercial, political, religious, social or cultural interest."  In furtherance of this principle within the commercial area, RTE has in place clearance committees.  All commercial activity, whether sponsorship or advertising, is cleared through those clearance committees before it is allowed to go to broadcast.  These clearance committees make sure that the provisions of the codes are applied fully, including those which are relevant to this committee, to do with the transparency of commercial content and its separation from editorial content.</p></speech>

As the witnesses are aware, the programme had a very serious commentary with regard to where the property market was going, where values might fall to, and other pending concerns.  In the immediate aftermath of that programme, can Mr. Mulhall describe to us what was the general mood in RTE at an editorial and management level?  Was he approached by any sectors outside RTE regarding the concerns that were raised in that programme?  Does he have any recollection of what was the general media commentary, critique or analysis of that programme?</p></speech>

I am not going to talk about things that I do not have direct experience of.  I will probably use that qualification a couple of times when I am saying something.</p> <p>  With regard to "Future Shock: Property Crash", I did not have direct editorial responsibility for it.  It was commissioned by Kevin Dawson in features, so he would have reported directly to the director of television, who was Noel Curran at the time.  In terms of the fallout from that programme, television would have dealt with it directly.</p></speech>

I will give examples of it.  I know of some of the discussions around it because I would have been involved in discussions, so I am not totally oblivious to what happened, and also because many issues regarding the programme might have come originally to current affairs, assuming that it was a direct current affairs programme.<br/><br/>In the immediate aftermath of the programme, RTE was dealing with a number of official complaints.  There were complaints that went to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland about the programme.  In my recollection, I think they came from representative bodies, but the Chairman can check the record of who made the complaints.  I think RTE fought that complaint successfully.<br/><br/>There was also a deal of press coverage in the immediate aftermath of the programme.  Richard Curran is on record, in the book by O'Donovan and Murphy, as talking about the reaction to him in the aftermath of that programme.  Richard Curran worked as a correspondent in news before moving to the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I have known Richard for a long time, so I would have talked to him during that period.</p></speech>

The decision on commissioning the documentary and broadcasting it would be taken at the TV programmes level.  It would have been done in discussions with news and current affairs at the time, because those programmes - the special Monday night documentaries, as they were - ran in parallel with &quot;Prime Time Investigates&quot;.  Therefore, there was co-ordination between the current affairs section and the television programmes section about the subject matter for those documentaries.<br/><br/>It is obvious in terms of the coverage as well, because &quot;Future Shock: Property Crash&quot; ran on a Monday night, and the following night's programme on <i>Prime Time</i>had a discussion involving Morgan Kelly, as it turns out, about the content of that programme.  That is one of the most highlighted examples on YouTube of the early discussions of the crash.</p></speech>

Every programme that we broadcast would be reviewed on Friday after broadcast, at which time we would deal with any issues that came up in the programmes.  It would have been discussed in advance of broadcast in the forward plans.  If there had been a major issue it could have been brought up at an executive board, so I can say none of that came across.</p> <p>  The other thing that is probably worth stressing as well - I will probably come back to this later - is that it was not an isolated programme from RTE in that period.  A year previously, in June, the other documentary that I mentioned in my statement, "Boom", which George Lee presented, dealt with pretty much the same issues in a wider context.</p></speech>

In his presentation to the inquiry, he made the following observation, "During the boom years RTE had as chairman a director of Anglo Irish Bank, which epitomised the excesses of the Celtic tiger and property lending."  To Mr. Mulhall's knowledge, at any stage did that institution or any other financial institution attempt to influence - or maybe not directly influence, but have any discussions about - editorial matters or news content matters within RTE?  If they did, will Mr. Mulhall comment?</p></speech>

The particular chairman of the authority is mentioned and named in Dr. Mercille's books, so it is not hard to find out who he was.  He is now deceased.  In my recollection of him as chairman of the authority, he was one of the best chairmen in terms of trying to get RTE - particularly the business side of RTE and the financial structures - in order.  He was very significant in the licence fee campaign in 2002.  Another subsequent chairperson is also mentioned in Dr. Mercille's book, and she was probably one of the strongest chairpersons in terms of standing up when complaints happened.  It might be simplistic to cast people in a particular role.  Certainly, with regard to the deceased former chairman I am referring to, I come from a very different perspectives on a lot of things, but never in any of my dealings with him would he have tried to influence me with regard to coverage of business or banking matters or of the company he originally came from.</p></speech>

The chairman referred to in the book was actually chairman of RTE between the years 2000 and 2005.  From a commercial revenue point of view, they were not the biggest years.  The year 2004 was the first year we actually started to make any money in the boom period as such.  He actually was not the chairman for the boom period, but putting a name like that into it makes a point.  There is another point I would make.  I do not mean to be facetious, but if he was a director of Anglo Irish Bank, RTE never received any money or any advertising or content or anything from that bank.  If there was cross-pollination, it certainly did not happen in relation to revenue to RTE.</p></speech>

It has been commented on in many places that it was mostly the international media that broke the story of assistance being sought by Ireland from the IMF and the European Commission, before the domestic media discovered it.  Was there any pressure exerted on RTE at that time as to its reportage and what it should or should not cover?  Not covering something could often be as significant as covering it.</p></speech>

The main difficulty that RTE journalists had at that time was getting people to answer direct questions right through that period.  Everyone remembers pictures from RTE programming of Ministers shaking their heads and denying things that were happening.  There were people refusing to give information to correspondents.  In fact, at the same time as the BBC was breaking the story that the bailout was happening, RTE's business correspondent was on RTE programming talking about the same issue.  The most significant intervention in terms of alerting the public that the denials were wrong was the phone call from Patrick Honohan to "Morning Ireland".  That was a very fraught period.  It is a long way from the period we are discussing, but in terms of the interaction between Departments and Government representatives and all media, it was a very fraught period.  I would be denying a lot of things if I said it was not fraught, because it was a very fraught period.</p></speech>

Was it put to Mr. Mulhall or inferred in any of those contacts that coverage by RTE could at that particular juncture create, for instance, a run on the banks?  Were any implications rather than direct comments made?</p></speech>

One of the challenges faced by the inquiry is that when looking back, everything gets pulled together into one timeframe.  The gap between the guarantee and the bailout and the troika was nearly two years.  It is a long period of time.  I will walk back into the timeframe I was asked to deal with, because it gives an answer to the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  I have mentioned in my statement the reaction to the "Liveline" programme just before the first guarantee, the &euro;100,000 guarantee on deposits, which was in September.  It is on the record in Deputy Murphy's brother's play, and I think it is in David Murphy's programme as well, that the Minister for Finance contacted the director general arising out of concerns about that "Liveline" programme and a worry about a run on the banks and that sort of pressure.  The Minister also contacted me directly, which was unusual.  Normally, my contact with politicians would be informal or through the press representatives.  It was a very proper and in no way inappropriate contact.  The contact was to do with concerns that a Northern Rock-type panic might ensue in the aftermath of that programme.  I had a very formal conversation with him in which I said that we had reported on the six o'clock news that there were concerns about money leaving institutions on that day.  We were accurate in our reporting because we had checked it.  In fact, two correspondents were working on the story at the time.  I said that it was not my role or RTE's role to assure the public that the banks were okay; that was the role of the Central Bank, the regulator or the Minister.  I said that if one of those people wanted to come on air to make those assurances, if they were to make it in time for the nine o'clock news we would make sure that would happen.  What happened was that the Financial Regulator came out to RTE and did an interview with George Lee, and that was broadcast on that evening's nine o'clock news.  He subsequently appeared on "Prime Time" the following week.</p></speech>

I refer Mr. Mulligan to his opening statement in which he stated that property-related advertising accounted for less than 1% of total commercial revenue at its highest point in 2007.</p><p>He said the total for the financial institution category was less than 5%.  I ask the witness to outline briefly those two categories from the point of view of property-related revenue in particular.</p><p> A lot of advertising in different forms of media comes from other categories that are not directly linked with property in terms of the actual construction sector, whether it is electrical supply companies, home furnishings or anything else.  Does the 1% figure include those industries which were directly linked to construction but were not actually construction themselves?</p></speech>

They would be classified as household goods and services within our classification and not within property.  Obviously the fact that more houses were being built and more people were occupying houses would have meant more advertising for household goods.  To what extent that was lifted by the boom I could not say, but the answer to the question is that I am talking about pure property advertising.</p></speech>

In light of what Mr. Mulligan has just stated, does he think that statement applies to RTE in the period in question?</p></speech>

Yes.  Was there growth in the financial sector?  Yes there was, although most of the financial advertising at the time, when I look back, tended to be of a corporate nature rather than specifically about house buying or house purchase, although there would have been mortgage advertising as well.  The degree to which broadcast media benefitted any way directly from the property boom is certainly exaggerated.  When one looks at the major advertising categories at the time in the broadcast media, the main product categories at the time were things like food, retailers, toiletries and cosmetics, generally fast-moving consumer goods.  The medium itself is not deemed to be as suitable for property-related advertising; we do not do supplements.</p></speech>

I refer to the remuneration structure within the marketing department in RTE at the time and salaries versus bonuses.  What was that structure?  Was it an incentive-based system for employees to get more advertising from property or other sectors?</p></speech>

Most sales operations have targets and there are incentives to exceed the targets.  Across the period 2004 to 2008 there would have been bonus schemes in place.  They were not always there.  Was there anyone targeting the property market?  It was not a market that we ever saw potential in.</p></speech>

Some were about overseas properties and some were about domestic properties.  Advertising was sold during those programmes - often not directly related to property itself - but property and construction was a part of the programming make-up in RTE at the time.  Surely this did have an impact that was greater than 1% on the revenues of RTE.</p></speech>

There were four of five different programmes, but these did not all run at the same time; some of them ran for two years and some for three years.  They existed before the property boom.  There are probably three programmes currently on RTE that have nothing to do with the property boom but are in the same area.  They are there because the Irish people have a fascination - maybe not an obsession, which was the word used yesterday - but a fascination with property that is historically well based.  There is a huge interest in property.  It may not be unique to Irish viewers.  Some of the commercial channels in the UK seem to specialise in property programmes and they are very popular.  There is an interest in property programmes and in design and in developments in eco-housing.  There is a huge interest in property.  However, the advertising around those programmes was likely to be for soap powder, toiletries and cosmetics and other products.  There was nobody selling houses around those programmes.</p></speech>

There is huge value in rigorous academic research in terms of looking at the issues that were around at the time and in learning the lessons so that we do not make the same mistakes again.  That is what we are here today to talk about.  However, I have some problems with his analysis of these things.  To a large extent his analysis was not centred on RTE; it was centred on two very large business groups, <i>The Irish Times</i>and the <i>Irish Independent </i>group.  He says that by their very nature as big businesses, they were in cahoots with big business itself.  He stated that that was a known fact.  I did not see the proof for that fact in his analysis - it was a case of &quot;That is a fact.&quot;  His view is that because these newspaper groups were in bed with big business and property business, the only view that was ever going to be in their media was support for business and those financial and property businesses.  However, in reality, <i>The Irish Times</i>is read by 9% of the adult population in Ireland and the <i>Irish Independent</i>is read on a daily basis by 16% of the adult population in Ireland.  There are local radio stations and local press in every county in Ireland that far exceed the kind of audiences that any of those newspapers have.  Is there a supposition that these other media were part of the conspiracy too?  If they were-----</p></speech>

Programmes, and particularly lifestyle programmes, also reflect - I think it would be wrong to pretend otherwise - what people are watching.  Particularly in a schedule, one is looking for a mix of programming.  Therefore, if a house buyers' programme or a house improvement programme is not being watched and is not going to be renewed, it is sitting beside consumer programming, "Check-Up" and that sort of programming, which falls within, and would be commissioned from, the same area.</p> <p>  While we are on it, and I am sure it will come up again, it is important to distinguish between the programmes.  There was a list of programmes and they are different.  There are ones that one could certainly say are boom programmes - at least, I would say they are boom programmes - like "House Hunters in the Sun" and there are other ones that are house improvement programmes.  There was a deliberate editorial policy to shift from one to another in 2006 and 2007.</p></speech>

Commercial channels are allowed 20% and so that averages out at six minutes in the hour, as opposed to 12 minutes in the hour.  On RTE radio, RTE is permitted to have 7.5% of its time in advertising, whereas local and commercial radio is allowed 15%.  Therefore, it is half.</p></speech>

On the fifth page of Mr. Mulligan's submission to the committee, there is an item from 15 November 2006 referring to "I&rsquo;m An Adult, Get Me Out Of Here" which states "No problems with Financial Regulator &ndash; lovely fit".

Usually, a proposal will come from our own sponsorship people who might say they are going to meet the Financial Regulator, which has expressed an interest in possibly doing something in RTE and whether it would be suitable for it to sponsor this programme.  That would have been the request and I think the minute to which the Senator referred was from the minutes of such a meeting to say yes, it would be a lovely fit.  As can be seen from other minutes I have dictated there, this is not always the case.</p></speech>

How many people from the Financial Regulator's office used to be involved in monitoring RTE's programmes?</p></speech>

There was no involvement of the regulator.  Let me make this clear.  The sponsorship committee within RTE would vet any proposal to ascertain whether it was a suitable sponsor.  At the time the Financial Regulator as a sponsor came up as a concept.  At the time, we had a programme called "It's Your Money" and the regulator has a site that is similarly called.  The idea was whether it would be possible for the Financial Regulator to sponsor this, if it wished to so do.  Discussions were held with the Financial Regulator and eventually it never happened.  However, the reason the concept came up was because at the time, as the Senator may remember, the regulator was advertising with RTE.  Most people will remember the guy standing up on the bus saying he did not know what a tracker mortgage was.  The regulator was advertising the fact that it was trying to educate people in financial issues.  The concept was about whether the regulator could advertise a programme and the note cited by the Senator said yes it could, it was a good fit.</p></speech>

Would it be true that the business coverage, in particular as it relates to the Stock Exchange, is somewhat uncritical?  In other words, it announces a glowing profit for company X but is not focused on whether that company rigged the market or gets massive subsidies or huge tax breaks or whatever.</p></speech>

Sometimes, some of the edgier questions with some of the bank officials over this period would have been in that slot because that was the only time in a lot of cases that bank chief executives were available for interview.</p></speech>

As a general question, of all the lessons that Mr. Mulhall was watching and in which he was participating, how would he advise the committee on measures to prevent a recurrence?  What should we do the next time, to make sure this &euro;64 billion bill, which both the Oireachtas and society as a whole were obliged to face, never again arises?</p></speech>

As for the committee's work, it remains to be seen what will be the impact of its recommendations.  Obviously, much of how the committee's work is reviewed will come from the nexus phase and the conclusions the joint committee draws from that period.  I also have an interest, to which I alluded at the end of my statement, on the policy side of what are the conclusions from this committee because frankly, the structures may change and may alter a bit but it really is on the legislative side that the members of this committee can have the most direct input.  The joint committee has spokespeople present who more than likely will be spokespeople for the parties in the next election and they will have an ability to bring what they have learned from this committee's deliberations into that campaign.  The policy failures of this period probably are as interesting as some of the other sides of the equation.</p></speech>

These programmes were aired late on in the boom cycle.

That programme was presented by someone who was an expert in trying to advise people.  The programme, for those who do not remember it, centred on people in their 20s who had spent long enough at home, who wanted to move out but did not know what they could do, what they could afford or how they would go about it.  One could call that pushing the property market but I would call it consumer information.  I understand that-----</p></speech>

The presenter of the former programme, in a web chat on RTE's website in May 2007, wrote "... buy now, buy if you can ... Supply in property is currently outweighing demand and there could be deals to be done".   She also wrote, "My advice is to buy now ... should the next government abolish stamp duty for first timers this will simply put the price of properties for first time buyers ... UP!" and "I suggest buying now before buyers come back to the market".  The presenter was asked, "Do you think that the property market could crash?" and replied as follows: "No ... I don't think any government can afford to let that happen.  A levelling off is what we are seeing."  This was in May 2007.  Again I raise the issue of a conflict of interest because this was someone who was not a so-called expert but a player in the property scene.  The first-time buyers who were being given advice in 2007 may have acted on that advice, just before the bubble burst and finished up in serious negative equity.  Does Mr. Mulligan think that RTE might have some responsibility for that disaster?</p></speech>

Did young people buy property in 2007 that tumbled in value?  Yes, they did; of course they did.  Did the people making those programmes or the experts know this would happen?  I do not know but I do not think so.  There is a little bit of hindsight at play here in the sense that we know the bubble burst.  The question was, when did it happen?  It was probably going to happen and whether one was in before it or after it determined whether one was left with a burden or an asset.

That happened every year for ten years.  That was put down, in many quarters, to rampant speculation in land and rampant profiteering.</p></speech>

Did RTE ever launch an investigative journalism project or initiative to uncover the kind of rampant profiteering that was going on in land speculation and the housing industry, considering the detrimental and hugely negative social impact that had on young people in particular?</p></speech>

There were two "Prime Time Investigates" programmes specifically dealing with the issue of planning.  I will pass on the dates for those programmes to the committee.  There was also a "Prime Time Investigates" investigation into housing agents and one on mortgage products arising out of the sub-prime issue.  There were two big investigations, one early in the "Prime Time Investigates" series and one subsequently.  In the period immediately after the crash, there was one specifically on building, builders and speculation, as well as one on the banks.  There were a number of specific programmes and the ones to which I am referring were fully fledged "Prime Time Investigates" type programmes.</p></speech>

On television and radio there is a limited slot.  In terms of the laws of supply and demand, one cannot broadcast the 25th or 26th hour in the day as there are only so many hours in the day that one can broadcast and the time is very controlled in terms of how much one can allocate.  How does that work?  Does the price of advertising increase because the demand becomes higher?</p></speech>

Many years ago we had a kind of an auction basis system where when the breaks got full if someone was willing to pay a higher price, there was a churn.  That does not happen at the moment.  What we have at the moment is a fixed price.  We try to forecast months in advance what the demand and supply are likely to be and we fix the price.</p></speech>

There were a number of contributors to the programme - Padraic White, Tom Garvin, Brigid Laffan, John Farrell, Sean Dorgan, etc.  I apologise for getting tied up in a numbers game with Senator Mark MacSharry earlier.  The reason I used "Boom" as an example was that I was trying to make the point more in terms of the focus, because I was asked in the earlier questions when I got focused in on the issue myself.  I discussed with George Lee at the time the analysis he was doing with the period.  If one goes back and looks at what he said in his own presentation within that programme, clearly it deals with an awful lot of the core issues.  It puts in a historic context what is in the euro context.  It deals with the fact that the problems in the property market predated 2001.  I know I am taking up the time of the committee but there is a lot of stuff in it and it was done by George Lee.</p></speech>

I think he regretted it very quickly himself.  The reason we quote it - I quoted it in my longer statement - is that it was indicative of a certain attitude to people who were criticising or seen to be critical of the economic policy of the time.  It was not the first time that a similar comment was made.  In fact, let us consider the "How We Blew the Boom" programme again.  I do not want to keep coming back to it, but there was an equivalent comment the following Sunday directly about the boom programme from the Taoiseach.  In George Lee's contribution to the O'Donovan book, he sees that comment as indicative of comments he was getting from political circles in that period.</p></speech>

Certainly, it was a feature in terms of dealing with the wider planning issues related to the programmes that I outlined earlier.  I am trying to remember.  There was a segment on commercial property in "Future Shock: Property Crash" but I cannot remember a specific programme in that period dealing directly with commercial property.  Actually, there were programmes relating to some of the big housing developments.  I suppose they would come into that category but I would need to do a little more research to give a specific answer.</p></speech>

The planning programmes that I mentioned dealt with that nexus in terms of planning issues.  One programme directly related to the committee investigation was "Prime Time Investigates: Meet the Bankers", which aired immediately after the guarantee in early 2009.  That dealt directly with two big financial institutions among those involved in the nexus phase.  That programme had details about how the financial regulator dealt with them.  It was revealed in that programme how the regulator dealt with loans to businesses and other people, including politicians.</p></speech>

I am more interested in the aftermath of the programme.  Mr. Mulhall has referred to the comments of the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, after &quot;How We Blew the Boom&quot;.  After &quot;Future Shock: Property Crash&quot;, he also said something to Matt Cooper.  It is mentioned in Matt Cooper's book, <i>Who Really Runs Ireland?</i>.  I understand it was on the radio show as well.  He said that it was irresponsible and inaccurate and that he disagreed with almost everything in it.  The Construction Industry Federation had released a statement shortly afterwards.  The valuation body had taken up the issue of bias, which was not sustained.  Was there any direct contact from anyone within political circles or people acting for them to RTE in respect of &quot;Future Shock: Property Crash&quot;?</p></speech>

I was not directly responsible for the programme and, therefore, it would not be to me that they would go, although the likelihood is that they probably would have gone to me or to the editor of current affairs.  I do not have any recollection of any direct contact relating to that programme.  In fact, most of the heat - to put it that way - in terms of the programme was in full glare.  Everything was done through public statements, complaints and articles in newspapers.  It was not hidden in any sense.</p></speech>

I wish to follow on from Deputy Doherty's questions about "Morning Ireland".  I suppose that interview by the Governor, Professor Honohan, is an important moment in our history.  Some would argue that it was in the public interest but others argue that it was not in terms of the timing.  Are there internal controls in "Morning Ireland" or in RTE that would decide whether to allow him on?  Does someone get a telephone call?  Is there something to check?</p></speech>

In cases where there is a particularly sensitive issue, I have described how the editorial line goes.  If there was a particular sensitive issue relating to a legal matter, a balance issue or something like that, it might go up.  In the case of "Morning Ireland" it might go up to the series editor of "Morning Ireland", escalate to the managing editor of radio or up to me.  That is the chain in terms of "Morning Ireland".  In the case of something like the Governor of the Central Bank wishing to make a statement on a matter of extreme current interest, it would be a very straightforward decision by the editor to make the decision himself to put him on.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulhall referred earlier to the "Liveline" programme of Thursday, 18 September 2008 during which there was discussion of the security of people's deposits in the banks and people deciding to take their money out.  Rumours were running wild at that stage and it was reported at the time that the late Minister, Brian Lenihan, actually phoned the director general, Cathal Goan.  Mr. Mulhall said the Minister phoned him also.  Could he clarify that, first of all?</p></speech>

Because of his training, the Minister was very careful in what he said.  I do not want to paraphrase him inaccurately because I did not take a note of what he said.  He had concerns about the banking sector and he believed that what had developed in the "Liveline" programme would cause problems for the banks and that there needed to be some balance put into the issue.  That was a developing story that day.  Two of our correspondents were aware of what had happened on "Liveline" and had checked it out with a number of the institutions involved.  So there was a real concern around the story.  In terms of the story we did at 6 p.m. that day, we were quite careful in terms of how we phrased it.  The Minister and I then had an exchange during which I said that there were a number of people who could be interviewed about it.</p></speech>

It was reported subsequently that within 24 hours, about &euro;50 million had been transferred into An Post guaranteed State savings products.  It was also reported that the production team of "Liveline" were rebuked by senior management at RTE because they planned to continue with the topic of the safety of bank deposits the following day on Friday, 19 September 2008, and they were prevented from doing so.

I remember going around to the finance briefings of most of the parties during the course of that campaign.  I asked George Lee, who did a number of set-up points both for news and programmes, to ask again about the issues around taxation during that campaign.  I remember I met him at one of these briefings - I cannot remember which one - and he said, "I just keep getting the same answer back; they won't deal with the issue."  To answer the Deputy's question about whether it was rigorous enough, I think it was rigorous.  It came up in the issues.  It was in the leaders' debate.  It was in the set-up packages that were done for "Prime Time".  There was specific discussion of the topic but it did not seem to have much impact.</p></speech>

It is difficult when one starts research from the basis that there are elites and they are all in cahoots together - the results of the research are there before one does any factual analysis.  Dr. Mercille may have something to say about the major press groups, and I know the committee has spoken to them earlier, because they did benefit more directly from the property market, but RTE did not.  RTE had no vested interest in it and there was no contact with developers or auctioneers in any of RTE's commercial activities across that period.  The cement that may have been there with other media was not there in the broadcast media, to build that contact one would like to propose.  I do not say this just about RTE, I believe it was true of all the broadcast media.</p></speech>

He said that only ten of the programmes had segments dealing with the housing boom.  He goes on to say that in those ten programmes 26 guests appeared, 11 from property or financial sectors.  What would the criteria need to have been for RTE as a public sector broadcaster, to have done more programmes over that period to deal with the housing bubble?</p></speech>

I am sorry to cut into the Deputy's time, I do not want to get him into trouble, but I need to take a little time to answer the question.  I would quibble with the classification that Dr. Mercille uses.  I had a researcher go through the "Prime Time" programming from that period.  It is vastly more coverage than Dr. Mercille says it is.  I gave the committee the figure of 120 programmes related to the inquiry, of which a third - 40 programmes - related to property alone over that period of time.  I am not disputing with him, but if one looks at Dr. Mercille's analysis, and the Chair showed the analysis in terms of newspapers, Dr. Mercille is doing a word search for the newspapers.  He is only allowing for the word "bubble" and not allowing for the word "boom" and that affects the issues around the numbers.</p></speech>

Having reflected on the 2002 to 2007 period in the space RTE holds in Irish media, are there lessons being taken from that period that RTE will apply to itself as national broadcaster in future?  Could this inquiry take lessons into the future in terms of some recommendations, legislative requirements, policies and support?</p></speech>

I am very proud of the journalistic work done by specialists during that period at a time when many other things were difficult.  I have genuine concerns about the maintenance of specialties within journalism and public broadcasting.  That is an ongoing concern and there are issues about the transparency of how broadcasting is regulated and funding.  I have concerns about these things and, even with the flawed performance of RTE in news and current affairs, I have concerns for the future about whether we will be able to sustain the investment required for these.  It is not just about here but also internationally.  There was a big international component to this so it is a major challenge for public broadcasting.</p> <p>  I have also gone into the other side of the question, about the inquiry.  There is a major challenge in respect of fact finding in the nexus phase.  The inquiry can have a real impact on an area where it has the power within its parties.  For example, Deputy Michael McGrath asked me about the previous election in 2007.  It would be good journalistic practice to have some way whereby party promises could be evaluated by some independent body that people buy into in order that we can get away from one party promising to cut something without it being costed or evaluated.  That would assist matters, as happens in Holland.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to provide a legislative basis for the role of the Teaching Council and for the forthcoming arrangements for the vetting of registered teachers to empower the Teaching Council to seek and obtain vetting disclosures as a registration body and to clarify and strengthen the statutory provisions relating to the Teaching Council's fitness to teach function.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and her officials to the meeting.  If anybody has a mobile telephone, I ask them to either turn it off or put it on to flight mode.  </p> <p>  If the committee is agreeable, we will conclude consideration of Committee Stage of the Bill this morning.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I refer members to the list showing the grouping of amendments for this debate.  All amendments not grouped will be discussed individually.</p> <p>  Before we proceed to discussion of the Bill, I wish to inform the Minister that before this meeting we discussed correspondence from the ASTI regarding a court case that has just finished on which a judgment has been made.  The ASTI thought this Bill should be deferred as a result.  I understand the Minister informed the ASTI she did not consider there was a need for that.  Would she like to say anything about that now?</p></speech>

My officials had meetings with representatives of unions on this issue and we have taken legal advice.  The specific issue in regard to the Corbally case concerns public hearings and what matters should be brought to a public hearing.</p><p>I indicated on Second Stage that I intended to bring forward an amendment on having hearings in public being the default position.  That amendment is not being submitted today on Committee Stage but my intention is to bring it forward at a later stage in the Seanad.  The Bill will then return to the D&aacute;il.  That is the substantive issue that is of concern with regard to the court case.  It is not the subject of an amendment today.</p><p> There are matters with respect to which I am considering amendments but which are not included today.  With the Chairman's permission and with respect to the committee, I will briefly mention what these are.  The amendments are largely technical changes or amendments designed to bring further coherence to the overall approaches to registration, fitness to teach and vetting throughout the Bill.  I intend that these will be progressed on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  However, the committee will recall that prior to and during the Second Stage debate, I also indicated my intention to provide for the conduct of disciplinary hearings in public, and that I would bring forward these amendments at a later stage.  It has not been possible to finalise the draft provisions in time for the committee's consideration of the Bill today.  I remain committed to the inclusion of this provision and I intend to bring forward amendments in the Seanad to give effect to this policy.  We have to allow sufficient time to seek and consider legal advice and the views expressed by stakeholders, including the stakeholders referred to by the Deputy, as well as the views outlined in the House on Second Stage.  My officials have briefed the teaching unions and the Teaching Council in this respect.</p><p> Having taken cognisance of the relevant issues and in light of the legal advice, the approach I plan to take is as follows.  Mirroring recent legislation for other professional regulators, specifically the nursing and midwifery board and the Medical Council, I intend to provide that fitness to teach hearings will be held in public as a default position but that on the request of a witness and where the witness can show reasonable and sufficient cause to the disciplinary committee of the Teaching Council, some or all of the hearings may be held in private.  This approach can cater for long-standing principles of natural justice, such as those espoused in the European Convention on Human Rights.  I also plan to include express provision that the registrant who is the subject of the hearing is entitled to be represented at the hearing and will be furnished in advance with information about evidence in support of the complaint.</p><p> As well as the conduct of hearings in public, I will also provide for the publication by the council of the outcome of disciplinary hearings where it is in the public interest to do so and the notification of findings against a teacher to regulators outside the State where appropriate.  Again, this is in keeping with the arrangements applying to other professional regulators, and the legal provisions will be similar to those which already exist.  I am advised and am satisfied that this approach can cater for the types of issues that have been raised in respect of individuals' rights, such as the safeguarding of minors or vulnerable adults, the protection of private lives and privacy concerning medical fitness.  The disciplinary committee will have sufficient discretion to determine when privacy should be employed, including anonymising where it is considered appropriate.  We have a series of steps before any case would come to a public hearing.</p><p> The disciplinary committee is largely the body that will make those judgments as to what is severe enough to go to public hearing.  It is also important to be aware that no case will proceed to a hearing without having gone through several screening stages that are designed to weed out less serious complaints that would not merit a full disciplinary inquiry.  Following completion of Committee Stage, my Department will also be proofing the Bill, as amended, and if any technical corrections are required, the necessary amendments will be introduced on Report Stage.  I hope this provides some clarity on the issues raised.</p></speech>

On the one hand, she is proposing that the default position is that a public inquiry would be held but she also indicates that there are many hoops to be gone through before getting to a public hearing.  I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by teachers, particularly in Ireland, which is such a small place.  That is one of the points that has been made.  Having a default position where complaints are heard in a public hearing, when the potential for very damaging complaints that may not really have substance, could tarnish the reputation of a teacher or vulnerable children who are put in the limelight when they really should not be.  That is quite problematic and for the protection of both teachers and children, if there is acknowledgement of the need to screen complaints, why should there be a default position of a public hearing?  On a case-by-case basis, as unions and the Teaching Council have indicated, there may be good reason for something to go public.  That should surely be considered on a case-by-case basis if we are going to be sensitive to all the concerns about people's reputations and potential damage.  This should be examined on a case-by-case basis to decide whether it is appropriate for such issues to be in the public domain.</p></speech>

In those cases, hearings are by default held in public unless there is a specific reason for them not to be in public.  This is really about giving confidence to the teaching profession, as well as the public, in following that model.  The earlier investigations are about ensuring they are appropriate to go to full hearing.  I presume there will be cases where there would not be sufficient evidence to suggest that there should not be full hearings.  The model we propose is that by default a hearing would be public but it would have gone through a process to clarify whether the action is appropriate for a hearing.  A judgment can be made that it would not be appropriate to have the hearing in public and then it would be held in private.</p></speech>

In the midwifery area, people have either complied with the proper medical procedure or they have not.  It is reasonable where there is negligence or professional misconduct, or an allegation of same, for the hearing to occur in public.  Teaching is different.  We are a small country so although international comparisons have some relevance, we need to be specific about this country.</p><p>We are a very small country and if mud is thrown it can stick and follow one around in a serious way, even if there is no basis to the mud.</p><p> The relationship between teachers and students is different.  Various conflicts can occur between teachers and students on both sides, and people may simply not get on.  There should not be a default position whereby disputes, many of which could have that sort of character and do not involve professional misconduct or unsuitability to teach, or which could be just the product of vulnerable children being upset or whatever, which are serious matters that need to be dealt with, are put before a type of public star chamber.  That is problematic.</p></speech>

The point of the amendment is that, as I have been informed, if someone is not registered or they are removed or suspended from the register of the Teaching Council they are not paid, and teachers often do not know this.  They are working for weeks and they do not know that they have not been paid and that they are not registered.  They discover many weeks afterwards that they have not got paid because they were not registered or they had been removed from the register for some reason.  While it is reasonable that they should not be paid, they should be informed immediately that this is about to happen to allow them remedy the situation if it is simply an omission that they should have registered, but it is not fair if people are not being paid and discover after the fact that it is because they are not on the register.  It seems reasonable that there should be a requirement to inform the teacher.  Ideally, when the decision is made that their pay will be stopped they should be told immediately that is the case.</p></speech>

Deputy Conaghan is right on that point.  I appreciate Deputy Boyd Barrett's concern but there is already provision in regard to informing people that they are not on the register.  I will explain it in more detail.</p> <p>  Section 30 of the 2001 Act provides that a person who is employed as a teacher in a recognised school shall not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be paid from Oireachtas funds where he or she is not a registered teacher or where he or she stands removed or suspended from the register.  A substantial communication campaign took place in preparation for the commencement of section 30 of the Act, which was commenced last year, so that all teachers would be well aware of the requirement to be registered and the implications of non-registration.</p> <p>  While it appears that the intention behind the amendment is to ensure that a teacher's salary would not be discontinued without that teacher being informed, there are appropriate provisions elsewhere within the Bill that address this issue.  Requirements in regard to the council notifying teachers of decisions made in respect of initial registration, renewal of registration and in regard to fitness to teach inquiries are already in place.  Under the amended Act teachers will therefore be notified of decisions regarding their registration status, including any decision to remove or suspend registration which impacts on payment of salary.  However, as the Teaching Council is not directly involved with teachers' employment or payment, the council would not be in a position to notify teachers of changes to payment in accordance with the amended proposal.  For those reasons I do not consider that the amendment is appropriate in section 30.  </p> <p>  There is already provision that teachers will be notified if they are not on the register or if they are removed from the register.  The implication of that is that they will not be paid.  There was an information campaign when that section was brought into place.  We cannot force the Teaching Council to tell people they will not be paid because the Teaching Council does not pay them.  They are paid from a different source but if there is a need to in some way further communicate, I would be very happy to take up the intention of the amendment.  However, I do not believe it is appropriate to put it into the legislation.</p></speech>

I will go back before Report Stage and report what the Minister said, but I was informed that this does happen and it clearly is unfair.  Whatever is in place now is not adequate from the account I was given.  I do not understand why it is a problem for the Teaching Council.  Even though it does not pay people I do not see why it is a big deal to ask the Teaching Council to inform people that they are not on the register and if they are not on the register they should know they will not be paid.</p><p>It does not matter that it is not the body that pays them.  It should simply be a piece of information that it passes on to them.</p></speech>

As Deputy Boyd Barrett pointed out, this has happened on a number of occasions.  The teachers have been teaching for a few weeks and it is only when the pay cheque does not come through on pay day that they realise their registration is not up to date and that they are not liable to be paid for the period they have already worked in the school.  How can there be a situation that a teacher whose registration is not valid, because they have not paid, can commence work and be working, yet the school has not checked that or the teacher, for whatever reason, would not be aware of the fact that their registration is not up to date?  Surely there could be some means, in legislation or otherwise, whereby a better checking mechanism is put in place to ensure the school verifies that the teacher's registration is up to date and that it will be in a position to pay them.  What is happening is a sign that the schools are not checking that a teacher's registration is valid and up to date, and I would have thought that would have been a requirement when somebody starts a job.</p></speech>

They are not supposed to employ anybody who is not a registered teacher.  If there is an information gap, I will be happy to fill it.

The concern raised in the amendment is that the term &quot;fit and proper&quot; is too subjective and is open to abuse or a subjective interpretation which is too wide.  Obviously, one wants people to be fit and proper in the sense one would generally understand that, but that phraseology is too subjective.  It is the type of phrase that could allow the parish priest to say somebody is not fit and proper, for example.  The proposal is that we be a little more specific about what we mean by fit and proper and remove that subjective phraseology.  What we want them to be, I presume, is qualified and vetted according to the legislation.  The vetting ensures that they are fit and proper.  If the Minister wishes to state there are other criteria that should be deployed in deciding what is fit and proper, that is fair enough but the obvious ones are that they would be properly qualified to do the job and that they would be vetted according to the legislation.  However, fit and proper is too subjective.</p></speech>

The Bill's provisions relating to the council being satisfied that an applicant for registration is a fit and proper person to be registered enable the council to consider, before registering a person, whether that person is a suitable person to be registered, including whether that person is a suitable person from a child protection perspective.  A key aim of this Bill is to make Garda vetting an integral part of initial teacher registration and to ensure that any person who is not a suitable person to be registered, including where a person poses a risk to children or vulnerable persons, shall not be registered as a teacher in the first instance.  The effect of amendments Nos. 4 and 6 would be to remove the capacity of the council to assess a Garda vetting disclosure for this purpose.  If amendments Nos. 4 and 6 were accepted, the council would be able to assess a Garda vetting disclosure only for the purposes of determining if a person was qualified to be admitted to the register.  This is clearly not the intended purpose of a vetting disclosure.  The proposed amendments run contrary to the intention of the relevant provisions amending section 31 and the overall child protection aims of the Bill.</p> <p>  Regarding whether a person is qualified to be registered, the Bill already makes separate provision relating to the council setting out requirements in respect of the qualifications that a person must have attained in order to be registered.  I therefore do not accept amendments Nos. 4 and 6.</p> <p>  My amendment No. 5 is necessary to correct references inadvertently used in this provision of the published Bill to a registered teacher applying for a renewal of registration under this section.  As section 7 amends section 31 of the principal Act and is concerned with applications for initial registration, this amendment now correctly refers to a person applying for registration under this section.</p> <p>  I do not propose to accept amendment No. 7, the effect of which is to re-state in the provision in question a requirement for vetting that is already in place in the Bill.  Section 7 already amends section 31 of the principal Act to provide that the Teaching Council shall not register a person unless the council has received and considered a vetting disclosure in respect of that person.  Accordingly, I do not consider it appropriate or necessary to make this amendment.</p> <p>  The council, as a body, will develop its own procedures and guidelines setting out the manner in which an assessment will be carried out.  That was one of the Deputy's concerns, that there would be guidelines as to how the council would assess whether a person is fit and proper.</p></speech>

That is the reason I make reference in amendment No. 7 to the national vetting bureau in the legislation.  My aim is to try to ensure that how "fit and proper" is defined by the council in making its decisions is not open to some type of over-subjective viewpoint.  I take the point that qualification is only one dimension.  The other dimension, as the Minister says, is that they have been properly vetted according to the legislation and are fit and proper.  Perhaps I must look again at exactly where I should insert the amendment to make that point, or perhaps the Minister would look at it, and ensure we do not have that subjective phraseology whereby a subjective judgment could be made.</p><p>It should be more specific and state that what we mean by fit and proper is qualified and vetted according to the legislation.</p></speech>

It might be useful to have a look at that.  That would give the Deputy an idea of the kind of guidelines they intend to operate under the legislation when it is completed.  That will also be published.  It would give a picture of what considerations are taken into account in dealing with the vetting process and how the council decides whether someone who is currently being vetted is appropriate to be registered.</p></speech>

It also puts in place requirements in relation to the council notifying the teacher concerns where the council intends to seek a vetting disclosure for that purpose.  It is important to note that under the Bill not all registered teachers will be vetted each year.  Rather, section 11 of the Bill allows the council to plan and undertake such vetting in a structured and phased manner and sets out what the council will have regard to when considering whether to seek a vetting disclosure in respect of a teacher for renewal of his or her registration.  In that regard, this section will enable the council to prioritise the vetting of those teachers who were never vetted under the non-statutory arrangements, to subsequently address those who have been vetted under the existing non-statutory arrangements but who have not been vetted under the new statutory vetting arrangements and to provide thereafter for periodic revetting of all registered teachers to be undertaken on an ongoing basis.  It also makes provision for the council to notify the teacher in good time where it intends to seek a vetting disclosure as part of renewal.</p><p>On review of the published Bill, I considered that the obligations on the council in terms of notifying the teacher where it intends to seek a disclosure as part of the renewal process should be set out in a clearer manner.  The purpose of this amendment is therefore to ensure that in circumstances where the council intends to seek a disclosure for the purposes of renewing the registration of a teacher under section 33, the written notice to the teacher of this intention must also formally request the teacher to comply with the vetting requirement, specify the form and manner by which the teacher can do so, set out why the vetting disclosure is being requested and what it may be used for, and inform the teacher of the obligation under the Act to comply with this vetting request and the consequences for the teacher should he or she fail to comply with such a request.  This amendment ensures that those teachers who are being vetted for renewal of registration purposes receive adequate and timely notification in this regard.</p></speech>

The substituted provision involves some minor rewording to make clear that where the council refuses renewal of registration for non-compliance with a vetting requirement the council must have notified the teacher of that requirement for vetting in accordance with the notification requirement of the Bill.</p><p>The amendment also involves some re-wording of the provision to make clear that where the council refuses to renew registration on the basis that having received a vetting disclosure it is not satisfied that a person is a fit and proper person to have his or her registration renewed, the council must have reached that decision having considered that vetting disclosure in accordance with the Bill&rsquo;s provisions for assessing vetting disclosures obtained for the purposes of renewal of registration.  These involve providing the teacher with an opportunity to make submissions in respect of the vetting disclosure and also preclude the council from considering specified information contained in a disclosure where that information relates to conduct which occurred prior to the coming into operation of this section and where that conduct would not have constituted a criminal offence at the time it occurred.  This amendment more clearly sets out the requirement for the council in respect of making a decision to refuse renewal of registration in the circumstances specified in the Bill.  It also amends the Bill to provide that where the council renews a teacher&rsquo;s registration subject to conditions a time limit may be set by the council within which such conditions are to be fulfilled.  It is logical that there should be a time-line for conditions to be complied with but the time limit provision was absent from the published Bill.</p></speech>

A concern was expressed to me that one can be de-registered on the basis of some of these provisions and that in the code of conduct there is a requirement to adhere to the policy of the Department of Education and Skills.  Does that mean one could be denied registration if, as a teacher, one refused to implement the Minister&rsquo;s policy of junior certificate reform in respect of the controversy about independent marking and teachers marking their own students?</p></speech>

This amendment provides that a teacher may seek an extension of the time frame set by the council to comply with these conditions.  Such an extension may be granted at the council&rsquo;s discretion.  Where the teacher fails to comply with conditions set by the council or the High Court, if applicable, this amendment provides that the teacher shall be removed from the register.  Similar provisions are already in the 2001 Act and in operation, relating to conditions set at initial registration.  As conditions may now be set on renewal the same requirement arises to allow a teacher to apply for an extension where it has not been possible to fulfil the conditions within the initial time frame.  The amendment is to allow a teacher have extra time should he or she request it. </p></speech>

The Bill, however, precludes the council from making such a complaint in respect of specified information in a disclosure which relates to conduct that occurred prior to Part V of the Act becoming operational where that conduct would not have constituted an offence at the time it occurred.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarity in the wording used in this provision to ensure that the wording of the provision does not also preclude the council from making a complaint in relation to other information in such a disclosure, perhaps criminal records or other specified information, which gives rise to a bona fide concern that the teacher may harm, attempt to harm or cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed or incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person. </p></speech>

The current provision, in accordance with section 43 of the principal Act, requires that the director shall refuse to refer a complaint to the investigating committee where the complaint is not made in writing, signed by the complainant or accompanied by such documents and information as may be relevant to the complaint or where the director considers that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, is made in bad faith or is an abuse of process.  It is considered more suitable for the director to have discretion based on the information available to him or her in relation to each individual complaint to refer the complaint to the investigating committee and not to have to refuse it in all cases.  For example, a complainant may not be able to satisfy the requirement to include documents relevant to the complaint if the complainant is not aware of or in possession of such documents.  This measure aims to ensure that bona fide complaints may be referred to the investigating committee as appropriate.</p></speech>

It also provides that the person may appeal the decision to the investigating committee and that where such an appeal has been made the complaint will proceed to the investigating committee stage.  However, it is more appropriate that, where the director's decision to refuse the complaint has been appealed, the investigating committee would consider in the first instance whether it agrees with that decision, rather than proceeding to investigating committee stage.  Accordingly, this amendment makes provisions where such an appeal has been made for the investigating committee to review the decision of the director not to refer the complaint to the investigating committee and to either uphold that decision or to quash the decision and then proceed to hold an inquiry in respect of that complaint. </p></speech>

The intention of the proposed section 42(7C) as inserted by section 15(i) of the Bill is to provide that where the investigating committee has obtained the vetting disclosure it may not consider specified information in that disclosure where that specified information relates to conduct that occurred prior to the coming into operation of Part V unless the conduct concerned would have constituted an offence at the time the conduct occurred.  Amendment No. 27 corrects an error in this provision of the published Bill whereby reference was made to the council rather than the investigating committee in this context.  The provision in section 43 of the principal Act is that where, following an inquiry by a panel of the disciplinary committee, the panel dismissed a complaint, the disciplinary committee informs the complainant.</p><p>Amendment No. 28 explicitly provides for the more appropriate situation that where a complaint is dismissed it is the director, as secretary to the disciplinary committee, who advises the complainant on its behalf.  It is considered appropriate that, for clarity, such explicit provision should be made consistent with the other sections of the Act.</p></speech>

There then follows a series of cases, one of which is "that he or she has engaged in conduct contrary to a code of professional conduct established by the Council under section 7(2)(b)".  I am reassured and, more to the point, teachers will be reassured by the Minister's earlier assurances that she would never dream of invoking any of this in the context of an industrial dispute but I wonder if there are legal grounds on which some other Minister might invoke this provision.  If teachers were engaged in a legitimate industrial dispute could a Minister have the teachers deregistered because they were not doing as he or she had told them?</p></speech>

For the purposes of an inquiry under section 43, a panel may consider&mdash;<blockquote>(a) the information (in so far as that information relates to the conduct the subject of the inquiry) contained in a vetting disclosure obtained by the Investigating Committee under subsection (7A) of section 42 subject to subsection (7C) of that section in like manner as subsection (7C) applies to the Investigating Committee, and<br /><br />(b) submissions (if any) made by the registered teacher concerned under subsection (7A)(b) to the Investigating Committee.</blockquote>5B. (1) Where the Investigating Committee did not seek a vetting disclosure in respect of a registered teacher under section 42(7A) in relation to a complaint and a panel considers that the complaint referred to it by the Investigating Committee under section 42(9)(a) is of such a nature as to reasonably give rise to a <i>bona fide </i>concern that that teacher may-(a) harm any child or vulnerable person,<blockquote><blockquote>(b) cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed,<br /><br />(c) put any child or vulnerable person at risk of harm,<br /><br />(d) attempt to harm any child or vulnerable person, or<br /><br />(e) incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person,<br /><br />the panel may request the Council to apply to the National Vetting Bureau for a vetting disclosure in respect of that registered teacher.</blockquote>(2) Where a panel receives a vetting disclosure under subparagraph (1) in respect of a registered teacher, it shall provide the registered teacher concerned with a copy of the disclosure and invite that teacher to make submissions in writing to the panel in relation to the disclosure within such time period as is specified in the notice.<br /><br />(3) A panel shall consider submissions (if any) made by the registered teacher concerned under subparagraph (2).<br /><br />(4) Subject to subparagraph (5), a panel may consider the information contained in a vetting disclosure obtained under subparagraph (1) in so far as the information relates to the conduct the subject of the complaint, for the purposes of its inquiry.<br /><br />(5) Where a vetting disclosure obtained by the Council under subparagraph (1) in respect of a registered teacher contains specified information and that specified information relates to conduct of the teacher which occurred prior to the coming into operation of <i>section 15 </i>of the <i>Teaching Council (Amendment) Act 2015</i>, the panel may not consider that information for the purposes of subparagraph (4) unless the conduct concerned would have constituted a criminal offence at the time the conduct occurred.&rdquo;</blockquote></blockquote>and&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>This amendment inserts a new provision in Schedule 3 of the Act to make clear that a disciplinary panel, which is considering a complaint that has been referred to it by the investigating committee may also, where the committee had sought a vetting disclosure in respect of that complaint, consider that disclosure for the purpose of the panel's inquiry into the complaint.  It provides that the panel may consider the disclosure in the same manner as the investigating committee may consider it.  The panel is therefore similarly precluded from considering specified information contained in the disclosure where that information relates to conduct which occurred prior to the coming into operation of Part 5 of the Act and where that conduct would not have constituted a criminal offence at the time it occurred.</p><p>Where a vetting disclosure had not previously been requested by the investigating committee, this amendment also makes provision to allow the disciplinary panel itself to request a vetting disclosure if it considers that the complaint gives rise to a bona fide harm concern.  Where the panel requests such a disclosure the amendment provides for the teacher concerned to be provided with a copy of the disclosure and to be invited to make written submissions to the panel in respect of that disclosure.  It requires the disciplinary panel to consider information in such a disclosure only in so far as it related to the conduct which is the subject of the complaint and it precludes the panel from considering specified information contained in a disclosure where that information relates to conduct which occurred prior to the coming into operation of this section and where that conduct would not have constituted a criminal offence at the time it occurred.  This amendment is necessary to ensure that there is a lawful basis for a vetting disclosure obtained by the investigating committee to be provided to and considered by the disciplinary panel appointed to deal with that complaint and to allow the panel itself to request a vetting disclosure where one had not previously been obtained and where the panel considers that the complaint gives rise to a bona fide<i></i>harm concern.</p></speech>

We are amending the Education Act in significant ways as part of the Bill under discussion.  I accept the amendment does not directly relate to the establishment of the Teaching Council but it is important that the issue would be considered.  I wish to broaden the avenues available to parents and students who are not satisfied with how a board of management deals with a particular complaint or issue.  At the moment under section 9 of the Education Act the only instances in which an appeal can be made to the Secretary General of the Department relate primarily to enrolment issues and also to issues of suspension or expulsion of a student from a school.  Where a parent of a child is dissatisfied with how a board of management deals with any other issue no avenue of appeal is open to them outside of a court application.</p><p>Often, in the past when people contacted the Department on the matter they were referred to the Ombudsman for Children.  However, that office is restricted in handling complaints made to it to the process by which the complaint was dealt with as opposed to the content of a complaint.  That is something which needs to be addressed.  It is a role in which the Department, as the overseeing body for education and the setting of education policy, needs to become involved.  In addition, the Department is the primary funding body for education.  We need the Department to provide avenues for appeals to be made to it where a family or a young person aged over 18 feel they have been treated disproportionately or unfairly or a decision has been made by a board of management which is not in their best interests and where there is no provision for an appeal in that regard to another body.</p></speech>

I will introduce further legislation in the near future.  Section 28 of the Education Act 1998 provides for grievance and appeal procedures in schools.  It expresses a desirability of determining appeals and resolving grievances in the schools concerned.  I am not satisfied that the current provisions of section 28, which was of its time, and I plan to revise it in order to provide in law for a charter.  There is a commitment to introduce a charter for parents and learners.  The Deputy will be aware that changes to the Education Act 1998 will be necessary to provide for and support the introduction of a parents and learners charter, and that I am already considering amendments to sections 28 and 29 of the Education Act in that context.</p> <p>  The 1998 Act does not provide a cohesive approach to enhancing the manner in which parents and students are served by schools.  With that in mind, a set of principles will be required to act as the foundation of a charter to strengthen the relationship between parents, students and schools and the position of parents and students generally within the school system.  Therefore, discussion on the matter proposed by the Deputy is premature at this time.  The Deputy will have an opportunity to have his proposals considered and debated in due course when amendments to sections 28 and 29 of the Education Act are progressed further.  I intend to do that before the summer.  There will be more appropriate legislation where we will be able to look at the issues in totality.</p></speech>

The purpose of this section is to review how the Act is working at a particular point in time.</p></speech>

However, I consider it to be unnecessary at this time.  The existing suite of provisions for ongoing oversight of the implementation of the Teaching Council Act and operations of the Teaching Council are comprehensive.  The main purposes of the Bill under consideration are to underpin the Teaching Council's statutory functions in regard to Garda vetting of teachers, to strengthen and clarify the Council's teaching arrangements and to make consequential amendments.  The additional provisions in this Bill have been carefully considered and drafted.  Therefore, I do not consider the proposal necessary.</p> <p>  The Teaching Council appears before this committee.  What we are doing by way of this Bill is amending the original legislation upon which the Council is based.  The Teaching Council also publishes an annual report.  There are opportunities to follow through on these issues in a variety of ways, including by this committee.  All legislation needs to be kept under review in case something is not working in accordance with the intention during its passage.  This is amending legislation and as such a review of it in two years time might not be the most practical way of doing things.</p></speech>

It would also address concerns raised by other Deputies.  Acceptance of the amendment would ensure that issues arising in terms of implementation of the Act could be addressed at a particular time.  If the amendment is not accepted I will withdraw it but propose to resubmit it for Report Stage.</p></speech>

Apparently, the Teaching Council purchases property with money paid to it by teachers, which property it then rents out.  That is pretty bizarre and appears to me to be a pretty strange thing for a Council to do.  Perhaps consideration should be given to the introduction of legislation around whether a Teaching Council should be purchasing property with funds garnered by way of registration fees from teachers, which money rather than being used to purchase property could be returned to the teachers.</p></speech>
