    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B00200"><p>We are joined this morning by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied today by Mahin Fitzpatrick.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Shane Cassells.</p> <p>  We will sign off on the minutes of the recent meeting at next week's meeting.</p> <p>  Members have a list of correspondence in front of them.  Before I get into the correspondence, I must say, as Chairman of the committee, that I am very disappointed that one item of correspondence we requested two weeks has not been received.  We were here two weeks ago with the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills dealing specifically with funding for the ETB sector.  The first question he was asked that morning in public session was the amount of funding to the ETB sector.  We sat here at length in what was an unsatisfactory situation whereby that figure could not be reasonably, accurately and promptly provided to us.  We are here a considerable period of time later and we still have not received it in writing.  I am saying now in public that we will contact the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills and tell him that if we do not have it by Tuesday, he will be here in person next Thursday morning to explain why he has not supplied that information.  The simple message I am sending out is that when witnesses appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and are asked questions and when they give commitments to supply information to the committee, it is not the end of the matter when they walk out of the room.  That information must be supplied.  We will be watchful of all such matters to ensure all these commitments are honoured in full, and I know members will agree with me on this.  The Secretary General will be here next Thursday morning at the commencement of the meeting if we have not received the full information requested by next Tuesday.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B00300"><p>Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B00400"><p>We will now move on to the correspondence received.  The first item, 950A, is the briefing document from the Revenue Commissioners' liaison officer for today's meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Item 956A, correspondence from Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, is his opening statement.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  Correspondence category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-ups to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  The first item is 933B, correspondence received from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 16 November 2017, regarding the transfer of assets of dissolved companies to the State.  This is held over from last week's meeting, so I suggest we note and publish it.  Members are free to study it and use it as they see fit.</p> <p>  The next item is 942B from Mr. David Carson of Deloitte regarding the report carried out by Deloitte entitled Independent Review of the Cost of Care Incurred by a Service Provider.  This relates to the Grace case.  The committee had requested an earlier draft of the report produced in May 2017.  Mr. Carson states that providing such a draft would set a precedent and that a draft report is incomplete and subject to change.  He states that he cannot provide draft reports to a party that is seeking to rely on them for any matter contrary to the basis on which they were prepared.  He does, however, provide explanatory information on the particular issue we spoke about.  We would not want our draft reports circulated until completed so, as Chairman, I understand what he is saying.  There is an item of correspondence there.  Does anyone wish to comment on it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B00500"><p>I think there was further information that was to be forthcoming.  I am almost certain it was agreed that Deloitte would also forward exchanges between the author of the report and the HSE, and maybe that would give us a clear indication as to whether or not suggested changes were coming from the HSE.  I, therefore, propose that we hold off discussing this until we get all of the information, first of all to establish why that has not come yet.  If and when we get that, we will have those exchanges and then the draft report and we will be in a better position then to ask questions about it, so-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B00600"><p>We are still waiting for that second portion-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B00700"><p>Until we get that, I do not see how we can proceed, so I propose that we hold off on any discussion pending receipt of that information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B00800"><p>We will conclude this topic.  We can hold off.  However, I think everyone is agreed that in the meantime we will forward this to the commission of investigation because it is relevant to its work and it would be improper of the Committee of Public Accounts to sit on information that may be relevant without forwarding it.  It does not mean we are not coming back to it, but we will forward it in the meantime.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B00900"><p>Just in a more thoughtful way, we need to consider this business of draft reports and the inappropriateness of their being circulated, or the refusal to circulate them on the basis that they are drafts and therefore not the completed work.  Ordinarily, that makes absolute sense, of course - one wants the finished product and not work in progress - but it is different if a controversy arises or there is a suggestion that something else happened to influence or shape what was in a draft and what was in the finalised document.  Deloitte is right to say that providing us with the draft would set a precedent, but it is not necessarily a bad precedent.  In fact, in some respects for the work of this committee, it might prove a necessary precedent.  It would be the exception, I am sure, and not the rule.  We are not in the market for additional paperwork or additional reports, I can assure the committee, if we can possibly avoid it.  I am just bringing this to the Chairman's attention because, as a rule of thumb, I do not like the committee getting brushed off in that way.  There was a particular reason we made that request.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, and with the Chairman on the course of action here on out, but if we are to correspond with Deloitte I would not like the committee to say that by adopting this stance, draft reports are off limits.  That could hamper future work by this committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B01000"><p>I take the Deputy's point completely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#B01100"><p>I wish to make pretty much the same point as Deputy Cullinane's.  Mr. Tony O'Brien made a very clear commitment that there would be no problem getting that correspondence between the HSE and Deloitte.</p><p>He told us it was no problem.  We were strung along with regard to the Deloitte report.  We were told we were going to see it and it was imminent.  We were told all of that.  There is a pattern here.  I do not think we can criticise the Department of Education and Skills if exactly the same thing is happening in the HSE.  It is not a huge volume of information that we are looking for.  We were told it was no problem when Mr. O'Brien was here.  If it was no problem, why is it taking so long?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#C00200"><p>We will follow it up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#C00300"><p>I had indicated I wished to speak.  I agree with what is being said about the background.  It cannot be dismissed as a draft report that cannot be circulated.  It became an issue because of the issues surrounding it.  The point was being made by the service provider that funding had been reduced.  That was its consistent point to this committee and the previous one.  In response to that and in response to pressure from the Committee of Public Accounts, it was agreed that an independent report would be produced.  With regard to that independent report, Deputy Murphy has made the point that the word "imminent" took on a new meaning.  Imminent does not mean a year or longer.  The interchanges between the parties and the person procuring the report are of great interest.  That is why we asked for the correspondence but we have not received it.  I agree that if we are going to be very critical of one Department it has to be done across the board when the same issues arise.  There is a statement somewhere that the final report was agreed by both parties.  One of the parties did not see the final report.  It is something for that party to follow up on but it would seem it did not see the final report.  I do not know if it is usual to see the final report.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane that it has to go back and then we will look at it in a more nuanced way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#C00400"><p>We are unanimous at this stage.  In the meantime, we will note and publish it because it is on the record.  We will make sure it is sent to the persons concerned with the transcript from the last day.  We will send out a copy of that letter.  While we are on that topic, we recently spoke to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding the unit it had set up to deal with the Charleton tribunal.  As a matter of proper procedure we will send a copy of any correspondence we had on that matter and the transcript of that aspect of the meeting to the Charleton inquiry.  Now that I have considered the matter, since we have concluded our report on NAMA and Project Eagle, which is also subject to a commission of investigation, if anything has come through this committee by way of correspondence or discussion that could be relevant to that commission, it is our duty to send it on.  It is up to the commission then.  Is it agreed that with regard to the investigation into the Grace case, we will send on anything that is said or done here?  It is up to them to deal with it then.  Similarly with regard to the Charleton tribunal, we will forward anything that was said or any other information we have.  We will do the same with regard to the commission of investigation into Project Eagle.  We do not want it said we had information we did not pass on.  I think we all know where we are on that issue.  We will await further correspondence.</p> <p>  The next item concerns correspondence items Nos. 945B and 953B from Mr. Ray Mitchell.  It is follow-up correspondence in response to our meeting with the HSE and Chapter 19 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on section 38 and 39 organisations.  I want to make a comment on this.  I hope people will appreciate the good spirit in which I make it.  It is in contrast to the remarks I have just made.  The reply we have received from the HSE should be the model for how other Departments reply to us.  We asked questions and it deals with them by replying with exact answers to each numbered question.  It is very thorough and complete.  The HSE has improved its communication with us by replying to each specific issue raised.  For the information of the public, we will note and publish the reply.  We asked for the breakdown of the section 38 organisations required to publish their annual reports.  The HSE gave us a list of the 30 organisations.  There is a list of 14 others that are not incorporated bodies and do not have to lodge accounts with the Companies Registration Office, CRO, but which are published as well.  With regard to section 38 organisations that have received over &euro;3 million in funding, we wanted to ensure that all of the 2016 accounts were received by the HSE.  This letter provides a list of 43 such organisations and only three are outstanding.  They are Cheeverstown House company limited by guarantee, Leopardstown Park Hospital Trust and St. John of God Community Services, company limited by guarantee.  Three out of 43 is very good progress and the HSE is to be commended on getting such a high number.  If only other Departments were so good.  Under the section 39 not-for-profit organisations, there is a list of 65 organisations that are required to supply their 2016 financial statements.  Only five of the 65 have not yet done so.  That is a very high hit rate.  We can discuss the content of the HSE correspondence later but I acknowledge the way it is approaching our questions by systematically answering every one and getting those accounts in on a timely basis.  If the rest of the public service got their accounts in as quickly as the HSE seems to be doing with the section 38 and 39 organisations, there would be improved public accountability.  That is an administrative point rather than the substance of the point.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#C00500"><p>I commend any section 38 or 39 organisation on the timely presentation of accounts but that was not the issue we were discussing.  It is good that it has happened but we have had a lengthy discussion about the failings in a number of these organisations, which arose from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  While this happened on the back of a targeted auditing, we heard from the internal auditor that he had difficulty with a lot of these failings.  We could refer to the situation of Console; its internal audit report showed the issues were systemic and had raised questions for the HSE nationally.  We then saw a list of more than a dozen organisations over which red flags had been raised.  Some of them were new because others in which there were difficulties came into the public domain after we discussed the issue of Console.  We know there are issues in the sector.  I add a caveat to that by saying I understand many of these organisations are small and such a level of governance and oversight can be quite difficult for them to manage.  Some of these organisations get very significant funding from the State and some of the failings were of real concern.  We have had an exchange with the director general of the HSE.  What is the next course of action?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#C00600"><p>We have sought some information so the next course of action, which we will discuss in our work programme, is to produce a report.  Can we come to it in the work programme in a few minutes?  That is the next step.  We will come to it on the agenda in a few minutes.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 946B from Mr. David Keating of the national patient safety office in the Department of Health providing details as requested by the committee regarding the employment status of the 101 inspectors in the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 952B dated 27 November 2017 from Mr. Michael Nolan of Transport Infrastructure Ireland providing follow-up information on a number of items requested at our meeting of 12 October.  We should note and publish it.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 954B dated 28 November 2017 from Ms Madeleine Halpin of Tusla providing an update on the implementation of recommendations made in the Geoffrey Shannon report.  Ms Halpin also corrects two inaccuracies with regard to details given at the meeting with Tusla last month.  We will note and publish that as well.  </p> <p>  The next item is category C correspondence dated 30 November 2017 from Deputy McDonald on matters raised in a "Prime Time" programme on hospital consultants.  I am sure the Deputy would like to speak on that.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#C00700"><p>I do not want to delay things but I am sure everyone saw the "Prime Time" programme and the serious issues it raised.  They are issues which for the most part will need to be dealt with in the Oireachtas through the health committee and on the floor of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I was struck by the issue of the spending of public money on consultant contracts.  There was a suggestion that some consultants were not fulfilling the hours' requirements and yet were being paid from the public purse with public money.</p><p>That particular issue, as opposed to broader policy issues, ought to concern this committee.  I do not need to rehearse for anyone how unacceptable it is if this is a widespread practice or a practice adopted by a small minority within the consultant community.  I am not saying that this is the core reason for the failures of the health system but, given our stewardship, we need to consider and get to the bottom of this issue.  It concerns the spending of public moneys and accountability at every level in that regard.  We are in the midst of a busy programme of work, but I suggest that we carve out time for this.  I emphasise that I am referring to this niche issue, not general issues.  We are not equipped and do not have the scope, capacity or terms of reference to deal with the broader issues, but this issue falls squarely within our remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#D00200"><p>It does indeed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#D00300"><p>I concur.  The issue of not honouring contracts is important because it has financial consequences.  If we are exploring it, though, we could also explore a related matter, namely, that of tax avoidance.  We dealt with this.  In a report, the Comptroller and Auditor General brought our attention to a practice whereby consultants established companies and paid corporation tax rather than PAYE, and that they were availing of improper allowances.  I am not saying that every consultant does this, but it was a practice within the health service.  We put questions to Revenue, but we never got the chance to put questions to consultants, a group representing them or the HSE.  If we are examining the issue of consultants, there is a considerable amount involved that is relevant to this committee.</p> <p>  Deputy McDonald is right about the governance issues and the financial fallout of consultants being paid to do a job and not doing it, which falls under our remit.  If a practice is being employed by some consultants to avoid paying income tax and there is a loss of revenue to the Exchequer, that also falls under the remit of the committee.  In light of both issues, this is a serious enough matter to put on our work programme.  Perhaps we can discuss it later.</p></speech>

We have three other items of correspondence - I believe I received some last night or this morning - regarding Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, that have not yet been circulated.  A number raise important legal and procedural issues and some that I have seen are potentially libellous.  I propose that we ask the secretariat to liaise with the legal adviser and prepare a proposal for us for next week.  I was not happy to circulate the correspondence.  Some of it refers to High Court proceedings.  I want to obtain advice.  The secretariat will revert to us next week with a proposal on how to handle the various items of correspondence that have been received - some of it from members of the ETB - by me, the committee or members.  We will deal with the matter next week.</p></speech>

He certainly wrote to the committee indirectly given that the Secretary General of the Department wrote to us and made reference to advice that Dr. Thorn was giving us as well.  I am concerned about that.  I stand over what I said at the previous meeting.  Without repeating any of that, we should at least write to Dr. Thorn asking for an explanation.  That might give us scope to consider whether we should take this matter further.  I was concerned that if this were to become the precedent, it would hamper our ability to do our job.  There can be parallel examinations.  The role of the Committee of Public Accounts is to examine systems, processes and procedures.  We are not in the business of telling the Department what it should do in its examinations.  We can offer opinions, but how the Department puts its processes in place is its responsibility.  If any member of the committee had advised a member of the ETB not to co-operate with Dr. Thorn pending the witness' appearance before us, that would have been inappropriate.  Why, therefore, is it okay for Dr. Thorn to advise members of the ETB not to co-operate with this committee?  I still have a difficulty with that and I was not satisfied with the responses we received from the Secretary General.  At the very least, we should write to Dr. Thorn asking for an explanation and his rationale.  There may be one and I would like to hear it.</p></speech>

On the screen, there are three sets of accounts, the first of which relates to the Social Insurance Fund.  While there is a clear audit opinion, chapter 16 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report this year deals with the estimated level of irregular payments in respect of certain Social Insurance Fund schemes, which is material.  That item is on our agenda for next week with the Department and we will deal with it then.</p><p> The next item is the Environmental Protection Agency.  Its 2016 accounts were given a clear audited opinion.  The other item is the Institute of Technology Tallaght.  It received a clear audited opinion except for the non-recognition of pension costs and liabilities.  That is the standard issue raised by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General with all of the institutes of technology.  We note those.  We will deal with the social insurance fund accounts next Thursday.  </p></speech>

That will be the core of our work programme and the other items can come up.

We are dealing today with the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 Report.</p><p>I apologise - I should have said Mr. Keith Walsh.  <br/><br/>We are dealing today the Comptroller and Auditor General's report from 2016 and specifically with chapter 20 on corporation tax receipts.  We are joined from the Department of Finance by Mr. John Hogan, assistant secretary, Mr. John McCarthy, assistant secretary, and Mr. R&oacute;n&aacute;n Hession, principal officer.<br/><br/>I remind members, witnesses and everyone in the room that all mobile phones must be switched off or put into aeroplane mode.  I advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order No. 186 to the effect that the committee should refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<br/><br/>In the context of today's meeting, that last statement is important.  Corporation tax is a very important issue for the economy.  We want to deal with the accuracy and collection of corporation tax forecasting and receipts.  We will be trying to ascertain what accounts for what appears to be some inconsistencies in forecasting.  I will now invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#H00200"><p>The Revenue Commissioners collected a net &euro;7.35 billion in corporation tax receipts in 2016.  This was the highest level of corporation tax receipts recorded in any year, accounting for 15.3% of net tax and duties receipts.  Receipts in 2016 were 7% up on the previous year and followed an exceptional and unexpected 49% increase in net receipts recorded for 2015.  My examination was carried out to try to gain a better understanding of what factors lay behind the 2015 increase.  Although corporation tax applies to a very broad base of companies, the receipts are highly concentrated among a small number of companies and in a number of key sectors.  In 2016, some 70% of receipts were paid by the top 100 taxpayers or 0.2% of taxpayer companies. By comparison, the top 1% of corporation taxpayer companies in the UK accounted for 54% of corporation tax receipts.</p> <p>  Three sectors of the Irish economy accounted for around 70% of the total corporation tax receipts in 2016, namely, financial and insurance activities, manufacturing, including pharmaceutical manufacturing, and information and communications service providers. </p> <p>  Members will be aware that the effective rate of corporation tax paid by a company may differ from the statutory or headline rate of corporation tax due to the impact of a range of allowable tax reliefs.  The availability and use of such reliefs complicates international comparisons of corporation tax rates and also impacts on the amount of tax received in Ireland from year to year.  The method used by the Revenue Commissioners defines the effective tax rate as tax due as a proportion of taxable income.  The standard statutory corporation tax rate applicable to most trading income is 12.5%.  Using the Revenue approach, the effective tax rate that applied to all companies in Ireland in 2015 was an estimated 9.8%.  I understand that since the report was finalised in September, Revenue has received more complete data in this regard.  The accounting officer will be able to outline the impact of this. </p> <p>  The examination looked at the effective corporation tax rates of the top 100 companies in Ireland ranked by tax due and ranked by taxable income.  For the top 100 companies ranked by tax due in 2015, the average effective tax rate was 12.4%.  The effective tax rate averaged 9.3% when the top 100 companies are ranked on the basis of taxable income.  As indicated in the diagram on screen now, eight of the 100 companies with the highest taxable income had an effective tax rate of zero, including some who had negative rates, that is, instead of paying corporation tax, they received rebates.  A further five had an effective rate of less than 1%.  These very low effective rates reflected the use by the companies of significant tax credits and reliefs, in particular, double taxation relief and research and development tax credits.  However, it should also be noted that 79 of the highest earning companies had effective tax rates of 10% or more and that almost two thirds of the highest earning companies had effective tax rates of 12% or more.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Liam Gallagher, Ms Jeanette Doonan and Mr. Keith Walsh.  The focus today is on chapter 20 of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which is entitled Corporation Tax Receipts.  While chapter 20 does not contain any recommendations for Revenue, in the time available, I will provide a short briefing on corporation tax receipts.  At the outset I want to draw attention to my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality as provided for in section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which prevents me from commenting on the tax affairs of any individual or entity.<br/><br/>The Comptroller and Auditor General's 2016 report and Mr. Seamus Coffey&rsquo;s review of the corporation tax code<i>, </i>which was published in September 2017, both contain useful analyses of recent trends in corporation tax receipts.  Both reports also highlight the volatility in corporation tax receipts over the past decade or more.  Over recent years, Revenue has sought to contribute to the analysis of trends in corporation tax receipts by publishing a number of research and analysis papers containing statistical information and aggregate data from corporation tax returns and payments. <br/><br/>Since 2015, there has been a significant increase in corporation tax receipts.  In 2015, net receipts increased by 49% to &euro;6.87 billion and this upward trend continued into 2016, when &euro;7.35 billion was collected.  Corporation tax receipts to the end of October 2017 are &euro;5.42 billion, which is 4% ahead of target.  While volatility in this area makes forecasting difficult, the Coffey review points to the level shift in corporation tax receipts since 2015 as being sustainable over the medium term to 2020.<br/><br/>In an effort to facilitate better understanding of the recent increases in corporation tax receipts, Revenue has analysed the available statistical information, including corporation tax returns and receipts.  In 2016, Revenue published a paper analysing receipts in 2014 and 2015 based on a review of available tax return and payment data.  In April 2017, coinciding with the publication of our 2016 annual report, Revenue published a research paper containing an analysis of 2015 corporation tax returns and payments made in 2016.  Both papers have been provided to the committee as part of Revenue&rsquo;s briefing on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.<br/><br/>The analysis for 2015 is based on a review of corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in the calendar year 2015, the majority of which were filed towards the end of 2016.  Revenue&rsquo;s analysis of 2015 returns revealed that the increase in corporation tax receipts in that year was attributable to a number of factors, the main one being an increase in trading profits across nearly all sectors.  In 2015, trading profits increased by 51% to &euro;48 billion.  However, some of that increase was offset by increased claims for reliefs, including capital allowances and research and development tax credits.  There was a significant increase in claims for capital allowances in 2015, with claims relating to intangible assets increasing by over &euro;26 billion.  The number of companies paying corporation tax was another contributor to the increase in receipts in 2015.  In 2015, some 39,900 companies paid corporation tax, as compared to 35,700 companies in 2014.  Companies that paid tax in 2015, but not in 2014, accounted for a &euro;470 million increase in 2015 corporation tax receipts.  Generally speaking, companies newly paying corporation tax are either start-up businesses, or companies returning to a profit-making position.  Over 7,900 companies that carried forward losses into 2014 did not carry any losses into 2015.</p><p>While this is evidence that some companies have fully used up their legacy losses from the economic downturn, more than &euro;200 billion of trading losses were carried forward at the end of 2015 and will be available for the relevant companies to use against income of the same trade in future accounting periods.</p><p> In April 2017, Revenue published an initial analysis of corporation tax payments in 2016.  The majority of these returns were only recently filed and it will take some time to analyse the data in depth.  Revenue will analyse the returns to provide further details on the factors underlying the payment trends in 2016 and this analysis will be published in April 2018.</p><p> I will now address the source of corporation tax payments in 2016.  As has been highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, by the Coffey review and by Revenue&rsquo;s own published research papers, there continues to be a high concentration of corporation tax receipts from a small number of large multinational enterprises.  Revenue records show that in 2016, more than 80% of total corporation tax receipts came from companies dealt with by Revenue&rsquo;s large cases division and 37% of total corporation tax receipts were paid by the ten largest corporation taxpayers in the State.  This is a lower level of concentration than in 2015, when the top ten tax-paying companies accounted for 41% of total corporation tax payments.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General's report includes an examination of the effective rate of corporation tax in Ireland.  There is no internationally-agreed standard for calculating effective rates of tax.  In 2014, the Department of Finance published a technical paper on effective rates of corporation tax in Ireland, which identified eight different methodologies that are used to calculate the effective rate of tax, and set out the two most appropriate methods to measure the effective rate of Irish corporation tax.  One of these, the tax due as a proportion of taxable income, is identified as appropriate to measure the effective rate of Irish corporation tax on the total profits that are subject to Irish tax.  Consequently, this is the measure used by Revenue.  The most recent year for which information is available from which to calculate the effective tax rate is 2015.  The effective overall corporation tax rate for 2015 calculated by Revenue is 9.6%.  The figure of 9.8% in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was based on provisional data available earlier in the year and I can confirm that the final figure is 9.6%.</p><p> As noted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the average effective tax rate for the 100 companies with the highest amounts of taxable income in 2015 was 9.3%.  Of the top 100 companies, 13 had an effective Irish tax rate of less than 1%.  Each of these 13 companies was either in receipt of large amounts of foreign dividends, in respect of which double tax relief was available to offset Irish tax payable, or was a claimant of research and development tax credits.  I will briefly explain the impact that both of these claims have on the effective Irish corporation tax rate.</p><p> On foreign dividends, Ireland applies a credit system to ensure that foreign-source income, including foreign dividends, is not doubly taxed.  This means that an Irish-resident company in receipt of foreign dividends is chargeable to Irish tax on that income at either 12.5% or 25%, depending on the country from which it is paid and whether the dividends are paid out of trading profits.  Where certain criteria are met, however, a credit will be available against Irish tax in respect of any foreign withholding taxes applied in the country of payment, as well as in respect of foreign tax suffered on the profits out of which the dividend has been paid.  In certain circumstances, what is called an additional foreign credit may also be due.  This is a credit that Ireland introduced in 2013 in response to a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union that foreign-source dividends should not be subject to tax at a higher level than nationally-sourced dividends.  In summary, a company in receipt of substantial foreign dividend income will have substantial taxable income. However, the tax due element of the effective rate calculation only takes account of the Irish tax due, as reduced by the credit for foreign tax, and this results in a low effective tax rate for the company in Ireland.  When foreign taxes are factored in, the company will have paid significantly higher rates of tax on its income.  Our records show that if the effective tax rate of the relevant companies with substantial foreign dividend income is calculated before the application of a double tax credit, each company would have an effective tax rate of 12% or more.</p><p> The research and development tax credit is a targeted measure designed to encourage companies to undertake high-value added research and development activity in Ireland.  A report published by the Department of Finance with budget 2017 states that the research and development tax credit is responsible for 60% of the research and development being conducted in Ireland.  Research and development tax credits, which are available at the rate of 25% of relevant expenditure on research and development activities, can be offset against Irish corporation tax payable and, in certain circumstances, may give rise to payable credits.  Where claimed, they will reduce a company&rsquo;s corporation tax liability and result in the company having a lower effective tax rate.  As the committee is aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on the operation of the research and development credit in his 2015 report and the committee examined its operation with me at my last appearance before the committee on 1 June last.  In summary, if the effective tax rate of each of the 13 companies is calculated before taking account of double tax relief and the research and development tax credit, each would have an effective tax rate in excess of 12%.</p><p> Since the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, and as the committee is aware, certain information and allegations originating from the so-called Paradise Papers, have emerged.  As the committee will be aware, yesterday evening, I addressed these issues in detail before the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, at its invitation.  A copy of my opening statement to that committee is available for members' further information.</p><p> I thank the committee and I will answer any questions raised by members on these issues, subject, of course, to taxpayer confidentiality constraints. </p></speech>

I want to ask the Department of Finance a question first about Ireland's arrangement on corporation tax, which is the topic we are discussing today, and about the decision by the European Commission on the illegal state aid arising from our corporation tax arrangements with multinational companies.  It was decided in August 2016 that &euro;13 billion was to be collected by Ireland.  That was 15 months ago.  Ireland was given a number of months to do so and has not met the deadline.  Six months after the deadline expired, the Commission indicated that it may take the case to the European Court of Justice given that Ireland is not complying with the Commission's decision.  We are not here to discuss the case or the merits of what is due or where it is due.  This is not a discussion for the Committee of Public Accounts today.  That will be decided at European level.  Pending that decision Ireland was instructed to collect that money.  I am aware of the complexities involved in that.  I know it is not a simple question of opening up an account in Dublin Castle and sending over the money.  We know this and the Department does not need to tell us this.  I understand that an arrangement has to be put in place for an escrow account to be opened.  I understand the account will have to be managed for the entire duration and that management must be in place for the issue of the interest rates and be responsible for the handling of gain or loss on that investment.  I understand that the account will probably have to be held in bonds instead of cash - or a combination of both.  The Minister has indicated during oral statements in the D&aacute;il Chamber and written answers to parliamentary questions that investment managers would have to be appointed by mid-November.  I also understand that in July 2017 the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, started the procurement process in respect of appointing advisers on this matter.  This was six months after the deadline by which we were told by the European Commission to collect the money.  Perhaps the Department could tell the committee - as we sit here - where the &euro;13 billion is, given that the European Commission decision was for &euro;13 billion to be collected by Ireland arising from our corporation tax arrangements with multinational companies.</p></speech>

The alleged state aid calculated by the Commission at the time was in the region of &euro;13 billion.  The Chairman asked where we are in that regard.  The Chairman is right that we will not discuss the appeal, which is before the European Court of Justice as, obviously, there are limitations on what we could say on the appeal.  Notwithstanding the appeal, and the difference in view between the Ireland and the Commission on the case, Ireland is committed to respecting the decision of the Commission in this regard.</p><p> The Chairman has touched on some of the challenges we have in respect of this case.  It is an unprecedented amount for state aid recovery.  It requires a bespoke solution.  It is complex in terms of the nature of the volume of the alleged aid involved and it is set against the particular backdrop of a negative interest rate environment.  We looked at the options around what could be done on this.  In many cases the idea of an escrow account is a solution but an escrow account in this case would have been a sub-optimal solution because we have a large amount of money that has to be managed in a particular way, as the Chairman have noted.  Given that it is likely to be the subject of management for several years until the final conclusion is reached in the case, we have been careful in terms of how we have put in place infrastructure to manage it.  We have been involved with the Commission on a consistent basis explaining what has been going on in the background and the extensive work done by the Department in partnership with the Office of the Attorney General and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, as well as our engagements with the company.</p><p> Given the nature of the funds involved we need to look at the matter in context.  A sum of &euro;13 billion is twice the size of our existing Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, fund.  It is half the size of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, at its height.  The moneys at issue are market moving moneys.  Therefore, whatever solution we put in place has to be cognisant of that scenario.</p><p> We have made a great deal of progress in recent months in reaching agreement with the company involved in terms of the nature of the fund we put in place.  The Chairman is right to say it has taken far longer than we thought or anticipated that it could have taken.  At one stage we were signalling to the Commission that, given the size and scale of what we have, it would be nine to ten months from earlier in this year before we would have a solution in place.  It has taken a little longer than that.  We are at the stage now where we expect that, in the next short while, the arrangements will be endorsed by ourselves and the company involved.  That is our anticipation, against the background of what has been a good deal of work.</p><p> In tandem - the Chairman alluded to this &ndash; we issued a RFT for investment managers in the summer of this year to find custodians-----</p></speech>

The idea was to look for the types of companies that have the capacity to manage the types of funds we have in a way that would be responsible and that would adhere to the types and standards that we would expect.  That competition was launched in the summer.  The types of services of an escrow agent or custodian are bespoke.  Such services are not issued or looked for on a regular basis.  In recent months there has been engagement between interested tenderers and the NTMA.  We could have taken the option of waiting until the escrow fund was in place to commence that procedure.  However, in view of the commitment we had to recover the money as quickly as possible, we kicked off the procedure in advance on the basis of the information that we had at the time.</p> <p>  The conclusion of our negotiations with the company and the agreement in terms of how the escrow fund will operate will give us the latitude to conclude the competitions for the appointment of the escrow agent and custodian.  In parallel, a competition is also under way for the appointment of an escrow manager to manage the funds.  Given the links and relationships, there is a bespoke nature to the type of arrangement we have and to the types of services we are interested in procuring.  We anticipate that in the next short while, we will see the necessary arrangements being put in place for us to fulfil the obligations placed on us by the Commission.</p></speech>

You have also referred to the need for agents and a manager for the fund.  You are saying a decision was made in August 2016 telling Ireland to collect that money.  We did not do that in 2016.  You are now saying it will not happen in 2017.  You are saying Apple proposes this will happen in 2018.  I listened to what you said a minute ago and I have listened to what the Minister has said in the D&aacute;il in recent weeks on the matter to the effect that this process is to be concluded shortly or very soon or by mid-November.  You are now saying that it will not be concluded this year and you are confirming that Apple is saying it will not be handing over the money this year and that it will be 2018.  That is what Apple has said in its financial statements.  Can you understand that people are concerned about how long the Department is taking to do it?</p></speech>

However, in the nature of what we are trying to do here there is considerable complexity.  It is bespoke in terms of the approach around the types of structures that we are trying to put in place.  I can assure you there has been no resistance or lack of effort on our part in terms of what we are trying to achieve around all of this.</p> <p>  In tandem with dealing with the particular company involved, we have also been dealing on a consistent basis with the Commission and the Commission services team to keep them abreast of it.  The Commission approach to dealing with state aid has involved taking certain actions that were disappointing, especially considering that the amounts involved in respect of this state aid case are extremely large.  The Commission needs a particular structure to be put in place.  This structure has not existed in terms of what we have seen thus far in other state aid cases.  We want to ensure that what we have in place represents the optimal solution, especially from the perspective of the Irish taxpayer.</p></speech>

We are here to discuss corporation tax and that is why I am raising this issue.  I understand that Ireland was disappointed with the original European Commission decision.  You have now said that you are disappointed that the Commission indicated recently that it is taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice for not collecting the money before now.  That is your second public disappointment with the European Commission's approach.   Many Irish people support the Commission approach to how that should be handled although some would disagree with it.  The only issue at stake in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Department of Finance is the question that this money should have been collected and put in some account in the meantime.  Naturally, all of this is pending the resolution of all those decisions and however long that takes &ndash; it will take a considerable period.  Anyway, we are only talking about the actions of the Department of Finance in the meantime.  It has nothing to do with the overall case.  You have said the Department is working hard and doing everything.  Although you have said the Department has kept the Commission abreast of the position, it is clear the Commission does not seem satisfied because Commission representatives have indicated that Ireland's delay in collecting the money as an interim situation is a matter for the European Court of Justice.</p><p>Nobody at EU level has agreed.  Regarding the wider debate we will have on policy, it does not help Ireland's case that we are now being threatened by the European Court of Justice, just not to collect the money.  Does the Department understand that it may not be good for Ireland's international reputation that we are now being taken to the European Court of Justice for not collecting this money?  Mr. Hogan might not agree with that, but he can see the point.</p></speech>

The NTMA's role is to manage the sovereign debt, to reduce debt-serving costs to the Irish sovereign.</p> <p>  The Chairman is absolutely right.  It has amassed a huge amount of liquid and semi-liquid assets, which are mostly sitting on deposit in the various banks.

Why is there no calculation of it?  There is a clear exposure to the State?  How much to these people cost?  How much does the infrastructure cost?  That is a cost incurred by the State that may accrue to the taxpayer, depending on how this case goes in a number of years' time.

Putting a very large sum of money into the escrow account or the escrow fund on the first day would pose challenges for any fund manager.

This company reported $256.8 billion in cash reserves, according to MarketWatch.com, which I just googled a second ago.  Mr. Hogan says that it might be difficult or unexpected for the company to come up with the amount in one tranche and that this sort of investment would have knock-on effects for the managers.  I am no expert but, regardless of whether the amount is &euro;13 million, &euro;130 million or &euro;13 billion, if the company has it, we should have it because that is what the Commission wants.</p></speech>

It would probably be useful to discuss how we are structured.  Revenue has a dedicated division to deal with large cases across the country.  That division is responsible for compliance management and customer service in respect of 698 groups - the large multinationals, the companies that figure in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The 698 groups comprise 6,500 companies.  These are proactively managed by the large cases division.  The division was established in 2003 in the Revenue restructuring process.  How it manages large cases is regarded as best practice.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General and our reports state, it is responsible for 80% of the corporate tax receipts paid by companies in Ireland.  Dedicated teams are dealing with that.  The challenge of ensuring compliance, the type of companies involved and the other complexities are part and parcel of the work that we do in managing risk.</p></speech>

The basis of the state aid decision is set out in the decision, but it was also set out in a process that went on probably for two years, beginning with an initial opinion.  There is a formal process in which the Commission sets out its interpretation of the state aid rules.  It has come up with a decision.  There would have been significant interaction and toing and froing between Ireland and the Commission.  At the end of the process the Commission came up with its decision, part of which is that, in its opinion, there is state aid.  That is the basis on which its decision is based.  It has to do with worldwide profits as opposed to the profits attributable to the Irish branch.  We have discussed that issue here numerous times and at other committees.  The job with which we have been tasked is to calculate the liability that will arise if the Commission's decision is correct, having regard to the detail-----</p></speech>

In fairness to it, the reason it included the figure in the press release rather than the decision was that, broadly, it had taken the worldwide profits and multiplied the figure by 12.5%.  That is the basic approach.  What the Commission would not have carried out is a detailed examination of the component elements of each year.  Regarding the idea of us looking back over the 11-year period or the period of ten years plus, we have to go through the information in granular detail for the given case.  However, we would not have any legal basis on which to engage in a similar exercise for any other company.</p></speech>

In this case, given its complexity and bespoke nature, we have tried to bring the Commission along in its understanding of what we would be faced with when we would look to put the structure in place to capture this amount of money.  Earlier in the year I was anxious to ensure there would be no misunderstanding.  We would have tried to alleviate any misunderstanding on the Commission's part that this was a simple matter of opening an account and putting the money in it; that was just not what was going to happen and could not possibly happen.  Therefore, we have been building our relationship with the Commission services team over time.  In the past few weeks our team has been sitting down face-to-face with Commission staff to bring them through the structure and design as we currently see them.  We will continue to do this over time.</p></speech>

It simply wants the transfer.  Again, I am characterising the situation.  Has Mr. Hogan discussed the proceeds in any way?  For instance, if one puts &euro;13 billion into a current account, one will receive considerable interest.  If one puts it into an investment account, one will get a vast sum in return.  Has Mr. Hogan discussed where the money will go?  Has there been any discussion on who would bear the cost of managing the account?  Would it be paid out of the investment proceeds?  Has Mr. Hogan got into to that level of detail?</p></speech>

Companies complete corporation tax returns.  Large companies also provide accounts and XBRL data for us.  We take a risk-based approach.  Ultimately, considering the types of entity with which we are involved, we know the companies and the countries in which the foreign tax is being paid and the rules that apply under double taxation agreements.</p><p>In an audit process we can look for proof, and we can also look under exchange with other countries for confirmation of amounts.  Given the type of entities involved and the type of claim involved, first, the dividend income is declared.  It comes from a particular country.  The rules that apply in that country are very clear.  The double tax agreements are very clear.  The legislation is very clear.  It would be one of the low-risk checks, and a very simply check to carry out, to confirm the rules were applied appropriately and the tax computations involved.</p><p> On the type of challenges we have in managing large multinational enterprises, the idea that any of them would make a false declaration, which is the context of the question, would not be the case because of all sorts of accounting rules and sets of accounts.  Certainly, it is very easy for us to confirm the amounts, and we would do that as part of our ongoing risk approach on all cases.</p></speech>

Approximately 80% them are paying over 10%.  Mr. Cody mentioned rather helpfully in his statement that "In summary, if the effective tax rate of each of the 13 companies is calculated before taking account of double tax relief and the R&amp;D tax credit, each would have an effective tax rate in excess of 12%".  In terms of whether those who should be paying tax are paying tax, this, in itself, is satisfactory.  The R&amp;D tax credit, introduced in 2013, is a policy matter and therefore does not come under the remit of this committee.  However, it is interesting that if one removes it, there is a 12 percentage point differential which is substantial - sorry, I should say, when one includes double taxation.  One cannot qualify it precisely, or perhaps one can - if Mr. Cody can intercede, he should feel free to do so.  If one removes the R&amp;D tax credit element, what percentage of tax would the 13 companies have paid?  Can Mr. Cody do that?</p></speech>

Fifteen hundred and thirty-six companies claimed the R&amp;D credit in 2015.  They claimed a total of &euro;708 million.  Each year, the amount of the R&amp;D credit has gone up.  The policy decisions around R&amp;D has been to broaden the scope of the credit and a number of years ago, a refundable element was brought into the R&amp;D credit.  As I said in my opening remarks, the R&amp;D credit was subject to an examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the 2015 accounts and we had a discussion about it here, back in June, on the level of audit that we carry out on the R&amp;D credit.</p> <p>  The significant issue around R&amp;D credit is ultimately a policy issue.  Ireland is keen to deepen the involvement higher up the development chain of companies in Ireland and the R&amp;D credit is seen as a support of that process.  The Department of Finance did a review on that and published it last year.  The most significant proportion of the R&amp;D credit is claimed by large multinational companies because they are spending the biggest proportion of the money on the R&amp;D credits, and that just makes sense.</p> <p>  In the report we published in April 2017, we gave some significant breakdown of the R&amp;D element, by sector and by multinational, compared to small companies.  On the 13 cases, we could certainly show the number of them that were in receipt of the R&amp;D credit.  Some of them were in receipt of both the double tax and the R&amp;D credit, depending on where they were.  I refer to the impact, if you took out the R&amp;D credit.  Mr. Seamus Coffey gets mentioned a lot when we discuss corporation tax receipts.  One of the things he did was he did a commentary on the chapter and he highlighted the fact that the R&amp;D credit is actually related to expenditure, and it is not like the companies can get a kind of free credit.  They have to spend this money on R&amp;D.</p></speech>

Revenue has come under significant criticism from elements of the sector.  What they have accused us of is an overaggressive approach to the audit of the R&amp;D tax credit.  A number or practitioners have commented on that, including making representations to the OECD about an overly aggressive approach to R&amp;D credit.  That was what we were discussing.</p></speech>

It has improved significantly.  In record keeping in relation to R&amp;D, there are onerous requirements to substantiate that it is original R&amp;D.</p> <p>  There are essentially two elements to the claims: one is an accounting process; and the other is what we call the science test, even though R&amp;D is not just science.  We do the accounting test ourselves.  If there is a challenge, because, obviously, we are not experts in whatever bioengineering or pharmaceutical, we engage experts to satisfy us in the context of an audit that the research and development meets the legislation standards that are set out.</p></speech>

What we have tried to do is improve our guidance as we come across new insights.</p> <p>  I was asked a few years ago here could we not pre-approve every R&amp;D claim because that would provide great certainty.  The mantra in tax is certainty.  It is really important.  When we teased it out, we came to the conclusion that if we did that we would stop all research and development taking place because you would have to have the experts in at the start and there are not even that many experts there.</p> <p>  I suppose some of the research and development is very clearly cutting edge - totally new.  Others are enhancements and development of the system.  It is a really important piece of the Irish investment situation and the Irish tax code.  It is set out in legislation and we have to deal with it.</p></speech>

There have been fairly significant changes over the last number of years.</p><p>They are a matter of fact.  With the change that took place in 2014, all Irish-incorporated companies are essentially now Irish resident unless they are resident in another double taxation agreement country.  Since pre-1999, there was essentially a set of rules.  Changes took place in 1999 and significant changes happened in 2013 and then in 2014.  That is all set in legislation and is a matter of fact.  Companies registered in Ireland register with the Companies Registration Office and over the past number of years, we have engaged in a process around balancing the companies registered with the Companies Registration Office and registered for corporation tax.  There are some reasons relating to shelf companies, for example, they are not trading.  There are forms to be filled out and we look after that process.</p></speech>

I refer to Mr. Cody's opening statement.  He rightly reminded us of section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which precludes him from discussing the tax affairs of any taxpayer.

Section 851A was inserted into the Taxes Consolidation Act a number of years ago to confirm that process.  Ultimately, it is a policy issue.  It is a decision.  Whether we end up with a complete open process that makes everybody's tax records available is ultimately a decision I do not make.  I implement the law.  It is a criminal offence to breach section 851A.</p></speech>

I clearly understand that it is Mr. Cody's role to implement whatever policy is in place so, obviously, I understand that.  My point is that there are other countries where there is proper scrutiny and even publication of the taxes paid by individuals, including high net worth individuals and companies.  We operate a different system.  We are the Committee of Public Accounts and it is our job to scrutinise how money is spent, which can be done very easily, and how money is raised, which is more problematic because we cannot discuss whether or not individual companies or individuals themselves have actually paid the taxes they should have paid or even scrutinise that.  We must take Mr. Cody's word for it.  We cannot scrutinise it.  I am only making this point by way of an observation because a number of these big companies are going to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We have invited them and, hopefully, they will come before us voluntarily.  Some have already acknowledged that they will-----</p></speech>

He should feel free to completely disagree with me in terms of my analysis.  What I see when I see systems in place that preclude us from talking about taxes that people can pay is a system of secrecy.  I do not like a system that is built around secrecy.  I would much prefer it if we had full transparency where we could examine all of these issues, particularly as messengers of the people.  As a Committee of Public Accounts, we have a clear duty to examine systems, processes and procedures in respect of how money is raised and spent.  I do not believe we are fully in a position to do that because of the limitations of that Act.  I clearly understand that it is not for Mr. Cody to even comment on that.

I have a responsibility as chairman of the board of the Revenue Commissioners and as Accounting Officer for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to appear in front of the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees.  We publish an detailed annual report.  We have governance frameworks in place for which we are accountable.  We publish our annual report every April with detailed analysis of our activity.  Over a long number of years, we increasingly publish granular data comparing annual receipts from corporation tax, for example, with CSO and economic activity.  We are also subject to examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who has permanent access to all of our systems, files and records in respect of every taxpayer in the State.</p></speech>

We had a good discussion on this last night.  I discussed it at the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of HSB Swiss.  It is a core part of some of the inquires and investigations the Comptroller and Auditor General has done, going back to the original work of the Committee of Public Accounts in 1999 on bogus non-resident accounts.  The process we use has been adopted by many tax administrations following the work which we have done. </p></speech>

All I am doing is putting questions to him.  I am reading a statement that Mr. Cody made where he said that Revenue's approach to tackling offshore evasion is recognised by the OECD and that, then, is the benchmark.  I am reading from two reports by the OECD, one from 2000 where it identified seven jurisdictions which it says were tax havens, namely, Andorra, the Principality of Liechtenstein, Liberia, the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of Vanuatu.  In May 2009, the same OECD stated there were no tax havens and that no jurisdiction is currently listed as a tax haven by the committee on fiscal affairs.  The OECD itself is saying - it seems to be a flat earth view of the world - that there are no tax havens operating in the world.  When Mr. Cody, then, as head of the Revenue Commissioners cites the OECD as the benchmark upon which we should judge whether Ireland is facilitating tax avoidance, tax evasion or is a tax haven, it is not something that holds up when one looks at the OECD's own reports.  That is the point I am making.</p></speech>

It has nothing to do with a debate around whether a country is a tax haven.

Deputy Cullinane is now conflating what I said last night with a debate, which is a really political debate, on whether the tax code of a country is to be considered as part of a tax haven.</p></speech>

The Department has conducted a series of evaluations of the research and development tax credit, most notably in 2016 and for 2017, which was published as part of the pack that members have been given.  The outcome of that quite detailed review, which is available on our website, is that the research and development tax credit was seen as being responsible for 60% of the additionality of the research and development happening in the country.  That compares favourably with other similar types of interventions.  It is a general measure that is available to companies, large and small, which incur the type of research and development expenditure that qualifies under the incentive.  The Department continues to review this regularly in line with our tax expenditure guidelines.</p></speech>

Last June we had a good discussion about our audit programme in the context of research and development.  We carry out risk based audits in respect of the research and development credit because it is valuable, about which there is no question.  In the context of the changes made over the period and small enterprises, the key is that there has to be expenditure on research and development.  That is the first point.  What we have been doing is trying to ensure that if a small enterprise is carrying out research and development, the appropriate documentation is submitted.  In February we issued guidance specifically to assist small and medium enterprises engaged in research and development.  We engaged with Enterprise Ireland on the record keeping needed in that regard to ensure that if companies were carrying out qualifying research and development, they were receiving the credit to which they were entitled.</p></speech>

I have one final question for Mr. Cody.  He said last night that Revenue would investigate thoroughly and seek to recover the tax avoided, together with interest and avoidance surcharges.

There is a pipeline of cases.  Another 16 have been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As the Deputy is aware, an investigation leading to a criminal prosecution takes a significant period and cases are at various levels or stages.  Custodial sentences were imposed in 16 of the 18 cases in which there were convictions for serious evasion.  Some were fully suspended, while others were partially suspended.  Actual prison terms were imposed in four cases, ranging from three months to one year.  Up to September this year, we had had 19 convictions for serious tax and duty evasion.</p></speech>

There are various restrictions that apply, depending on factors such as if trade changes.

It is a policy issue.  There was a restriction in place affecting the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, banks a number of years ago.  That was changed and the levy was introduced on banks to reflect the fact that this process had taken place.  However, that is ultimately a policy matter.  We implement the tax code having regard to the rules set out in law.

They bailed out a particular sector.  That made it saleable and it does not have tax liabilities forevermore because of the crash.  However, the people are required to be tax-compliant.  This is just a comment.  People feel that there is an inherent unfairness there.  However, as the witness said, it is part of what was discussed in the context of the Finance Bill 2017.  We may have to come back to that policy issue.</p> <p>  Given that approximately 80% of corporation tax receipts come from foreign-owned multinational companies, can Mr. Cody elaborate on how residency is established?  That was obviously one of the issues relating to the Apple tax situation, which concerned an entity that was here in the sense that it was registered here.  How does the Revenue Commissioners define residency?</p></speech>

That has been part of the process of change that took place in our whole international tax process.  A foreign-incorporated company is tax-resident here if it is managed and controlled here.  The rules are set out in legislation.  There have been changes over the years that reflected policy changes and they are set out in the corporation tax code.</p></speech>

Most companies that register here immediately register for corporation tax.  They are trading here and they have converted from being sole traders into limited companies or whatever.  In 2016, an additional 16,390 companies were registered on the corporation tax system.  The last few years have seen numbers in the region of 16,000, 15,000, or 13,000.  Meanwhile, 20,951 companies registered with the CRO in 2016.  We examine companies which are registered with the CRO but which have not registered with the Revenue Commissioners to see if they should do so.  That starts with a declaration form.  All sorts of shelf companies that do not trade here at all are set up.  They are set up because somebody thinks that they might trade.  The foreign companies that have set up in Ireland are primarily not brass-plate operations.  They provide substantial employment.  I looked at the figures for last year.  The Revenue Commissioners examines employments, as opposed to employees.  A person could have a number of employments.  He or she may be dealt with by different companies in a group.  There are 490,000 employments linked to the multinational sector.</p></speech>

However, as a country, we need certainty as well.  This is probably more a question for the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  On the previous occasion on which Mr. McCarthy was before the committee, I asked how his Department communicated the surge in corporate tax in 2015 and he stated that there was a difficulty in communicating it because it had not been not expected.  How can there be certainty in the Department of Finance?  That surge could go as quickly as it came.  At this point, is there a means of estimating what the yield would be if every company that is liable for a corporation tax rate of 12.5% was to pay the 12.5%, which is a generous amount?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.363" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017113000002#S01500"><p>In response to the Deputy's first point, she is absolutely right in that she and I did have a discussion.  However, it was about the 26% GDP growth rate in 2015, rather than tax.  There are absolutely huge communication challenges around that, and it has caused us some reputational damage.  There is no doubt about that.  Ireland's GDP is perhaps the most volatile of any country in the world.  During the crisis, we fell much more than anybody else, and we have rebounded much faster than anybody else.  Even the components of GDP are incredibly volatile, that is, investment, exports and so forth.  There are lots of these issues.</p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy's question may be more for colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners.  We know the total corporate profitability in the economy.   One of the reasons for the surge in corporation tax in 2015, when it went up by &euro;2.3 billion, was a surge in corporate profitability.  However, corporate profitability does not immediately translate into tax liability because of capital allowances, losses carried forward, the &euro;200 billion which, I think, is still outstanding because of trade charges, and so forth.</p><p>This means that the walk from profits to taxes is not simple.  When we try to project GDP we base tax yield on corporate profitability.  We run projections in line with that basis.  We also interact with our colleagues in the large cases division, some of whom are sitting in the Gallery, because there will be issues specific to individual firms.  We will never be told what the firm is.  Under the legal arrangements Mr. Cody has talked about, we are not allowed to know.  We will, however, be told that there may be repayments pending or a big payment to be made.  We take such judgments into account.</p></speech>

To give the Deputy an example, exports are 120% of our GDP.  No other country is as open as Ireland.  We are the coalface in terms of the fragmentation of global value chains.  For instance, if a firm in the pharmaceutical sector has a product which is going off-patent, it has a big impact on our GDP.  Firm-specific developments have a big impact on our GDP.  Some 50 firms account for 30% of our GDP.  That makes it very volatile and very difficult to forecast.</p></speech>

I note page 293 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report which says "The cost of capital allowances increased from &euro;2.4 billion in 2014 to &euro;5.8 billion in 2015, an increase of almost 150%".  That paragraph, 20.18, shows that the amount of tax liability that can be written off is impacted by the policy positions which have been taken.  Was that reviewed in the context of the surge in GDP?</p></speech>

There was a huge surge in capital allowances on the intangible assets side in 2015, of the order of &euro;26 billion.  As has been mentioned before, capital allowances are a normal part of international tax codes.  They are part and parcel of our system as well and it is perfectly legitimate that investment and depreciation can be offset from tax liability.</p></speech>

Do we know what the yield would be if 12.5% was the effective tax rate for the companies which are here now?  What would it be if every company paid 12.5%?  I know there are companies with losses, but 12.5% is a generous tax rate.  Has that potential yield been calculated?</p></speech>

Total corporate profitability was something of the order of &euro;150 billion on a national accounts basis.  One could work out what 12.5% of that figure would be if there were no offsets such as capital allowances, trade charges or losses carried forward.  That would not apply in any country however.  It is too simplistic an approach because firms are entitled to apply these trade charges and so forth.</p></speech>

It is very generous headline rate, but it is not the effective rate.  I can understand offsetting in cases where there are losses.  However, if a large company can employ people to work on being "efficient" - is that the word used? - in respect of calculating its taxes or minimising the amount it pays,  then the generosity is not really in the headline rate but in the other associated elements which result in the effective rate being lower than it should be.  Some companies are paying less than 1%.</p></speech>

I am straying into my colleague's territory but I will give the economic rationale.  We have a relatively low headline rate, but we apply it to a very broad base.  Many institutions such as the IMF would say that is the correct approach because it does not distort incentives and so forth.  As the Chairman mentioned earlier we have published analyses of eight or ten different ways of measuring the effective rate.  Depending on how it is done our effective rate is about 9% or 10%.  If one looks at page 295 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, one will see many countries which have very high headline rates.  These countries are quite happy to talk about the headline rates but, because of various exemptions and so on, their effective rates are much lower.  We are much more transparent.  There are far fewer loopholes.  We have a low rate but the base is very broad.  That is the correct approach from an economic perspective.</p></speech>

I was appointed to this job on 1 February 2015 and two weeks later there was the first of these leaks - HSB Swiss - and there were significant documents provided.  In March of that year I came into the Committee of Public Accounts at the time to report on our activity in HSB Swiss.  It was very interesting in that any of the entities that had an Irish involvement, a significant number we had already dealt with.  We had already prosecuted four of the people who have used the HSB Swiss structure for serious tax evasion.  We then had the Lux Leaks, the second of the big process in which the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, ICIJ, was involved.  Then we had the Panama Papers.  Each of those sets of leaks we have analysed and we have looked to see if there are cases with an Irish interest.  For example, in the context of the Panama Papers we know that there are a number of jurisdictions that paid for the underlying data to whoever got the information from Mossack Fonseca.  We were not offered the information which, I think, is probably significant and probably underlines the fact that there is not significant Irish tax evasion.  I have to stress the term &quot;tax evasion&quot; because we can only collect tax in accordance with the Irish legislation.<br/><br/>We now have the Paradise Papers.  There are 71 entities with an Irish connection.  There are 603 addresses and 802 individuals that the ICIJ say are Irish.  The information that has been provided publicly is essentially a kind of spreadsheet setting out names and addresses.  The underlying data, and the financial data, has not been made publicly available.  We have written to <i>The Irish Times</i>and we have written to the ICIJ asking them, and this is set out.  I thought because of the Paradise Papers that it was appropriate that we should send the committee the opening statement that I made last night. </p></speech>

If we go in to do an audit on a company that has an R&amp;D credit we do not necessarily restrict ourselves to a problem with the R&amp;D credit.  One could find that there was a problem with expenses for employees.  In the collection or audit yield, it was not necessarily clear that the full recovery in an R&amp;D audit was a restriction on the R&amp;D credit.  The Comptroller in his study of it recommended that we would capture exactly what was the restriction of the credit.  What we have done is we have mandated our officers, when they have the recovery, to raise the assessment and collect it using a specific section of the Act.  That is then recorded in our IT systems and then we will be able to say exactly the restriction was that.  The only thing that I cannot say 100% off the top of my head, because I did not come with that piece of paper in my head, is the idea of whether our IT system enhancement has taken place.  Certainly, the policy decision has been taken.</p></speech>

Up to 6% of total tax revenue comes from ten firms, meaning there is a concentration risk.  One cannot tell the company we no longer want it in Ireland.  That is not part of our industrial policy.  Accordingly, to militate against that risk, we must ensure the public finances are in a better shape to be able to absorb any shock if one of these firms was to move or reduce its tax payments substantially.  This is why it is important from a policy perspective that we achieve a structural balance next year and rebuild our fiscal buffers, including, as the Minister did, establishing the rainy day fund.</p> <p>  Under the fiscal rules and the so-called "expenditure benchmark", growth in public expenditure is anchored on the trend growth rate of the economy.  It is averaged over ten years rather than on one particular year.  That, in turn, reduces the probability that a Government might spend so-called "windfall gains".</p></speech>

I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few points.  I apologise if I am sometimes abrupt but that is the nature of the beast in here.  The delivery can be a bit adversarial but it is not personal.</p> <p>  I often think that when it comes to dealing with matters relating to Revenue and taxation we should have a glossary of terms defined in the Peter and Jane Ladybird version because the complexion or perception of 'company X paid no tax' is often wrong and naturally any of us paying pay as you earn, PAYE, can be very frustrated to think that such profitable companies are theoretically paying no tax.  Double taxation means nothing to the person in the street.  Am I right in saying double taxation means not that no tax was paid but that it was paid in the country where the profits were domiciled but the company was not eligible to pay it here for that reason?  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

I often see these determined as 'the cost of double taxation to the State was &euro;X millions'.  When we use that language we must make it clearer for the taxpayer because in real terms it is not a cost to the State.  It is not money we are paying out.  For people's peace of mind it is important for them to understand that these people invested &euro;X millions in research and development or whatever and as a result they availed of a measure we introduced in policy to encourage such investment.  That is lost and the catchy headline of 'X Paid no Tax' will always win out unless our definitions are clearer.</p> <p>  In his review of the code issued by the Department, Seamus Coffey proposes several changes.  One is to change to a territorial regime, as opposed to a worldwide one.  That means nothing to me, apart from reading a bit about it and it means nothing to the ordinary taxpayer.  Will the witnesses explain to us what the difference is between the two and what the benefits would be for Ireland if it opted for that system?</p></speech>

We were conscious last year that we wanted to study sustainability in respect of corporation tax receipts and to have a look overall at our tax codes.  He was engaged to undertake a fairly fundamental overview of our corporation tax regime considering several issues, including how we are implementing the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, arrangements and the sustainability of tax receipts.</p><p>His conclusion was that the new baseline in terms of our corporation tax receipts is sustainable until 2020.  That is an important point to make.  Mr. Hession will comment on the worldwide versus the territorial regime.</p></speech>

In other words, we tax overseas profits but give credit for the tax paid overseas.  In effect, taxes are paid on profits in Ireland.  The same result could be achieved using a territorial system, whereby we would tax profits in Ireland but would not seek to tax overseas profits as they would be taxed in another jurisdiction.  The latter type of system requires the introduction of a particular type of anti-avoidance rule, which is known as the controlled foreign company, CFC, rule.  This ensures that companies do not artificially stuff their profits in the jurisdiction that has a lower tax rate than their home country.  Under a European directive, this rule has to come into effect in Ireland on 1 January 2019.  Seamus Coffey's view is that given that one of the reasons we have not made this move up to now is because we do not have the CFC rule but we are now required to introduce it, it is timely-----</p></speech>

As I said, we are now required to introduce this rule.  Policy makers should periodically explore - every generation if one likes - whether we have the right design for our system.  Mr. Coffey has suggested that when introducing this rule, we should also look at the question of whether orienting our system differently to a territorial system would be a worthwhile change.  It may not make that much difference in terms of the overall amount of tax paid here but as so many countries now have a territorial system - the US is now moving to this system - this may become the default design norm in tax systems and, therefore, it may make things easier for us in terms of moving internationally in the years ahead.  This is an assessment we have to do in the Department next year.  We are currently engaged in a consultation process, launched by the Minister on budget day, which runs until the end of January.  These types of rules can be very complex and can depend on company structure.  Broadly speaking, that is the explanation.</p></speech>

It depends on how one does it.  The directive sets a minimum standard in terms of what we have to do and there are different design features within that requirement, for example, there is option A or option B.  There are lots of other features internationally in controlled foreign company rules that we could import if they made sense for Ireland.  We will have to do that analysis next year ahead of the legislation being brought forward.</p></speech>

Broadly speaking, this is about transactions within a group or in other words, the manner in which related companies transact between themselves.  Under OECD rules this should happen on an arm's-length basis.  In other words, if the Deputy and I are companies in the same group we should transact as if we are on the open market such that we cannot artificially set prices in a way that distorts the tax result.  That is the purpose of the transfer pricing rules.  The OECD sets these rules internationally.  Arising out of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project there are new guidelines in place as to how this should be done.  Ireland has committed to importing these rules into its domestic law.  Mr. Seamus Coffey considered this issue in the context of his review.  While this was not an issue that necessarily caught the headlines when the review was published, Mr. Coffey makes very important recommendations on it, including the need to meet the new OECD standards and on the scope of our transfer pricing rules.  There are some areas where the transfer pricing regime in Ireland does not currently apply, for example, in respect of passive-investment income.  It also does not apply to SMEs or to transactions before 2010, which is when transfer pricing was introduced in Ireland for the first time.  Seamus Coffey makes the point that not only do we need to modernise our transfer pricing regime, we need to broaden it and that given the complexities, we should consult on the issue.  This will form part of the process that runs until the end of January.  He also states, however, that we should not unduly delay in introducing those changes and that by the end of 2020, we should have made these changes.</p> <p>  Perhaps one of the Revenue officials might like to add to what I have said.</p></speech>

Transfer pricing is an essential part of how transactions between groups are priced and the key is that these transactions are at arm's length.  That is the process.  Mr. Hession set out very well the overall context of the Coffey review and the policy changes required.</p></speech>

There is a whole range of transfer pricing auditing.  The Coffey report suggested strengthening the resources in Revenue to deal with transfer pricing and strengthen the competent authority.  One of the features of international tax is that there are inter-tax authority disputes around the proper attribution of profits, and there is a whole process around competent authorities engaging with each other.  We deal with other tax administrations on the issue of the proper attribution of profits.  This is a feature across the world.  We look at transfer pricing auditing of companies based here to ensure that profits attributed to Ireland are not understated.  Other tax administrations are looking at the Irish issue.  There is engagement on correlative relief, mutual agreement procedures which deal with disputes around the challenges.  One of the recommendations is that we should bolster our resources in this area.  The transfer pricing Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, standard was introduced into legislation in 2010.</p></speech>

We get challenges.  There are disputes going on, and I have spoken about it at other committees.  The success rate of our competent authority in disputes with other countries is very high.  Ireland features very prominently in the multinational tax system - we are a significant player in foreign direct investment - and so there are disputes.  The adjustments are reasonable, however, and it is not a big proportion of the profits attributed to Ireland.  Ultimately, the company sets the transfer pricing arrangements.  The arrangements are subject to review by Revenue and the other side.  Some countries are very proactive in challenging.  These take a number of years to wash through the system.</p></speech>

The State, whether it is through the Revenue Commissioners or the Department, deals with tens of billions of euro every year, so it is not credible to put forward a defence that the money simply cannot be transferred at one time.  I am putting this question as an observation.  Some people might ask whether this is a stalling tactic.  I cannot see how it is credible for the Department of Finance to say that the money simply cannot be transferred in one go, so I believe there are possibly other reasons for that.  Can the witness explain why it would be difficult for the money to be transferred in one go, given that tens of billions of euro go through the hands of the State every year?</p></speech>

Whatever the large number is, whether it is &euro;8 billion, &euro;10 billion or whatever, we want to ensure that the investment managers are looking for the best possible return for the investment that we expect them to make on our behalf.  It is not that there are other issues at play with this, as the Deputy might suggest, but the reality of what we are dealing with here.  We are taking advice from the NTMA on the procurement process.  It is much more familiar with how we engage these investment managers.  The advice is that we must have this done on a phased basis.</p></speech>

Mr. Coffey states that the increased profits associated with onshoring of intellectual property assets to Ireland are likely attributable to Irish resident companies.  However, a claim for capital allowances for intangible assets would likely reduce substantially or eliminate the taxable income associated with the use of these IP assets.  This is essentially Mr. Coffey saying what the Chairman just said.  The companies brought the intellectual property onshore and it could offset that against tax using its capital allowances.</p></speech>

If one has an asset which reduces in value, that is a cost which one offsets against one's profits.  It is exactly the same, for example, if one buys a car for &euro;10,000.  If one made a profit of &euro;1,000 in that year, one could write it down by &euro;1,000 because one's car is only worth &euro;9,000 after a year.  The &euro;1,000 is offset against one's profit.  It is an equivalent scenario here where a company buys an intellectual property asset which depreciates and it is written down in the accounts over time.  That depreciation in the form of capital allowances is offset against the income for that asset.</p> <p>  One of the changes in the Finance Bill, which came from Seamus Coffey's recommendations, is that one does not have a scenario where capital allowances are written off against income in full and then one has a period where one has a big change in one's corporation tax receipts later on because there are no more capital allowances to use up.  From a sustainability point of view, it is preferable to smooth this over time.  What Mr. Coffey recommended is that the extent to which these capital allowances can be used against income should be limited and an 80% cap introduced.</p></speech>

The tax code does not capture this over time and it can be very short term.  Is the way in which it is structured more risky?</p></speech>

We discussed earlier the base erosion and profit shifting project.  What has been happening over many years is that intellectual property has been held offshore in jurisdictions with low corporation tax and, in some cases, no corporation tax.  One then has royalty flows going out to the jurisdictions where the intellectual property is held.  The OECD has introduced new transfer pricing rules whereby, if there is no substance in those jurisdictions, that sort of tax arrangement does not really work.  What multinationals have to do now is look where they have substantive activities, employment and decision makers and co-locate the intellectual property with that substance.  For some of those that have substantive operations in Ireland, it makes sense to move their intellectual property here.  Once it comes onshore, like any other type of asset, it will be subject to depreciation and that is based on what is in the accounts.  They follow within the accounts.  What we have done in the Finance Bill, which has completed Second Stage in the Seanad, is that there is a cap on the extent to which companies can use these allowances.  This measure will raise about &euro;150 million a year.</p></speech>

The claims are made in the context of the corporation tax return and then we carry out audits and interventions, having regard to the risks in companies.  We treat it like we treat other credits and reliefs.  We carry out a programme of research and development audits to address the risks.  As I said earlier, we carried out 270 interventions in 2016, resulting in a clawback of &euro;13 million in credits.  Sometimes there are definitional issues.</p> <p>  Part of the reason for the increase is also that because of expansion in the policy regarding tax-payable credits, the scheme has been broadened to make it more effective.  My colleagues from the Department of Finance spoke earlier about the research published in 2017 which evaluated the policy.  A facility is in place to carry forward research and development credits.  The refundable credits are paid over a period so an increase is built into the system until things are washed out.  Ultimately, however, the credit is a direct result of the expenditure.  There is a Government target to increase research and development because when it takes place in Ireland, it is really positive.  It means we are employing people with education and we are bringing in people.  That is what it is about.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned familiar cases which came to attention because we ended up in tax appeals.  They did not end up being challenged in the courts because someone decided they wanted to tell us about things.  We have a programme to look at compliance with residency rules for high wealth individuals.  The rules are set out and have changed a bit over time, but ultimately the number of days is 183.  We pay attention to compliance.  The Deputy talked about the entities carrying out research and development and the fact that they would have advisers and people working on the issue, but I can assure her that high wealth individuals, whether resident or non-resident, are very well advised.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is loss of revenue in some cases, while in others we are probably receiving revenue under a double taxation agreement, but that is not something we have discussed.

I am just saying it so that he does not have to.  Will Mr. Cody provide a breakdown of the report, An Analysis of 2015 Corporation Tax Returns and 2016 Payments?  Revenue seems to have a great man in the form of Mr. Paul Tancred.  Page 18 shows a diagram.  Mr. Cody might have some information on this, although my question does not specifically relate to today's discussion on corporation tax.  Everybody in Ireland comes from somewhere and has an interest in his or her own county.  One of the diagrams shows employment by foreign-owned multinationals only.  A second diagram shows employment by other companies, which presumably are not foreign companies.  A third shows the employment share of foreign companies as a share of the employment provided by all companies.</p> <p>  Revenue must have some information about all employment, not just through companies.  I am not talking about corporation tax.  Is Mr. Cody able to provide an additional diagram showing the employment provided by foreign-owned companies relative to the total number of employees or however Revenue gathers its information in a county?  These diagrams exclude the self-employed and public sector employees.  Given that they provide good information otherwise, I suspect that the diagram I have requested might be useful.  Maybe the CSO or some other body has that information.  Will Revenue examine its statistics and determine whether this would be possible?  This is not part of the corporation tax debate, only a means of providing information.  These diagrams are interesting, but some Members of the Oireachtas would love to have it expanded upon.  If Revenue is able to, well and good.  If it cannot be done, then it cannot be done.  I am coming at it from a different angle.</p></speech>

We are not disposing of the chapter today because we are meeting with some multinationals.  We will do so in due course.  The witnesses' evidence has been very good, useful and helpful.  We remarked that the amount of information they will have to send on to us after today is much less than after many other meetings when other groups have come before us.  The witnesses seemed to have most of their information available when we asked them questions.  With other people, we have a list of 20 questions that are unanswered on a day so it is nice to get most of our questions answered today.  I say that by way of contrast.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank our witnesses from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General for coming before us today.  We will adjourn the meeting until 9 a.m. on Thursday, 7 December 2017, when we will meet with representatives from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection with regard to the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General as it relates to regulatory of social welfare payments, the management of social welfare overpayments and Departmental reviews of social welfare schemes as well as some matters relating to the social welfare appeals process.  In that context, we will also look at, but not sign off on, the Social Insurance Fund 2016 and the social protection Vote.</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, I am joined by Ms Geraldine Luddy, head of the bioethics unit at the Department of Health, and our colleague, Ms Aoife O'Brien, who is also from the bioethics unit.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak about the ancillary recommendations contained in the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly&rsquo;s final report and recommendations on the eighth amendment of the Constitution.  The committee received in September the Department&rsquo;s submission on the recommendations, so I will try to summarise them briefly.</p> <p>  The first ancillary recommendation which I will address concerns improved access to reproductive health care services, including contraception, sexual health services and termination of pregnancy.  With regard to contraception and family planning services, the Department of Health launched the National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020 in October 2015, following Government approval.  The strategy is being implemented under Healthy Ireland, the National Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing.  It is a cross-governmental policy, which is being delivered in partnership by the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  The national sexual health strategy&rsquo;s key aims are to improve sexual health and well-being, and to reduce negative sexual health outcomes.</p> <p>  The strategy aims to ensure that everyone in Ireland will receive comprehensive and age-appropriate sexual health education and information, and will have access to appropriate prevention and promotion services.  It also aims to make equitable, accessible and high-quality sexual health services, targeted and tailored according to need, available to everyone.  I will not address the service provision aspects of the national sexual health strategy, as I believe our colleagues from the HSE are in a better position to do so.  They will address it as part of their presentation and will support any questions committee members may have on it.  However, just to note that implementation of the strategy got under way quickly, with an action plan prioritising an initial 18 actions, covering areas such as clinical services, education, communications and governance structures.  All of these actions have commenced, and ten have already been completed, including the appointment of a national clinical lead for sexual health in the HSE, and the reconfiguration of the HSE crisis pregnancy programme to encompass sexual health as the new HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.  As the Chairman said, this is represented at the meeting.  In terms of achieving good quality outcomes, the Department considers that full implementation of the strategy, together with the measures outlined in the national maternity strategy, which I will address shortly, will significantly advance the good quality outcomes envisaged by the Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>  The second ancillary recommendation which I will address concerns standards of obstetrical care in Ireland.  I want to cover a number of elements of this.  Over recent years, as members are aware, there has been significant focus on the development of a national maternity policy to ensure that our maternity services are developed in a coherent and evidence-based manner.  Last year, we published Ireland&rsquo;s first ever national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together 2016-2026, again following Government approval.  The HSE's standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death were also published in 2016, and I will speak a little more about these later.  Also, in 2016, at the end of the year, HIQA's national standards for safer better maternity services were launched.  They aim to give a shared voice to the expectations of women using maternity services, service providers and the public.  They are intended to show what safe, high-quality maternity services should look like.</p> <p>  Committee members may be aware that each of the 19 maternity units is now required to publish a maternity patient safety statement every month.  The first of these were published in December 2015.  They are published monthly in arrears, and report information on 17 metrics, dealing with clinical activities, major obstetric events, modes of delivery and other clinical incidents.  Taken together, all of these developments are key building blocks which will enable us to provide a consistently safe, patient-centred, high-quality maternity service.  They will also help advance the quality outcomes envisaged by the Citizens' Assembly in its ancillary recommendations.</p> <p>  In terms of overall governance structures, a national women and infants health programme has been established within the HSE, the leadership of which is represented here today, to lead the implementation of the national maternity strategy.  It spans obstetrics, aspects of gynaecology and neonatal services across community, primary, and secondary care.  The programme will oversee the establishment of maternity networks across the country, which will formally link all maternity units within each hospital group.  It is recognised that smaller maternity services cannot, and often should not, operate in isolation as stand-alone entities.  Given their size, some of these units cannot sustain the breadth and depth of clinical services required by the populations they serve.  Through the establishment of maternity networks, we will ensure efficiency in the provision of, and access to, specialised services and support smaller units to provide safe and quality services.</p> <p>  The Department is aware that a key concern of the Citizens' Assembly in its ancillary recommendation was that all pregnant women, regardless of geographic location or, indeed, ability to pay, should have access to early scanning and testing.  On this point, the maternity strategy is very clear that all women should have equal access to standardised ultrasound services.  We know that there are challenges, but we intend to build capacity in our ultrasound services.  To that end, additional funding will be provided to the national women and infants health programme in 2018, subject to finalisation of the service plan, to develop a more equitable and consistent antenatal screening service.  We will hear more detail on this from colleagues in the HSE in a moment.</p> <p>  The recently published maternity strategy implementation plan addresses the current regional inconsistency in service provision.  Pending full implementation of the strategy&rsquo;s recommendations on anomaly scanning, the programme will continue to work with the six hospital groups to ensure increasing access to anomaly scans.  In particular, it will work to ensure that clinical pathways are in place within each network, such that where clinically indicated, a woman can be referred to a larger maternity unit for such a scan.</p> <p>  In relation to the ancillary recommendation on improving counselling and support facilities for pregnant women, I do not propose to go into the detail on the service delivery side, given that colleagues from the HSE will address it.  I am aware the committee previously had speakers before it on this from the HSE sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme, which is also represented here today.  I will briefly note that the programme funds the provision of crisis pregnancy and post abortion counselling services, which operate out of more than 40 locations throughout the country..  All services also provide access to post-termination counselling and a number provide free post-termination medical check-ups.</p><p>The national maternity strategy pointed to the need to improve access to mental health supports and to that end a number of its recommendations are relevant.  The maternity strategy implementation plan addresses the issue and sets out specific actions to identify women at risk and ensure that they get the necessary support during their pregnancy and postnatally.</p><p> Earlier I referred to the national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss.  I draw members' attention to the fact that they were published last year.  We anticipate that the standards will drive the development of clinical and counselling services within our maternity services overall.  The standards describe the standardised structures, clinical processes and compassionate responses that should be in place across maternity services for parents who experience a pregnancy loss or a perinatal event.  The standards will also apply in situations where there is a diagnosis of foetal anomaly that may be life limiting or fatal.  The linkages between maternity bereavement care and other hospital and associated services such as primary care, public health nursing and palliative care are also outlined in the standards.  Each hospital will have to have systems in place to ensure that bereavement care and end-of-life care for babies is central to the mission of the hospital and is organised around the needs of babies and their families.  The implementation of the standards has begun and teams are being established in each maternity unit and hospital around the State.</p><p> The HSE is today launching a perinatal mental health services model of care for Ireland.  I expect we will hear something more about this from contributions by colleagues in the HSE.  I note that the model of care is closely aligned with the national maternity strategy, and contributes to the implementation of the strategy&rsquo;s actions on mental health.  The model is based on the maternity networks that I spoke of earlier.  This means that specialist perinatal mental health services will be aligned within hospital groups and developed to provide for each of the 19 maternity units.  It is a significant development in addressing the mental health needs of women both during pregnancy and in the year following delivery.</p><p> The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly recommended that further consideration should be given as to who will fund and carry out termination of pregnancy in Ireland.  I will preface my remarks here by pointing out that action in this area will be subject to deliberations of this committee and further deliberation by the Oireachtas on recommendation this committee decides to make.  It will also be subject to the outcome of the referendum which the Government has committed to holding next year.</p><p> Terminations of pregnancy carried out in Ireland at the moment, under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, are limited to the 19 public hospital obstetric units.  That is to say, they are only done in the public system and are funded by the State.  It was appropriate that terminations in this context took place in obstetric units to ensure all the expertise and facilities appropriate to provide safe medical services, and ancillary services, to pregnant women whose lives were at risk and to the unborn.</p><p> Other than in emergency situations, doctors who can certify or permit access to a procedure under the Act must be registered by the Medical Council in its specialist division.  At the moment, a termination of pregnancy may only be carried out by or under the supervision of a consultant obstetrician.  This is irrespective of whether the medical procedure for carrying out the termination is by medical or surgical means.  On the point about medical terminations of pregnancy, I must note that there are currently no medicines indicated for the termination of pregnancy currently authorised for that specific use in Ireland.  In the event of any change to the Constitution and to legislation around access to such services of drugs for medical termination, it would be the responsibility of the manufacturers of such medicines to seek - as they do - a marketing authorisation for such use in Ireland.  This would be in line with the normal procedure for authorising any medicines to the Irish market.   Members are aware that the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, is the competent authority responsible for the regulation of human medicines in Ireland.  It has a structured assessment procedure in place for conducting this assessment process.</p><p> If there is a change to the eighth amendment and if the grounds for termination of pregnancy are widened from what is currently provided for, then this will have implications for the health service provision.  Pending a decision on the policy direction, the Department of Health is working with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of the Taoiseach to explore and research the constitutional and policy issues involved so that as much preparation can be done and drawn upon in the context of any recommendations or decisions that are made over the coming months.  Once direction is clear, consideration will be given to the issue of funding and carrying out terminations of pregnancy in Ireland, and to drafting further legislation in order to ensure access to such services and good quality outcomes.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and her fellow committee members for the opportunity to address the committee today and I wish the Chairman well with her work.  I also look forward to the report. I am available to answer any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

I am joined today by Dr. Peter McKenna, Mr. Kilian McGrane and Ms Angela Dunne from the national women and infants health programme and by Ms Janice Donlon, who is with the sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme.<br/><br/>In my submission to the committee I have addressed the points raised by the committee in correspondence with the HSE.  With regard to improvements being made to counselling and support facilities for pregnant women both during pregnancy, perinatal mental health features strongly in the national maternity strategy recognising the potential impact it has on the mother, baby and the wider family.  The national women and infants health programme implementation plan sets out a series of actions aimed at identifying at risk women, and ensuring that they get the appropriate support throughout their pregnancy and during the postnatal phase.  These actions include the appointment of clinical midwife specialists in each of the 19 maternity hospitals or units, to support and train midwives in identifying and supporting at risk women and the recruitment of additional perinatal psychiatrists, so that each maternity network has a minimum of one perinatal psychiatrist.  In line with the perinatal mental health model developed by the HSE&rsquo;s mental health directorate, a hub and spoke model will exist within each maternity network, with the psychiatrist based in the tertiary facility accepting referrals from individuals units, and supported as required by local liaison psychiatry.  Another implementation action is the training of all staff working in maternity hospitals or units to identify women at risk at booking appointments, or throughout their maternity journey, and in particular those with a mental health history.<br/><br/>While these developments are resource dependent, the implementation process will commence with the launch of the HSE&rsquo;s implementation plan for the national maternity strategy.  Perinatal mental health is a significant priority for the programme.  The actions in the implementation plan will focus on providing the necessary support and counselling to women who are showing signs of stress and anxiety at the lower end of the spectrum, as well as those who have an underlying history of mental illness in the higher risk categories.  The pathway for women will depend on the risk classification from their assessment. The model of care for perinatal mental health is being launched today by the mental health division of the HSE and we will arrange for information to be provided to the committee on its content.  I have copies of the printed document from that session which I will provide to the clerk if that is helpful for committee members.<br/><br/>The model of care is based on the maternity networks recommended in the national maternity strategy.  This means the specialist perinatal mental health services will be aligned to hospital groups and developed in a hub and spoke format so all 19 maternity services are included in the model.  An allocation &euro;1 million has been made in 2017 to start three specialist perinatal hubs in Galway, Cork and Limerick hospitals and to expand the small existing teams in the Dublin based maternity hospitals - the Coombe, the National Maternity Hospital and the Rotunda.  A further &euro;2 million has been allocated for 2018 to complete each of these six hub teams.  The model of care recommends the establishment of a national mother and baby unit.  This will require further investment.<br/><br/>In August 2016, the HSE launched the national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death.  These standards set out the care that families can expect following a maternity related bereavement.  An implementation team has been established and a clinical lead and programme manager have been appointed.  The implementation team are visiting all 19 units to support the implementation of the standards.  In 2016, resources were secured to appoint a clinical midwife specialist in bereavement to all maternity hospitals and units that did not already have one.  Recruitment to fill these important posts is currently under way.<br/><br/>The provision of services and supports to women and their families experiencing a crisis pregnancy is part of the remit of the sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme, which is one of a number of national programmes led by the health and well-being division of the HSE.  My colleagues, Janice Donlon and Helen Deely, made a presentation to the committee on the work of the programme on 15 November 2017, and Ms Donlon is here today to provide any further inputs the committee may require.  The programme presented on the current provision of counselling services in Ireland as funded by them and the range of supports available to women both during a crisis pregnancy and following termination.<br/><br/>The members will be aware from the presentation that the HSE programme currently funds 15 individual crisis pregnancy counselling services, which operate out of 40 plus locations nationwide to provide free crisis pregnancy counselling.  These services are in a mix of rural and urban locations.  Details of these crisis pregnancy counselling services can be found on <i>www.positiveoptions.ie</i>.  Crisis pregnancy counselling and the provision of information on all three options - parenting, adoption and abortion - is provided under the legal framework of Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995.</p><p>The Act sets out how information about legal abortion services outside Ireland may be given to individuals or groups in Ireland.</p><p> All women should have the same standard of obstetrical care, including early scanning and testing.  That was the subject of the committee's second question to us.  The national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together, sets out the roadmap for ensuring that all women can access standardised high-quality, safe care regardless of location.  The HSE has developed and published an implementation plan for the national maternity strategy which seeks to address the current regional variations in provision of anomaly scanning as part of the overall approach.  The implementation plan will be overseen by the HSE's national women and infants health programme, NWIHP.  The HSE's maternity services will be managed through maternity networks, with larger tertiary centres working collaboratively with smaller regional centres.</p><p> The provision of a dating ultrasound in the late first trimester, 12-14 weeks, followed by a detailed foetal anomaly scan at 20-22 weeks is a recognised component of good antenatal care.  Currently only seven maternity hospitals or units offer 100% of women access to anomaly scans, and five units do not offer any access.  As part of the implementation plan for the national maternity strategy, the NWIHP has identified the need for an additional 52 sonographers to support the provision of both dating and anomaly scanning in all 19 maternity hospitals or units.  In 2018 the priority will be on improving access for anomaly scanning, and funding for approximately 40 additional sonographers, subject to the approval of the HSE's national service plan for 2018, will be provided.  Sonographers are a difficult grade to recruit, and if suitably qualified personnel are not available, existing staff will be trained to develop the required capacity.  While this will take time, the recruitment of the additional staff will improve access.  Further consideration should be given to who will fund and carry out terminations of pregnancy in Ireland.  That was the final query.  In the first instance this will be a policy matter for the Department of Health in the event of any changes in the legislation being passed in the future, following which the HSE may be invited to submit additional service proposals for funding through the HSE's annual service plan and Estimates processes.</p><p> This concludes my opening statement and with my colleagues we will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming in.</p> <p>  My first question is for Dr. Holohan.  He said something that made me bristle.  He told us he is working with the Office of the Attorney General to explore the constitutional issues and consider framing legislation.  This committee is working hard to consider the outcomes of the Citizens' Assembly, to adjudicate on them and make some decisions that we can bring back to the D&aacute;il after we complete our report on 20 December.  We, as elected representatives, will recommend what we think should be the structure of future legislation that can be put to the people in terms of a referendum, to accept the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, or put forward other proposals, or not.  How does this marry with the job Dr. Holohan is doing with the Attorney General's office in framing legislation and effectively putting the cart before the horse?</p></speech>

We are considering what he and we have described previously as all the scenarios that might arise.  We have considered the work of the Citizens' Assembly, tried to imagine any scenarios and tease out what it might mean were the Oireachtas or the committee to recommend in favour of any given option.  We are trying to see what the different models might be and how they could be made to work in legal and service terms, without pre-empting in any sense any decision to be made.  This will ensure we are in a position, when the committee has made its determination and recommendations, when the Oireachtas has had an opportunity to debate them and the Government has made a decision on this, to move as quickly as we reasonably can, whether we are going to legislate, or make constitutional change, to deal with the issues that might arise and put those decisions effectively into place.  It is no more than trying to see around the corners as much as possible.  We are not pre-empting the work of this committee or the legitimate work of the Oireachtas and ultimately the say of the people on any decisions to be made.</p></speech>

It is not in any sense to place any value judgment or priority on any of those but to say what it would take to make it operational.  The decisions are not for us.  They are ultimately for the committee in respect of its recommendations, for the Oireachtas in respect of what it considers and in respect of the Constitution for the people.</p></speech>

They would already have forked out in the region of &euro;1,500 in travel, accommodation and having a procedure in Britain.  Is the Department considering the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly on the provision of permanent methods of contraception for women after a crisis pregnancy, or indeed before, in other words, the provision of full obstetric medicine available to all women and girls in respect of how we might deal with crisis pregnancy?</p></speech>

In respect of the scenarios we are trying to envisage in trying to see around the corners in as much as we can, we are trying to ensure that we consider things from a service point of view and what will need to be in place to ensure that, whatever form of legislation might be enacted, whatever form of constitutional change might take place, the legal and service implications of that can be made to operate, and to understand what that would mean in service terms.  That may or may not take us into some of the issues that the Deputy is talking about.</p></speech>

It is accessed illegally and a woman is criminalised for accessing it, with a potential sentence of up to 14 years.  Could Mr. Woods comment on the ranges of support that he said in his presentation are available during a crisis pregnancy and following termination?  If a woman has accessed an abortion pill illegally and has had a medical termination, albeit at risk to her own health because it is unsupervised, how is she going to present herself to a general practitioner or another medical service if she has committed an illegal act?  Where is the follow-up treatment for this woman or cohort of women?  Mr. Woods says that the HSE funds and supports a range of services but it is impossible to give a woman who has committed an illegal act that could put her at risk of a sentence of 14 years follow-up services.  Would he comment on that?</p> <p>  When Mr. Woods says all women have the same standard of obstetrical care, will he comment on how much of that care is available to migrant women, asylum seekers, women in direct provision who do not have the language, the skills, the access or the finances to access obstetric care and if they are treated differently from others?</p></speech>

In one part the HSE admits it will need 52 new people trained in scanning throughout the 19 maternity units to provide services that would be required depending on outcomes.  Over the summer, 11 beds in a mental health unit for young people in Cherry Orchard were closed because the health service could not retain the nurses because they are not paid adequately.  What is the HSE's plan to fund this wonderful aspirational improvement in obstetric medicine for women?  I am all for it but the HSE will not pay nurses adequately.  There is evidence of trained psychiatric and other nurses leaving the country because they are not getting proper wages.  What is its plan to get these staff to train and stay?</p></speech>

As she rightly identified, we have funding for 40 posts.  Within the acute division, in the hospital sector, we are increasing our nurse numbers.  As we flagged in our statement, sonographers are a difficult grade to get and we may have to train current staff in sonography.  If we need to do that, we will do so.  Our experience is that when we have the resource we can put the posts in place.  In this instance we have the resource.  Therefore all our efforts will go into recruiting and retaining those staff.</p></speech>

As far as I know there are only three part-time perinatal psychiatrists in the country and all of those are based in Dublin.  There is no mother-and-baby unit for severely depressed mothers or mothers with other perinatal mental health difficulties.  It is difficult to believe that in 2017 we have such poor support for pregnant women.  It is well understood that the consequences of not having proper support for pregnant women and post-natal women can be very serious in the short, medium and long term, even up to fatalities.</p> <p>  Why has pregnant women's mental health been largely ignored to date?  We know that mental health services tend to be the poor relation of health services.  Even within mental health services, perinatal mental health support seems to be at the bottom of the list of what has been provided to date.</p> <p>  We have A Vision for Change.  We are in year 11 of a ten-year plan with approximately 72% to 75% of it implemented.  What enforcement will be applied to ensure this plan is implemented?  Is there an implementation body?  Who will oversee its implementation?  Will there be quarterly reports to ensure it is implemented and if it is not being implemented will there be accountability for its lack of implementation or certainly explanation as to why it is not implemented?  Is there a step-by-step roadmap for its implementation?</p> <p>  Further to what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, how will the HSE recruit and retain the staff?  While plans are great, certainly in mental health there seem to be extreme difficulties in getting staff into place and retaining them.  For example, psychiatric nurses are under huge pressure because of the lack of staff to support them.  They are extremely stretched.  They are coming under severe mental health pressures.</p> <p>  If the people vote in a referendum to change the system we have, how will terminations be facilitated?  How will the HSE facilitate the necessary staff training?  Are the facilities in place at the moment?  If not, how will the HSE meet those demands and needs?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in saying that we are limited to the three part-time Dublin-based posts.  As we said on our opening statement, we have funding to recruit additional psychiatrists.  That will be a challenge.  In the mental health services at large that has been a significant issue.  We have had more success in recruiting psychiatrists in the acute area than we have into the community.  We hope that we can use that to advantage in terms of attracting people back.  I would not underestimate or understate the challenge.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to A Vision for Change, monitoring against a plan, a roadmap for success, timescales, deliverables and reporting against that.  The national women's and infants programme within the HSE service plan is monitoring the implementation of these developments.  Some of them will also fall to be considered within the mental health division of the HSE.  There is a process for that and we report on it.  The Department of Health holds the HSE to account for our implementation of new services when new funding is provided.  That is typically reported on within our published reports that we put online quarterly.  We also report back to the Oireachtas committees and elsewhere.  There is a process in place to monitor implementation and that is clear.  I would not underestimate the challenge.  It is something we have in place and we hope to progress that.</p> <p>  Recruiting any consultant is typically a 12-month journey.  A fair amount of effort is required to attract consultants back.  It is about attracting back consultants.  Typically that will happen over 12 months.  There are processes in place for that.  We have increased the overall consultant number.  The number in the acute division is up by about 59 year-on-year at the moment.  We have a process.  We will have to run that and see where it brings us - hopefully it will be successful.</p> <p>  Regarding capacity, as I said at the end of the statement, the HSE, as with any service, will respond to legislation in terms of scaling service requirement and costing that and submitting such costing and service requirements to the Department of Health based on a model of care as and when that is required.  That is our normal business and we would do that.</p> <p>  The HSE already has extensive training in place across a range of services.  We would simply need to expand to cover these particular issues.</p></speech>

In reality, we see it as primarily being implemented and monitored under the women and infants programme.  Mr. Kilian McGrane, Dr. Peter McKenna and Ms Angela Dunne are part of that work.  It is part of the HSE and the reports are to its acute division.  A plan has been set out with these actions and there can be reports against them which can be made publicly available.  Mr. McGrane might have his view, but I believe it would probably nest better within the overall women and infants programme because it is related to other actions under that programme.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting they will be easier to get, but it is a post in which there is a lot of interest.  We are not sure of the exact numbers until the service plan is finalised, but the aim is that there will be a minimum of one in each of the 19 units.  That is an important part of the development which allows us to provide the first point of access.  It also allows us to support midwives who are interacting daily with women, identifying needs and the referral pathway onwards.  That is where the psychiatry service comes into it.</p> <p>  On the reporting component, we will be submitting reports regularly to the Department, but there is also a requirement for us to produce an annual report, which requirement is set out in the national maternity strategy.  We produced an annual report early in 2017.  Obviously, there was no programme office in place in 2016; therefore, the annual report was quite light.  However, the 2017 annual report that will be published in the middle of the second quarter of 2018 will detail what we have done to date in 2017.  It will include any development in the area of perinatal mental health.</p></speech>

One of them mentioned that in his work in the Department he was preparing for various scenarios, depending on what the Government and the Oireachtas eventually proposed.  I ask him to direct his mind to another scenario when a referendum is held and the people decide to uphold the <i>status quo</i>to protect both babies and their mothers during pregnancy.  I ask him to consider whether there are changes that will be required in that regard.</p><p>According to the figures presented to us many times, our birth rate is approximately one tenth of that in Britain.  Were we to have an abortion rate one tenth of that in Britain, there would be 19,000 or 20,000 abortions per year.  On the best evidence available from British figures for the number of Irish women having abortions in Britain, the very small number who do so in the Netherlands and if one were to allow for 1,000 or 2,000 people importing abortion pills, one is talking about between 3,000 and 5,000 abortions, which is one quarter of the rate in Britain.  Do we have any knowledge of what has contributed to this?  Is there evidence that the provision of State funded counselling, for example, is a contributory factor?  Has it to do with the increased use of contraceptives?  The figure has been declining, on the basis of the information available on the number of women having abortions in Britain.  Has it to do with increased awareness?  The emergence of 4D ultrasound scans has increased awareness of the wonder of life in the womb and its complexity and development from its earliest stages.  Is there a new awareness of it?  Any information in that regard would be helpful.</p><p>I wish to ask about non-directive counselling, about which I asked questions on a previous occasion when representatives of the crisis pregnancy programme appeared before the committee.  I am operating from the understanding non-directive counselling is one of the many approaches that can be practised and is respected in the general area of counselling.  Obviously, where one does not give an instruction on how to proceed, non-directive counselling clearly has its limitations.  For example, I cannot imagine that it would be appropriate when counselling a person who is suicidal.</p><p>My question is in the context of the Constitution pledging that the State, as far as is practicable, will defend and vindicate the right to life of the unborn and there being a great deal of public messaging on matters such as obesity, drink driving and so forth which is directive in seeking to protect not only oneself but also potential third parties who could be hurt by one's actions.  In addition, I note what the 1995 Act states, as discussed on a previous occasion.  There does not appear to be a definition or a requirement in law that counselling be non-directive.  The 1995 Act states counselling must not take a form or manner which advocates or promotes the termination of pregnancy.  Interestingly, as far as I am aware - I am subject to correction - there does not appear to be a counterbalancing injunction that counselling must not take a form or manner which encourages the protection of the unborn.  Has any consideration being given to whether what clearly appears to be the preferred mode of non-directive counselling, in the context of the provision of State funding, is actually constitutional, having regard to the fact that the Constitution states in law and policy that there are two human beings to be protected?  Has there ever been any discussion about whether the requirement for undefined non-directive counselling in some way offends the spirit of the Constitution?  Having regard to the fact that some State funded pregnancy counselling organisations have a strong stated agenda to promote legalised abortion, it appears to be tilted in the other direction.  On a previous occasion I drew the attention of the committee to how counsellors with the Irish Family Planning Association and other organisations, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, had been found in some circumstances to have been giving women dangerous advice which included telling them to lie to their doctor if they suffered complications after an abortion and to say they had had a miscarriage.  In some cases women had been given information on how access the abortion pill.  I wonder whether non-directive counselling has been used as a cover, if anything, to push women towards having an abortion.  Clearly, there is a block on counselling to encourage, not coerce, the taking of the life saving option.  Will the delegates tell me if the provision of non-directive counselling has been considered in terms of its constitutionality and whether there are other ways by which it could be done?</p></speech>

The second was related to non-directive counselling.  I am aware that the issue arose previously.  </p> <p>  On the specific issue of whether consideration has been given to the constitutionality of what happens, if I am summarising the Senator's question correctly, it might well be the case that such issues were considered before my time because this relates to the 1995 legislation and a previous amendment.  Other than it arising at the committee in the recent past, I am not aware of the question having arisen.  Perhaps my colleague from the HSE, Ms Janice Donlon, who has addressed some of these issues in the past, might wish to add to what I have said.  </p> <p>  If I was clear on the first question, I would be happy to answer it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.709" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Janice Donlon" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017113000002#H01300"><p>I reiterate what we have presented to the committee on the non-directive, non-judgmental counselling provided with the funding provided through the HSE.  It is good practice to provide that counselling for an individual.  If I am right, the abortion information Act also states that if information on abortion services abroad is to be provided, it must be provided in a counselling session in which all options are explored.  All options, including parenting and adoption, must be explored before the option of having an abortion is discussed.  If requested by the client, it is discussed and under the legislation information can be provided.</p><p>Non-directive counselling goes back to the good counselling practice.  It is a matter of neither directing nor guiding an individual towards a certain pathway but rather making it the decision of that individual as to which pathway they may take.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.711" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017113000002#J00200"><p>My first difficulty concerns who it is who defines what good counselling practice is.  Second, the term "non-directive" is not defined in legislation and yet it seems to be thoroughly relied upon.  Third, from what Ms Donlon has said, she does not seem to have regard to the particular constitutional context, which is that there are two lives to be protected.  I am not promoting coercive counselling now but I find it very difficult to understand the role of non-directive counselling.  I find it strange, especially given that the non-directive approach is not the approach that one would adopt with someone who was suicidal.  This would clearly not be a matter on which one would be neutral; it would not just a be a case of the good choice being whatever choice the person is fully informed about.  That is clearly not the answer when counselling someone who is suicidal.  I am not expert in this area and I am open to correction.</p></speech>

What we as a society expect of professionals is that the way in which they inform and support people in making decisions is to give them the necessary information to help them make those decisions.  This is very much in conjunction with the person in any clinical sense.  I am not talking about the particular situation outlined by the Senator, I am talking about any context.  The days of the paternalistic practice of medicine and health care, when doctors, nurses or anybody else made decisions for people, are at an end as far as we are concerned.  The expectation, particularly in professions like medicine where these ethical codes exist, makes it clear that the role of practitioners is to support people in making decisions and to give them the information as necessary to make those decisions.  This applies to every clinical situation and not just to the one the Senator is talking about.</p></speech>

I would like to think that one of the reasons why we are making progress is that we have improved the quality of education and training and the understanding of the access that people have to a variety of services that they did not have 20 years ago.

I am familiar with some of them from many meetings of the health committee.  I am a firm believer in prevention being better than cure. Looking at the report on folic acid as a preventive measure against birth defects in Ireland, for example, I note we actually have an increase in neural tube defects in this country.  Such defects encompass spina bifida, though I do not need to tell Dr. Holohan that, of course, and many other things that might sometimes be classed as fatal foetal abnormalities.  It looks like we are an outlier with regard to European standards and I am quite concerned by that.  From what I have read, the rate seems to be increasing disproportionately in Ireland.  The report contained options for the prevention of neural tube defects in Ireland.  How are we getting on with that?  I would like to see folic acid, a very safe and cheap B vitamin, being more readily available than it is currently on the GMS scheme.  Many pregnancies, though not necessarily a crisis, are unplanned and from my own work as a community pharmacist, I am aware there is a huge amount of ignorance around folic acid.  I have spoken before about people just using up the vitamins that are in the cupboard and then not getting around to buying a packet of folic acid until week 14 or so.  Could the witnesses speak about this and about what we are doing in this area?  If we can try to prevent neural tube defects we will then have healthier babies and ultimately fewer terminations.  That is what we are all about here.</p> <p>  My second question arises from a point in Dr. Holohan's presentation about the medical professionals involved in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 being on the specialist register.  Looking at international examples, my view would be that one would not need to be a specialist in the provision of medical abortion and that some of this could be done through the GP and the pharmacy.  Thinking forward and assuming that the eighth amendment might be repealed, perhaps Dr. Holohan could offer this committee some advice on this matter in order that we do not end in a situation where we need 15 doctors and three psychiatrists for a woman who is six weeks pregnant and looking for a termination.  That would obviously be completely unworkable.  </p> <p>  I would also like someone to comment on the current situation.  Professor Veronica O'Keane, a professor of psychiatry, appeared before the committee and she spoke about her concern over patients with complex medical and psychiatric needs travelling abroad without their medical files or without a conversation.  How does Dr. Holohan, as Chief Medical Officer, feel about this?  Is there anything that we can do in the meantime, within our constitutional restrictions, to try to ease some of that pain?  Is there anything we can do in the interim period before there is a referendum in this country?  This is something about which I am quite concerned.</p> <p>  I was going to talk about contraception but I know that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith-----</p></speech>

I know of a variety of different mechanisms in place here, not least the work being done through the women and infants programme, which is led by a number of obstetricians.  Professor Turner, of whom the committee may be aware, is doing work on the development of guidelines on folic acid to deal with the very concerning increase in this country in the incidence of neural tube defects.  There may be other factors to explain why we are seeing this increase but the use of folate is certainly not at the level at which we would wish it to be.  This is a question that we have looked at and will continue to look at at a policy level, particularly in terms of the public health measures that could be taken to deal with this.  I am conscious that I am in the presence of someone who is far more expert than myself in these matters, namely, the former Master of the Rotunda, Dr. McKenna, and he may be in a position to add something to what I have said here.  I will deal with the other questions and then hand over to Dr. McKenna.</p><p>Members may be aware that the specialist register is essentially a mechanism through which specialist registration can be recognised in a number of different specialties, which are organised at European level.  General practice is one of those specialties, so a doctor on the specialist register who is a general practitioner is covered.  If the change in law was such as to enable both access to prescription and the dispensing of medicines, the types of services that have been described are well within the sphere of competence of a doctor who is on the specialist register in general practice.</p><p> On the question of complexity, in the current situation, a doctor who is in possession of medical records relevant to the care and treatment of a woman who is receiving services elsewhere is allowed to make those records available, if it is wished for.  In a more general sense of course, in the case of anybody who has a medical procedure in one jurisdiction and travels in short order to another jurisdiction, the general concern one would have as a medical practitioner for the person's health and well-being would be significant.</p></speech>

The arguments against it are in line with the fluoridation arguments.  Obviously there are a lot of people who do not like the mandatory fortification of flour.  It is complex enough, even though it seems very simple on the face of it.  I am sorry to interject.</p></speech>

What appears to be a very simple solution, fortifying a staple food, will immediately run into difficulties and arguments.  The converse is that one cannot expect people who are not planning on getting pregnant to take a tablet every day.  That is not going to happen.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the cost of a drug license in Ireland, and the relatively small number of users, if we are using the figure of 5,000 terminations a year.  I wonder if someone will actually seek a licence to manufacture it.   It is something that may not be in the witness's remit.  Drug companies are only interested if there are lots of people.  I am also concerned about the protection of doctors, if no one gets a licence for it and it is used in an unlicensed way.  I am trying to deal with the pitfalls.  Would a witness like to comment?</p> <p>  People have spoken about the 20-week anomaly scanning.  I refer to the maternal blood test that can be done at eight to nine weeks.  I am not sure of the name.  I know there is a brand called "Panorama", but I am not sure if that is the actual technical term.  Is that being examined within the maternity strategy and the increase in services?  We have heard that is available in other countries.  I cannot remember the figures from last week, but in Holland even if a woman cannot afford it, somebody sorts it out.  Is early diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities, etc., being examined as part of the wider scanning and diagnosis?</p> <p>  We have also heard in the health committee about the upskilling of nurses so that they can do specialist ultrasound work.  Perhaps a witness could update us on how we are getting on with that.  We spoke about it last year.  For me, and I am sure for many women in this country, it is refreshing to see that the woman is at the centre of the maternity strategy, and I wish the witnesses the best of luck in rolling it out.</p></speech>

I do not have the expertise to make a speculation on that.  Some of the medicines are already in use in the State but for other purposes.  Whether that would have any bearing on what would ultimately be commercial decisions, I cannot say.  In respect of the next question, perhaps Dr. McKenna would like to offer a view.</p></speech>

It is used routinely, or very frequently, in an obstetrics situation off-licence.  I cannot imagine that not getting a licence would be an impediment to these drugs being used.</p> <p>  The other issue members raised, namely, Panorama and Harmony non-invasive pregnancy tests, is something of which we are very much aware.  We were not asked whether we should go down the route of scanning or this route.  Rather, it was mandated that 20-week scanning to look for anomalies was to be introduced, so that is the priority.  However, in parallel to that, in time, these tests will be normalised, and should be available to everybody.  When they were introduced three or four years ago they were very expensive.  Each test cost about &euro;900.  That cost tumbled, and now it is about a third of that.  I would expect that the more it is ordered the cheaper it becomes.  I would envisage a situation, hopefully in the not too distant future, where this would be broadly available throughout the country.  I totally agree that it is the way forward, and it is standard of care in some other countries. </p></speech>

They are able to have a maternal blood test done at eight weeks and know that everything is all right, so they are not waiting and dealing with the unknown.  We talk about perinatal mental health, and I think the Harmony or Panorama tests offer great comfort to families.</p></speech>

Is there any other aspect of women's health care where the first step is to look at the law which is in place, then at an examination of how the needs can be met within that law and then at how the system is organised to suit that?  For instance, abortions or terminations are illegal here.  All the evidence we have heard in this committee indicates that access to terminations is a vital part of a woman's health care.  Is there any other area of women's health care where the law prevents the most effective health care from being provided to women?</p></speech>

As the Deputy may know, we publish an annual report.  The numbers that we have reported under the Act, which provides for reports in respect of the three provisions, namely, a risk to life on grounds of physical health, a risk to life on grounds of mental health and then the emergency situation.  We have a report in respect of the breakdown of that.  The numbers are almost exactly the same from year to year and they are almost exactly in line with what we predicted beforehand.  Whether that allows one to say the legislation is working well is another matter.  The Deputy also had a question on reviews.</p></speech>

I agree with them that doctors in this country do a tremendous job.  However, I believe we can improve the services that are offered.  I cannot see how abortion will improve the situation.  It certainly does not improve the health of the baby.  The only one thing that abortion does, from a medical perspective, is end the life of a baby in the womb.  Yesterday, we heard that the abortion procedure involves giving the baby in the womb an injection to paralyse him or her and then another injection to end his or her life.  If the eighth amendment is repealed this is what we would expect doctors to do.  Do the witnesses agree that widening the grounds for abortion would mean training doctors to end the lives of babies, which would do real damage to the medical profession?</p></speech>

That is the purpose of the legislation.  At the moment the law is very clear on what doctors are or are not enabled to do in these situations.  The Medical Council's professional practice code makes the behaviours expected of doctors very clear.  If the law changes then medical practice will change in line with that.  If the law changes then the guidance to doctors on professional practice will change in line with that.</p></speech>

How do the witnesses feel about the evidence given to the committee yesterday?  Dr. Thompson from the UK talked about how one would have to give two injections to a baby in the womb to end his or her life and as late as eight months' gestation.  Do the witnesses think this is something we should train our doctors to do?  I always talk about the unborn child.  One talks about the heartbeat, the movement, the stretching, the yawning and everything else.  When a baby in the womb is administered an injection, he or she moves.  Should doctors be trained to do this?</p></speech>

We know that increased resources would help to alleviate some of the pressures on the health system in Ireland.  I am very concerned that public moneys would fund abortions that end the lives of babies instead of going towards something that would help us save a life.  Let me give one example.  Yesterday, we heard about the number of the women in the UK who have had an abortion because their babies had a disability.  Do the witnesses think it is right for us to allocate funding to pay for abortions where babies have been diagnosed with a disability instead of giving the money to a charity like the Special Olympics that works to help people with disabilities to reach their full potential?</p></speech>

They repeatedly asked for money and stated how they could not keep the system going.  Money is very tight at the moment but there are many good people and charities that want to help people with a disability live their full term of life.</p> <p>  I asked a question yesterday and will do so again today.  I do not believe in abortion and believe there should be as many alternatives as possible.  I seek a positive outlook.  It is important that we support mothers and their unborn children.  There are families in my area who want to adopt children but the current adoption system has made it almost impossible.  What is the Department of Health and the HSE doing to speed up the adoption process?  What are they doing to inform the public about adoption?  Contraceptives and everything else are ways to end a baby's life.  To me, adoption is an ideal alternative to abortion.</p></speech>

It is legal in this State and anybody who has a crisis pregnancy and who chooses that as an outcome can do it.  Deputy Fitzpatrick seems to be concerned that there are not enough children.  The only alternative is that we reverse the Chinese policy of restricting numbers of children and mandate every woman to have four children.  Then, if she cannot afford a couple of them, give them up for adoption.  It is not really practical.</p> <p>  On his point, however, this is the ancillary section.  The Citizens' Assembly asked us to give this serious consideration and we have heard a great deal of evidence in recent weeks to the effect that the biggest, positive news is that the best way to reduce abortion rates is the availability of contraception.  More than any restrictive legislation, this is what will change the situation and address concerns.  What has been done in the way of a cost-benefit analysis of the provision of free universal access to contraception as part of the health service?  The most recent data in this regard come from the Irish Contraception and Crisis Pregnancy Study 2010, or ICCP 2010.  We cannot make policy if we do not have data.  Are we reviewing that?  Are there plans to initiate a new study?  Has the HSE costed contraceptive availability as part of the health service programme?</p></speech>

In the presentations, the question of who will fund and carry out terminations arose.  I think Dr. McKenna made the point about not getting licences for abortion pills and so on would not be an impediment to use.  Many of the products that serve as abortion pills are already available.  Have the witnesses considered how long it would take to make abortion pills available, post-repeal - if that is to be the case - and the decriminalisation of abortion?  Presumably, there is no impediment to that if abortion is decriminalised.  If the companies want to opt for a change of use, how long would it take?</p></speech>

I am sure it will be available afterwards.  I would, however, share the Deputy's concern about surgical termination, where it will be facilitated and what the effect would be on the rest of the health service.  As we know, there are extensive waiting lists for gynaecological procedures.  If a woman wants a termination, there is no point going on a waiting list because every week increases the morbidity.  If surgical termination is to be widely available it will have to be resourced, otherwise there will be a very negative impact on other gynaecological waiting lists, which are already problematic.</p></speech>

In the context of what I said at the very outset about scenarios, not just the legal scenarios, the service implications are exactly what we are working on in a primary care situation, a secondary care situation and so on.  Regarding the point Dr. McKenna made about an intervention that could take place at one point but via medical means, as opposed to the same intervention with the same purpose taking place at a later stage by surgical means, there is a clear patient safety implication.</p></speech>

What they are saying, I think, is that the facility to have, for example, the abortion pill would be far cheaper, more accessible and better for women's health, but also better from the point of view of putting less pressure on our health service, for which perhaps the surgical procedure later on might have implications.</p></speech>

The scenario the Deputy describes, were it to come to pass that termination of pregnancy would be available via medical means, could, in technical and competence terms, be delivered in a primary care environment.

I can check back on the record.</p> <p>  I want to know about the recruitment of the 52 sonographers.  We have already heard at this committee extensive evidence on the need to access scans for the purpose of detecting anomalies, dating and so on, so we know it is very important.  I am conscious that Dr. Holohan said some of the work in preparation for a referendum has been done, and that is to be welcomed.  However, on the flip side, none of this will be possible or easy unless we have the staff to do it.</p> <p>  Could the witnesses give us a timeline for the 52 sonographers?  The witnesses will know as well as I do that the 20-week scans are screening scans.  I would not ask the witnesses to take my word for it but, as the consultants in this area have told us, it is not necessarily possible to make a decision as to who will need a scan because it is a screening scan and one needs to screen to get the information.  In the meantime, and pending the recruitment of the 52 sonographers, 140 midwives and all the other staff that would probably just bring us up to a fairly basic level of service, how many women access the anomaly scan, how is it decided they will need one, and what percentage of women need it?  Since it is a screening scan, we will take as a given that all pregnant women should have access to it.  What percentage of women are missing out?  This will have serious implications in the event of the repeal of the eighth amendment.</p> <p>  I will ask one final question because I do not wish to delay any more than I have to.  My colleague, Deputy O'Brien, asked a question about recording those women who sought access to a termination under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act but who were not granted one and did not engage in the review process.  One of the speakers - it might have been Dr. Holohan - alluded to the need for us to have evidence, and evidence must inform policy.</p> <p>  The Department of Health is fairly clear that collection of that information would not come under its remit.  My view is that it clearly would come under the HSE's remit, not Mr. Woods's personal remit, that it would be the HSE's job.  It is quite worrying that the information is not being recorded.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Woods could explain to us why he feels it is not important to record that information and who he feels should be recording it.  The Department has given its clear view that it is not a policy matter so it is not for it to record it.  My view is that it clearly comes within the remit of the HSE.  Mr. Woods can correct me if I am wrong on this, but I think we can all agree that the recording of this information is important.  If it is not currently being recorded, and I suspect it is not, perhaps Mr. Woods might be able to tell us who within the HSE will have responsibility for recording it.</p> <p>  In the event that the eighth amendment is repealed and expanded access to services is brought in, and in order to be able to develop services further, we will need evidence, and we are starting from a fairly bad place if we are already neglecting to collect some of that evidence.</p></speech>

We have a combination at present of radiographers and midwives, who go off to do the training.  There are a number of master's programmes and it can take up to 18 months to complete the process.  I do not have an exact figure, but we have a number of people in training at present.  However, even once we start to release the additional resource, those who have experience in the training relating to the dating scan will move on and start to receive anomaly scanning training.  We will increase capacity straight away in that respect.  Just getting that dedicated resource ring-fenced, subject to the approval of the service plan, is a big step forward from our perspective.  As the Deputy knows, it has been lobbied for for a long period.</p> <p>  Regarding her second question about the percentage of women not currently accessing the scan, our colleagues from Cork University Maternity Hospital in UCC did a study on this and they published the data in July, I believe.  There are currently seven units in which we provide 100% of women with access to a scan, seven units in which there is some access and five units in which there is no access.  In those units in which there is access, it is usually by clinical indication, and I am sure Dr. McKenna can talk to those kinds of clinical indications that may be appropriate for it.</p> <p>  I cannot remember the exact figure, but I think approximately 64% of women are offered the scan, so we have quite a distance to travel.  The 52 sonographers also carry out dating scans.  Not all of our 19 units provide every woman with a dating scan, so we have tried to spread the resource as best we can.  We are making anomaly scanning the priority for 2018.  This is why we are looking at a 40-person sonographer resource, and the balance of the 12 would be a 29-person resource to ensure that every unit provides the dating scan at 12 to 14 weeks.</p></speech>

In response to a parliamentary question I asked, the Minister, in what was not exactly a ringing endorsement, said, "Let us be very honest, the likelihood of finding all of that cohort in one go is slim."  He is not convinced, I certainly am not, and that is very worrying because, as I and others have said here repeatedly, these are screening scans.  When we have asked the professionals and the consultants, they have told us it is a screening scan so it is not possible to grade in those terms.</p><p>I will take the answer of the witnesses anyway.</p></speech>

The point was made earlier.  At a national level the answer is no.  On the second question, if I understand the Deputy correctly, the information exists locally and is not collated.

In my clinic I see a woman who has a cardiac problem.  She asked about her risk, should she take that risk or should she have a termination.  I explained to her that her risk of dying could vary from 10% to much the same as for a normal woman.  Is this inquiry a request or is it an inquiry?  It is difficult to know when an inquiry becomes a request, if the Deputy knows what I mean.</p></speech>

One is, obviously, the fact of a termination having taken place under one of the provisions of the Act.  We have a flow of information that we have shared in that regard.  The other is when the review mechanism is triggered.  I recall, in broad terms, the debates that took place when that legislation was passing through.  The policy rationale was that the HSE is obliged to create panels from which people are drawn in order to support the review process and especially to make sure that when individuals lodge review requests they get access to an opinion very quickly.  I believe that three days is the period of time as set out in the legislation, but I am subject to correction on that.  It is, however, a short period of time so the HSE has to have standing panels in place and a range of procedures.  The scale of review requirements needed to be understood to ensure the process of review mechanism was working, as opposed to any kind of measure of the scale of the problem.  That was the broad rationale for it.</p></speech>

This is a two stage process - we have been through the Citizens' Assembly and we are considering its report.  We are not looking, necessarily, at the existing resources.  We need to look at what is the ideal, what is best practice, what we should recommend around screening, ratios in perinatal care, contraception, folic acid and what should the health promotion unit in the HSE, for example, do in that regard.  We want to make practical recommendations with some sort of vision around the ideal of maternal services such as screening.  It would be quite useful if the witnesses could point the committee to where we can find that kind of information.  How does Ireland compare in where we are now and international best practice?  Is it possible to find this information in one location for the committee to include as recommendations in its report?</p></speech>

We will have to support that work and in parallel do, as the Deputy has rightly said, forward planning on how to provide the best access to the services whatever they may be, and on how best to provide the services and in what settings.  The planning will set out models that are not constrained - if I can use that term - by the current service models but are service models directed to supporting the operation of the legislation that ultimately becomes part of our law, whatever that may be.  I wanted to make that point in principle.</p> <p>  There are aspects of the question that might apply to crisis pregnancy interventions, for example, where good practice questions can arise.  In the examination of models, the Department is looking at countries internationally around various different approaches to service provision and legislation and how we might begin to operate for the provisions.  This was part of our scenario analysis that I spoke of earlier.  Perhaps Ms Donlon or others will comment on aspects of best practice in crisis pregnancy generally.</p></speech>

We have the ability to look at that.  We are also considering introducing a national telephone counselling system next year, which we hope will improve access to counselling for a larger cohort of women.  If legislation is changed and if there is a requirement to provide termination services in the State, the services we fund would be able to respond accordingly.</p></speech>

We have heard a lot about criminalisation and about the concerns of people who work in labour wards around whether something can or cannot be done.  One would need a barrister rather than an obstetrician in that scenario.  When we consider the recruitment of staff and those who practise medicine - given that we are trying to recruit from a wide environment - does medical insurance play a role?  Has it arisen as an impediment for people when considering a jurisdiction with this kind of regime?</p></speech>

The State carries the insurance.  Individual insurance tends not to be a problem currently.  It was an issue until the State Claims Agency took over in 2002.  As the obstetrics services have attracted much adverse publicity people do not wish to be associated with that and it can be a barrier.  Some practitioners, either midwifery or medical, have found themselves in the spotlight and not in a way they would want to be.  That is very negative.  The HSE is aware of some colleagues who have attracted attention and it has made a very negative impact on their lives, probably unjustifiably.</p><p>In that regard, it can be very difficult to attract some people in and keep them in because of the stress.  Criminalisation is something I have heard referred to, but I am unaware of any instance where it has followed through into action.  I could be wrong and perhaps it has happened and I have not heard about it, but I think it is more of a theoretical issue than a practical day to day problem.</p></speech>

We were told that in some school environments how it is rolled out very much depends on the ethos in the schools.  I do not know whether this is for the Department of Health or the HSE, but is there any concern that there is not a uniform approach or that an ethos may interfere with the quality of sex education and that it is not just about pregnancy and disease but that there is a much more rounded approach?  Is there any concern or discussion about this?  What input do the witnesses have into how such programmes are delivered or is it just about inputting into the design of the programme?</p></speech>

It would be accepted that the fewer barriers in place between accessing the service and the user the better.  Whether these barriers are financial or educational, they should be dismantled if at all possible.

We have an implementation plan with the actions I have set out, some of which fall to the Department of Education and Skills, and I would be very happy to communicate with the Deputy directly to give her an update if it would be of help.</p></speech>

I want to have clarified the definition of a crisis pregnancy.  It could be for a variety of reasons.  It could be for health reasons, mental health reasons or stress.  Are we satisfied we have a sufficient and adequate response, when a woman presents in a maternity hospital or a clinic, to what may initially appear to be a normal procedure but could suddenly transfer quickly to a serious life-threatening issue?  I do not want to name any particular case, but I can think of one which made headlines and I can think of a couple of others that have also hit the headlines.  I know outsiders should not comment on these things, but from an outsider's point of view I would like to think that when we legislate, whatever we do we have an adequate and responsive service available that takes into account all aspects of what can and might happen, even though initially it might not look as if that were necessary.  What I am trying to ask is whether we have an adequate diagnosis to deal rapidly with that situation.</p></speech>

It is in primary care.  I would not be equipped really to deal with this.  If a woman presents with a medical health problem, and that is presenting a difficulty and challenge to her life, then the services do exist to advise accordingly.  The most common is a heart problem.  In many years of working in this area, I do not think I have ever been approached by somebody who did not have a health problem, or by a doctor asking me on behalf of a woman who did not have a health problem, what would we do here.

It could be a termination or an intervention that would bring the pregnancy to a conclusion, whatever the case may be.  I do not want to spend too much time but, for instance, in some of the cases that come from the past, albeit from a time when different legislation prevailed, nonetheless it would appear that in order to respond to the emergency-type situation there would have needed to have been a greater degree of alertness in the system to determine what needs to be done next to ensure the mother did not die or that the mother and child did not die unnecessarily.</p></speech>

The measures that have been put in place in recent years, some of which were identified earlier in this meeting, do not allow us to say we responded fully to everything that required a response.  However, there are several maternity strategy information systems in place.  There is a national mechanism through the centre for perinatal medicine in Cork and another through the national perinatal reporting system at a national level that gives us the ability to track and monitor relevant events.  The Irish maternity early warning system, IMEWS, which is a reporting system in regard to obstetric units, facilitates a monthly reporting arrangement.  As I said, patient safety statements are published.  All of those measures are geared towards increasing the transparency of activity and the awareness of risk in the environments in which obstetric practice takes place, with a view to increasing the speed of response.  The delivery of health care is not a risk-free enterprise.  None of the science, people or processes involved are perfect but we have to constantly ensure the systems are capable of learning from and responding to incidents and applying the benefits of that learning.  The delivery of maternity services is an area in which significant improvements are taking place, but none of the witnesses present would say that all of the risks that might exist has been fully and adequately eliminated.  That almost never arises in the context of medical practice.</p></speech>

The only thing she can think of is to go abroad for a termination, as has historically been the case.  Such a woman may not be in a good mental position at the time and going abroad for a termination may not be in her best interests.  How does one identify such patients?  They may not attend a GP or other services.  I ask the witnesses to address the issues of advertising, health education or any other measure on which we can rely in that regard.  There have been some very tragic incidents in the past 20 or 30 years.  One incident in particular comes to mind, whereby the person was alone with no help from any quarter and was obviously forlorn and in a very bad situation.</p></speech>

As Dr. McKenna said, there are multiple potential barriers for those in such situations and who are seeking to access services.  In some cases, the health services have not given their best in responding as they could and should.  I would like to think that people have an increasing understanding of what they are entitled to request access to because of the progress we are making in terms of crisis pregnancy, access to general practitioner services and increasing the awareness and provision of maternity and related services and increasing awareness of access to the kind of services we are discussing and with which the committee is concerned.  Health services also have an understanding of their obligations in that regard.  All of those things indicate-----</p></speech>

As regards the folic acid point raised by Deputy O'Connell, which is an issue I am very interested in and on which I have done some work, approximately 100 babies are born every year with a condition the incidence of which could be dramatically reduced were folic acid to be standard fare for women of childbearing age.  Some 70% of those events are preventable but occur in spite of widespread knowledge that folic acid is required by women for the reasons that have been discussed, such as a baby not having been planned even though it is wanted and so on.  The World Health Organization, WHO, has advocated the fortification of flour with folic acid.  Does Dr. McKenna think there is any reason for that not to be done?  Could it have a negative effect on the male population or on women for some reason?  Folic acid is of benefit to most bodies, regardless of pregnancy.   I may be asking a question to which Dr. McKenna does not know the answer but I am interested in his views on the matter.</p></speech>

The answer is because we had the confluence of two specialties that were regarded as not worthwhile spending money on.  One was maternity and the other was psychiatry.  The maternity services have arrived at where they are because of resource issues.  A very easy measure of this is the number of consultants.  There are about 120 or so consultants in this country.  By any international standards that is very low.</p></speech>

There is a lot of talk about how well paid lawyers, doctors and all these professions are.  I have a lot of friends who are medics and many of them have spent years abroad and came back reluctantly for family reasons.  Australia is very attractive because of the work conditions.  They are very satisfactory for family life, etc.  With the new contracts and so on, has it become unattractive to Irish people abroad to come back?  We cannot get them back.  Would the witness think that is a fair comment?</p></speech>

Without prejudging it, many of the kinds of interventions that are effective contraceptions are not expensive.  It is a question of cost, implementation and a range of things like that.  If we were to do it, we would have to look at the various policy implications of it to provide universal access to one form of medication or one form of intervention, however we would define contraception.  However, in broad terms, the specific interventions that make up the range of interventions that are contraception are not for the most part expensive.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Connell raised a point earlier about the licensing issue.  This the last of my questions.  My understanding is that there is no real issue when it comes to licensing because even a drug like Armour Thyroid - I do not know if the witnesses are familiar with it - is not available on license but it is freely available once it is prescribed.  Certain doctors would know about it.  Is it a similar type of situation with the drugs that we discussed?</p></speech>

I spoke to the Minister about it.  There is an issue with quantifying the private patient on no medication because it is very common.  In the UK, it is provided free universally.  As far as I know from my time in the UK, it is for a year after one gives birth.  Essentially one gets a temporary medical card while pregnant and for a year after.  That was 12 years ago.  Perhaps it has changed.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be every bit as aware of this as I am but the Department is currently considering the details of its response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report from the committee chaired by Deputy Shortall.  That makes a whole series of recommendations, some of which touch on eligibility.  There is nothing in the report specifically about free access to contraception.  The general direction that the system will go in terms of implementation is something that we are working to finalise and to give the Minister proposals that he will bring to Cabinet in the early new year.  Beyond that, I cannot say.  I could make a commitment here that would not be an honest one.  I will look at the issue and-----</p></speech>

I will introduce the speakers, who will then proceed to give statements on the issue.<br/><br/>Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi is a Palestinian physician, social, political, human rights and peace activist and politician who serves as secretary general of the Palestinian National Initiative.  He has been a member of the Palestinian Legislative Council since 2006 and is also a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization executive committee.  In 2007, Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi was Minister of Information in the first national unity government in Palestinian history.  He was a presidential candidate in the elections of 2005 as a representative of the Palestinian National Initiative on an anti-corruption and pro-democracy platform, achieving second place behind President Mahmoud Abbas with almost one third of the total votes.  He is an outspoken advocate of internal reform, an international spokesperson for the Palestinian cause and a leading figure in the non-violent peaceful struggle against the occupation.  Dr. Marghouthi is one of the most active grassroots leaders in Palestine.  He has made an extraordinary contribution to initiatives which peacefully challenge the ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestine as well as efforts to build the institutional framework of Palestinian civil society and promote the principles of internal democracy and good governance.<br/><br/>Dr. Rima Khalaf Hunaidi has served in several leadership positions in Jordan and the United Nations, most recently as the Under Secretary General and executive secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia.  Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi resigned her post in 2017 when she refused to withdraw a seminal report on the suffering of Palestinians under Israeli occupation.  The report had concluded, based on overwhelming evidence, that Israel has established an apartheid regime that oppresses and dominates the Palestinian people whether they live in the Palestinian territory occupied in 1967, in Israel or in the diaspora.  Previously, Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi served as director of the Regional Bureau for Arab States with the UN Development Programme, initiating projects to promote good governance, human rights and human development in Arab countries.  She was the principal architect of the pioneering Arab human development report series and has received numerous international prizes.  Before joining the UN Development Programme, Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi served in senior government posts in Jordan, including Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Industry and Trade and Minister of Planning.  She also served as Senator in the upper house of the Jordanian Parliament.  Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi holds a bachelors degree in economics from the American University of Beirut as well as a masters degree in economics and a PhD in system science from Portland State University in Oregon.  She has received an honorary doctorate, doctor of humane letters, from the American University of Cairo in recognition of her important regional initiatives in education, women's rights, civic engagement and economic growth.  In December 2009, the <i>Financial Times</i>listed Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi among the top 50 people who shaped the decade.<br/><br/>I must offer apologies for Mr. Daniel Levy who unfortunately, for personal reasons, had to return to London.  He would welcome the opportunity to return and deliver his part of the presentation to the committee at a later stage.  Dr. Barghouthi will present the opening statement.</p></speech>

We were pressured to accept a two-state solution, the decision which was made by the United Nations in 1947.  It decided that there should be a Palestinian state on no less than 44% of the land of Palestine.  We came to negotiations.  It has been 25 years since negotiations started.  The Palestinian Liberation Organization and other structures completely concentrated on a non-violent approach and on negotiations.  During these 25 years, as the members will see from some of the slides that will be distributed to them, instead of having peace, freedom and independence we witnessed an increase of illegal settlement activity, from 111,000 settlers in 1993 to more than 750,000 settlers today.  We have seen the transformation of the military occupation, which is the longest in modern history, into a system of apartheid.  It is a far worse system of discriminatory apartheid than what prevailed in South Africa at one time.</p> <p>  We have witnessed the continuation of the deprivation of 6 million Palestinian refugees of their right to go home, the right to return to the places from which they were displaced in 1948 in one of the worst forms of ethnic cleansing.  Today, things are getting worse because the Israeli Government feels it has impunity to, and is above, international law.  It feels it can violate international humanitarian law with impunity as well.  The Israeli public, unfortunately, is increasingly turning towards extremism and is electing racist governments.</p> <p>  This situation is intolerable.  It is that way because the Israeli Government and the Israeli people are benefitting from the occupation.  It is a profitable occupation and a profitable system of apartheid.  This cannot be changed except in two ways - Palestinian struggle to change the balance of power and international solidarity with the Palestinian people.  Palestinians have only one of two options.  They either turn to violence or stick to the non-violent approach, which we are choosing.  However, that non-violent approach will not succeed unless there are strong international activities in support of the Palestinian people.  That is why we urge Ireland, a country that also suffered from colonialism and an oppressive colonialist system and a country that understands people's struggle for freedom, to make its contribution to supporting the Palestinian struggle.</p> <p>  It can do so first by immediate recognition of the Palestinian state.  That recognition should be made as soon as possible because it makes a difference.  Ireland should be in the avant-garde of countries that take that responsibility.  Second, we urge Ireland to pass legislation that forbids the import of products produced by an occupying power in an occupied territory.  This would apply to all occupied territories anywhere in the world and specifically to the occupied territories in Palestine.  Preventing settlement products from reaching this market and boycotting such products would be a great contribution to supporting justice, the principles of international law and to supporting Ireland's own laws.  We also hope there will be no form of military co-operation with Israel as a government that is occupying another country and a state that, unfortunately, is practising a profound system of apartheid and discrimination.</p> <p>  My colleague, Dr. Rima Khalaf Hunaidi, will explain further the aspects of the apartheid system that Israel has created.</p></speech>

I will address Israel's violations of international law and how Israel robs all Palestinians, wherever they live, of their freedoms and universally acknowledged human rights, including the right to self-determination and the right to justice.</p><p>A report published in March 2017 by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia while I was its executive secretary examined Israeli policies and practices towards the Palestinian people in its entirety and determined on the basis of scholarly inquiry and overwhelming evidence, that Israel employs policies and practices that oppress and dominate the Palestinians wherever they live - under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza, as refuges abroad and as citizens of Israel itself.  Those policies discriminate against Palestinians because of their religion and national origin for the benefit of another racial group, Jewish Israelis.</p><p> The report concluded that such policies and practices amount to the crime of apartheid as per the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  In addition to imposing an apartheid regime over the Palestinians, which is a crime against humanity, Israel is also in violation of the United Nations Charter, Security Council resolutions, international human rights law and international humanitarian law.  By building settlements in the Occupied Territories, Israel has also flouted its obligations as the occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention as confirmed by the International Court of Justice.</p><p> The international community's failure to hold Israel accountable for its violations of international law, including possible crimes against humanity such as apartheid, has allowed this injustice to fester causing immense human suffering.  Seventy years is too long for any country to flout international law without facing consequences.  Building settlements in occupied territories is a crime.  The produce of these settlements should be prohibited from entering international markets and not just labelled.</p><p> I was pleased to meet Senator Frances Black on Tuesday and to learn that she has prepared draft legislation with Sadaka that will be published in the coming weeks on banning the produce of illegal settlements established by any occupying power.  Passing such a Bill would send a strong message to the world - to the oppressors and the oppressed, to the occupiers and the occupied - that Ireland stands fully in support with international law and that it is willing to start by enforcing it domestically in compliance with its constitutional principles and domestic laws.</p><p> Subjecting an entire people to an apartheid regime should not be allowed.  Apartheid is a crime against humanity and comes second to genocide in criminality under international law.  The perpetrators should not be aided and abetted; they should be held accountable.  A first step in that direction would be for this committee to consider forming a working group or an investigation panel to confirm beyond reasonable doubt that Israeli policies and practices against the Palestinian people amount to apartheid.</p><p> Ireland, a country that struggled against and prevailed over foreign occupation and domination, a country known and respected for its unwavering commitment to the ideals of freedom and justice, can play a pivotal role in bringing justice to Palestine.  As an active member of the EU and the community of nations, it can insist on the strict and prompt implementation of international law in order to arrive at a durable peace that sees two peoples living together on the basis of real equality.  This durable peace will only be achieved when justice is achieved.</p></speech>

Deputy Crowe and I are also members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  In that capacity we met another Palestinian delegation yesterday.  Some of today's discussion adds to what we heard yesterday.  Yesterday was about looking at how the Good Friday Agreement can act as an example or model.  It is very obvious that certain elements are missing in the Palestinian situation.  Here a number of governments were involved - our Government, the British Government and the United States Government.  They took a very personal involvement in it.  In addition our diaspora in the United States were influential.  The United States will not be an ally to the Palestinians in this case.  Is there an alternative that can be that driver in the way that the United States was the driver that contributed to bringing about peace in our country?</p> <p>  I have been in Palestine a few times, most recently in September, and have had the opportunity to meet some political figures from both Fatah and Hamas.  We discussed how that political vacuum has led to so much more humiliation and indignity, and so much more settlement building.  Everywhere I went I was struck by the extent of the settlement building and the indignity brought about because of the wall and the restrictions on travel.</p> <p>  It was good to hear that just after that a ceasefire was called, and Fatah and Hamas are working on reconciliation, a political plan and a vision.  I ask for the witnesses' comments on the need for a really strong political movement in Palestine that can be the driver of this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.969" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#C00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  It is a pleasure to have them addressing the committee.  I thank Sadaka for the work it does here on behalf of the Palestinians.</p> <p>  The issue of Palestine and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is always to the forefront of this committee's work.  It is also to the forefront in Fianna F&aacute;il.  Unfortunately, today the witnesses have painted a very bleak picture and one of which we are acutely aware.  Dr. Barghouthi outlined the increase in settlers in the Occupied Territory, which confirms my view that the longer this is allowed to continue, the less realistic a two-state solution becomes.  Where do Dr. Barghouthi and Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi see things going from now?  I very much welcome the formation of a unity government in Palestine.  It is very important that there is one message coming from Palestine.</p> <p>  Earlier this year in Cairo I met the secretary general of the Arab League.  While we there for other reasons, at every opportunity they mentioned to us the importance of the recognition of the state of Palestine and using that as a springboard within Europe to move Israel towards talks.  I would like to see that happen.  The programme for Government mentions the recognition of a Palestinian state as part of a two-state solution, which is also Fianna F&aacute;il's view.  What do the witnesses envisage the real impact of that for the Palestinian people and the government in Palestine so that people here can understand how important the recognition of the state of Palestine would be in the Middle East and internationally?</p> <p>  Both Dr. Barghouthi and Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi mentioned the apartheid system and how Palestinian citizens are treated.  I ask Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi to give some examples of what that means to the normal Palestinian people going about their daily lives.</p> <p>  As my party's foreign affairs spokesperson, I am incredibly disappointed at the lack of engagement by Israel in moving towards a solution.  Following on from what our Vice Chairman, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, said, I believe these talks need a sponsor; it cannot just be Israel and Palestine.  The Palestinian ambassador to Ireland, who along with his team does a fantastic job, has been at pains to say that it needs an independent sponsor.  If it is not to be the United States - I would not write that off completely - what country should it be?  Previous advances in talks arose because there was an independent sponsor.  We understood that, given the work of the US Government and the European Union in the Irish peace process.</p><p>Ireland and its European partners have strongly condemned the destruction of EU-funded properties in Palestine and the Occupied Territories.  The European Commission has made a strong statement in that regard.  What more would the witnesses like the EU to do?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.971" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for their very good questions.  The peace process is not a goal by itself.  The peace process is an instrument or a method used to achieve peace.  In the Palestinian case, unfortunately we have ended up with a peace process that has become a substitute for peace because the US has a monopoly over the so-called peace process, a total bias in favour of Israel and an inability to play an impartial role.  We have ended up with a peace process that has become a substitute for peace and a cover for the expansion of Israeli settlements.  The Israeli facts on the ground are destroying the very potential for a two-state solution.  It is ironic that the peace process has become a cover for actions that are killing the possibility of peace and the possibility of a two-state solution.  After 26 years of negotiations, nobody can hide the reality that there is no peace process.  It is unacceptable that the peace process is being used as an excuse to delay the recognition of Palestine as a state.  To be specific and technical, there have been no peace negotiations for many years.  The process is dead.  It is used to cover the Israeli actions.  It is not leading to a solution.<br/><br/>I tried to show the committee some slides.  They have been printed for the committee.  The green area of the map on the first slide depicts what was supposed to be a Palestinian state on almost 44% of the historic land of Palestine.  The map on the second slide depicts the so-called two-state solution, which we accepted with great pain because it meant giving up half of what we should have had according to the UN resolution.  Palestinians accepted the two-state solution option that was based on the 1967 borders, as shown in the second map.  Unfortunately, a third map was offered to us when we went to Camp David in 2000.  This offered us a state without borders, without sovereignty and without Jerusalem, which is the most important city in Palestine.  Ariel Sharon went further at a later stage by deducting more of the proposed Palestinian state and transforming it into three separate sectors.  The real map I would like to show the committee today shows how Palestinian communities have been fragmented across 225 isolated bantustans or ghettos.  Israel is devoting the black area on the map, which represents 62% of the land of the West Bank, to the use of illegal Israeli settlers.  How can we have a state with such a map?  How can we speak about a peace process which is being used as a cover to produce this system of fragmentation and killing the very foundation of the possibility of having a Palestinian state?<br/><br/>I think the only possible alternative to the US is a true international body which includes major players.  That is what France tried to achieve when it initiated the idea of having an international peace conference with the participation of many countries from across the world.  Unfortunately, this idea, which would have eliminated the US monopoly, was paralysed when Israel refused to attend the conference in question.  Israel refuses to deal with any country or entity, including the EU, that presents itself as an alternative peace mediator.  We are stuck with an imbalance of power that cannot be changed unless the facts on the ground are put across to counter the Israeli facts on the ground.  That is why the recognition of Palestine is important, to come to Deputy O'Brien's second question.  The recognition of Palestine would send a message that the Israeli facts on the ground are not going to dominate.  It would show that there is an alternative fact on the ground: the recognition of the state of Palestine, which would have the status of a state under occupation, as the UN has indicated.  Such recognition would have a very important legal aspect, a very important fact aspect and a very important moral aspect for the Palestinian people in feeling that the world is supporting their goal.<br/><br/>Before I speak about reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas, a process in which I am participating, I will ask Dr. Rima Khalaf Hunaidi to speak about the issue of apartheid.  Deputy O'Brien asked for specific information about the system of apartheid.  I can show the committee some figures that show we do not have much water.  The West Bank produces approximately 132 cu. m of water every year.  Israel takes more than 86% of that.  The outcome of this is that on average, a Palestinian is allowed to use more than 50 cu. m of water per year, while illegal Israeli settlers are allowed to use 2,400 cu. m of water each year, or 48 times more than us.  The Israeli GDP <i>per capita</i>is $38,000.  The Palestinian GDP <i>per capita</i>is less than $2,000.  We are obliged to buy products at Israeli market prices.  Moreover, we are obliged to pay double the price for electricity and water.  If we need to send a patient to an Israeli hospital, we are obliged to pay four times more than what an Israeli citizen pays.  In addition, there is a system of road segregation.  This is the first time in human history that roads have been segregated.  This did not even happen during the South African apartheid system.  There are major roads inside the West Bank - not in Israel - which we are prohibited to use.  If we are caught driving or walking on these roads, we will be sentenced to six months in jail.<br/><br/>I was born in Jerusalem.  I worked as a medical doctor in Jerusalem for 15 years.  I committed a sin, from the Israeli perspective, in 2005 when I decided to run for president and to meet voters in Jerusalem.  I was arrested on four occasions for being in the city where I was born.  Since then, I have been prohibited from entering Jerusalem and visiting my sister who lives there.  If a Palestinian man in Jerusalem decides to marry a Palestinian woman in Ramallah, which is just 16 km away, legally they will not be able to live together.  She could not go to Jerusalem because she would not be given a permit.  If he decided to move to Ramallah to live with his wife, he would lose his residency, social security and health insurance and would not be allowed to come back to Jerusalem.  This must be the worst system of apartheid in the 21st century.  It is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

The real question in this regard relates to why this is being allowed to drag on.  It is definite that the Palestinians are not causing the process to drag on, given that they are living under a brutal foreign occupation that they want to end as soon as possible.</p><p>Israel wants to drag on the occupation because the longer it takes to resolve, the more facts on the ground can be established, the most important being the establishment of settlements in the occupied territories.  As Dr. Barghouthi said, when the Oslo agreements were signed there were around 100,000 settlers in the occupied territories.  Now, more than 700,000 settlers live there.  </p><p> I worked for the UN and while I was there we looked at the map of the West Bank.  We discovered that Israel has illegally expropriated 20% of the West Bank.  If one adds the lands that are now what are called shooting, military or green zones and the lands taken by illegal Israeli settlements, as well as the lands that surround Israeli settlements that Palestinians are not allowed to access, one will find that more than 60% of the land of the West Bank is no longer accessible to Palestinians.  These are the facts on the ground that Israel is establishing.  That is why we were very excited to know about the Bill that will ban the products of illegal settlements established by an occupying power in an occupied territory from being sold on the Irish market, regardless of who the occupier is.  If signals are sent to Israel that it will not benefit from delaying the end of occupation then maybe the parties can be pushed towards a speedy resolution of the conflict and thus end the occupation for the benefit of all.  The ultimate objective is to establish peace.  </p><p> The regime Israel has imposed on the Palestinians is an apartheid regime, which we determined using the definition for apartheid in international law.  I will start by quoting the definition for apartheid in the Rome Statute.  The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines the crime of apartheid as "inhumane acts ... committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime".   The inhumane acts are listed in the apartheid convention.  We considered all of the acts that Israel has perpetrated against Palestinians and compared them with the inhumane acts listed in the apartheid convention.  We concluded that Israel has committed all of the inhumane acts listed in the apartheid convention except for genocide.  It is worth noting that the apartheid South African regime did not commit genocide but committed all of the rest of the inhumane acts.  </p><p> The report considered how Israel treats different segments of the Palestinian people.  Israel has divided Palestinians into four categories.  First, the Palestinians who live in the occupied territories or the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967.  Earlier, Dr. Barghouthi gave examples of how services are determined by a person's religion and national origin.  Palestinians are deprived of services but Israeli settlers who reside illegally in the occupied territory can access land, water and natural resources. </p><p> The most important signal that it is an apartheid regime is that Israel imposes two legal systems to the same piece of land.  On the one hand, military rule is imposed on the Palestinians.  On the other hand, a different legal system and laws are applied to Jewish Israelis who settled in occupied territories.  One cannot apply one legal system to one racial group and another system to another racial group.  Such a dual legal system makes legal protection, human rights, the ability to benefit from public services and everything in one's life dependent on one's ethnic origin and religion. </p><p> I contend that an apartheid regime is imposed on Palestinian refugees because, according to Israeli law, such refugees are not allowed to return home because they are not Jewish.  Had they been Jewish, they would not have been expelled or uprooted from their homes to start with.  It is a little bit more tricky in east Jerusalem because Israel illegally annexed the area after occupation in 1967.  After annexation, Israel classified the residents as permanent residents and, therefore, they were no longer the citizens of the city.  By comparison, the Israelis who illegally went to live in east Jerusalem are nationals and citizens and, therefore, can avail of all of the services.  Discrimination is obvious in health services, educational services, municipal services etc.  </p><p> The most controversial aspect is whether Israel has imposed an apartheid regime within the State of Israel.  As a Jewish state, the basic Israeli legal architecture codifies a privileged status for its Jewish citizens and allows discrimination against all others, particularly against Palestinians.  According to Israeli law, Palestinians can be citizens of the state of Israel but they cannot be nationals of the state of Israel.  The country differentiates between nationality and citizenship.  Only the Jewish citizens of Israel can be nationals of the State of Israel and, therefore, Palestinians cannot access and benefit from all of the nationality rights granted to Jewish citizens, including access to land.  As much as 93% of the land in Israel has been deemed Government land, which can only be developed for the benefit of its Jewish citizens.  Non-Jewish citizens cannot benefit from Government land.  There is also discrimination when it comes to immigration.  Only Jews are allowed to immigrate to Israel.  Palestinians who were born in Palestine, which is Israel now, are not allowed to come back.  </p><p> There are now 50 Israeli laws that explicitly discriminate against its non-Jewish citizens.  They cover a wide range of domains, including constitutional protection, immigration, political participation, the state budget and the ability to benefit from state land and public services.  One would question why such discrimination was allowed to persist.  The reason is equality is not a legal principle under basic Israeli laws.  While all constitutions state that all citizens are equal regardless of their race and gender, equality is not a legal principle in Israel and, therefore, non-Jewish citizens cannot lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court to be treated the same as Jewish citizens.  </p><p> We all accept that the German nation is the nation state of the German people and the French state is the nation state of the French people.  The Israeli Supreme Court decided that the Israeli state is not the state of the Israeli people but the Jewish people only.  That demonstrates an institutionalised system of discrimination that targets a racial group, namely, Palestinians and favours another racial group, namely, Israelis.  The objective of such domination is to perpetuate the system of apartheid and discrimination.  </p></speech>

Regarding the issue of internal reconciliation between Palestinians, we have now engaged in another attempt to bring back internal unity between Palestinians.  I myself attended the most recent meeting in Cairo in which all the 14 political parties in Palestine participated.  We have come up with an agreement that we hope to fully implement, which would come to a practical end with the establishment of a unified Palestinian leadership within the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, PLO.  It would also allow elections to take place.  It is hoped such elections would be held no later than the end of 2018.  We have not had such elections since 2006.  It would also allow us to have a national unity government again.</p> <p>  It is very important for further reconciliation to succeed for us for two reasons.  First, it will make us much stronger in confronting all of these oppressions from the Israeli side and in changing the balance of power.  However, it is also important to bring democracy back to Palestine.  It is important to bring our parliament back to life because it has been paralysed since the collapse of the national unity government in 2007.  Bringing back democracy, elections and the principle of separation of powers is very important internally for Palestinian people and for the future independent Palestinian state for which we hope.  </p> <p>  This will not succeed unless the international community also supports the reconciliation efforts.  We had a very painful experience in 2007.  When we formed our national unity government I personally mediated between Fatah and Hamas, being an independent party to both of them, and we succeeded in forming a national unity government.  We were besieged by embargoes from the United States and many European countries and Israel suspended the transfer of our tax revenue, which it controls.  As the committee knows, Israel controls 70% of our tax revenue and deducts 3% as a commission for doing so.  When it suspended the transfer of all our tax revenue, the world community partially participated in that siege on us.  That unity government collapsed.  That is why it is very important that Europe supports unity between Palestinians not with words, but with actions.  That is why it is not acceptable to impose conditions on Palestinian political parties.  </p> <p>  I would like to mention one small point.  Everybody keeps saying that Hamas should recognise Israel.  Hamas asks why it should recognise Israel when Israel does not recognise Palestine?  Why do people not speak about mutual recognition?  The PLO recognised Israel, but Israel never recognised Palestine.  As a matter of fact, Israel is the only country in the world that does not define its borders.  I hope, in any future encounter committee members have with any Israeli officials, that they would ask them what the borders of Israel are.  It will not define its borders because it continues to expand them in violation of international law.</p> <p>  A question was asked on what the alternative would be if the two-state was killed.  For Israelis the alternative is what we have today - the system of apartheid, discrimination and continuous occupation.  This is not the solution for us.  It is probably the opinion of most Palestinians that if Israel kills the two-state solution, and if the world community does not intervene very quickly, we will have no option but to struggle for a one-state solution with full democratic rights for everybody.  In that case we could never accept that Israel could be a Jewish state.  Israel cannot be a Jewish state if more than half the population are Palestinians.  It has to be a state for all its citizens.  That means equality for everybody.  Therefore Israel has two options, either a two-state solution immediately or a one-state solution eventually.  However, we know that it will be a long struggle against the system of apartheid, which was described very well to the committee.  </p> <p>  I have one last point on the EU projects which were destroyed.  It is unacceptable that Israel is allowed to continue to destroy projects which the EU is funding with the money of Irish and European taxpayers.  The European Union must take action.  Protest is not enough.  I believe that the European Union should immediately take action so that damages for any EU-funded projects in area C which are destroyed by Israel would be deducted immediately from any co-operation agreement between Israel and the European Union.  More than that, the fact that Israel is destroying European projects in the occupied Palestinian territories should be a reason to suspend all these agreements between the European Union and Israel.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I have always known of the difficulties, as has everybody, but when one looks at the map it is quite shocking to see it in that way.  When one hears of things like road segregation from Dr. Barghouthi it is also quite shocking.  I am really sorry that is the case.  On the discussion about the difficulties we have had here in our own country and how we have come out of the other end, people would say that both sides were more equal and that we had a very good driver in the United States.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has stated she does not think the United States will be there for Palestine and I am inclined to agree.  There is, however, a very strong need for an independent driver for any peace process.</p> <p>  I know that President Trump visited in May or June of this year.  Does Dr. Barghouthi feel that there will be any intervention from the United States?  It has said that it wants to try to drive the peace process.  Does Dr. Barghouthi have any indication as to what it might be looking at doing?  Is there any possibility that anything can come out of that or is it just talk?  I am sorry to jump in like this.  I have another committee to attend at 10 a.m.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.989" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#F01400"><p>I will be very quick, yes.  First, I thank the Senator for the question.  As she knows, President Trump is a man of grand ideas.  He is speaking about a grand solution to the problem but we have not yet been officially presented with any ideas.  All we hear is that the US is thinking about, talking about and visiting us.  Members of President Trump's team have already visited the place 23 times.  Perhaps the Americans would be very happy if he were to visit us 23 times himself.  This would reduce the amount of tweets.  Unfortunately there are three indications that make us worried.  The first is that this US Administration is the first in decades which has not spelled out the term "two-state solution" and which has not said that it would support the creation of an independent Palestinian state.  Second, this Administration is quite different from previous Administrations in how it responds to Israeli settlement activities.</p><p>It is not doing anything.  The rate at which settlements expand has increased by 100% since President Trump was elected.</p><p> The third problem relates to the nature of the team that is working on the issue.  Many people are very suspicious that the team is very biased to Israel and that it adopts Israeli positions.  One of them, at least, is definitely not suitable to participate in a peace process.  This is the American ambassador in Israel, David Friedman, who declared openly that he supports settlement activities and who is also very proud of the fact that his daughter has volunteered to work in the Israeli army.  These aspects make us very worried about the nature of that grand plan, if it is represented.</p><p> We also understand that one of the main efforts of the American team is to enforce normalisation between Israel and Arab countries without solving the Palestinian issue and without presenting a solution that would end the occupation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.992" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#G00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  I share the frustrations of the speakers about the current situation in Palestine and the impunity that the international community, including Ireland, provides for Israel.  For those who are watching the proceedings at home, some of the witnesses' comments this morning will be shocking, especially the idea that Israel portrays itself as a very liberal society that, for example, recognises the gay community, takes part in the Eurovision song contest and has a European outlook.  People are then shocked to hear how Israel treats the Palestinians and what is happening with the occupation.  That one group of people get access to a huge amount of water to fill a swimming pool, particularly in a region such as the Middle East where people clearly cannot survive without water, while another group is confined to small amounts will shock most people.</p> <p>  The idea of settlements should not be a surprise to people in Ireland.  Looking back on our own history, we had conflict and war and we also had plantation similar to the settlement process, where people were moved off their lands though conflict and hunger.  They were forced off their land and the phrase that was used was "To hell or to Connacht" during Cromwell's time, but plantation happened before that also.  People suggest there may similarities between Ireland and what is happening in Palestine.  People look at the Irish peace process and ask why would anybody be against peace.  This is the big question asked by people in Ireland.  The Irish peace process, however, is a bit different in that all the parties had come to a conclusion that there could be no military victory on any side.  That was the conclusion and one of the reasons that people went to the table.  Many of the parties also had an idea of a plan for how the situation would resolve, and those discussions went on.</p> <p>  People have a difficulty in respect of the Palestinian peace process with some saying it is a sham or a cover-up for what the Israelis are doing.  Looking at the map, the Israelis do not need to do a peace process as they are clearly killing the green area that is supposed to be Palestinian, which is shrinking in size.  I suppose that the Israeli policy on settlements is working for them, but perhaps the witnesses will explain the idea of a settlement.  What happens if a settler moves into a house in a particular area?  Do the remaining Palestinians then live around the house where the settler is living?  Does the military move in to protect the settler?  What happens to the families who live in that area?  It would be useful to have this explained for people who may watch this committee from home.</p> <p>  In her role as executive secretary for the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi worked on the report that detailed the apartheid system operated by Israel in the occupied Palestine.  The report is hard hitting but necessary.  Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi was put under pressure to withdraw the report and it is regrettable that she had to resign.  Will the witness explain why she thinks certain forces within the UN attacked her over the report?  They had said the report had not gone through due process and so on.  When will the UN wake up to this, finally accept that an apartheid system operates in that area and challenge it as was done with South Africa?  Dr. Khalaf Hunaidi has clearly outlined, to the committee and in her report, the situation and many of the issues,  but what is the difference between Israel now and South Africa at that time?</p> <p>  The witness has also referred to the military links and how Israel probably would not survive without its military complex, the technology it buys and its arms sales around the world.  How important is this for countries such as Ireland?  We have information technology companies that are quite successful and they might supply components that could be useful in the technology.  With regard to the South African issue, during the apartheid regime there was a ban on certain elements, for example, such as for military helicopters, but it was not in place for helicopters used for health and safety or rescue.  That was how they got around that issue.  The apartheid regime could simply use it for peaceful purposes.  Within these comments I have tried to outline the frustration shared by people in Ireland.  We as a people want to know what our country and our Government can do to move beyond this stalemate and beyond the colonisation that is happening.  It is clearly killing off the idea of a two-state solution and is killing off the prospect of the Palestinian people ever having self-determination and freedom in their own land.</p></speech>

They are very welcome to the committee.  It has been a very important session.  While it has not been good to hear what the witnesses have said, because it is very bleak, it is important to hear it and to have it on the record.  The committee is glad the witnesses are here with us today.</p> <p>  I was glad to attend the Sadaka conference on Tuesday and to engage on the political panel with so many people there and to hear some of the presentations.  At that panel I expressed my own commitment and that of the Labour Party to working towards the Government's recognition of the state of Palestine.  There have been unanimous resolutions of the D&aacute;il and Seanad when our former Labour Party leader, Eamon Gilmore, was T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and he took up the groundbreaking stance.  Ms Crawley has quoted Eamon Gilmore in her presentation to the committee as having said, "The continuing Israeli military occupation of the Palestinian territories is at the heart of the unresolved Arab-Israeli conflict".  A very clear position was set out there.  On that point of recognition of the state of Palestine, this committee might take up a position seeking to persuade the Minister to give effect to the D&aacute;il and Seanad resolutions.  I take the point that action such as this needs to be taken to move things forward.  In the Seanad we will also work on the legislation, which we discussed at the Sadaka conference on Tuesday.  I have personally supported the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign for many years.</p><p>I have raised the issue of the demolitions and the settlements with the Minister.  At EU level there are initiatives to prohibit importation of goods from occupied territories.</p><p> The witnesses have painted a bleak picture of the Middle Eastern peace process which has been at a stalemate since 2014.  What do they see as the way forward?  Do they expect the Middle East peace process to be revived in some form with, if not the US, the EU or the Arab League as honest brokers?  Where do we get the international intervention that would be required to kick-start it or should we start afresh with a new two-state solution?  What is the position within Israel?  Netanyahu's governments have been resolutely against the peace process and the witnesses have graphically described the creeping settlements and annexation of Palestinian land.  Is there any prospect of change in Israel?</p><p> Dr. Khalaf identified the position taken in the report.  I thank her for that.  What is its effect and how can we pursue its findings?</p><p> We received a letter yesterday from the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign stating, and I did not know this, that President Netanyahu is scheduled to meet EU foreign ministers in Brussels on 11 December.  Are the witnesses aware of that?  Will they comment on that forthcoming meeting and what Ireland could do about it?</p></speech>

Does the United States have a representative in Ramallah?  The committee and I have met delegations from non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and civil society from Israel who are as critical as the witnesses of their government.  There is a need for those voices in Israel and Palestine, who want to see democracy and respect for human rights, to come together.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the resilience of the Palestinian people I have met and how they keep going.  The development in Ramallah is an example, probably a bit too much, although I can understand the reason for it.  I went to Nablus for the first time where human life goes on in spite of everything.  We have to be positive about how the Palestinian people are living their lives and getting on with work, education and family life.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.996" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rima Khalaf Hunaidi" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#H00300"><p>I thank the committee for the questions on the report.  The main question was why the report was stifled and how we reacted.  The report was stifled because international law imposes legal obligations on all states and on the United Nations if a crime of apartheid is brought to their attention.  According to international law, all states, individually and collectively, have a duty, first, not to recognise an apartheid regime as legitimate, second, not to aid or assist a country in maintaining an apartheid regime, and third, to co-operate with other states and with the United Nations body to dismantle that apartheid regime.  The report brought a crime of apartheid to their attention and they wanted it to disappear because if they had knowledge of this crime, they would have to take action.  The first reaction was to make it disappear.</p> <p>  My reaction was not to resign.  I said, "The report is in front of you.  If you find any flaw in the argument, if we misquoted an Israeli law or misrepresented an Israeli practice, if we arrived at any wrong conclusion, if you can point to any flaw in the analysis, I am willing to withdraw the report without asking any questions.  Just point to one error."  The response from all the parties involved - the United States and Israel put pressure on the Secretary General of the United Nations - was that they did not see any flaws but we had to take it off our website.  Later, when the spokesperson for the Secretary General was asked about the report, he explicitly mentioned that there was no disagreement about its contents but that the issue was procedural, which is irrelevant because we followed the proper procedure.  This is the background and that is why we all have a responsibility to act on the recommendations of the report.</p> <p>  That is why I suggested to the distinguished members of the committee that it may be worthwhile forming a working group, an investigation or a fact-finding panel to confirm beyond reasonable doubt that Israel has imposed an apartheid regime.  I am not talking about punitive actions or taking measures but about establishing the facts and confirming that this is happening and that a crime is being perpetrated against the Palestinian people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.997" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mustafa Barghouthi" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#H00400"><p>The first question was about settlements and what settlers do.  Israel uses a combination of laws to impose its regime on the ground.  The committee might be surprised to know that Israel still uses the Ottoman Turkish law, the British mandatory law, British emergency law, Israeli law, Jordanian law and no less than 2,400 military orders to impose its facts on the ground in Palestine.  The Ottoman Turkish empire, the British Mandate and the British emergency law ended a long time ago, but these laws are still used in Israel.  If that is not enough, it can initiate a new military order any time it wants or a new law in the Knesset, which is racist by nature.</p> <p>  The settlers come in and can claim that the land they are taking is estate land, in which case it does not belong to Israel because these are occupied territories, or they confiscate private land.  As soon as a settler is in one spot, the whole surrounding area is forbidden to Palestinians, for security reasons they claim.  The spot expands and a very wide area around that is also considered a security area forbidden to us, and that expands.  Then they build a wall to prevent us entering that area.  After building the wall they can expand the settlements further.</p> <p>  Two clear examples are Salfit in the north of the West Bank where Israel built many settlements up to 30 km inside the West Bank to take over control of major aquifers.  Then all the Palestine villages and communities were fragmented.  A trip from one village to another, to go to a hospital, a health centre or university which used to take five minutes has become 2.5 hours because people have to go around the settlements and the roads that they are not allowed to use.  Hebron is a much worse example.  Israel put 450 settlers there.  For their sake, Israel has imposed an apartheid system where 25,000 Palestinians are under Israeli military control and have become separated from the city of Hebron.  No fewer than 1,000 shops closed completely more than 15 years ago.  All major roads inside the city are closed and only Israeli settlers and the Israeli army can use them.  We the Palestinians cannot move on these roads inside Hebron city.</p> <p>  In 1994, one year after the Oslo agreement was signed, an Israeli medical doctor by the name of Baruch Goldstein entered the Ibrahimi Mosque while Palestinians were praying and started shooting them.  He killed 29 Palestinians while they were praying and injured many others.</p><p>This resulted in the closure of many streets in Hebron, the division of the Ibrahimi mosque and Palestinians being forbidden to use large parts of the mosque.  We were punished for that terrorist act that was committed by an Israeli settler.  The situation in Hebron is very dramatic.  The people who are living in Hebron cannot have a normal life because they are attacked frequently by settlers.  Students cannot go to schools because the army would harass them.  Settlers continually attack the Palestinian community in Hebron and Palestinians cannot respond because if they try to do so, the Israeli Army will arrest them, oppress them or shoot them, which happens frequently.  It is a very dark situation of severe discrimination, which on a human rights basis cannot be defended.</p><p> On the question of the peace process and what might be an alternative, the only alternative is an international conference with the participation of impartial parties and not one party that is biased to the Israeli side.  To be frank, we cannot achieve any result without changing the balance of power and the asymmetry between us and the Israelis.  We cannot remove the asymmetry between us and Israel because it has nuclear power.  We cannot have nuclear power.  Israel has the most powerful army not only in the Middle East but in the world.  We cannot balance that.  The only way to change the situation, in my opinion, is to adopt an alternative strategy with popular, non-violent, resistance, as was done very successfully in many actions, most recently in Jerusalem in July, by way of a strong boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign worldwide, similar to that used in South Africa against the system of apartheid.  One cannot balance the international support that Israel gets from the United States and many other countries without strong international support and power from another side.  We believe that boycott, divestment and sanctions, BDS, is the most powerful way to do this because it is peaceful and non-violent and it can create a material economic affect and, importantly, it can create an important model affect.</p><p> Many Jewish people realise that the apartheid system is very bad not only for Palestinians but for Jewish and Israeli people as well.  As I told soldiers many times when they arrested me, we are struggling not only for the freedom of Palestinians but also their freedom.  Israelis will never be free unless we are free.  This is why many young Jewish people are now joining the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign in the United States and participating in organisations in Jewish Voice for Peace, B'Tselem, Yesh Gvul, Gush Shalom and Women in Black.  Unfortunately, these groups represent a minority in Israel.  Inside Israel, the mainstream political parties, including the Likud Party and the Labour Party, are all adopting the policy of occupation.  The most recently elected leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Avi Gabbay, recently declared that he will not allow the removal of any settlement.  He also declared that the Israeli Army must remain active inside the occupied Palestinian territories even after the establishment of a Palestinian state.  When we have these positions, it becomes clear that the only way to change the political internal dynamic in Israel is to make occupation unprofitable.  As long as occupation is profitable and as long as Israel is allowed to be impunitive to international law, this bad situation will continue.  This is why we have to combine our work and struggle on the ground with international strong solidarity activities, as happened in the case of South Africa.</p><p> As we heard, Mr. Netanyahu is to speak in the European Parliament to foreign ministers, but to allow him to do so and not allow Palestinians do the same would be unequal, biased and unacceptable.  I hope that if he is allowed to speak, the foreign ministers of Europe will put specific questions to him, including why Israel does not identify its borders, why it continues its occupation, why it is creating a system of apartheid and why it continues to obstruct any effort to have a productive peace process.  A member asked if the United States has a representative in Ramallah.  We know that it does not have a representative to the Palestinian Authority but it does have an American consul general in Jerusalem.  Some countries that have consulates in east Jerusalem or Jerusalem in particular continue to represent their countries through the Palestinian side, including the United States, Sweden, Britain, France, Belgium and some other countries.  The consul general in Jerusalem is the United States representative to the Palestinian side.  Following on from that, I would like to inform the committee of a most unfortunate American act to close the PLO office in Washington.  That act, by itself, reflected how much influence the Israeli and Zionist lobby in the United States has in the American Administration.  That act also reflects how biased this American Administration is to the Israeli side.</p><p> On Palestinian resilience, we are very resilient and we are proud of that.  We have built institutions without permits from the Israeli side.  Along with some colleagues, I founded a fantastic health and medical organisation that helps poor people.  It serves 1.5 million every year.  We could not get a permit for it from Israel for 20 years and so we acted without permit and applied for and got a licence from the Palestinian Authority.  Seventeen universities were created.  This building of Palestinian institutions and educational structures and health care facilities is in itself in our philosophy an act of resistance.  In Palestine today, living there is an act of resistance.  Praying is an act of resistance.  Studying is an act of resistance.  Treating a patient is an act of resistance.  This is probably one of the most noble aspects of the Palestinian struggle.</p><p> Of course we would co-operate with Israeli civil society organisations but with one condition, namely, that they oppose occupation and the system of apartheid and support the right of the Palestinian people to be free.  On the apartheid report, I met Mr. Guterres during his last visit to Ramallah and I asked him why the report was removed from the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, ESCWA, site and his response was that while they do not disagree with the content of the report, it is a procedural matter.  I told him that I hoped he would not accept any pressure that would prevent the publication by the United Nations Human Rights Council of this very important report between December and February, which declares the names of 130 companies that are working illegally in illegal Israeli settlements.</p><p>That report, once published, should be the basis for an immediate big campaign to divest and boycott these companies that are participating in the violation of international law.  I do not know whether there is any Irish company there but we will see.</p></speech>

The Minister of State and his officials are very welcome.  </p><p>We are at a critical juncture in our overseas development programme.  In recent weeks the joint committee has had an opportunity to hear expert presentations by Irish Aid non-governmental organisations; the former permanent representative of Ireland to the United Nations, Mr. David Donoghue; representatives from academia and ambassadors of partner countries.  The committee's review is timely from the perspective of recent statements and commitments made by the Taoiseach and the Government on the doubling of Ireland's global footprint and increasing our overseas development aid.  It is also the case that two years have passed since agreement was reached on the targets set in the sustainable development goals.  As a committee, we must support and push the Government to ensure will Ireland meet all of its commitments by 2030.</p><p>The format of the meeting is that the Minister of State will make an opening statement, after which we will have a question and answer session with members.  I remind members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee room.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1006" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#N00300"><p>I say, "Good morning," to my Oireachtas colleagues and our guests in the Visitors Gallery.  I thank the joint committee for affording me this opportunity to discuss Ireland's policy on development co-operation.  In the first instance, I welcome the committee's initiative to review Ireland's policy on development co-operation.  As I am sure those members who visited Malawi and Mozambique earlier this month will have witnessed, this is work of which Irish people can be truly proud as it makes a substantial difference to people's lives.</p> <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, sends his apologies.  He is preparing to take Leaders' Questions in the D&aacute;il Chamber in a few minutes.  I am joined by a number of colleagues from the development co-operation division, namely, Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca, director general; Ms Nicola Brennan, head of the policy unit; and Ms Nicole McHugh, also from the policy unit.  All three of my officials have worked both in the field and headquarters.</p> <p>  The various hearings held by the joint committee have made manifest to all of us that our world is shrinking and growing in complexity.  Europe's immediate neighbours in the Middle East and north Africa and even Ukraine are troubled.  Four major famines in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and northern Nigeria are all the result of the failure of politics.  Significant population movements are under way, north and south, and there is instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar which I visited recently and elsewhere.  In the autumn we saw the devastating effects of climate events as hurricanes hit many Caribbean countries hard.  Drought is feeding conflict and famine.  In the midst of all of these challenges, poverty continues to blight the lives of too many people, not least in Ireland's partner countries in Africa and Asia.</p><p> Ireland is not unaffected by events elsewhere.  We saw, for example, the risk posed by the Ebola virus.  Containing the spread of that awful disease required an investment in health system strengthening in countries of origin.  We saw how Irish expertise and dedication, which members may have seen in the recent RT&Eacute; documentary "The Thin Green Line", was important in ensuring that there was a successful response to that crisis.  Irish Aid played its part.  It must continue to play a role in ensuring that the systems are in place to avoid similar crises in the future.  That was why I was pleased that my Department, together with the Department of Health and the World Health Organization, hosted the Global Forum on Human Resources for Health in Dublin earlier this month.  Over 1,000 delegates, including many at ministerial level, from across the world, representing both developing countries and those more advanced, were present.  A key element of their discussion was the interconnection between countries, how we can learn from each other and the importance of working together to address problems.</p><p> Working together with others to address problems is at the core of Ireland's approach to foreign policy.  It is why Ireland is committed to the multilateral system - a rules-based international system that is best placed to lead the response to the global challenges we face.  It is a system that has its imperfections just like any other.  This is why Ireland strongly support the UN Secretary General in his reform process.  It is also why Ireland has indicated that it is a candidate for a UN Security Council seat for 2021-2022.  Success in that election would allow Ireland to advocate for the core values of our foreign policy - peace and security, justice, equality and sustainability - at this important forum, with an emphasis on the development dimension in our approach to matters taken under consideration by the Security Council.  Our role at the UN in brokering the sustainable development goals, SDGs, is a very real and tangible demonstration of how Ireland makes a difference at the multilateral level.  The targets set by the SDGs - also known as Agenda 2030 - are ambitious and set a context for the future work of Irish Aid and Ireland's wider development assistance.  Ireland will take on various leadership positions within the UN family over the coming period, such as chairing the lead UN humanitarian donor group, chairing the Commission on the Status of Women and our membership of boards of UNICEF and the World Food Programme.  All these positions provide real opportunities to positively influence the international development agenda.  </p><p> Ireland's membership of the European Union allows us to work closely with other member states and with the European institutions to ensure the delivery of targeted and effective aid.  With like-minded states, Ireland has an influential role in Brussels regarding determining policy priorities and ensuring that global issues are addressed.  It involves issues such as emergency response where on our own, we are too small but where working through the EU allows us to make a real difference.  Of course, working with others requires some give and take.  That is where our influence, knowledge and experience makes the difference in ensuring that our voice is not just heard and respected but acted upon.  This is the judgment of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, which, in its most recent review of our development co-operation programme, noted Ireland's global leadership role on our priority issues, in particular hunger and nutrition.</p><p> I saw our influence at first hand last month when I visited Tanzania.  We have a very respected voice among the donor group - in part as we leverage our EU membership.  I saw also how our advocacy is heard by Tanzanian partners, including government.  Furthermore, I witnessed the real needs which too many people in Tanzania and elsewhere face.  I saw: hundreds of thousands of refugees with insufficient food rations; the logistical challenge of getting water uphill so that increasing numbers can drink and wash; children who may never return home getting schooled, sometimes under a tree because classrooms cannot be built quickly enough; and dedicated medical workers ensuring that care is given to those who need it working in very difficult conditions which require the creative use of scarce supplies.</p><p> These are challenges which Irish Aid, working with others, is helping to address through our long-term development programmes in partner countries, including Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zambia, and &ndash; outside Africa - in Vietnam.  I know that the Chairman and some committee members saw these challenges during their recent visit to Malawi and Mozambique.  However, although there are significant challenges, thankfully, there is also hope, which I am sure the Chairman and members also witnessed.  Real changes are being made in people's lives.  Tiny payments, as social security systems are being built up, allow people to start small businesses or keep their kids at school.  I saw children grasp the opportunity of education in Tanzania.  I saw extraordinary women who are the recipients of this social welfare support starting small businesses in their villages in order to help sustain their families and, indeed, the larger community.  We saw more and better teachers, better agricultural techniques, seeds, improved access to markets, the roll-out of health centres and improved capacity of health workers, some of whom have been trained in Ireland.  Ultimately, we are seeing small but incremental steps to improve the resilience of the most vulnerable.</p><p> I also saw the need to create jobs and build more sustainable economies.  For me, this is a very significant part of the challenge for the future, particularly for the African continent.  We met people involved in education in Tanzania who told us that 1 million more people enter the workforce every year.  Ethiopia, for example, needs to create 2 million jobs per year, every year.  This figure represents all the jobs in Ireland every year.  Kenya needs to create 1 million jobs per year, every year.  These are very significant challenges in terms of an emerging workforce, young people with huge ambitions for themselves, their communities and their country.  This will be a very significant challenge in terms of skills development and other issues in the future.  However, Ireland is helping address this need.  For example, Irish potato seed technology will transform the yield on Kenyan farms.  Such farms currently produce an average of seven tonnes of potatoes per hectare in a year compared to 70 tonnes in Ireland.  We are already seeing improved storage techniques being used to help farmers sell their potatoes months after harvest and to ensure a proper supply to processors and resellers elsewhere.  It is planned that greater yields will allow for investment in value addition and in creating many of those badly needed jobs.</p><p> Essential to our work are our partners, particularly the Irish NGOs with which Irish Aid works closely in many parts of the world.  I do not wish to single out any particular organisation because all our NGO partners bring real value.  Some are household names while others are small but with a singular and very effective focus.  Their contribution, often in difficult circumstances, to addressing humanitarian and development need is something important that Irish Aid supports.  Notwithstanding the challenging budgetary situation of the past few years, the percentage of Irish overseas development aid to NGOs remained at over 30% of all Irish assistance, which is very high by international standards in comparison with other donors.  Looking back, much of the path-finding for Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with development co-operation, and with Africa in particular, owes much to our missionaries who we continue to support through Misean Cara.  Their good work continues to make a positive difference in improving people's lives.</p><p> Looking ahead and with the budgetary situation becoming regularised, it is the Government's intention to grow Ireland's overseas development aid.  The Taoiseach has reiterated the intention to reach the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income by 2030.  Our effective, well-respected, development co-operation programme is an important component of Ireland's global footprint.  In growing our programme over the coming years, it will be important to ensure that it continues to be efficient and effective.  This committee's current work regarding Irish Aid is important because it will assist us in looking to future directions.</p><p> At present, Ireland's development co-operation priorities are as set out in the One World, One Future document published in May 2013.  That sets out three goals: reduced hunger and stronger resilience; sustainable development and inclusive economic growth; and better governance, human rights and accountability.  As we begin to think about future directions, we have decided to review One World, One Future with the intention of bringing forward a new White Paper on development co-operation in the middle of next year.</p><p> In advancing our thinking and ensuring that our development co-operation is fit for purpose for the next decade, it will be important that it remains grounded in who we are.  It should reflect us and our history, which includes our particular experiences of famine and migration - something that is still very much alive in our national memory.  It should allow us to project our present, which includes our experience within living memory of moving from poverty to relative wealth and from the subsistence agriculture of our grandparents to being one of the world's great food producers.  We need to preserve the strengths of our current approach, including our focus on vulnerability, nutrition and humanitarian response as part of our response to the SDGs.</p><p>We must make sure that we have the right people with the right skills in place to manage our programme not just prudently but effectively as we work to reduce poverty.  I am convinced that to do so is not just in the interest of our partners abroad, but in our own national interest.  Let us imagine a world where today's demographic bulge in Africa is a true demographic dividend, where those millions of jobs I mentioned earlier have been created in a context where the sustainable development goals have been realised.  That must be our ambition and we can help make that happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1009" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1313" speakername="Noel Grealish" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#P00200"><p>As I am speaking on Leaders' Questions I will have to leave early.  I congratulate Deputy Cannon on his appointment as Minister of State.  He referred in his speech to the delegation that recently visited two countries in Africa.  I was part of the delegation to Malawi and Mozambique.  I am sure Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and the Chairman will elaborate more on that.  The clerk travelled with us.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to our ambassadors in both countries and the staff they have in their office.  They do tremendous work.  I do not think 99% of the people in this country realise the tremendous work the ambassadors and their staff do abroad to promote projects.  We visited a number of projects.  The cash transfer was the one I found most impressive.  It involved only &euro;10 a month.  There is an old saying, give a little, it could help a lot, but by God it does.  We visited an irrigation programme where water is now provided.  A little co-op was set up and little business people run it.  They are feeding themselves and making a few bob in selling their produce.  I think approximately &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000 was invested but it is remarkable to see what it has done for a small village.  In Mozambique the Irish lead the education programme there.  They provide funding for other countries as well.  People work together and co-operate.  That is an excellent approach to having a scheme involving more countries.</p> <p>  When we met with the EU ambassador he was highly impressed with the Irish team in Malawi and the programmes that are in place.  He said that if the Irish office in Malawi had more staff it would give some funding to it to work on its programmes.  I am sure the Chairman and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan will elaborate on that also.  Perhaps that is something that should be explored further with the ambassador in Malawi.  It just shows how the Irish are viewed out there.  I must also mention the tremendous work of the missionaries there.</p> <p>  As I said at the ambassador's residence the night we were there, everybody in the Oireachtas should go to see what the Irish Aid programme does in Africa.  I know that might not be possible but if all Members went they would come back and fight to increase the aid.  One often hears people ask why we are giving money to help people abroad and that we should look after our own first.  People in Africa are human beings as well and they feel pain and hurt.  They suffer from starvation and death.  When we met the foreign affairs Minister in Malawi I asked what is the biggest challenge facing the African continent.  The Minister of State referred to it in his opening statement.  It is population growth.  The Minister of State referred to job creation.  Malawi has a population of 17 million and the projection is that it will be 40 million by 2030.  That is a major problem on the African continent and it will have to be addressed.  That is unsustainable.  The country is struggling to feed 17 million so how will it feed 40 million?  As has been said, Tanzania is not going to create 2 million jobs a year.  That is not possible.  I do not know what to do but I am a firm believer in education.  If one educates people that might be the way forward.  I wish the Minister of State the best of luck and congratulations on his appointment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1010" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#P00300"><p>It is good to see all the witnesses back here again and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon.  I fully agree with what Deputy Grealish said about our recent visit.  It was a very comprehensive and full-on visit.  We have amazing ambassadors in Gerry Cunningham and William Carlos.  I acknowledge them and their staff.  I also acknowledge their wives who play a role that is often not acknowledged at all.</p> <p>  The projects Deputy Grealish mentioned are very impressive.  I also wish to mention food and nutrition and what is being done in that regard with Irish support to ensure that babies, children and women were getting the right amount of nutrition.  It is great to see the provision of education and in particular girls going into education but it must be quality education.  It is not enough to just get the numbers in and to tick the boxes to say there are more people in education.  We must be really strong on the kind of education they are getting.</p> <p>  There is no doubt about the value of our bilateral aid but that brings us to questions about multilateral aid.  People have said it is important that we are part of the multilateral aid programmes but there is a need for rigorous monitoring and evaluation of the aid so that we know exactly where it is going.</p> <p>  We are a member of the Ireland-European development fund management committee.  That is not something we hear about yet we are a member of it.  What is happening in that regard?  Could the Minister of State also speak about the monitoring of the development co-operation budget?</p> <p>  Ireland and other countries are expressing concerns about the EU trust funds yet we are doubling the money we are giving.  There is no doubt about the difficult situation in Libya and concerns have been expressed but the funding is still going into a country that is dysfunctional.  It would appear that a lot of the money is going to the various groupings but they are militia groups as well.  There are genuine concerns over where the money is going.  Dreadful reports are coming out about slave markets.  At an informal meeting with another NGO this week the point was made that sometimes organisations come in and make one visit and they do not go back to follow up on the first visit when the funding was given to see where it is going.  It is not enough to express concern, we must be more proactive.</p> <p>  I acknowledge all the submissions we got from the various organisations.  One thing that came through to me was the importance of policy coherence.  Our decisions on climate change and tax must be complementary to our humanitarian budget because sometimes they are not.  I acknowledge in particular the submission on disability.  Perhaps we can put in a specific percentage requirement for disability funding for bilateral and multilateral aid to show we are conscious of people with a disability, both mental and physical.</p> <p>  We see an increasing military agenda in Europe.  It was great to see the recommendation on human rights and business but there was no mention of the arms and weapons industries and that was disappointing.</p> <p>  Because Irish Aid is so valued and respected, perhaps there is a need to look at extending to other countries.  This year I became chair of the Irish-Nepal friendship group.  I met a number of the Nepalese community in Ireland and their Irish supporters.  There is no doubt but they would love to be considered a partner country.  I do not know whether we could have mini partners as opposed to major partners but it would be very good to look at that.  Could the Minister of State also comment on our relationship with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNWRA, funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1011" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#P00400"><p>I thank Deputies Grealish and Maureen O'Sullivan for their kind words.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Grealish.  He paid significant tribute to the staff of our embassies.  My experience as a junior Minister in education from 2011 to 2014 working with the embassies, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA in trying to attract additional investment and students was exceptionally positive.  That positive experience of being a Minister of State in education has translated into my current role.</p><p>My recent visits to both Tanzania and South Africa have impressed upon me the absolute commitment and professionalism of all our people who work abroad.  They are ambassadors for Ireland and they do it in the most effective way possible.</p><p> I also found interesting the deliberate and wise recruitment of a significant number of local staff at our embassies.  These are extraordinary people who have so much to offer and, let us be frank, have a lot more skin in the game when it comes to furthering the aims of their communities.  They derive huge pride from being recognised by our embassies and people abroad as being the very best that can be recruited in the region.  It is wonderful to see the deep professional relationships being developed by Irish embassy staff, our people here in Dublin and Limerick and those local staff abroad.  Not alone in terms of international development but in terms of the future relationships that will exist between our two countries, developing those relationships now with our local staff will serve Ireland to a positive extent in the future.</p><p> The Deputy also spoke about the impact of social welfare supports.  During my visit to Tanzania, that was one of the messages I brought home.  Ireland supports the TASAF programme, which is being implemented by the Tanzanian Government and is targeting the million poorest families in the country.  As the Deputy said, for somewhere between &euro;8 and &euro;10 a month, which we would describe as an insignificant amount of money, this is making a real difference to the lives of people.  What is really smart is that all the money is being channelled through the women in those Tanzanian households.  It empowers women.  There is a deep and innate entrepreneurial thing going on in Africa.  By their nature, Africans are entrepreneurial people.  Many of the women we met were starting small communities in their communities.  They are the fundamental decision makers in the household in terms of their children's education and family's health, so to target that money and channel it through them is wise.</p><p> Deputy Grealish and Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about increasing our footprint, that is, our staff complement, on the ground in Africa.  I agree that we should be considering it in the context of the discussions at this committee over the next number of months in preparation for the publication of the White Paper and moving towards our 0.7% goal in 2030.  The Taoiseach speaks regularly about doubling the Irish footprint but we need to move beyond what seems to date to be the traditional understanding of that footprint.  It is not alone about establishing a network of embassies and consulates around the world but about building on the strong relationships we have already developed, particularly on the African continent.  Perhaps it means the recruitment of more local staff into those embassies across the African continent.  It needs to be considered in terms of the overall ambition and moving towards the 0.7% target.  Looking at our staff complement in these countries must be a critical part of it.</p><p> The Deputy spoke about the huge challenges around population growth and education.  Education will play a vital role in addressing that population growth on the one hand while, on the other, empowering, for example, the 1 million Tanzanian young people emerging into the workforce.  We need to look at the significant experience this country has garnered through F&Aacute;S and Solas in upskilling our own people.  There is some ongoing collaboration deriving from the lessons we have learned in Ireland and how we gave a whole generation of Irish young people the skills to partake in the extraordinary economic growth we have seen over the past 50 or 60 years.  I believe that those who are in their late teens, 20s and 30s in Africa are about to embark on that same journey.</p><p> When I was in Pretoria a number of weeks ago, I met the South Africa Gaels.  This is a new Gaelic football club which has been set up by an extraordinary Irishman out there.  We met seven or eight of these young African men and women, predominantly aged 18 to 22, one evening at a reception organised by the ambassador.  Four of them came over to me but not to talk about Gaelic football.  Frankly, they would have gotten a very strange response if they did because I know nothing about Gaelic football.  Hurling I could have talked about.  However, consistently and individually they asked me about education.  That was the recurring theme for these young people: "How can you help me to be educated?"  We need to keep that focus in mind.  We have an extraordinary track record in terms of our footprint in Africa in education.  If we build on that, we will play a significant role in helping them to address those challenges in the future. </p><p> I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan, who echoed the sentiments of Deputy Grealish, in praising the work of the ambassadors and their wives.  As she remarked, they have a significant role to play in the daily life of our embassies and consulates around the world.</p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan also asked about education which I will address first.  I agree wholeheartedly with her that there has to be a huge focus on the importance of education.  In terms of TASAF, one of the key positive outcomes of that social welfare intervention has been greater access to education by the million poorest families in Tanzania . We need to keep focusing on improving access to education for marginalised groups while also seeking to address the quality of education so that there is a consistent quality across that education provision, particularly in the areas of numeracy and literacy, when children access education for the first time.</p><p> We also have a great track record in our continuing focus on girls' education beyond primary level.  In terms the cultural shifts that are required in these countries to eliminate gender violence and empower women to take up their role in society, enterprise and economy, getting them from primary school and all the way through second level education is critical.  We have a huge amount of experience in this country of ensuring that educational opportunities at second level and in further education and training respond directly to the needs of the labour market.  In Solas we have an expert entity in doing exactly that and we have a lot of knowledge and experience to share. </p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan also spoke about the EU trust fund to Africa and expressed concerns about it.  This trust fund for stability is addressing the root causes of irregular migration and the displacement of persons in Africa.  While we have an emergency humanitarian response to the eventual migration occurring daily, we will never solve the problem unless we examine the underlying root causes.  The trust fund is being used to support stability in the north east region of Africa - the Sahel region and Lake Chad area.  It is contributing to tackling the root cause of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration.</p><p> To date we have disbursed &euro;1.2 million, which has been predominantly earmarked for the Horn of Africa.  We are considering economic programmes to create employment opportunities in these regions so that the root cause of young men and women leaving is addressed and employment opportunities are presented to them in their own countries.  We are also examining how to address resilience to support basic services for local populations.  Again, we are addressing the most vulnerable refugees and displaced persons.  We are investigating migration management to prevent irregular migration, fight human trafficking and providing for effective return and readmission.</p><p> I visited the refugee camp in Nduta in north west Tanzania where there are 125,000 refugees from Burundi.  I wanted to see, in particular, the repatriation and return element of the programme working.  We visited that part of the camp where we saw an effective return and repatriation process in place.  First, it was determined that each individual was going back of his or her own volition.   This had to be made very clear.  There was then a programme of support in terms of food, clothing, transport and all the other issues that might arise.  The contribution we are making to that trust fund is helping to do that in each particular area.</p><p> The Deputy also spoke about doubling the footprint and examining other opportunities.  I agree.  As well as assuming that doubling our footprint internationally will bring significant economic benefits to Ireland in the future, we also have to consider the strong track record of Irish Aid in our international development work overseas.</p><p>One must include the Irish Aid element in any discussion of "doubling Ireland's footprint".  The relationships we are building with certain countries, such as that of which I saw evidence on a recent visit to South Africa, and our long track record in supporting the most vulnerable there are beginning to pay dividends in terms of very strong trade relationships developing between those countries and Ireland.  For example, there is &euro;1.5 billion of trade annually between South Africa and Ireland.  As such counties inevitably make their way toward economic resilience and ultimate economic growth, our relationships with them over the past 50 or 60 years will begin to bear dividends.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1014" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017113000002#R00200"><p>I apologise for being slightly delayed in getting to this session.  I commend the work being done by the Department, Irish Aid and all our embassies and consular staff across the world because Irish Aid is a pillar of Irish foreign policy.  The credibility of our commitments, in particular in respect of overseas development aid, is crucially important because they are public commitments and it is, therefore, the responsibility of the Government and Oireachtas to follow through on them.</p> <p>  I wish to specifically discuss the commitment of 0.7% of gross national income, GNI, to which the Minister of State referred.  He stated that the Taoiseach recently reiterated a commitment to reach the UN target of 0.7% of gross national income by 2030, which was mentioned last year by the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy McHugh, and then moved off the stage and not mentioned for some time.  It is important that those commitments be given but there must then be movement towards meeting them, as has been discussed across party at this committee.  My belief as spokesperson on foreign affairs and trade, and that of my party, is that it must be done on a cross-party and multi-annual basis.  It will not be achieved if we keep dealing with it on an annual basis and there is no point repeating that it will.  In terms of the challenge facing Ireland in that regard, &euro;707 million or 0.3% of GNI was allocated to official development aid, ODA, in 2017.  Allowing for recognised growth rates, an increase of approximately &euro;400 million will be required, bringing the total to &euro;1.1 billion, if we are to reach 0.4% by 2022.  However, to reach 0.7% by 2030 would require Ireland to pay &euro;2.459 billion.  I want us to get to 0.7% but we will have to pay that amount to so do and unless a big initial leap is made in the budget of this Government or the next, as was done in Britain, that will not be possible.  A significant jump of approximately &euro;200 million per annum up to 2020 would be required to get to 0.35% and then 0.4% thereafter.  I recently tabled questions to the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on this issue which were answered by the Minister of State.  Members know how that target can be attained but I ask in the context of this discussion and the review of Irish Aid that the Government begin addressing the issue on a multi-annual basis.  The Minister of State will have a partner in my party in that regard.   The coming three years should be planned for and each of the political parties and Independents allowed to have an input.  I propose that be done through the Committee on Budgetary Oversight as the Government will be submitting its plans to it.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, Fine Gael and the Independents could agree that a pot of money is available and discuss whether an extra &euro;200 million should be committed to official development aid.  That must be done.  There is no point in the Taoiseach or his successor saying we want and are going to hit 0.7% unless there is movement towards achieving that.   I do not mean that in any disrespectful way.  In the context of the current review of Irish Aid, I ask the Minister of State to make a policy decision that Irish Aid funding be allocated on an initial three-year cycle with a target of 0.35% by 2020 and state how that will be done and what money will be needed.  A target of 0.4% by 2022 can then be set and how that will be achieved can be set out.  The Minister of State understands my point.  That must be done or there is no point discussing the target.  The work being done is not being undermined but the credibility of our international commitments is very important in terms of issues such as seeking a seat on the UN Security Council.  The Minister of State is aware of that as he is currently responsible for such matters.  We have to see that through.</p> <p>  My final point regards the definition of overseas development aid and a possible change in that regard.  We should keep the current definition but include expenditure for in-country refugee costs, peacekeeping and so on.  I completely agree with the points made by the Vice Chair, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, regarding oversight of multilateral aid programmes.  There is a need for such programmes but we do not have enough oversight.  As a Deputy and spokesperson for my party on this area, I could not get a commitment or clarity that none of the money we contribute to the EU-Turkey arrangement was being used for security purposes such as barriers and so on instead of solely for refugee and aid assistance.  The Minister of State understands my point.  We need to define official development aid and prevent money being taken out of the ODA pot if, for example, &euro;30 million is needed to provide assistance for a catastrophe.</p> <p>  If we are to reach the 0.7% target, we should deal with it as a programme.  We have the best of programmes running and the best of people responsible for them but if that target is a cornerstone of our foreign policy, as I believe it to be, we must start moving toward it.</p></speech>

Through our action and inaction in that regard, we are complicit in the events taking place there.  We need to seriously consider current Government policy in respect of that part of the world.</p> <p>  Before the Minister of State arrived, evidence was given to the committee by witnesses from Palestine and the awful situation of the Palestinian people as a result of the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine was discussed.  References were made to Israel being an apartheid state and its continued human rights and international law violations.  The view of some committee members is that the Government and Irish people must hold Israel to account and seriously consider banning the importation of goods from illegal colonial settlements and placing sanctions on Israel and its apartheid system.  </p> <p>  Millions of euro worth of aid sent to Palestine, much of it paid for by the European Commission which is funded by EU member states, including Ireland, has been destroyed by Israel.  The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor estimates the total value of EU aid squandered by Israeli actions at &euro;65 million between 2001 and 2015, inclusive, with at least &euro;23 million destroyed during the Israeli assault on Gaza in 2014.  What action is the Government taking to recover some of that funding?  What is being done to try to get from Israel money to compensate for some of the damage it caused to property funded by Irish and European aid?</p> <p>  NGOs, many of which are funded by Irish Aid, are under pressure in some countries.  Israel has put pressure on certain NGOs and others are under pressure in Turkey, among other places.</p><p>What additional supports can the Irish Government give to NGOs, which will need increased support in various parts of the world?  The head of Amnesty International Turkey was arrested, for example.  I agree with my colleagues on the multilateral spending on EU aid.  Many of us have raised our concern that increasingly the focus has been moving away from bilateral spending and shifting more towards multilateral spending.  Some of the contributors this morning talked about their recent trip to Malawi and so on.  There should be some sort of reporting mechanism for the groups that come back.  Is there any formal structure for that?  I was on one trip and I saw the result of multilateral spending on a factory to make sunflower oil.  There was a factory and machinery but there was no electricity or sunflowers growing in the area.  That was just one example of something that is gone wrong within the system.  I would not have seen it unless I went to it.  I would not have been aware of it and I would not have been able to ask questions.  There needs to be some sort of structure in which we can give feedback on some of these issues.  There are concerns about how transparent the funding is.  I presume I will get a response saying there are all sorts of committees that will look at it.  I am more concerned about what committee in this Parliament looks at ODA funding through EU institutions.  Perhaps I am wrong, but I do not think we have ever had anyone into the committee to tell us where the funding is being spent.  There needs to be a structure, whether it is through the finance committee or someone else.  Clearly this committee is not doing it or at least not to the extent that I could go out and tell the public I am fully satisfied as to where all the funding is going because in many cases I do not know.  I am appealing today that as part of the reform, a structure be established to make it work in order that we are able to tell our constituents where the money is going and that we are confident it is being spent in the right area.  Could the Minister of State clarify, with regard to the EU institutions, how the money is being spent?  Can the Department write to us and engage with the committee to tell us how and where the money is spent and, more importantly, come up with solutions for the best way to do that? </p><p> There was talk of the least developed countries, LDCs, to the effect that the funding should be focused on places where there is the greatest degree of hunger, fragility and insecurity.  I agree with my colleagues.  There needs to be some sort of plan for the UN target of spending 0.15% of GNI on overseas development.  There needs to be some sort of plan, whether it is the three-year plan being talked about or another one.  If there is a plan, I am not aware of it, as an Opposition spokesperson.  We need to work together on how that is to be done.</p><p> The Minister of State touched on climate change.  New figures from the Environmental Protection Agency show greenhouses gas emissions in Ireland increased by 3.5%.  This is despite commitments to reduce carbon emissions by 20% by 2020.  The State could face fines of &euro;450 million in 2020 for missing its legally binding targets.  Will the Government redouble its efforts to tackle climate change at home and abroad?  Have we plans to increase the number of key partner countries?  Increasing the footprint has been mentioned.  Does the Minister of State have any news on that?</p></speech>

My short contribution, because I do not want to repeat what has been said already, will be on the overseas development aid and all the targets, such as the one of 0.7%.  The committee has just heard from Deputy Crowe about what can happen when we get hung up with targets and find empty factories being built just as a contribution is being made.  Only that Deputy Crowe was there nobody would ever have known about this empty factory.  As a small country with a proud record of work in overseas development, particularly by the religious orders that did a tremendous amount of work in development and teaching, a price cannot be put on that sort of work.  We get hung up on figures to show the target of 0.6% or 0.5% has been met.  If the money is being wasted in certain areas and other areas are being left short, surely it is time we target exactly what we mean by overseas development aid.  As a small country, it is important we narrow it down to certain targets and concentrate on our money going into those areas and not being spread for the sake of reaching a target and throwing money at it.</p> <p>  The reality is we have a load of young, educated, committed people in this country today who can replace the religious orders that went before.  Unfortunately the religious orders, whether Catholic or Protestant, are not in a position to supply the sort of personnel that was there before.  One of the jobs the committee could do in overseeing overseas development aid is to investigate to develop a system where bright young people from this country could be targeted to go and do certain types of work that we would regard as overseas development aid.  It could be in the areas of looking after the health of people or teaching, for example, but the most important thing is to target where our money is going.  I am old enough to remember when one had to pay to go to secondary school.  Unless one's parents had enough money one did not go to secondary school, one went down to the local tech.  I am 73 years of age now.  I lived through that.  Parents made a huge contribution by saving and going without to send people to secondary school because we did not have free education.</p><p>Let us imagine the position those countries would be in if they had targeted free education, and the people to administer, teach, and build up that sort of resource.  I think much of our energy and resources, although not only money, should go into supplying that type of assistance.  I am absolutely certain that if a proper scheme was developed, it would attract young people to serve abroad for certain periods in certain areas, whether in medicine, teaching, or whatever, and that would be part of meeting our commitment to contribute 0.7% of gross national product.  It is time we asked if we are getting the best out of our buck.  We must ensure that we do not have the empty factories Deputy Crowe spoke about.</p><p> I would like to hear the Minister of State's views on this.  It would take a bit of work, and it has to be driven by Government.  This has to be ongoing.  If there is a change of Government, it should not interfere.  The programme should continue on irrespective of who is in government.  That will be part our 0.7% contribution.  As a small country, we should genuinely review that whole area.</p></speech>

It was my first visit to that part of Africa, and it was a real learning curve to see the levels of deprivation, poverty and hunger, and the desire of people to get a better way of life.  The hunger for education among the most impoverished people was one thing that struck me.  We saw the very inadequate health centres, and the difficult circumstances in which so many people are working.  Again, the message given to us by representatives and ambassadors from other countries, and indeed people who had no connection with Ireland, was one of appreciation for the great work and the impact of Irish Aid.  The EU ambassador felt very strongly about the great benefits that the work of Irish Aid has brought, and continues to bring, to so many people.</p> <p>  Deputy Barrett and other colleagues mentioned the role of the religious missionaries over the years.  We met with some who were there all their lives.  These people are literally in their 70s and are still ministering and working away in the most deprived areas.  It was great to hear local people and representatives of other countries refer to the outstanding work that those people have done over many decades, and continue to do.  As Deputy Barrett said, the numbers there reflect favourably on many religious denominations.</p> <p>  My colleagues, Deputies Grealish and O'Sullivan, referred to the areas of education, health and poverty.  I am very glad that Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned that, per the D&oacute;chas submission, the need of the people with disabilities as well needs to be advanced.  That is very much the case.  It has to be a particular focus.</p> <p>  In his introductory remarks, the Minister of State mentioned Irish potato seed technology.  This has the potential to improve yields, and has already done so.  Improving yields and productivity naturally brings increased incomes to the farmers.  It improves their living standards, and very importantly, if those people have any surplus income, it is put away to pay for second level school fees.</p> <p>  We have the potential to be more actively engaged in knowledge transfer in the farming and agrifood sector.  I mentioned previously to the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and to the Minister of State's departmental colleagues who are here today that we should be harnessing the potential of the private sector to engage in knowledge transfer to a greater extent.  I know that some work is under way.  I believe there is huge potential there.  Many Irish companies started off as small indigenous enterprises, such as a creamery employing two people, and they are now international corporations.  I am sure that there is good work going on between them and Irish Aid.  However, that could be ratcheted up much more.</p> <p>  Deputy Barrett spoke about targeting young people to replace the missionaries who are no longer there.  There is a cohort of people who are active but retired.  Consider the people in the advisory and education service within the agrifood sector who are retired.  Some of them were State employees and were employed by Teagasc, the universities and the agriculture colleges.  There are also many people who carry out advisory and education work with the co-operatives and in the private sector.  There is a wealth of knowledge there.  It should be tapped, if only by having those people visit recipient countries for a short time or involving them in online education.  I know that the latter option is not that simple in the countries in question because people do not have access to technology.  The area could be dramatically improved.  The Government should target those people who have the knowledge and experience, and who are still thankfully in good health and are fit to impart it in order to improve the lot of aid recipients farming very small acreage. </p> <p>  Knowledge transfer is needed, whether in animal husbandry or crop husbandry.  In Malawi we saw the dramatic effects of knowledge transfer for potato growers.  It helps ensure that the most nutritious crop varieties, particularly for feeding children, are developed.  I represent two counties, Cavan and Monaghan, that have very large agrifood industries.  The farmers there work difficult terrain such as drumlin soil.  Growing up on a small farm, I remember that the farming community was always anxious to learn.  They went on field walks.  The co-operatives ran competitions to improve grass and silage production, cattle breeding and the fulfilment of the dietary requirements of animals.  These efforts were all aimed at getting better yields and better production to improve the income of farmers.  We were doing that throughout this country.  I am familiar with it in my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, having grown up on a small farm.</p> <p>  We are discussing parts of Africa that are many decades behind our level of development, but we should be targeting knowledge transfer.  It is also very cost-effective.  We would empower people, deal with their nutritional requirements, as well as generate income for them.  It would be so powerful in so many respects.  As Deputy Barrett said, we can all help to get the message across that people could contribute in a very positive way to improving the lot of the most disadvantaged people in the world.</p> <p>  People often ask us how we spread the message that very valuable work is being done by Irish Aid.  Deputy Grealish referred to that.  None of us does it enough, because most of us have not experienced it first hand.  If people have ownership of a project, they identify with it more.  Maybe if companies in the agrifood sector from particular parts of the country entered into partnerships with particular countries in Africa, that could bring a sense of community ownership to the project.  It might even help to create a better appreciation of the needs of those people in the most disadvantaged areas, the good work that is being done, and the great return on very small funding.  The Irish people are generous.  They respond to the appeals for help in the different crises that arise throughout the world.  However, we need to constantly get the message across about the good work that is being done on a daily basis.  We were privileged to meet many young people working with the different NGOs, in the countries we visited.</p><p>I understand Deputy O'Sullivan has a final question before I invite the Minister of State to make his concluding remarks.</p></speech>

It is apparent from each of their contributions that they feel passionately about this subject.  I agree completely with Deputy O'Brien's suggestion that the only way this will ultimately work is in collaboration.  Members of all parties and Independents need to come together to form a collective view on how to move this in the right direction.  We need to move towards a significant and greater contribution from the Irish people to overseas development aid.  As Deputy Barrett has pointed out, we need to acknowledge that this contribution can come in many shapes and forms.  As we seek to make a significant additional contribution, we need to have substantial ongoing scrutiny and oversight of every cent that is spent.  We also need to ensure the money that is spent has a real, legitimate and tangible impact on the lives of people in difficult environments.</p> <p>  Like the members of the committee, my experience to date of travelling overseas has been nothing other than positive in this regard.  When I spoke to women in north-west Tanzania who get TASAF payments of &euro;6 a month, I saw the extraordinary impact such payments are having on their families.  I travelled to a refugee camp of 125,000 people where children are being educated under trees and noted the presence of the Irish Aid logo at the bottom of a display board outside a new school that is being built 500 m away.  I visited a water purification plant that is supplying water to 132,000 people in the refugee camp.  I saw the Irish Aid logo and knew that our taxpayers' money and, ultimately, our people are having an impact in this area.</p> <p>  I agree with the remarks of all speakers about the need to make people more aware of the impact of our investment and our people on the ground in these locations.  I am trying to do exactly that, predominantly through the use of social media and video.  I will continue to do so.  Members have done a very good job of using social media in this context.  I suggest we need to use this tool to a far greater extent to tell very important stories about the impact of our people and our money in these locations.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy O'Brien that aiming towards 0.7% in 2030 is a laudable aim.  It will involve almost &euro;2.5 billion, which is a very significant amount of money.  I support the Deputy's suggestion that it should be done on an incremental basis.  This should certainly be explored in the White Paper.  I agree that the supplemental three-year increment needs to be looked at because 2030 is a long time away.  If we do not make definitive incremental increases in what we provide over the intervening years, we will be going nowhere.  This measure should be explored over the coming months as part of the White Paper process.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how exactly we define overseas development aid.  He wanted to know how we ensure there is no encroachment into the very pure definition of overseas development aid.  I think such encroachment is unlikely to happen.  In all of our discussions about the definition of overseas development aid, our overarching position has been that there is a need to maintain the integrity of overseas development aid as a concept with a distinct focus on development and poverty reduction.  That should remain our focus and will remain our focus during the White Paper process.  We believe that as the definition is strengthened, there should be a focus on benefitting recipients and targeting the poorest countries.</p> <p>  Deputies O'Brien and Barrett mentioned the issue of oversight, on which we need to focus relentlessly.  If the Irish aid programme is to retain the strong credibility it has acquired nationally and internationally, we need to continue to focus on oversight.  If possible, we should bring a greater degree of transparency to how our funds are spend and to the oversight associated with such expenditure.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe spoke about transparency and oversight in the context of the EU.  I want to refer specifically to our engagement with the EU because a significant portion of our development budget is channelled through it.  Our engagement with an entity of the size of the EU allows us to amplify the impact of our response to all the significant challenges that are arising internationally.  EU member states and the European Court of Auditors have generally been positive about the ongoing scrutiny of the EU's overall overseas development aid budget.  As the EU's external auditor, the European Court of Auditors acts as an independent guardian of all the financial interests of the citizens of the Union.  It checks that EU funds, including those spent on development, are correctly accounted for and spent in compliance with the relevant rules and legislation.</p> <p>  As we know, the UK is not a serious fan of the EU.  I would argue that it has never been, to be frank.  A review of the UK's multilateral engagement placed the European Development Fund in the top tier of its multilateral development partners and highlighted the fund's positive role in the achievements of poverty reduction and better governance.  The UK's own scrutiny of its commitment to EU overseas development aid concluded that this money was well spent.</p> <p>  We are working with the EU and the UN to address the complex situation in the Middle East and Palestine.  Our voice is amplified through the EU in putting pressure on Governments to address the many ongoing human rights violations in that region.  I would add, based on my experience of visiting Myanmar two weeks ago, that it is only by aligning ourselves with the EU, the UN, the ICRC and other organisations that we can amplify our voice in expressing our very significant concerns about the human rights violations that are occurring in many locations throughout the world.  I remind the committee that the UN brought in Kofi Annan to design and recommend a response to the issues in Myanmar.  I would argue that having the might and the heft of the UN behind that initiative was a significant factor in pressurising the Myanmar Government to respond in a meaningful way.  I hope that will be the case.  The solution we must find as we seek to bring about a positive result to all the significant challenges we face in this regard does not involve Ireland or any other country speaking on its own on issues like this as a lone voice in the wilderness.</p> <p>  The Deputy quite rightly pointed out that the situation in Libya is very challenging.  Ireland is not currently giving any direct support to Libya.  Conditions on the ground are disturbing.  We are working with our partners, including the ICRC, the UN and civil society organisations, to make sure real needs are being addressed on the ground and to give people the best possible supports and responses in the context of the difficult circumstances they are facing.</p> <p>  Deputy Barrett mentioned that our missionaries have had an incredible track record of working with communities across the whole of Africa over many decades and rightly pointed out that this footprint is diminishing.  We have an opportunity to fill that void and vacuum with young Irish people who are determined to contribute to the elimination of poverty across the world.  It is difficult to understand how we can quantify that in the context of our ambition to move towards the 0.7% aid target.  Perhaps we need to have that conversation as part of the preparation for the White Paper.  The Deputy referred to the significant and beneficial impact of Donogh O'Malley's groundbreaking decision in the 1960s to make secondary education free to everyone and to the lessons we learned from that.</p><p>I take his point about capacity building in Africa and working with African governments to share our experience of that journey, from a time when my father could not afford to go to second level school to a point when we have the highest level of third level participation in the whole of the EU.  That has been an incredible journey over just two generations.  We have a lot to share in that regard.</p><p> The point being made was that we can only throw money at a problem for so long without addressing the underlying issues as to why poverty is arising in the first place, and as to why sufficient and high quality educational opportunities are not available to young people in these countries.  That 0.7% has never been, and should not be, about simply movements of money to other locations.  It is about working with governments in capacity building in education, agriculture, science and technology, which ultimately will empower them to move beyond a time when they need what we describe as traditional overseas development aid supports.</p><p> The Chairman spoke about the impact of the visit on him at a personal level, and that is something with which I can empathise.  Tanzania was my first time setting foot on the African Continent.  In terms of my emotions, I oscillated the whole time between having incredible hope for the future from having met Tanzanian young people, as they were really bright and ambitious and determined to make the very best of their own lives for their communities and country, and then looking at the incredible challenges they face.  Many of these challenges are with regard to poor governmental practices and poor politics, and we are working on capacity building with other governments.  We need to make people more aware of our commitment and the impact Irish Aid is having.</p><p> It is correct that agriculture is a no-brainer, in terms of working with organisations such as Teagasc.  The private sector was mentioned.  We recently launched a programme between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in terms of supporting and funding Irish agrifood companies to establish a presence on the African Continent.  Many exciting things are bound to happen there.  Teagasc is a knowledge base that we need to share significantly.</p><p> With regard to twining communities, Fingal County Council has a significant relationship with Lesotho, and Athenry, from where I come, has formed a relationship with a village in Kenya called Siminjaro, and through fundraising in Athenry a school and hospital have been built over the past decade.

On behalf of the committee, I thank them for their attendance today.  The format of the meeting is that the witnesses will be invited to make a brief opening statement, to be followed by a question and answer session.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw the attention of witnesses to the position in relation to privilege.  I ask the witnesses to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system, which makes it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and has an adverse effect on television coverage and webstreaming.  I advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statement they make to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  I now invite Ms O'Connor to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Dr. Philip Dodd, Mr. Liam Hennessy, Mr. Jim Ryan and Ms Yvonne O'Neill, all of whom work in the mental health division.  Members will have received a separate briefing document which sets out the details of the implementation to date of A Vision for Change and other service improvements that are currently under way.  The document sets out in detail the progress made in respect of each of the relevant 209 recommendations.  Other briefing documents that were supplied to the committee last week set out details of the governance of mental health services and provided an overview of the 2017 budget.  Other reports that are available to the committee were published as part of the HSE annual planning and performance cycle.</p> <p>  The report of the mental health policy expert group, A Vision for Change, was published in 2006 and subsequently adopted as Government policy.  This progressive, evidence-based policy document proposed a new model of service delivery which would be centred on the service user, flexible and community-based.  It has contributed significantly to the development of mental health services in recent years by providing a policy and rationale for the delivery of standardised services.  The implementation of A Vision for Change was initially constrained by the lack of the recommended investment in the post-publication recessionary years.  While consistent investment has been made available since 2012 through programme for Government funding, the inability to recruit some key clinical staff due to early retirement options for nurses and international competition for some specialist consultant staff has frustrated efforts to improve services at a faster rate.  The summary points I am making are detailed in the separate briefing document that has been provided.</p> <p>  The implementation of A Vision for Change initially focused on the core building blocks underpinning mental health services, including the reconfiguration of community mental health teams within recommended population catchment areas.  The level of whole-time equivalent staffing recommended in A Vision for Change, adjusted for the latest 2016 population, is 12,354.  The actual staffing level last month was 9,767, which represents almost 80% delivery of the recommendation in A Vision for Change.  General adult mental health teams are now based on populations of 50,000.  Nationally, we have reached 76% of the staffing levels recommended in A Vision for Change.  In addition, we have put in place 69 of the 79 recommended child and adolescent mental health teams and 30 of the 48 recommended psychiatry of later life teams.  There are insufficient staffing numbers in some of these teams, resulting in 56% achievement of the recommended staffing levels for child and adolescent mental health teams and nearly 61% delivery of the recommended staffing levels for psychiatry of later life.  We continue to use development funding to increase the staffing levels on existing teams or to create new teams, while also implementing recommendations on other specialist teams including mental health, intellectual disability and rehabilitation.  All of this is outlined in detail in the briefing document that has been submitted.</p><p> A Vision for Change describes a framework for developing and promoting positive mental health, including suicide prevention, across the entire community.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention, established shortly after the publication of the policy, has driven the strategic direction for suicide prevention.  Initiatives to date include the appointment of suicide resource officers in local communities, suicide crisis assessment nurses in general practice, funding of agencies for direct counselling and support services and more recently through Connecting for Life, the commitment to interagency working and the development of local suicide prevention implementation plans.  Additionally, the development of the self-harm clinical programme and the appointment of nurses in emergency departments nationally to deal with cases of self-harm has been progressed.</p><p> A Vision for Change places significant emphasis on the need to involve service users and their supporters at every level of service provision.  Within the mental health division, we have developed a national office dedicated to engagement with service users and their families and increased mental health engagement capacity within the nine community health care organisations.  We have developed a national recovery framework to ensure that a recovery ethos underpins all service delivery.  In 2017, we employed peer support workers in our services for the first time.</p><p> The policy recognises that most mental health treatment and care is delivered in primary care settings.  Specific initiatives to date include the development of the counselling in primary care service and national counselling service, the funding of over 100 assistant psychology posts to expand psychological interventions to children and the funding of innovative youth-friendly mental health organisations like Jigsaw.  The policy also recommended that community mental health teams should offer multi-disciplinary, home-based and assertive outreach care and a comprehensive range of medical, psychological and social therapies across the lifespan.  Recent initiatives here include the development of seven day mental health services, the funding of home-based treatment teams and assertive outreach teams, the provision of modern evidence-based therapeutic programmes and the development and implementation of the early intervention psychosis clinical programme.</p><p> A Vision for Change sets out recommendations for best practice in the delivery of recovery and rehabilitation services for people with severe and enduring mental illness and other significant needs such as forensic mental health, homelessness, substance misuse and eating disorders.  Initiatives here to date have included development of specialist rehabilitation services, mental health services for people who are homeless, the clinical care programme for eating disorders and the deployment of forensic mental health teams in all prisons.</p><p> Significant capital development has taken place since the publication of the policy.  Over recent years, new units have been built for children in Dublin, Galway and Cork.  Adult units have been developed in a number of locations, including Cork, Drogheda, Limerick, Galway and Killarney.  The refurbishment of many units across the country has also been provided for and construction work has now commenced on the new national forensic mental health facility in Portrane which will provide 170 forensic beds including forensic child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and forensic mental health intellectual disability, MHID, services.  Notwithstanding these developments, it is estimated that in excess of &euro;500 million in additional funding is required to meet all future mental health infrastructure requirements.</p><p> Since the publication of A Vision for Change, the mental health division has also responded to a variety of emerging wider mental health issues including the development of appropriate perinatal mental health services, the development of a clinical programme for ADHD in adults and other initiatives.  Additionally, since the establishment of the division in 2013, there has been an emphasis on improving services using a programmatic approach to ensure implementation of sustainable change designed to modernise mental health services, including over 25 service improvement projects.</p><p> A Vision for Change has been a valuable policy guiding the continued development of and investment in mental health services.  Consideration now needs to be given to adapting the approach taken to date to support integration and the implementation of more recent policies.  The HSE looks forward to contributing to the review of A Vision for Change, recently initiated by the Department of Health, and also to maximising the opportunities identified in Sl&aacute;intecare for responding to mental health needs as part of a wider societal and whole-of-Government approach to health.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1047" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1279" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017113000002#D00300"><p>I echo the Chairman's words and I thank the witnesses for their work.  It is much appreciated.  The more information we have, the more we can work on.  I have a number of questions I will open to all the witnesses.  My first question has been partly answered but I will put it to the witnesses.  What are the key reasons for the difficulty in recruitment and retention of mental health staff across the country?  How can such challenges be addressed and what measures need to be put in place?  One of the briefing documents that we received earlier deals with some of it but it has me slightly confused.  It states that funding provided to mental health is ring-fenced for mental health, yet on the next line it states money that is unspent in respect of recruitment is allocated to the improvement of mental health infrastructure.  I can understand that but it also then mentions agency staff.  We have a major issue with recruitment and retention.  We have been over and over this, even in the Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  The HSE has told us that it cannot get staff, yet there does not seem to be any problem in getting agency staff.  Why can the HSE not start to recruit these staff directly?  Is there an issue with contracts?</p> <p>  That is just one issue.  I have a couple of other questions which I will put to the witnesses which relate to recruitment.  Is there an issue with salary conditions and pay rates in Ireland?  If there is, why can we not address that and do what is being done in England, where packages are being enhanced so that staff can actually be recruited and retained?  I know it is a challenge but we will have to break the mould and start somewhere.  There was also an issue with out-of-hours access.  An initiative was mentioned here last week.  What was the initiative the witnesses were talking about?  There was an initiative for community mental health services.  How many in the country are operating on a seven day week, if any?  An issue close to my heart goes back to preventative measures, which are that prevention is better than any cure.  Does the HSE have a plan to roll out the 24-7 access to crisis mental health services in every area in the country?  We are all looking for an update on the development of the new clinical approach to dual diagnosis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, was here a couple of weeks ago and mentioned the possibility of a one stop shop, or, as he called it, the no wrong door policy.  Has that been flagged with the HSE?  We have spoken about it among ourselves here.  We need a pinch point where everybody in the country has at least one access point and service can be distributed to wherever it is needed.</p> <p>  There was a worrying piece in the media last week or the week before stating that over 600 people left emergency departments who were in crisis.  Do the witnesses have numbers of people who were either highly intoxicated or under the influence of drugs who were refused admission to the acute section of the services?  Is it possible to get those numbers?  Is a record kept?  Primary care is the main issue here.  It goes back to the bottom-up approach.  It is a similar issue to what I said a while ago about people trying to access counselling services.  The waiting lists are so long that people are being discouraged and, unfortunately, left behind.  Does that go back to recruitment?  Does it go back to the lack of service when assisting general practitioners, GPs?  GPs are normally the first port of call.  No matter what ailment one has, a person will usually go to a GP first.  Another issue which I saw last night and see many nights, and which is not only prevalent in Dublin but countrywide, is that of homeless people.  What steps, if any, are taken to assist people who are homeless?  If they are taken in and assessed as having mental health issues, is there a follow-up or are they just assessed and left back out?  Is any accommodation or assistance at all offered?  It is heartbreaking and soul-destroying to see these people.</p><p>Most of these people are in a bad place, temporarily.  I am also concerned about mental health service provision to people in the criminal justice system?  Not everybody is aware of services in their local communities.  Information is key and there appears to be a lack of support in this area.  </p><p> Ms O'Connor mentioned in her opening statement that 90% of these issues should be addressed through primary care.  The words "should" and "can" are two very different words.  I would prefer to use the word "can".</p></speech>

Ms O'Connor also stated that an additional &euro;500 million in funding is required to meet future mental health infrastructure requirements, which concerns me in light of my earlier comment regarding the ringfenced money that has been already spent on infrastructure and the lack of spend on recruitment and retention that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  I welcome the Sl&aacute;intecare report which hopefully we will have an opportunity to discuss at a later stage.</p></speech>

In regard to agency staff and recruitment, which we addressed last week, we do have agency staff and we try to recruit them but, unfortunately, they do not all want to work.  The flexibility that is granted by working as an agency staff member is very different.  We have tried to offer contracts to agency staff but not all of them want to take them up.  There is no issue around funding.  We have to keep our services operating and so we staff what we can with existing staff and we then seek to recruit agency staff.  It is not only the HSE that cannot recruit as agencies are now also struggling to get staff, which is something not previously experienced.  I referenced at our last meeting that we had to close beds in a CAMHS unit in Linn Dara.  The reason this is so bad this year is because the agency could not get staff either.  There is a general shortage of the staff we need.  This has been the experience not only of the HSE, but across agencies and our funded partners over the past year to 18 months.  There is a wider recruitment issue that is hitting the health sector because we are operating in a global international market for staff.  It is worth noting - this was referenced in one of the responses given earlier - that in Ireland we have very fairly highly trained mental staff.  Not all countries specifically train nurses in mental health.  Our nurses are, therefore, very attractive to other jurisdictions.  Only about three or four countries have dedicated mental health training for nurses.  Our nurses go abroad.  There are massive recruitment campaigns going on in the UK that are offering very attractive packages which are very difficult to compete with.</p> <p>  In regard to packages and pay scales, these are not within our gift.  We were involved in the Bring Them Home campaign last year, which was an international nursing recruitment campaign.  We got a very small number of nurses arising out of this very big initiative that involved representative bodies, the HSE, the Department of Health, etc.  There was a package agreed as part of that campaign but it did not cut it for us.  To be honest, some people would not come home for what they were being offered.  Also, the HSE is locked into the public pay frameworks and it cannot decide to pay anybody outside those agreements.  This is an issue we work with every day, and it is broader than mental health and the HSE.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions on the agency and recruitment issue regarding the conditions.  I also point out that when we were having difficulties recruiting consultants, we worked with the Public Appointments Service to survey consultants abroad to determine why they were not coming back to Ireland.  The feedback we got was that they were all aware of the posts that were available.  There was no lack of information in that regard.  It was not just an issue of pay but the environment in which they would be required to work, rosters and lack of facilities, etc.  It is a bigger issue that just pay.  </p> <p>  Mr. Ryan will respond later on the seven day services and out-of-hours service because he is leading in that area and Mr. Dodd will respond to the questions on dual diagnosis and the accident and emergency aspect.  In terms of primary care, most mental health is dealt with in primary care.  We could argue about whether there is sufficient capacity in primary care to support GPs.  We know that capacity does not exist from a psychology perspective.  It is for this reason that we are investing in the 120 assistant psychologists for under 18s.  There are not enough avenues for the GP to take and GPs say that they are obliged to refer people to specialist mental health services even though they know that, for example, counselling might be what they need.  The National Counselling and Primary Care Service operates for people with medical cards only.  Anybody who does not have a medical card does not have access to that service.  We fund agencies to provide different kinds of counselling on our behalf, to which there is variable access.  I mentioned last week that we are looking at a national initiative around improving access to psychological therapies and talking therapies.  We are bringing in a clinical lead to do that piece of work.  We have a variety of different types of counselling across services.  I accept that is an inequity in different areas in that there are some types of services available and not others.  We want to have a standardised approach to how we do the talking therapy side of things.  We are also conscious that we need to develop services in general in primary care because it is not all about counselling.  For example, with young people it might be about speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or something that is not a mainstream mental health requirement.</p> <p>  In regard to homeless people, we have specialist services to meet need in this area.  As mentioned on page 29 of the document on homeless services, which was provided to the committee, there are specialist teams for people with severe mental illness, one on the north side of Dublin and the other on the south side.  There is a similar service in Cork and another in Waterford.  These services are for people who have long-term mental health conditions.  We know that GPs deal with people but there is a gap in the service for people who have become homeless and do not have a severe mental health illness but are at risk of developing it.  We are conscious of that gap and we are well advanced in our work with the NGO sector and other services on putting in place a  stepped care model to support people with mental health illness.  We are looking at how we can provide a more aggressive and assertive outreach model to people who are homeless to prevent them from developing greater problems.  This work is under way as one of our service improvement initiatives.  </p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Ryan, to comment on the forensic services.  We currently have in-reach in all of our prisons.  This has been a significant development over recent years.  The Central Mental Hospital Dundrum will soon move to Portrane.  We have staff going into every prison and we have different initiatives in certain prisons.  In regard to infrastructure, there is always a difficulty in this regard.  A significant amount of HSE funding is being spent on the new children's hospital, which is the second largest capital development.  The forensic hospital is the largest mental health capital development ever.  We know that we have other facilities that are not meeting their requirements.  We are regulated and environment is a key concern for the Mental Health Commission.  Some of our units that were developed in the 1990s are struggling to meet compliance.  We have a constant improvement programme.  Deputy Buckley mentioned the need for money to remain in mental health services.  If he were to ask people working in mental health services about the spend on infrastructure, they would say that one of biggest differences for service users was the improvement in their environments.  We have a long way to go on this and if we really want to improve our service model, we need to develop better day hospitals and nicer units.  We are lucky in that we have a footprint in many of the new primary care centres as they develop but there are still lots of gaps around the country.  I will hand over now to Mr. Ryan.</p></speech>

In regard to 24-7 services, we started with 7-7 because we wanted to do service provision in a way which would allow us to see to where the evidence would point.  Earlier this year, we did a trawl of the 114 general adult community mental health teams and we found that 60% of them were providing a seven day a week service, which meant we had a 40% gap.  We then identified that to meet that gap we needed an additional 50 whole-time equivalents.  We sought funding from the programme for Government, which we received.  We then consulted with local areas on what professionals would be required.</p><p>We have that information and we are recruiting those 50 posts to be in place by the end of quarter one in 2018.</p><p> There have been questions on the roadmap.  That is what it means.  We expect to get that information because we will have a suite of key performance indicators to see what value it has brought to a Saturday and a Sunday service.  Has it reduced people having to attend emergency departments?  Has it reduced people having to go back into hospital?  We want to trial the evidence before we look at moving on to a 24-7 basis.  At the moment, we do not have a model of care which we could stand over.  There is a lot of information here.  Briefly, that is the situation in regard to the development, on what we would see as a phased basis.  </p><p> The second item that we raised was around forensics in the Department of Justice and Equality.  In the Central Mental Hospital we have 12 forensic psychiatry-led teams.  Most of those are operating in prisons.  In all the Dublin and Leinster prisons we have a forensic psychiatrist, social worker and nurse who are working within the prison system.  They are treating prisoners who have a mental illness and, who at that time, either do not have to come into the Central Mental Hospital or who are on a waiting list to come in.  It is an attempt to try and provide care where the prisoner is located if we cannot get them into Dundrum.  The 93 beds tend to be full all of the time and there is a waiting list.</p><p> Those teams operate on a year-round basis.  We are also expanding that to Castlerea.  There is a limited service in both Cork and Limerick and we are trying to enhance that as we speak.  We have both the posts and the funding for it.  It is a question of making sure that it integrates with local services.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1057" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Philip Dodd" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017113000002#F00300"><p>On the issue of self-harm and how it is managed in our emergency departments, our clinical programme for the management of self-harm was launched in 2015.  In 2016, we began a process of recruiting clinical nurse specialists to be placed within emergency departments across the country.  Approximately 16 of the levels 3 and 4 emergency departments in 2016 were staffed and began to implement the clinical programme.  Towards the end of this year we have it in place in 24 of the 26 levels 3 and 4 emergency departments.  We have recruited 36 clinical nurse specialists across the country.  With regard to what was recently presented in the press, the National Suicide Research Foundation has been publishing data on self-harm as part of its self-harm register for the last number of years.  It has quoted a percentage of 13% of people as leaving emergency departments without assessment.</p> <p>  In the data that we have collected in the 16 emergency departments for last year, we found a rate of 9.9% leaving emergency departments before assessment.  However, 231 of those individuals were actually referred to the general hospital for treatment or the onsite psychiatric hospital, bringing the rate down to 7.2%.  That suggests that where the clinical programme is in place, it is significantly reducing the number of people who present with self-harm but leave hospital before assessment.  That is what we are hoping to achieve.  If we compare those figures to international figures, in the UK a 2013 study found that approximately 40% of people presenting with self-harm to the UK emergency departments were leaving before assessment.   </p> <p>  We do not have full data from across the country yet because this is a relatively new clinical programme.  We are not trying to measure anyone leaving hospital prior to assessment, having presented with self-harm.  We are trying to achieve a measure of every individual being offered assessment.  Our international data, and even our Irish data, suggests that the performance of this clinical programme is improving that outcome.</p> <p>  With regard to dual diagnosis, based on A Vision for Change, the policy document outlines that the vast majority of supports to people who present with addictions should be provided within primary care services.  A Vision for Change very much delineates the relatively limited role for secondary and tertiary level mental health services in the support of people who have primarily got a mental illness presentation and an addiction presentation.  The divide between that designation of how a person needs to be supported is not a concrete designation in that the way in which the policy has been rolled out across the country actually means that many mental health services are placed within primary care.  The National Drug Treatment Centre in Dublin is funded and developed through primary care but actually has a number of mental health teams as part of it.</p> <p>  Our clinical programme has just started.  We have a national working group that has been set up in the spirit of co-production along with other service users and service user's representatives.  What we hope to achieve from this clinical programme is very much developing a model of care within our mental health services and developing clear pathways of care for people who present with significant mental illness complicated by addiction problems as well.</p></speech>

The clinical programme is scoping what is available.  There are different versions, but most mental health teams currently deal with people who have addiction problems as well.  The difficulty for us is that they do not all have specific addiction counselling.</p> <p>  This is one of the challenges for us in developing the services.  It is important that people do not come to a mental health service simply to access addiction counselling.  Such people need to be managed in primary care.  That is what we are trying to develop with our colleagues in primary care.  The idea is to have that first line of defence in primary care, where there is access to addiction counselling and mental health supports.</p></speech>

At the moment, many areas are operating with 20 beds per 100,000.  We need to try to ensure that the beds we have are used for those who require them most.  I will try to answer the question directly.  We are trying to stay within the policy, which refers to 15 beds per 100,000.  The policy also refers to the development of a range of community services.  Previously, we discussed early intervention and so on.  The bed numbers are actually above those set out in A Vision for Change.</p></speech>

I will comment on that point.  As we know, A Vision for Change is now 11 years old.  I do not think it took into account the growing population.  Whether the figure is 15 beds or 20 beds per 100,000 people, the number is insufficient.  Perhaps that is something that the expert review group can examine.  Senator Devine is next.</p></speech>

I have some quick-fire questions.  The HSE representatives referred to 90% of mental distress or ill-health being dealt with in primary care.  The primary care team will be seen to be led by the GP.  How involved are GPs in this?  What information and encouragement is being fed to them?  Primarily, the work of the primary care team is to promote well-being in order that we do not get to the crisis stages.  The idea is to have early intervention.</p> <p>  Has the HSE engaged with An Bord Altranais to discuss the possibility of the board altering its criteria for registration in this country?  We know at least 100 nurses have attempted to register but have been refused because of the strict criteria on the educational and experience modules.  This needs to be revamped.  Experienced nurses were turned away.  They are now in other services but we need them in our services, as the members of the deputation know.</p> <p>  My next question relates to estimating the number of people in the Central Mental Hospital and the number of people in prisons.  The number of those with mental health issues has sky-rocketed.  I know the deputation addressed this earlier.  Reference was made to the Central Mental Hospital, where the 93 beds are always full.  I know there is a waiting list as well.  Has the ten-bed facility in Dundrum reopened?  I raised this question last year.  Have the difficulties been sorted out?  Did the HSE get the staff?</p> <p>  Has the HSE ever thought of allowing or employing psychiatric nurses to sit in the courts and Garda stations?  A successful trial along those lines took place in London.  Obviously, the idea is to get mental health issues at the first level of presentation along with some crime or alleged crime.</p> <p>  What contracts are the HSE offering to staff now?  Are they flexible?  The deputation referred to flexibility.  Are they permanent?  Do the contracts encourage and set out a career path or opportunity?  Does a nursing contract have a clause to the effect that by so many years the employee will be eligible to become a clinical nurse specialist or advanced midwife practitioner?  We know those roles can take a heavy workload from the mental health multidisciplinary teams.  That is the way we need to proceed with experienced staff.</p> <p>  Has the HSE looked at the unsuitable environment of accident and emergency departments?  I imagine we all agree on this point.  While the GP might be the first port of call, where is the first port of call after 5 p.m., at weekends and out-of-hours?  These are times when the greatest prevalence of mental distress is seen or is at its height.  Has the HSE looked at alternative models for emergency services to be offered with particular emphasis on people in mental distress?</p><p>Will the witnesses name the 40 areas which do not offer services seven days per week?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1134" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017113000002#H00200"><p>I will answer some of the Senator's questions before handing over to Mr. Ryan.  We are in violent disagreement about the whole primary care issue.  We all want primary care to be better resourced to deal with mental health and we are doing a great deal of work with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.  We have a project which is examining specifically the physical health of people with mental illness because we know that the physical health of people with severe and enduring mental illness is very poor and their life expectancy is much lower than average.  We have a significant amount of work under way with the Irish College of General Practitioners looking at improving physical health and ensuring general practitioners are trained and work with us in this area.</p> <p>  I referred to the whole of society and integrated approach to mental health.  As I may have mentioned last week, we are firmly of the view that we need our specialist services to be very specialised and very good but we are at a stage where, with A Vision for Change having set a particular model for us, which is great, we need to do a substantial amount of work in primary care.  We know people do not have sufficient access, general practitioners do not have sufficient supports available for people and so forth.  We are committed to addressing all aspects of this and working with the ICGP.  General practitioners are also represented on the Connecting for Life cross-sectoral group.  We are at one in our view on that issue. </p> <p>  In terms of well-being, Healthy Ireland is guiding much of what we do.  Using Healthy Ireland, Connecting for Life and A Vision for Change, we are trying to drive a number of initiatives to promote positive mental health.  Historically, the mental health division has not focused on mental health promotion.  However, we have done a significant amount of work in this area in recent years through the National Office for Suicide Prevention.  This includes running the Little Things campaign.  We are also working with colleagues in health and well-being in primary care to look at a variety of models around messaging, mental health promotion and general population approaches to mental health. </p> <p>  The Department of Health engages regularly with An Bord Altranais and the HSE engages with the Department.  The Department recently negotiated a change in respect of advanced nurse practitioners under which it is no longer the site that is improved.  There are a number of obstacles and the Department is engaging extensively with An Bord Altranais.  We do not engage with it directly because we go through the Department.</p> <p>  In terms of contracts, we try to be as flexible as we can.  We send out all sorts of messages around staff coming to work for us.  If the issue is one of working part-time, we try to hold on to staff and try to recruit them on any basis in terms of the hours they will be available for work.  We work within the broader public sector, however, which means certain limitations apply to contracts and it is not necessarily within our gift to offer anything.  Nevertheless, we try to be as flexible as we can.  </p> <p>  In terms of accident and emergency models, we are examining this issue very intensely.  There are two groups of people in the mental health services.  The first is those who are known to the services and may have been in our units.  They will have attended teams, experienced a crisis and often return to an emergency department.  We are not happy that this is occurring and we believe other models are available.  We are examining models used in the United Kingdom, for example, and in 2018, we intend to develop one site where people will be seen in a different way.</p> <p>  Part of the challenge we face is that A Vision for Change specifies that people should present to emergency departments.  We have to manage the policy and the feedback we receive from everybody.  Our priority is the group of people who are known to mental health services.  The challenge we face is how to provide a service where people can be properly assessed.  The statistics show that people who have a history of mental health problems are not always fully screened in respect of their physical health when they attend an emergency department.  There is always a risk that we treat people differently because they have a mental health problem and we miss a physical health issue.  We have to be careful about that.  There will be lots of protocols to work out in terms of how a facility should work. </p> <p>  The second group of people are those who are not known to the services.  These individuals will have to visit emergency departments until we find a different approach.  Hopefully the review of A Vision for Change will help in that respect but current policy dictates that we take a particular approach.  I ask Mr. Ryan to address the issue of prisons. </p></speech>

Every prisoner who is remanded is assessed from a psychological and mental health perspective.  One of the issues we have is that there is no legislation in place for what is known as the court diversion scheme.  Recommendation 15.1.2 of A Vision for Change requires the introduction of legislation to enable to do this in a more formal way.  We are doing it somewhat informally and we divert people who do not need to come into the prison system but may need to be more connected with the mental health service.  I hope that answers the question.</p> <p>  On Senator Devine's question on seven-day services, I will circulate the information to the Senator as I do not have the list with me.  I will send a list of all the teams to the Senator.  </p></speech>

We heard today, however, that additional funding of &euro;500 million is required.  I do not understand how the witnesses can arrive at that figure.</p> <p>  On recruitment, we heard that money was not an issue.  People working in mental health services tell me, however, that part of the problem in terms of staff retention is conditions, including the management and organisation of their workplaces.  Who develops the rules and procedures for running a department?  Some front-line staff argue that the buck is always passed and there are too few front-line staff.  People decide to pass on problems because they believe it is not their job to deal with them.  This passing of the buck causes great stress among front-line staff.  It is not appropriate that they have to work in such conditions and I would not blame any member of staff for leaving their job.  Who is responsible for management?</p> <p>  We heard there are teams in place nationwide but not all positions have been filled.  How many management teams are in place?  Have all the positions on those teams be filled?  I suggest that all the positions on management teams have been filled and all the front-line positions are not being filled.  </p> <p>  I accept what Ms O'Connor said on agency staff.  How much would an agency nurse earn compared with a nurse employed directly by the Health Service Executive?  Why are the mental health services unable to recruit psychologists?  Will Ms O'Connor outline the pay and conditions for psychologists compared with pay and conditions for psychiatrists?  What are their salaries and how much would psychologists and psychiatrists earn in the United Kingdom?  I suggest that psychiatrists are paid much more than psychologists.  We need to recruit more psychologists and more talk therapy and less medication is required.  I also suggest psychologists in the United Kingdom have better pay and conditions than psychologists here.  We need to address this issue.  We must also stop constantly asking for more funding. </p> <p>  According to the opening statement, HSE psychology services have traditionally been underresourced, yet Ms O'Connor was unable to tell the joint committee where the &euro;1 billion in annual funding was being spent.  The service is now asking for a further &euro;500 million in funding.  We must stop focusing on how much money we do not have and focus instead on delivering value for money for current funding.</p> <p>  At our last meeting, I asked for data on clinical outcomes in order that members could identify which areas are performing well and which are underperforming or underachieving.  I have not received a reply, although I thank the witnesses for the other documents they submitted to us with the replies.  I ask for specific answers to the questions I have asked. </p></speech>

The need for capital health funding has been a significant topic of discussion and within it we have captured the requirement for mental health services.  That is how we derived the figure.</p> <p>  Before I ask Ms O'Neill to speak about recruitment and pay, I will refer to how a department works.  If one takes acute units in hospitals as an example, there is a line management structure in which the nurses report to a clinical nurse manager at a particular grade who reports to an assistant director of nursing who ultimately reports to a director of nursing.  The governance paper we provided at the previous meeting sets out the governance structure for mental health services.  Each area has a head of service for mental health, at least one director of nursing - there are several directors of nursing in each community health organisation - and an assistant director.  There is, therefore, a tight governance model.  </p> <p>  Everyone is a professional and has his or her own professional standards.  Passing the buck would not be acceptable to any of us.  Everyone has his or her own personal responsibilities and ultimately we have a governance perspective on services.  We hold the management teams to account - the chief officer and the heads of service - and each CHO has its own management team.  There is not a variety of management teams, but there are many types of mental health team within an area.  The management teams are not significant.  There is generally a head of each discipline.  For instance, there are a number of directors of nursing; there will be a manager for the occupational therapy service, one for the social work service and one for the psychology service and that would be it.  The lack of middle layer managers in any of the allied health professional grades provides a challenge for us.  There is a very flat structure for the allied health professionals.  The nursing service has directors, assistant directors and different grades of clinical nurse manager, but the allied health professionals do not.  One often has a single manager with a variety of basic grade and senior staff.  We are trying to look at management teams.  </p> <p>  Psychologists and psychiatrists are different staff.  A Vision for Change sets out the construct and make-up of a multidisciplinary team.  All teams are led by a consultant psychiatrist.  It is included in A Vision for Change and we work with it.  There is at least one, possibly two, consultant psychiatrist, depending on the size of the area involved.  There are non-consultant hospital doctors, psychologists, occupational therapists and so on, but they are from different disciplines who train in a different way and have different qualifications.  Even within the psychology service, there is a breakdown, with clinical and counselling psychologists.  Part of our challenge is that A Vision for Change specifies a clinical psychology service.  We believe there is a significant role for counselling psychologists in primary care and employ them in the national counselling service.  We are looking at how we can employ more throughout the services we provide.  Again, we are working with a policy that has set a particular direction, but it is being reviewed.  We hope some of these matters will be addressed.</p> <p>  I ask Ms O'Neill to speak about agency staff and so on.</p></speech>

We constantly seek to convert any member of staff on a temporary or agency arrangement to being a permanent member of staff where we have such vacancies.  It is worth noting in response to Senator M&aacute;ire Devine's question about flexibility that we also re-employ retired nurses to the maximum of their pre-retirement income in order that it does not impact negatively on their superannuation.  That gives them the flexibility they seek.  They are making decisions on a work-life balance based on their terms and conditions and do not want a permanent arrangement.</p></speech>

In the mental health division operational plan for 2016 a sum of &euro;2 million was allocated for the development of specific services to enhance the supports available to those who were homeless.  In my area Midlands Simon Community does amazing work with persons who are homeless who have underlying mental health conditions.  The HSE provides it with about &euro;48,000 annually, a figure which should be reviewed, as it is not sufficient for Midlands Simon Community which has been deemed to be the best agency based on value for money achieved per service user.  Better value for money could be achieved by putting money into agencies such as Midlands Simon Community which not only houses people but also teaches and helps them to deal with their issues.</p></speech>

If we are investing in IT systems, we need to ask what the communications process is between the functional users and those who put the systems together.  The HSE has hiring numbers for CAMHS, but if it can hire and knows how many positions it needs, can it not produce a report on how much that would cost?</p></speech>

I cannot interpret the nitty-gritty of the details the HSE gave to auditors as I do not have the qualifications to do so.  The stakeholders consulted when these IT systems are constructed may need to change.  Our report may propose that end users such as this committee be consulted in order that we can be given the scripts and other reports made available.  We are building IT systems that I, as a politician accountable to the people, cannot interpret.  It is only specific experts within the system who can interpret them and I depend on these stakeholders to be able to do so.  There is also a need for exterior consultation.  If we put money into the construction of new systems, we need them to be able to spit out details, in real time, of business functions if we ask for them.</p></speech>

A team attended an international conference and did a lot of promotional work on what it was like to live in the area.  The mental health division is part of the wider HSE and there are certain ways of working that are common across the HSE, within which we must work.  We are trying to work with our services in promoting the areas within which they operate.  For example, one can recruit a panel of 100 nurses but in recruiting a team to work in County Kilkenny or County Donegal, for example, we can show how it works and what the lifestyle is in either area.  We are trying to change the way in which we promote areas in order that it becomes real and about living and working in a particular area.</p></speech>

I do not know when it arrived, but it contains a lot of interesting and good information and I would like a little more time to digest it.  Perhaps we might return as a committee to a few of the issues raised.  There is a lot of information included in the appendices which needs to be scrutinised a little better.  On page 43 is shown the posts needed to meet the recommendations made in A Vision for Change: 477 in general adult services; 460 in CAMHS; and 200 in the psychiatry of old age service, giving a total of 1,137.  How many of these posts have been funded?  Does the HSE have the money to fund them?  How many could it fill right now and how many would be left to be filled for which funding would be needed?  Deputy Anne Rabbitte made the good point that a team of seven was small and that if one was missing, it greatly inhibited the team's ability to deliver.  It is very difficult to deliver an effective service in such circumstances.</p> <p>  The HSE probably has a number of teams which have been fully filled.  What is their output?  If the HSE could determine the outputs, it could work out what the increase would be in creating new teams.  If it focused on specific areas, it could increase output in this way and achieve the targets set.  If it did not achieve its targets, it would have to ask why.  The committee is also trying to achieve this.</p></speech>

The HSE also carried out a review.</p><p>What was put forward was positive.  I am aware of ten areas where there are deficiencies.  I would like to analyse them further and determine what is needed, such as how many high-observation beds are required.  I would like a timeline within which improvements can be achieved.  I would like targets and key performance indicators to be set.  We could then begin to break through and determine what is needed to improve the situation over a certain timeline.  If we achieved that, it would be great, but if we do not we need to determine why.</p></speech>

We have that information every month and feed it back to teams.  It is fair to say that it is not always the case that teams with vacancies are performing poorly.  We have teams that are fully staffed which do not necessarily perform.  The other challenge in mental health is that we have one of each discipline.  If an occupational therapist is missing, nobody else can do that job.  Nobody else can be a social worker.  That is a challenge.  Ms O'Neill can discuss funding.</p></speech>

It shows that the current number of whole-time equivalents, WTEs, in post.  In addition, we have approved funding for the unfilled posts which we have clarified is ring-fenced.  When we receive programme for Government funding for expanded teams, we recruit personnel for the teams and the money remains ring-fenced.  If the additional funding available for posts was added, the number would probably go up by another 5% across the teams.  There are approximately 300 to 500 unfilled posts.  We do not need funding, we just need to recruit people.</p> <p>  In our calculation, we noted that the number of staff paid for through agencies are not reflected in the WTE numbers, but they are equivalent to in the region of another 1,000 WTEs.  That is across all services, including community, acute and inpatient provision.  There are 9,500 WTEs currently in place and the adjusted population calculator in A Vision for Change stated that we need approximately 12,500.  Posts funded by agency add another 1,000.  We are actually at about 11,000 in terms of the numbers in A Vision for Change.  The Deputy is correct: all of that should be put together and gaps determined.  To be fair, that is the level of analysis and work we are doing around improvement projects.</p></speech>

I am not qualified in mental health.  I happened to be my party's spokesperson on health in the Seanad when A Vision for Change was introduced.  I challenged and welcomed it, and thought it was a huge move forward.  On many occasions, I have seen a change in patients or friends of mine.</p> <p>  I admire psychiatric nurses for the work they do.  It is a job I simply could not do.  I was the only Government Deputy in Roscommon-South Leitrim from 2011 to 2016.  The accident and emergency Department in Roscommon closed and we wanted to build three different facilities.  There is a mental health facility in Roscommon hospital.  We approached it and said we wanted to build an urgent care centre, a rehabilitation unit and a palliative care service for the Mayo-Roscommon hospice.  The total cost of the development would have been &euro;20 million.  We wanted to use the six or seven acres of land that were available and offered to pay for a new mental health facility.  We waited six or seven months but were then told that it would inconvenience patients and staff.  Five years later, people are complaining that the Roscommon mental health facility is not fit-for-purpose.</p> <p>  We had to build an urgent care centre over what was the endoscopy unit.  We are now building around the mental health facility at the back of the hospital.  A rehabilitation unit for the west of Ireland is being built.  There may be issues with staff but services should be about patients.  On local radio, I called on management and staff to work together.  At six o'clock one morning I received 20 phone calls from psychiatric nurses.  Those in any other occupation who engaged in such behaviour would be taken to court.  In fairness, I explained to them that I did not say what was alleged.  Psychiatric nurses have a tough job and represent their patients, but they should not target politicians.  The action was unprofessional and nasty.  The people involved should have known better.</p> <p>  I know what the witnesses are going through.  Issues should be highlighted.  Mental health should not be a political football.  This should be about the patient.  How have services improved?  What the Chairman is doing today is vital.  What happened to me stopped me from getting involved again because I was scared.  People in the Psychiatric Nurses Association who should have known better told lies to their staff.  When I explained to them that what they alleged was not what I had said, they understood my position.  These people should have known better than to ring a politician at six o'clock in the morning.  I would not do the job the witnesses do for anything.</p></speech>

Mr. Hennessy can speak as our head of engagement.  Things have improved.  We are fully committed to putting service users at the centre of what our business is about.  Mr. Hennessy came into post a year ago as our head of engagement with service users and family members.  He is driving the service user agenda.  We now have an area lead for engagement within each community health organisation and the critical thing is that for the first time this has allowed us to have an equal voice for service users at our management table.</p></speech>

In other occupations, that might have been seen as possible barrier to employment but, in the case of the HSE and the mental health division, it was actually a requirement in order for me to take up the post.  The post was about putting in place structures across the country which would allow service users and their families to be involved in the delivery of services, as well as monitoring services as they are rolled out.  Local structures have been put in place by the nine area leads across each CHO, which the national director referenced.</p> <p>  The curious thing is that, even at this early stage, we are starting to get feedback from the structures.  The national director emphasised in public that this would not be just about consultation because it has been done in the past and largely ignored, or at least that is the perception of some service users and their families.  The national director has emphasised very publicly that this is a two-way process.  Services will be obligated to respond to the issues raised by service users and their families.</p></speech>

I spoke about budgets two weeks ago.  They are confusing.  It is important to get figures from the nine CHOs and break them down because cuts are happening even though we have been told that is not the case.</p><p> One of the transition and transformation requirements is that hospitals must close in order to free up resources to provide community-based care.  Recently, in my own area of Carlow-Kilkenny, St. Dympna&rsquo;s in Carlow closed, as did St. Brigid's in Galway.  The witnesses gave all the figures, although those figures only go up to 2016.  In Carlow-Kilkenny, people now have to go to St. Canice&rsquo;s.  I am a firm believer in having community-based services.  Does the HSE believe that, by closing all these hospitals, it is providing the service that people need?  We have to accept that there are long-term patients but there are also short-term patients who need to go into hospital for, say, a month or two weeks.  We need to get clarification on that because it is a major concern for people.</p><p> Regarding CAMHS, there is only one pilot under way, which is an advocacy project in CHO area 2.  When is that to be rolled out to the nine CHOs?  It is fine to say &ldquo;We are working on it&rdquo; but this is needed now.  I have a concern when the HSE keeps saying money is not a problem.  Every area is affected and we all need to make sure this happens in all of the areas.</p><p> On homelessness and housing, the witnesses say that the HSE is working through local authorities for people who need to go back into houses, which is excellent.  What measures are in place?  Does the HSE buy or rent houses?  I know from dealing with people that there are many who are renting but who are confused and do not want to stay where they are.  Who decides where they go?  Is the HSE buying or renting houses and what agencies are involved in this?  I ask that the witnesses clarify those three issues.</p></speech>

As a result, the numbers are set out.  The model is about closing institutions and having acute units, etc.  The gap that exists is more to do with the absence of other supports.  It is not about having lots of beds everywhere because people should be at home and supported to live at home.</p> <p>  In terms of advocacy, this has gone to tender.  The CAMHS advocacy project has been extremely complex in that advocacy for children is very different to having advocacy in place for adults, for all sorts of reasons.  We have gone to tender for an external agency to run that.  That tender is out and we hope to commence that initiative at the end of this year, although I am not sure of the date as we have to do the pilot piece first to see how it works.</p> <p>  On housing, we do not buy or rent houses.  The whole ethos is about people living in their own homes, having their own front doors and their own tenancies.  We are working with housing agencies, for example, the Housing Association for Integrated Living, HAIL, and with local authorities.  We have a very significant project under way as part of the policy relating to housing transition, which is about moving people into their own homes and being supported.  As the health service provider, our role is to support people from a health perspective in their own homes and we work with local housing agencies in that regard.  Obviously, the housing environment has impacted upon that but we have divested ourselves of many of our low-support hostels.  We previously had people living in health-owned housing, which is really not appropriate in the current age.  We have given many of our properties over to housing agencies and local authorities for them to have proper tenancy arrangements with people.</p></speech>

One of the first things that jumped out at me in terms of the transition and transformation chapter is that the HSE's mental health division was established in 2013.  We can see, therefore, that a considerable amount of work has been done in the past four years in delivering on A Vision for Change, although it will be very challenging to progress that.</p> <p>  I am interested in the prevention side and, in particular, whether the HSE has provision for research into how to deal with the evolution of social media.  I am very concerned about the impact this is having on young people.  Where is that kind of research catered for within the HSE's budget or how does the executive conduct that type of research?  I would have thought it would be crucial for the delivery of services to try to understand how to prevent difficulties in this area.  I know the Healthy Ireland framework would be a big part of this.</p> <p>  Section 38 and section 39 agencies obviously do vital work across the country.  I am trying to figure out how the HSE can ensure fair access across the country to the services that are provided.  One could be lucky enough to live in an area where there is a very active agency whereas that would not be the case in another area.  I am trying to establish how the HSE is going to ensure there is an evenness of services or equality of access to those services across the country, regardless of where they are located.  If the HSE can provide a list of the section 38 and section 39 agencies and the funding they receive, it would be very helpful.</p></speech>

The HSE has quite a good digital media department and we are doing a lot of work with it in looking at how we can develop a better presence in terms of mental health supports and access.  At the moment, at the request of the Minister, we are looking at having a single type of portal and IT access on mental health.  The work that goes on in respect of promotion and prevention really sits within the health and well-being division.  Just today, the HSE has launched a new Twitter tag in the context of health and well-being for schools, so there is a whole Twitter feed that is going to push out health promotion and health and well-being messaging to all the schools in the country.  That has been a very significant initiative.  From a mental health promotion perspective, we are part of that and there is a mental health promotion officer working with the health and well-being division.</p> <p>  With regard to the section 38 and section 39 agencies, we will send the Deputy a list.  We covered that at the last meeting so we have that information available.</p></speech>

I am sure the witnesses will be glad to know that we have run out of time.  I once again thank Ms O'Connor for what she provided yesterday.  I am struck by the vastness of the HSE's remit - it is absolutely enormous.  I think the members and I are struggling a little so, before the witnesses came in this morning, we loosely agreed that we are going to focus on three areas, namely, primary care, funding and recruitment. We see this as three modules, so we will be asking the HSE to come back in every now and then to help us to see where we are at, what the baseline is and what we are achieving.</p> <p>  I see Deputy Rabbitte wants to come in.</p></speech>

What I was going to add is that we have a private meeting next week at which the members will decide on and confirm this.  While all the other information is obviously crucial for the future of Ireland, there is only a certain amount we can do.  We are in a very precarious position this week and all of it could have gone down the Swanee, so we are definitely going to focus on the three areas.</p> <p>  Again, I thank all of the witnesses for coming in and for answering so many questions.

This is important because such devices can cause serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Paul Murphy and Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is attending in substitution.  In addition, Deputy Dara Calleary will substitute for Deputy Michael McGrath.</p> <p>  Today we will consider the Supplementary Estimates for Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, and Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service in the presence of the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  For the information of Deputies, the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017 has not yet been referred to this committee.  Therefore, this morning's meeting will adjourn following our consideration of the Supplementary Estimates.  I ask the Minister to address the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017113000002#B00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it a proposal for two Supplementary Estimates within the Public Expenditure and Reform group: a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.5 million, or a gross figure of &euro;10.5 million, in respect of Vote 12 &ndash; Superannuation and Retired Allowances, and a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;664,000 in respect of Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of Vote 12 will bring the total 2017 Estimate for Superannuation and Retired Allowances to &euro;550.4 million in gross terms and &euro;366.4 million in net terms.  This Supplementary Estimate arises mainly from the fact that this year, there have been more retirements than forecast under the pension scheme for established civil servants.  In addition, balances have been payable to former civil servants who retired in 2009 under the incentivised scheme for early retirement.  The pensions and lump sums that are paid under the pension schemes for established civil servants comprise just under 90% of total gross expenditure on the Superannuation and Retired Allowances Vote.  This means the main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire each year.  For various reasons, it is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next.  Most established civil servants may choose to retire within a five-year window between the ages of 60 and 65.  In addition, a number of people under the age of 60 retire each year under cost-neutral early retirement schemes or on grounds of ill health.  Each year, a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement.  The average lump sum and pension benefits that fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year vary depending on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.</p> <p>  This year's gross Estimate for Vote 12 of &euro;539.9 million was based on a forecast of 1,320 retirements from the established scheme.  There have been 1,309 retirements to date this year.  This trend suggests there could be up to 250 more retirements by the end of the year.  The effect of this higher-than-forecast number of retirements has been to put upward pressure on subhead A4, which relates to pension lump sums.  As a general rule, for each person who retires, a once-off lump sum that is three times the size of that person's annual pension is paid.  Increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  Therefore, subhead A4 is a key driver of variations in expenditure on the Vote in any given year.  So far this year, &euro;85.5 million has been expended from subhead A4, compared to the original full-year Estimate of &euro;90.4 million.  It is estimated that up to &euro;18.6 million will be further expended by the end of the year.  This would result in an overall projected excess of approximately &euro;13.7 million under subhead A4.  It is estimated that total gross expenditure on Vote 12 for 2017 may be approximately &euro;550.4 million, or approximately &euro;10.5 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;539.9 million that was voted previously by the Oireachtas.  The committee should note that the level of the gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated by anticipated increased levels of appropriations-in-aid.  It had been estimated that appropriations-in-aid for 2017 would be &euro;180 million and some &euro;159.8 million has been received to date.  Receipts with respect to the single public service pension scheme are ahead of profile so far this year.  Total appropriations-in-aid are now projected at &euro;184 million by the end of the year, or &euro;4 million more than expected.  This excess amount will act to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  The Supplementary Estimate of &euro;664,000 in respect of Vote 17 - Public Appointments Service - will bring the total 2017 Estimate for that Vote to &euro;12.044 million, which represents an increase of 5.8% on the original Estimate.  This reflects the higher-than-expected levels of activity to meet the recruitment and resourcing needs of the civil and wider public service in the light of the improving economy, the end of the recruitment moratorium, the ongoing process of public service reform and the need to build resource capacity and capability across the public service.  The committee should note that there are supplementary requirements under pay and non-pay costs within this Vote.  An additional &euro;196,000 on the pay side is requested to meet higher staffing costs this year as a direct consequence of the scale of additional recruitment and resourcing that the Public Appointments Service is required to oversee in 2017 in meeting its statutory obligations under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004.  This funding will enable the Public Appointments Service to assign additional staff to recruitment and selection units and increase support to client Departments and offices.</p> <p>  A non-pay additional request of &euro;833,000 is as a direct consequence of increased recruitment costs associated with increased operational activity.  In 2015, the Public Appointments Service received 54,025 applications, interviewed 6,871 candidates and assigned 5,256 people to positions in the civil and public sector.  By the end of October of this year, 75,000 job applications had been processed, 13,000 candidates had been interviewed and over 8,000 people had been assigned to positions across the public service.  The total number of assignments may reach 9,500 by the end of the year.  The Public Appointments Service is legally obliged to undertake this recruitment activity, which results from Departments, offices and the wider public sector restoring capacity after the ending of the recruitment moratorium and preparing for the future challenges presented by a growing economy, rising public expectations, public service reform and demographic trends.  For reasons relating to the increase in the volume of recruitment activity, spending on interview boards, research and advertising and testing has been higher than expected this year.  The additional request of some &euro;1.03 million is offset by lower-than-anticipated capital investment spending this year for the Public Appointments Service of &euro;365,000 due to timing factors.  Therefore, the proposed Supplementary Estimate for the Public Appointments Service is &euro;664,000.</p> <p>  I am satisfied that approval of the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;6.5 million net for Vote 12 will confer the necessary legal authority to meet the pension entitlements of civil servants who are expected to retire up to the end of 2017.  I am happy that the approval of the Supplementary Estimate of &euro;664,000 for Vote 17 will enable the wider public service to restore capacity and prepare for the future challenges presented by a growing economy, rising public expectations, demographic trends and public service reform.  I commend both of these Supplementary Estimates to the committee.  I will be happy to answer the committee&rsquo;s questions on these Votes.</p></speech>

I have two questions for him.  Is any work being done to ascertain why retirements are ahead of projection?  Is this being driven by any trend within the service?</p><p>Is any particular area of the public service showing a higher rate of retirement than other areas?  If so, are there any plans to make up for the retirements in that area?</p><p> I acknowledge that a substantial amount of work has been done by the Public Appointments Service this year.  It has filled a significant number of positions.  We have had ongoing conversations about human resources practices in the civil and public service that need to change to make it a more attractive place in which to work.  The Minister heard me speaking about this issue last night.  Flexibility is needed in the education and health care sectors to try to keep people in Ireland.  Is the Public Appointments Service investing in new human resources practices that would encourage new ways of looking at recruitment and new forms of contracts?  Pay is an issue, but other issues in public service contracts need to be addressed as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017113000002#C00200"><p>I can respond to the Deputy's second point by saying that the work which needs to take place to overhaul and modernise human resources practices within our public and civil services needs to be led by a line Department.  While the Public Appointments Service will be doing various pieces of work in this area, I envisage that it will continue to focus most of its work on appointments and on selecting candidates for State boards.  I believe the work that is under way will deliver against the needs to which the Deputy refers.  The progress we are making in some of these areas is better than is sometimes acknowledged.  The 2017-2020 people strategy for the Civil Service is driven by the anticipation that up to 10,000 civil servants will retire in the coming years.  This feeds into the first question asked by the Deputy, which I will answer in a moment.  We need to look at ways of continuing to improve our efforts to give people structured career paths over which they have visibility.  Perhaps we have not been able to do this up to now.</p> <p>  I think we are making progress in two areas.  Figures have been presented to me to show that this is happening.  I can see it happening with my own eyes.  People are moving at different levels of our Civil Service between various Departments and agencies.  I am seeing far more mobility across Departments than I have seen at other times.  I see two other positive developments that are happening.  Higher levels of recruitment are now taking place within our Civil Service.  Over recent years, I have seen a real change in the experience of the people who are coming in.  When I attend engagements with broad groups within the Civil Service, I see a far broader diversity of age and experience than I would have seen in the middle of the previous D&aacute;il and Government.  I think the long-term effects of that will be very positive.</p> <p>  I am seeing growing evidence of our ability to meet expertise needs in areas of the Civil Service, such as the topical area of international taxation.  Our Departments and the Revenue Commissioners now have the ability to attract and recruit people who will work in the Civil Service or the Revenue Commissioners for a number of years before deciding to stay on or go back to the private sector.  We should acknowledge that this is a welcome and positive development and we should continue to support it over the coming years.  The important changes that have been made have resulted in higher levels of recruitment, more diversity among those who work in the Civil Service and greater opportunities for mobility from Department to Department.  As I have said, the people strategy for the Civil Service that is in place for the period up to 2020 looks at how we can deal with issues like mentoring and development as a way of reflecting the fact that the private sector is far more competitive than it has been in the past.  In the coming weeks, we will launch the Public Service 2020 plan, which is the next phase of public service reform and in which the Public Appointments Service will play a role.</p> <p>  The Deputy's first question related to the variance in the number of retirements.  I am satisfied that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is doing everything it can to predict recruitment levels in order that those numbers can feed into the expenditure commitments we have each year.  We have a continual difficulty in anticipating when a group of people will retire.  It is understandable that we have to provide for lump sum payments in the year in which those payments are made.  This means that a small movement in either direction has an effect on our expenditure commitments for that year.  As I have said, there is a five-year window within which the majority of civil servants can choose to retire.  A curve in the demographics within our Civil Service, for want of a better phrase, is approaching us at the moment.  The number of people who are eligible for retirement will increase between now and 2021.  A small movement in the number of people who expect to retire will mean that we have to hand money back to other parts of the Department or to the Exchequer, or that we have to look for additional money from the Exchequer for the year in question.  Having said all of that, the total amount of money we are looking for from the Oireachtas this year is a gross Estimate of &euro;10.5 million from a total subhead of just under &euro;540 million.  I believe the variance is at a level I can stand over at this committee this morning.</p></speech>

I hope this will happen before the end of the year.  Maybe I can come before the committee in January to highlight some of the good work that is under way.  It is understandable, particularly after the week we have had, that we all hear about the difficulties.  I would welcome an opportunity to highlight the significant amount of work of great value that is going on as we seek to continue to modernise what we do with our Civil Service.  I am dealing today with Vote 12, which relates to civil servants only.  I have seen no evidence to suggest that any particular cohort of civil servants in any part of the Civil Service is any different in this regard.</p> <p>  If the Deputy is asking about an area across all of Government that would be important to me in terms of how we account for it and plan for it better, I would mention teachers in that context.  In recent days, I have had to go to the Cabinet in quicker than anticipated circumstances to seek agreement to make additional provision for superannuation and pension payments for our teachers.</p><p>I have been struck by how the variance in respect of the number of teachers that are looking to retire and how we account for this is different from what I want to see in future.  Although the matter is not covered by this committee, I am keen to indicate the point.  It is something the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and I will have to work on for next year.  We need to see how we can plan for it better.  We do not want to be in an adverse position.  If a teacher voluntarily decides to retire, then clearly that teacher has a legal commitment and an expectation that we will be in a position to meet his or her expectations.  I am keen to see how we can plan and account for this better in the coming years than we do at present.</p><p> The first question I was asked related to trends.  I will read out the details but I might circulate them in tabular format to the secretariat in order that the details can be shared in a better way with the committee.  I will set out the trends.  In 2015, we advertised 304 vacancies on State boards.  For that year, we received 4,699 applications.  Of those 4,699 applications some 916 were submitted to the Minister for consideration and of those in turn 206 led to appointments.  The figures are: 304 advertised, 4,699 applications received, 916 submitted to the Minister and 206 appointed.</p><p> I will share the figures for 2016 as well but the 2017 figures are not yet complete.  In 2016, the equivalent figures were: 2,598 applications received, 639 submitted to the Minister and 173 appointed.  The total number of vacancies advertised for that year was 163.  Those are the figures for 2015 and 2016.  I have figures for 2017 as well and I will share them with the committee, but the figures are not for the full year so I am not in a position to draw conclusions.</p><p> I was asked about the challenges, what is working well and what I think is not working well.  There has been a dramatic improvement in the diversity of applications.  The diversity of individuals who are being put before Ministers is significantly better than in previous years.  When I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the work that had to go into identifying a diverse group of candidates to put on boards was significant and took a considerable amount of time.  Now, we have an organisation that will generate these applications.  It can find new ways for us to talk to new people about State board vacancies.  That represents a major improvement.</p><p> Something else has changed since then.  There is definitely a growing awareness among people who are looking to apply for these roles regarding their responsibility as well as the potential challenges and pitfalls in doing that work.  The profile of the roles has increased, as has the reputational benefits and consequences of such work going well for individuals or otherwise.  I attended an event recently for the Institute of Directors in Ireland.  I am doing another for the Institute of Public Administration before Christmas.  My role is to reinforce to people the obligations they have if they go on boards.  While it would not be fair to say yet that there is hesitancy in people applying for positions, it is fair to say that there is greater awareness of the responsibilities involved in being on these boards.  That is a good thing but it is something that we need to keep an eye on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017113000002#D00200"><p>I wish to ask the Minister about superannuation and retired allowances.  My question relates to the restoration of the reductions that people took as a consequence of the economic collapse.  People, especially retired people, are extremely confused about how the restoration may affect them.  People may have retired at different times and, as a consequence, the rules are different.  I am seeking a people-friendly thing whereby someone can input the date of retirement and find out the particular scheme under which they retired.</p> <p>  It is important that people who retried before a certain date and before the changes took place are told that their situation is straightforward.  In other words, it is important to say that restoration follows the general principle of people who are working in the public service.</p> <p>  A situation has arisen whereby there is now evidently a labour shortage.  Large numbers of nurses and teachers opted to retire earlier than they might otherwise have retired because they feared that their pensions would be cut significantly.  At the same time, we have a difficulty in many schools in obtaining substitute teachers, especially in DEIS schools at primary and secondary level.</p> <p>  The Minister could have an influence in making the position clear to those who have retired but who may wish to offer themselves from time to time for substitute work, perhaps for a couple of days a week or for a couple of weeks at a time.  The question is how they can go about it.  We need to give the same information to principals.  I realise this is more a matter for the Minister of Education and Skills.  In any event, there is extensive confusion.  Many of those who retired early might well be interested in doing occasional work.  Some may well be interested in doing more than occasional work, were it to become available.  This arises in the context of the shortages now being experienced in different parts of the public services, but it is most evident in teaching and nursing.</p> <p>  I am seeking people-friendly information for people who have retired on how restoration will affect them.  In particular, I want the Minister to make clear to people who retired before or as the crisis began that they might have a straightforward situation.  I imagine the Minister has found that people are genuinely confused as well.  We get tables from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but they are extremely difficult to track and explain.  I realise it is a difficult communications issue but it is important for many people.</p> <p>  I represent a constituency where approximately 30% of the population were not born in Ireland or their parents were not born in Ireland.  I imagine Dublin Central, the Minister's constituency, is pretty much the same - the figures may not be as high as Dublin West but they are high nevertheless.  I found this question difficult when I was Minister, but the recruitment embargo was in place for most of that time and certainly up to the last year and a half.  At that point, gradually, we were able to get rid of it.  I do not find Polish people working in places in the public service in any significant number.  I do not find people from the Baltic states working there.  I do not find too many people from Africa or Asia working in the public service either.</p><p>As the Minister knows, these big population groups have immigrated into Ireland in recent years.  The Minister and everyone else accepts that gender diversity is really important, but I suggest that when the public service is looking at the issue of diversity, it should also focus on the representation of people who have come to live and work in Ireland, many of whom are quite highly qualified.  I know the Public Appointments Service has advertised in some international languages, but I do not know whether it has focused on the people about whom I am talking, many of whom have significant qualifications.  If they are without employment at the moment, with some appropriate training they might be able to make a career in the public service.  I see this being done in other European countries.  I do not see why we would not move towards the same tendency.  There are large numbers of students of international origin in many secondary schools, particularly in Dublin 15.  It is important for young Irish-European, Irish-African and Irish-Asian people who are planning what they might do for a living to have a sense that the public service is open to them as a career.  I suggest there would be merit in the Public Appointments Service offering career guidance information sessions to school-goers from an early stage to advise them on careers that are available and may be of interest to them.</p><p> I wish to ask about mobility within the public service.  My personal view is that one of the biggest problems with the HSE is the constant moving around of people in junior to senior executive positions.  Every time one has business to transact with the HSE, one finds that somebody else has moved into the position.  Does the Government have a policy in this regard?  When I served as Minister for Social Protection, I strongly advised against the adoption of a HSE-style constant rotation of officials that means people do not stay in their positions for very long, particularly as they make progress through promotions.  When an official is appointed to a particular area, he or she should be able to serve at least three years in that area.  It can be extremely difficult for clients to use the public service if there is constant rotation of staff.  This kind of rotation may also be difficult for some staff members.  If new people are arriving in and out all the time, it appears as though the place is in a constant state of flux.  This is a difficult issue because I appreciate that mobility is desirable on the one hand, but on the other hand the key thing is the service to the client or customer.  If we cannot stabilise service provision and ensure staff members feel confident they can provide a good service, it can be tricky.</p></speech>

The first point she made related to the status of public service pensions that are currently being paid.  As the Deputy will acknowledge, this is an immensely complicated environment.</p></speech>

Broadly, three different pension schemes are in operation for those who joined the public service up to 1995, those who joined between 1995 and the end of 2012 and those who have joined since the start of 2013.  The number of people retiring from the public service hit a particular peak across the crisis period.  They retired under a certain set of conditions because they correctly expected that if they stayed on longer into the period of difficulty we experienced, they would leave with lower levels of pension benefits.  It was decided to incentivise retirement as part of the efforts that were under way to deal with the immense difficulties at that time.  The simple answer I can give to the Deputy's questions on this matter is that we will look at how we can address it better.</p> <p>  The legislation that is currently in place means that by the time we get to next year, the public service pension reduction will be broadly eliminated in the case of someone who has a pension with a value of less than approximately &euro;34,000.  By the end of the agreement we have negotiated with representatives of employees in our civil and public service, the public service pension reduction will be eliminated in the case of someone who has a pension with an approximate value of &euro;50,000.  I do not have the Bill in front of me now.  I looked at it last night.  Perhaps the figure is closer to &euro;53,000 or &euro;54,000.  I will come back to the committee with all of that information.  By the time we reach that point in 2020, the vast majority of people who are in receipt of a pension will have their public service pension reduction completely eliminated.  We have already had a great deal of contact with the pensioners' representative organisations.  We have given them information to explain our plans.  Maybe we will share that information again after this morning's meeting.  Perhaps I will make a simple table explaining what is actually happening available to all Members of the Oireachtas, starting with the members of this committee, before Christmas.</p></speech>

That is where the complication kicks in.  Broadly, by the end of 2020, anybody who has a pension of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;53,000 will have the public service pension reduction eliminated.  By the time we get to next year, anybody who has a pension of approximately &euro;34,500 will see the public service pension reduction eliminated.  I want to make a point about the average pension levels out there.  For reasons we are all familiar with, much of the public focus and debate tends to centre on higher-value pensions.  It is worth knowing that in 2017, the average pension paid to existing pensioners was &euro;23,800.  That is a very valuable pension in the context of the difficulties being experienced in private pension schemes and the status of those schemes, but it is very different from the figures mentioned in public debate, which tends to foster a belief that public sector pensions are worth multiples of that amount.  That is not the case.  It has to be recognised that the pension payments of people who are on the more recently established pension schemes will be co-ordinated.  They will get the non-contributory State pension and their pension payment on top of that.  This approach will be taken to get them to a certain level.  Unlike people who would have been in receipt of pensions up to 1995, they will not get their pension and the non-contributory State pension on top of it.  Both payments are combined to get retirees to a certain point.  When we were negotiating the current agreement, I was very conscious of the need to be aware of the reality of pension payments for people who are retired.</p></speech>

"No" is the short answer to that question.  To address the two other points which the Deputy put to me, in respect of mobility I made the point earlier that I think it is improving.  It is not that I think that.  It is improving.  There must be a trade-off however.  We have to allow people to stay in a job long enough to build up the expertise needed to do that job before moving onto another assignment.  Each Government Department must put together a workforce plan to deal with matters like that.</p> <p>  In respect of the Deputy's point on our diverse population, only yesterday the Public Appointments Service gave a presentation in Trinity College on new ways in which we might recruit people from the new communities which form part of modern Ireland.  As we speak, the Public Appointments Service is seeking to change its website to make it more appropriate and understandable for those from the new communities to which the Deputy referred.  We have now started an outreach programme in secondary schools which will be implemented by PAS through career guidance teachers.  It focuses on the value and diversity of careers within the Civil Service.  All that is under way.  </p> <p>  I take a very positive view of the impact the diversity in our community is having and what it will mean for our economy in the future.  It is wonderful to think that in a few years' time we will have people working in the Civil Service whose mams and dads were born outside of our country, or who were themselves.  I can see it now at entry level.  I am beginning to see a change.  If one looks at the programme which will be on in schools in west Dublin and central Dublin, in a few year's time when the diversity we now have in our classrooms and colleges passes into employers, including our Civil Service, it will be a huge source of strength for Ireland.  I take a different view on that kind of diversity to that others in politics at the moment might take.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for making time available to consider the important Supplementary Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;44.2 million is required in respect of the Garda Vote in 2017.  It is projected that there will be an underspend of at least &euro;25.5 million in the remaining seven Votes in the Justice and Equality group.  This will reduce the net additional Exchequer funding requirement to approximately &euro;18.7 million.</p> <p>  An additional &euro;50.4 million is being made available to meet payroll and overtime costs.  The additional requirement in respect of pay and allowances is &euro;8 million and the additional requirement in respect of overtime is &euro;42.4 million.  The increased overtime requirement relates directly to the measures taken to combat organised crime and other serious crime.  The costs associated with the implementation of the Labour Court agreement on Garda pay are also a contributory factor.  The partial offsetting of the additional requirement by underspends in other votes reflects the commitment given by the Department in meeting the partial cost of the Labour Court agreement for 2017.  It is expected that total expenditure on Garda overtime in 2017 will exceed &euro;130 million, which is unprecedented.  This compares with overtime expenditure of &euro;91 million in 2016, &euro;56 million in 2015 and &euro;37.7 million in 2014.  Budget 2018 provides for almost &euro;100 million in overtime next year.  Overtime worked in December will be paid from the 2018 budget rather than the 2017 Estimate, which we are discussing this morning.</p> <p>  There are additional requirements in a number of other administrative subheads, including travel and subsistence, expenses associated with road traffic policing, training and other expenses, maintenance of Garda premises and certain other station services.  These costs amount to almost &euro;12 million when offsetting underspends in other areas such as telecommunications services are taken into consideration.  A further additional requirement of almost &euro;2.7 million arises under the communications and other equipment subhead.  This relates primarily to increased costs in respect of operational equipment, mainly in specialist areas such as the armed response units.</p> <p>  There are offsetting underspends in other areas within the Garda Vote, such as superannuation.  The underspend in this area can be attributed to a smaller than expected number of retirements.  In addition, there are surplus receipts of approximately &euro;14 million.  The largest proportion of these receipts, by far, relates to a greater than envisaged number of pension-related deductions as a direct result of increased expenditure on pay and overtime.  This Supplementary Estimate will make these additional receipts available to offset a proportion of the overtime and payroll cost.</p> <p>  A further aspect of this process is the reallocation of an underspend of &euro;8 million in capital expenditure from the buildings subhead.  Some &euro;6.7 million is being reallocated to the area of information and communications technology, ICT, and a further &euro;1.3 million is being reallocated to the transport area.  The underspend relates to the timing of the completion of new Garda divisional and regional headquarters in the Kevin Street area of Dublin and in Galway.  These buildings will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018, following the completion of the new divisional headquarters in Wexford in September of this year.  The additional budget allocated to ICT will ensure a total capital spend of over &euro;40 million in this area in 2017, including expenditure on a number of key systems such as rosters and duty management, investigations management and enterprise content management.  These projects are key components of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na modernisation and renewal programme.</p> <p>  The additional &euro;1.3 million for transport will bring expenditure on the Garda fleet to over &euro;5 million in 2017.  This follows expenditure of &euro;10 million in 2016, which allowed for the purchase of 462 vehicles.  I am pleased to say the Government's capital plan for the period from 2018 to 2021 provides for a further &euro;31 million for direct investment in the Garda fleet.  The additional amounts made available to ICT and transport in 2017 are bringing expenditure in these areas forward, in effect, with the corresponding budget being reassigned in 2018 to complete the building projects.  The utilisation of the capital budget in this manner ensures prudent use of available resources on a multi&ndash;year basis.</p> <p>  The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  The substantial increase in Garda numbers is a demonstration of tangible progress in achieving the Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This continued high level of investment in the Garda workforce will ensure the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  A further 800 new Garda recruits will enter the Garda College in 2018.  An additional 500 civilians will be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and facilitate the redeployment of garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.</p> <p>  I am pleased to say this investment is yielding results in a number of successful Garda operations, such as Operation Hybrid, which will continue apace throughout 2018.  As of 31 October last, 71 arrests and 11 charges - three for related offences - have been brought in connection with gangland-related shootings.  In addition, 30 firearms have been seized and over 14,260 lines of inquiry have been conducted.</p><p>In the region of 44,500 high-visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from the armed support units.  A significant amount of closed-circuit television footage, mobile phone traffic and forensic evidence is being examined.</p><p> Concentrated Garda actions against criminal gangs have been illustrated by a number of notable successes this year, with a series of very significant drug seizures, valued at over &euro;79.5 million.  This includes the huge haul of illegal cannabis valued at &euro;37.5 million seized at Dublin Port in January this year and, more recently, a significant seizure on 15 November valued at &euro;7 million.  Rural communities are also benefitting from the significant injection of policing resources provided by the Government and the concentrated initiatives, such as Operation Thor.  As part of the Garda approach, special targeted patrols are carried out with the assistance of the Garda national support services against criminals committing crime inter-regionally, including a focus on the use of the motorway network by criminal gangs, to disrupt and arrest those involved.  These initiatives have provided a most beneficial return in the Government's investment in resources and we will continue to back that up by strengthening the necessary legislative provisions where required to ensure the multifaceted response to crime in all its forms is maintained.</p><p> The underspends across the other seven Votes in the justice group has reduced the net additional Exchequer requirement for the Supplementary Estimate to approximately &euro;18.7 million.  The savings mainly arise in the Justice and Equality Vote, largely accounted for by payroll savings.  The full-year cost of additional recruitment during 2017 will not materialise until 2018.  There are underspends in a number of programme areas, including the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS.  I recommend this Supplementary Estimate for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote to the committee and I am happy to address queries that members may have.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for coming in.  It is important the overtime is available for garda&iacute; throughout the country between now and the end of the year.  Why has the overtime increased so significantly?  In 2014 it was &euro;37 million but in 2017 it will be &euro;130 million.  What is the reason for the enormous increase?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2017113000002#B00400"><p>Quite frankly, it is an increased demand on overtime having regard to the very serious criminal situation, particularly in this city of Dublin.  The Garda is anxious to ensure every available resource is at its disposal, particularly in the context of gangland matters.  Members are aware that particularly in parts of Dublin, there is an unprecedented challenge in terms of organised crime, including an escalation in gangland violence.  We always have the threat from international terrorism, which is something of which we should be mindful in the context of European Union neighbours.</p> <p>  Overtime expenditure in 2016 was &euro;91 million, compared with &euro;56 million in 2015.  As I stated, the expenditure this year is expected to be over &euro;130 million.  It is important to note, however, that &euro;28 million of this increase is accounted for by the cost of the Labour Court agreement on Garda pay.  It is important to note that overtime cannot be taken in isolation to other resources available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There needs to be a scheme of management in order to ensure overtime does not escalate on an annual basis in the way it has in recent years.  That is particularly offset by the ongoing programme of recruitment.  I was in Templemore in September and saw 180 newly attested, ambitious and energetic garda&iacute;, all of whom have been allocated to stations across the country.  I look forward to being there next week to witness a further 200 graduating.  As the recruitment continues apace and the newly attested Garda members take their positions across the country, the question of the escalating overtime must be considered in that arrangement.</p></speech>

Has any work been done with regard to the number of garda&iacute; out sick, particularly those out with work-related stress?  Has there been an analysis of the costs of that and the impact this has?  If people are out sick, they must be covered by overtime.</p></speech>

I would be keen to ensure there would not be any particular spike in that area without there being a corresponding reason.  Having regard to the fact that since the Garda college in Templemore has re-opened, 1,400 newly recruited members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been put to work on the streets.  That process will continue apace.  Next year there will be 800 recruits.  I mentioned in my statement the importance of noting the introduction of the new recruits and retirements within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This year, the number of retirements is somewhat less than in other years.  The number is usually approximately 300 but we are heading to the end of November and the figure is in the region of 270.  This is also taken into account in the context of the allocation of resources.</p></speech>

If we recruit people and they end up being stressed at work or in a difficult position with respect to bullying, harassment and so on, they might end up out sick.  There has been no analysis of the number of Garda staff out sick, particularly those out with work-related stress.  I know it has been brought to the Minister's attention that in a number of cases, people have been inaccurately recorded as being sick but they are out with work-related stress.  Is there any analysis of it?</p> <p>  My next question relates to expenditure in the disclosures tribunal and the committee established essentially to filter the information from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na going to that tribunal.  Is that an extra cost category?</p> <p>  My final question relates to the underspend in INIS.  What is the cost of Operation Gull?  How much is being spent and how many Garda resources are being used on it?  It is a process involving co-operation on the Border relating to immigration or migration.  I am not really sure what they are at, to be honest.  How much is being spent on that and is it envisaged that it will increase with Brexit?</p></speech>

Having regard to the ongoing programme of recruitment for INIS, it is envisaged that this will correct itself and it will be rebalanced for 2018.</p> <p>  I would be very happy to engage with Deputy Clare Daly or other members on an analysis of the suggestions from her that there would appear to be inordinate number of garda&iacute; out sick.  I would share her concern if there has been a spike.  I do not have the figures with me but I am happy to provide them to the Deputy.  The Garda has a comprehensive anti-bullying policy and this includes the provision of welfare services and external counselling services where required.  As far as these human resources and personnel matters are concerned, there are robust practices and procedures in place.</p><p>However, if the Deputy has evidence as to a rise in these figures I would be happy to engage and ensure that a proper analysis is done.</p></speech>

Liaison persons have also been nominated from the relevant sections to deal with specific requests for the tribunal in accordance with those requests.

It may be an operational matter for the garda&iacute; but on the basis of what has been provided here, can it be said that the announced ban on overtime, apart from specific operations, in the Dublin metropolitan region will continue between now and the end of the year or will it be rectified and overtime be available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  I take the opportunity to commend the garda&iacute; on their considerable successes in recent months in tackling organised crime.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Daly's points, it is a surprise to me that there is an underspend in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS.  Two years after the enactment of the International Protection Act and at a time of a refugee crisis one would imagine that there should be considerable pressure on the INIS budget.  It is a surprise to me and a source of concern, but I hope that will be rectified next year.</p></speech>

We are keen to ensure that there is a full complement of staff and that the resources allow for increases where appropriate.  As we head towards the end of the year, the recruitment programme has not been completed in the manner in which it might otherwise have been but I am satisfied that as we go into the new year and into the 2018 budget, and as the current vacancies are filled, those figures will correct themselves.  I would not like a view to be formed that there is any form of constrict in the matter of resources available to INIS.  This is purely in the area of the recruitment of staff.  Recruitment of staff is under way.  I would expect that the vacancies will have been completed by the spring of next year and that the figures will correct themselves.</p> <p>  On the overtime, this is an issue that has been in the public domain arising from a leaked circular referring to the cancellation of overtime.  It was suggested in the media that overtime would not be available to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na between now and the end of the year.  I am happy to report that that is not so.  I wish to reassure people who may have been concerned by these reports that the funding is being made available to garda&iacute; to ensure that people are safe in their homes, and particularly on the streets, during the midwinter and Christmas period.  There are issues for the garda&iacute; in terms of the management of the funds but we are dealing in real time with a situation where there is a sum of money available for Garda overtime to the order of &euro;130 million for this year, much of which has been expended, and the overtime bill for December 2017 will be a matter for the 2018 budget.  Those funds are fully available.  I wish to advise members that the management of the Garda funding and the prudent managing of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

As far as the Minister understands it, will there now be a change in the position in the Dublin metropolitan region and will overtime be available in that district?</p></speech>

I wish to assure the committee that following receipt of the report in the media, officials in my office immediately contacted the Office of the Garda Commissioner.  There appears to have been some form of misunderstanding.  I wish to assure members that there will be funding available for Garda overtime for the December period.  Obviously, I do not allocate overtime for garda&iacute;, no more than I suggest to garda&iacute; where actual policing endeavours might be undertaken but I am satisfied, following discussions at the highest level yesterday, that any misunderstanding or misinterpretation has been cleared up and that there will be a provision of overtime for garda&iacute; over the festive period in December.</p></speech>

Would there be an acceptance that if overtime is spiralling out of control, more personnel should have been recruited?  I accept recruitment is starting to increase again but is there an acceptance that the number working in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was allowed to slip too low given that we get more per hour out of someone working 40 hours per week than someone working 50 hours per week?  That is the same in all workplaces.  Likewise, in terms of cost, as a rule, time and a half is paid after 39 or 40 hours.  Is there an acceptance that this could have been managed better in recent years?</p></speech>

That resulted in a situation where garda&iacute; were retiring on an annual basis but no new recruits were coming on-stream.  Thankfully, we are gone beyond that and since the Garda College reopened, we have seen a total of 1,400 new Garda recruits, all of whom are now working across the country as fully fledged members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have in the region of 800 recruits on an annual basis and we have the funding to allow a further 800 next year.</p><p>Allowing for a retirement cohort of approximately 300, I estimate this will give us a net extra 500 garda&iacute; on the streets throughout the country.  By the end of this year, I expect the total figure to be approximately 13,500.  We are working steadily towards the target of a total workforce of 21,000 by 2021.</p><p> Of course, the Deputy is right and I understand the point he is making.  New garda&iacute; coming out of Templemore, fully attested and assigned their duties, should release the pressure on Garda overtime.  We will have more numbers in stations and a greater level of visibility.  That will allow the Garda to manage the overtime in a way that is somewhat different to the current situation.</p><p> I agree that in terms of quality of life, the optimum is something in the region of a 40-hour week.  That is accepted throughout the economy and society.  A situation where we have a permanent built-in overtime allowance might conflict with what might be regarded as a normal week's work.  I expect that as more recruits come on stream and as the numbers rise steadily &ndash; they will continue to rise steadily - in the coming years, we will have less reliance on an overtime bill.  Deputy Wallace is suggesting that bill is spiralling out of control.</p></speech>

In recent years, we have succeeded in bringing down unemployment from a high of 15.2% to almost 6% now.  That means there are job opportunities for people and choices that were not available at other times.  That has put considerable pressure on some aspects of the public service in terms of recruitment.</p> <p>  I am satisfied, on the basis of the figures available, that the recruitment of an appropriate number of staff to INIS will continue apace.  We have new requirements in respect of the passenger information unit as well.  I have looked at a profile of the personnel within INIS.  There is something of a turnover and something of a challenge with people leaving to take up other career opportunities.  It seems to me that if we can succeed in the recruitment campaign then the figures for 2018 will be re-adjusted in such a way as to reflect the spending of the moneys available this year that were not spent.</p></speech>

If the Department is finding it difficult to recruit people, officials might go down to Wexford to look for some staff.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware of the fleet on the motorways, in particular between here and Wexford, Cork and Limerick.  The Garda has high-powered Audi Q7 vehicles and other high-powered vehicles to ensure it is in a position to meet head-on the challenges posed by criminals.</p> <p>  Deputy Wallace referred to employment in Wexford.  I have heard the Deputy and my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kehoe, speak on this issue.  Deputy Wallace will be pleased to hear that I intend visiting Wexford at the earliest opportunity to perform the official opening of the new Garda headquarters in Wexford.  That is a fine example of cutting-edge technology and a building being made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of an ongoing building programme.  I hope to see the programme take on extra urgency next year in the context of outstanding Garda headquarters in Sligo, Clonmel, Macroom and throughout the country, including Wexford.  I will ensure that we have consequential follow-up on the new Garda station.</p> <p>  I am pleased to note that the new court house and court facilities in Wexford are almost completed as well.  I assure the Deputy that, from the justice perspective, every effort will be made to ensure first-class facilities are made available in the constituency of the Deputy, and I thank him for making continuous representations on this matter.</p></speech>

The opening of a new police station and a new court house does not change the fact that we have 15% unemployment.  I asked the Minister to identify other programmes where there was an underspend.  Perhaps he cannot.  I will move on to my last question.</p></speech>

The savings in the Property Registration Authority come to &euro;1 million and the savings in the Valuation Office come to a little less than &euro;1 million.  The underspend is mainly pay-related.  The full-year cost of additional recruitment during 2017 will not materialise until next year.  The main underspend relates to INIS.  Again, the saving in that area will be largely offset by overspends in areas such as the criminal legal aid scheme.</p></speech>

Did someone in the Department have to sign off on the extra costs attached to the special legal team of the former Commissioner, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, to deal with the Charleton inquiry?  We are aware of the fact that the head of Garda human resources, John Barrett, opposed it and said it was not a good idea.  Given this decision was going to cost money, did someone in the Department have to sign off on that from a procedural point of view?  Can the Commissioner of the day do as she sees fit in this area?</p></speech>

On the issue of Garda overtime, I welcome the fact that the Garda has had several successes this year.  Can the Minister explain the communications between the Department and senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that allowed such a circular to be distributed to chief superintendents?  There is a clear contradiction between what the Minister has elaborated on today and the elaboration of the Taoiseach yesterday on the one hand and what was circulated to the chief superintendents on the other.  Clearly the Department and the Minister were either not aware or did not approve that circular.  What communications took place around overtime?  How could such misinformation enter the public domain yesterday, when there appears to be overtime and a smooth process as the Minister has said today?</p> <p>  The episode gave the wrong message at the wrong time.  There was concern across many communities in Dublin and beyond.  Can the Minister explain the internal backdrop to such a misunderstanding and how it happened?  It is important that such a circular is not distributed again.  I hope it can be rectified internally with what the Minister is doing today.  What happened yesterday was of concern to many people and gave concern to many garda&iacute; who get overtime on a weekly basis.</p><p>I am not sure how it escalated to the degree it did without any explanation.</p></speech>

I was also very concerned which is why I was anxious matters would be clarified at the earliest opportunity.  Officials from my Department were in contact early yesterday morning with the office of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Commissioner.  Of course, it is not a Department circular; we are not required to sign off on internal Garda circulars.  However, coming towards the end of the year all organisations and companies are looking at their financial expenditure over the course of the year.  Garda overtime is an issue that has been the subject matter of great interest across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government is keen at all times to ensure sufficient funds are made available in order to meet the demands of security within the State.  I re-emphasise that we are dealing with an unprecedented sum of &euro;120 million for Garda overtime.  The manner in which this is expended on overtime across the country, including in this city, is entirely a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  There has been ongoing contact between the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform over recent months in order to ensure that sufficient funding was made available to meet the requirements of the Christmas season.  I share the Deputy's concern.  This was an internal memo that found its way into the public domain in a manner that caused alarm across communities.  I understand that a press release providing clarification was issued consequent to officials in my Department speaking directly to senior officials in the office of the Garda Commissioner.  I assure the Deputy that there is no absolute ban on overtime during the Christmas period.</p></speech>

Was there a refusal or reluctance in the Department to authorise the overtime?  Did that internal Garda memo issue to escalate matters between the Department and the Garda?  How did it reach the cliff edge?  Why was such a memo released?  Did the Department inform the Commissioner's office?  How long ago did the Minister inform them that this Supplementary Estimate would occur?  Why was that memo released in the interim period?  Surely they were informed in advance of the memo being released that the overtime would be authorised through the normal process, as it is every year - as it is in the Department of Health and in other areas.</p></speech>

However, the Garda is well aware, as is the committee, that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must remain within the overtime budget provided to it and, of course, that budget is kept under constant review.  The budget for 2018 starts in December.  I am sure the Garda was well aware of that as the Department of Justice and Equality was.  I assure the Deputy and members of the public that policing services will continue, including tackling organised crime, through Operation Hybrid with its importance in the Dublin metropolitan region and Operation Thor across the country.  Overtime will be available if and when required.</p></speech>

The proposal is that income from the rent a room scheme could be seen as an income disregard for the one-parent family payment.  The Minister and I have been back and forth on this already.  It fits with the rent a room scheme, for which there is a heavy tax incentive.  It fits with the crisis in student accommodation throughout the country and low-income households using the one asset they have to get a bit of additional income.  As things stand with any money that gets brought in from a household, almost exactly the same amount of money gets taken away from welfare payments, so there is no incentive whatsoever to do it.  I wanted to raise this in order that I can discuss it on Report Stage and I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I will not elaborate on the amendment in view of the fact the section has already been dealt with.  I tabled the amendment because the working family payment was the Government's big idea.  We were told a lot of work was being done on it.  It was going to replace the family income supplement, which was heavily criticised in the Fine Gael election manifesto for some good reasons.  We now find that what has happened is the family income supplement has been reintroduced but has just been renamed the working family payment.  The Minister recognised in the course of her Second Stage contribution the family income supplement as it stands, or the working family payment if we want to call it that now, needs to be altered because there are obvious poverty traps.  It could be altered in a number of ways which, I would argue, would benefit the Exchequer rather than the Exchequer losing.  The Minister has indicated she will do some work on this anyway.  The purpose of the amendment was for the Minister to come back here with her proposals within the next three months in order that we can discuss them to see how they achieve the objective she no doubt desires for them.</p></speech>

Three months is not a reasonable amount of time to have let the changes we are making now elapse to see what impact they will have.  Most of the amendments tabled today are about compiling reports on one thing or another, and all they would do is make work for us, whereas the work we are doing on the working family payment is something I want to work on continuously with the Oireachtas joint committee.  If and when we do make changes, I would like to be able to bring them back, suggest them and talk about them, and if committee members have enhancements to make to those changes, then let us work on them together.  The plan is to move what was the family income supplement into a new working family payment which gives more flexibility and picks away at the poverty traps identified by the Deputy to ensure they do not stay <i>in situ</i>.  I am very willing to come back to the committee during various stages, whenever the committee invites me or whenever I have something new to talk about, and go through it with the members.</p></speech>

When does the Minister think she will revert back to payments on 1 January?  Will it be 2019 or 2020?  Will the pattern of the future be that payments will be made a quarter of the way through the year?  From when it first started in 2015, people have fallen behind by three months.  When will that be recouped?</p></speech>

I cannot give a definitive answer because it entirely depends on the recovery of the economy.  As there is more money to spend and more money is given to me, we will have more money to do the things that we want to do.  As I said yesterday, if all we were doing this year was giving a &euro;5 increase and that was it, the likelihood is it could have started much earlier in the year, but because there were a variety of other issues that we needed to address this year, such as lone parent income disregards and the fuel allowance, I could not justify it.  This is why we tried to give as much as possible as early as possible to everybody.  As the economy recovers, I hope I will get more money, assuming I am still here, and if we get more money we will be able to pay people earlier.  The Deputy is right that it should be 1 January.  That is what it should be if things were perfect.  The economy is only recovering and we will get there.</p></speech>

This is to secure a proper debate on the issue.  The original amendment I submitted sought an intent to reinstate at the latest in the next budget.  Hopefully that would be earlier if possible.  It is a huge issue.</p><p> Last night approximately 60 women, and men, turned up outside Leinster House to highlight the issue.  It is really good to see people getting organised in this regard.  I have pulled out material by Michael Clifford from 2014 when it was only individuals who were coming forward and approaching Deputies to make representations for them.  We would then contact all the different groupings and the Minister on their behalf.  Now that more people have been hit - the figure is approximately 42,000 - it has become more of an issue.  People are demanding that this issue be addressed because they feel very discriminated against.  That was the feeling outside Leinster House last night.</p><p> The Minister stated earlier that the only motions on the agenda were for three-monthly reports but this report is already going through the process.  We are not asking for another report, it is just about ensuring that the report comes through within three months and is not delayed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-30a.1380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017113000002#F00200"><p>I have tabled a similar amendment No. 38, which looks for the report to be published and presented to us within a two-month timeframe in order that the changes can be made as soon as possible.  We have given the issue extensive discussion and debate at this committee and in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We know the impact this measure is having on 42,000 older people.  In fairness to the Minister, she has listened and has said she is prepared to act on it.  I do not question her sincerity in that regard.  I have a fear, however.  There are other reports out there and we have been promised changes on many other issues that unfortunately get held up and delayed elsewhere.  This is why it is essential that an amendment be made with a timeframe to hold the Government to account to produce this report.  Extensive work has gone in to publishing it and in going through all the data, including paper and computerised records.  We need to see that report.  The measure has had an impact across the board for 42,000 older citizens and their entitlements to their contributory pension.  We know it has discriminated more against older women.  It needs to be changed.  This is where I disagree; we need the report and I do not believe we can wait until next years' budget.  Having listened to what has been said I hope it can be implemented sooner than that.</p> <p>  My amendment has left out a timeframe, other than it needs to be implemented straight away, but we need the report within a two-month timeframe.  The work has been done on it and we need to see the report but more importantly, we need the changes brought in.  There have been conflicting messages from the Government about this.  I touched on this at a previous committee meeting.  The Taoiseach is saying one thing about moving towards addressing the issue through total contributions in 2021 but the Minister is saying something completely different.  We need the report.  I hope the difference in opinion - real or otherwise - at Government level will not hold back the publication of the report.  It is essential because if there are conflicting thoughts on the issue at Government level, an amendment such as this built into the Social Welfare Bill will hold the Government to producing the report.  Much hope has built up over the last number of months.  The figure of 42,000 people has grown on a yearly basis.  This time last year it was 35,000 or 36,000 older citizens ad now it is up to 42,000.  We have not even touched on the issue of retrospective payment.  The longer this anomaly is left to go on, the more older citizens will be punished because of what I describe as the grotesque changes that were made in 2012 to the changes to the rates and bands.  I will push amendment No. 38 to hold the Government to account to produce this report and, more importantly, to account for what actions will be taken to reverse the 2012 changes.</p></speech>

It was a very cold night and many of the people outside were in their 60s and 70s.  Obviously, many of them feel very strongly about this.  I communicated to them - in so far as I was able to - what the Minister had actually said, and they were quite heartened by that.  As Deputy Brady has said, they expect something to happen and they expect it to happen before next years' budget.  This is an injustice and every day this injustice continues, it becomes an even greater injustice.  The figure of 42,000 has been mentioned.  More than likely, according to the figures, it will be 52,000 next year.  It is not just about the 52,000 people who are directly affected.  A lot of people who are coming up to pension age are fearful that they will not get the full pension because of the averaging rule.  An awful lot of people will potentially be affected by this.  Will the Minister please run through the timeline again for what she proposes and within what period?</p></speech>

It was really good that she did this because we needed to clear up issues that had been in the public domain through the media.  I agree with Deputy O'Dea about needing more clarity and perhaps the Minister will outline the timeline as it relates to this issue.  It is an injustice that needs to be addressed.  We need to have a proper roadmap going forward to deal with the issue.</p></speech>

First, it is not a Government report.  It is a Department paper with resolutions to fix the anomaly.  That will be going to the next Cabinet sub-committee for discussion with the other people on that economics committee.  If it is agreed there, which I have no doubt it will be, it will then go to the Cabinet.  The timeline is that it will go to the next Cabinet sub-committee and if that takes place before Christmas it will be then and if it does not happen before Christmas it will be straight afterwards.  As soon as that Cabinet sub-committee meeting has been held, I will bring it to the very next Cabinet meeting.  I cannot put a timeline on that because I do not control the Cabinet sub-committees, except to say they happen exceptionally regularly.  The Cabinet happens every week and the Cabinet sub-committee meetings are held at least once per month.  Without having to put down an amendment, I could probably commit to it definitely going to the next Cabinet sub-committee meeting and once it has been discussed there, it will go to Cabinet.  I must put in a caveat that to reaffirm what I have said all along, in order to not give false hope that we are discussing a resolution to the issue in this Bill - we are not.  To fix this issue is going to cost new money that does not exist in this Bill.  The resolution will come from the Cabinet sub-committee and the Cabinet decision but it will have to be with regard to new money.</p></speech>

As we do not know what is in the report, we do not know what the sub-committee is accepting.  What if the Cabinet sub-committee does not accept the report?  This is a danger.  It is not 100% definite.  The Minister is not stating she knows the paper or the resolution will be accepted.</p><p>I do not mind which amendment we agree to propose.  I am prepared to consider with other members whether the period should be two months or three months.  It is very important we do not let this slip.  People are still very cautious and suspicious of the process of Government.  It is a blatant injustice.  If we do not get it sorted out in the next period of time, it will not be good for people.  Why is the Minister in no doubt that the Cabinet sub-committee will accept the report, that it will go to Cabinet and that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will say the Government will pay out?</p></speech>

We need to trawl through the more than 42,000 people to find out exactly where they were on the scale, how much money it will cost and what their circumstances were.  The paper will set out exactly what the problem is and the preferred way or ways to fix it and how much it will cost.  The reason I am confident it will be accepted is because everybody has said they want to fix this.  Everybody also recognises that it depends on how much it will cost.  The worst-case scenario is that it will be fixed in next year's budget.  If it does not cost as much as we think it will cost, it might happen sooner.  Nobody will say that is not the way to do it.  The discussion will be on where we will find the money.  The worst-case scenario is it will be the first thing on the list next October, November or December when people sit down to talk about budgets for next year, whoever happens to be in the hot seat.  That is the worst-case scenario.  There has been no indication that people will reject my proposals on how to fix this.  Who will pay for it is the issue that needs to be discussed.</p></speech>

The Minister and her predecessor, the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said there are always winners and losers.  I do not want the result to be that some people benefit by the reversal of the 2012 changes and others are losers.  It is a situation I do not want to arise and I do not want to be back here next year, on foot of new changes that have been made, discussing the losers, to use such terminology.  The Minister said that hopefully it will happen but it is not rock solid.  While the issue is a priority for everyone sitting around this table and for many Members of the D&aacute;il, I am not sure if it is a priority for Government.  It is important to have a timeframe built in so that it is not allowed to slip and does not fall down the pecking order of priorities if another emergency crops up in Government.  The 42,000 figure is growing month by month.  Putting a timeframe on it will show the level of importance the committee gives to the impact it is having on the 42,000 people who are directly impacted and their families.  It is essential that there is a timeframe.  It would be absolutely brilliant if the report and the Minister's recommendations could be delivered before that but hopefully we will not have to deal with a situation in which there are winners and losers again.</p></speech>

There will not be 60 pages, for example, hidden from members.  They will get everything.  Whatever goes to the Cabinet sub-committee will go to Cabinet and it will then be published.

If one had the requisite contributions, one was guaranteed a sum of &euro;800.  I have dealt with many cases in which people who qualified for the bereavement grant had to access the community welfare officer to get a top-up because the cost of funerals has been escalating quite steadily.  Now the only place one can get assistance is through the burial grant mechanism which used to be the old community welfare thing.  Many people are encountering a lot of hardship.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection seems to be assessing it on the same basis as before for people who already received the &euro;800 grant.  It is becoming more and more difficult and more and more people have to get into debt to meet funeral expenses.  I am not too concerned about a formal report.  I want the Department to have a look at this problem.  It is a real problem and I want the Department to look at it.</p><p>I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in this regard.</p></speech>

I would like to see a timeframe associated with it because it is left open-ended.  The Minister's predecessors promised reports and we are still waiting for them.  It is unfortunate that was not built into the amendment.  Cutting the bereavement grant was one of the cruellest cuts made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in government.  I am sure the Minister has heard stories of people trying to bury a loved one and, without access to this grant, are left at the mercy of the community welfare officer.  People tell me there is considerable discrepancy between different community welfare officers.  They do not adhere to the same criteria in their decision-making.  There are many issues there.</p> <p>  I support the amendment.  I am not sure if anything can be done at this stage to define a timeframe for delivery of the report.  It is having huge impact on people who need it.  It places an additional burden on other organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul where many people end up having to go.  In other cases people have to resort to loan sharks to help bury their loved ones, which is a disgrace.</p></speech>

When a loved one dies, the bereaved are all over the place emotionally.  They should not be forced to go to a community welfare officer and beg for support or else go to a loan shark.  It should be automatic for them to access that money as the bereavement grant did in the past.  The grieving process is hard enough without having the problem of getting money to bury a loved one.  The issue should be reviewed with the intention of coming back with something positive.</p></speech>

I had meant to stipulate a timeframe, but that did not happen for some reason.  I can withdraw the amendment and resubmit it on Report Stage with a timeframe.  However, I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.  Further to what Deputy Collins said, death is a sad time for a family and I have come across some very tragic cases.  As people are grieving and all over the place, the last thing they want to do is approach the local loan shark or go to the local credit union, getting into more debt.  It really is a very bad time.  While I do not know what it is like in the Minister's area, down in my side of the country it is a real problem and getting bigger.</p></speech>

The old bereavement grant was an insurance-based scheme.  Those who did not have their social contributions paid into the pot did not get anything out of it.  The people the Deputy is talking about, who are exceptionally vulnerable and going to the social welfare offices or loan sharks, are not the people who would have received the &euro;850 grant in many cases.</p></speech>

The average payment was &euro;3,800 per family who approached us.  There is no cap on that.  The Department did not have a budget of &euro;5 million and it was not a case of refusing people if we got to &euro;5 million.  If more people have a need for funeral expenses or any of the costs associated with bereavement, that is what we are there for.  The unexpected and unforeseen fits that category perfectly.  If we need some sort of campaign to let people the Deputy is dealing with know it is available to them, I am very happy to do that.</p> <p>  However, I am not happy to spend &euro;25 million or &euro;30 million to reintroduce it in the way it was, paying it to people who do not need it, thereby reducing the amount of money I have to spend on the people the Deputy is talking about.  I do not mean to be disrespectful to them.  I know they work hard, as does everybody, but the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is supposed to be helping the people who have absolutely no other means but social welfare to help them get through difficult times.  People who do not need it do not need the State to give them &euro;850.  That is my first gut feeling.</p> <p>  On the amendment, I am not even sure how I could compile the report the Deputy is requesting.  He seems to be asking me to go back to all the people who would have got the &euro;850 and ascertain how not getting it impacted them.  I am genuinely not sure how I would do that, irrespective of whether it is bound by a timeline.  I am not sure what I would be asking.  I ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing the amendment.  I would be happy for him to put in a suggestion that we should advertise in some way the supports that are genuinely available and to assure people there is no cap.</p> <p>  I believe Deputy Brady suggested that different criteria were being used in different areas.  That is the case because Deputy Brady's needs will not be the same as Deputy Collins's needs.  It is based on the individual's particular circumstances.  There is not a cap of &euro;100.  I do not want to sound shallow, but it is about the individual person or family and we address it on the basis of their requirements.  The average payment is &euro;3,800.</p></speech>

That is completely incorrect.  Many people who are on low wages and already paying social insurance are supported by FIS.  A family's circumstances can change.  That is absurd.</p> <p>  I am afraid a campaign will not do the business.  There is no point in having a campaign.  The people I am talking about are already aware of the burial grant.  They come to me and other public representatives to look for the burial grant.  In my area when we apply for the burial grant, we find that relatively early in the year the Department is saying that most of the money it intended to spend on this has already been spent.

Unfortunately, we cannot propose changes which would have a financial impact on the Exchequer, but we know the issue of fuel poverty is very real and faces many people in our society.  A conservative estimate shows that approximately 28% of the population are currently facing fuel poverty.  Ireland has the highest level of excess winter fatalities in Europe.  Last year it was in the region of 2,800, which is a huge figure.  More than 170,000 of our older citizens rely on the fuel allowance.  Obviously fuel poverty does not only impact on our older citizens and also impacts on people right across the board, but older citizens are certainly more susceptible to the cold.  We all hear horror stories of our older citizens having to sit in public buildings such as libraries and council offices during the winter months to keep warm.  We all know of the changes which were made to the fuel allowance which cut the period for which the allowance was payable from 32 weeks down to 25.  It is back up to 27 weeks now, which is a small but welcome step in the right direction, but the period is still five weeks shorter than it was in 2012 when the cuts were first made.  It is a real issue and a very serious one which faces our citizens right across the board.</p><p>It is important that a full report is carried out on the impact, good, bad or indifferent, of cuts implemented to the fuel allowance and on how they affect our older citizens.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge and welcome the changes the Minister introduced in respect of the payment of the fuel allowance at this stage.  I put forward a proposal for a bulk payment during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill 2016, a proposal which was being pushed by organisations such as Age Action Ireland among others.  That has now been implemented and there are two payments a year.  That is a welcome step.  I hear good reports from people on that measure.  We are still a long way away from the provisions before the 2012 cuts which, as I have said, are having a real detrimental impact.  Some 28% of our population are facing fuel poverty.</p><p>That percentage is growing so we need a report on that issue.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

The cut, from six weeks initially to five weeks now, has put huge pressure on people.  Fuel poverty exists and it should be acknowledged and recorded for posterity, particularly when the big companies are talking about fuel increases in February or March next year, which will put further pressure on people.  We might consider the potential of having it index-linked to increases, but some progressive measure should be considered that would make a difference to people because that increase will impact on them.  I am aware that many people are very happy with the bulk payment option in terms of oil or whatever fuel they have to buy.  It has made a difference, but I support the amendment.</p></speech>

The figure of 28% is frightening because it is more than one in four.  It has been exacerbated by the cuts to the fuel allowance but the partial restoration, however small, is very welcome.  I do not know if doing a report on the matter will bring any immediate improvements but I do not see any reason a report would not be done.  The Minister should give serious consideration to this amendment.  All it asks is that a report be done.  I know the Civil Service and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are very busy but it is an issue that will have to be tackled across Departments.  It is not just a Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection issue so if the Government is to look at this as a Government, it would be very useful to have something like that as a reference point.</p></speech>

We have to acknowledge that there are many people who are still experiencing difficulties in heating their homes, which is why we increased the fuel allowance period by one week this year.  I would have loved to have been able to increase it by two or three weeks but we did not have the money.  The commitment I will give the Deputies is that if I am here next year, it will go up further.  I will probably have the legs cut off me, so to speak, for saying that because next year is next year but I say that because I cannot commit to doing a report as it does not fall within my remit.</p> <p>  However, a report entitled A Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty was released only last year.  Apparently, it covers ambitions and recommendations to follow through from 2016 to 2020.  It is a very comprehensive report and I can get the Deputies a copy of it if it would be helpful, not to be smart.  However, if the Deputy presses the amendment and I lose on it today and I have to compile a report, it will not be me or my Department that will compile it.  It will be the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I then fall into a difficulty of the Deputy saying I have to have something done within three months when it will not be me who will be doing it but somebody else who will be doing it.  I ask that between now and Report Stage the Deputy might read the other report to see if he is happy with the suggestions and recommendations in it.  If there is anything in that report that he believes we can further progress, maybe by index-linking or something else, I would ask him to look at it that way.</p></speech>

I am well aware that there are many reports published.  Age Action Ireland and all the other agencies have carried out extensive, thorough work on this issue.  They have been to the fore in pushing it forward and putting pressure on Government.  I am sure that was factored into the partial restoration of the weeks that had been cut.  There are many reports available but having one carried out by whatever Department - it probably needs to be done across a number of Departments - is putting it on a statutory footing.  The recommendations it would make would put pressure on Government.  I am sure this committee and others will put pressure on Government to do it because the other reports are from agencies.  They are not actionable by Government.  It puts some pressure on but while we have had one week's restoration in the fuel allowance, it is staying at &euro;22.50 a week.  That has been static for many years.  We are still way behind where we should be because we see the cost of electricity, gas and solid fuel increasing.  I have come across cases where elderly people in particular have to ration their fuel.  They buy one or two bags of coal a month and divide it up so they know exactly how much coal they have to burn from one day to the next.  That is not right.</p> <p>  While the partial restoration and the bulk payment is welcome, in reality we are way behind where we were in 2012, both in terms of the weeks that have been cut and the fact that the payment of &euro;22.50 is static.  We need a comprehensive and thorough report on the issue, irrespective of what Department does it.</p></speech>

What the proposer of the amendment has in mind, if I interpret him correctly, is that we have something to show the impact of the cuts on the actual levels of fuel poverty and how much of an impact it would have on fuel poverty on an incremental basis if those cuts were gradually restored.  I believe that would be useful.  I suggest that the Minister would give this amendment further consideration between now and Report Stage.  On balance, I think it would be useful.</p></speech>

Apparently, it is the first ever Government strategy on affordable energy and it will give Departments specific tasks.  Unfortunately, none of those relates to my Department and therefore even if Deputy Brady wins on this amendment, I cannot tell another Department to do something that does not have anything to do with me.  Much and all as I stick my nose into many places that are not my business, I know what I would be told in this case.  However, in terms of what Deputy O'Dea said, an element that might be worth pursuing is to look at the impact of the cuts.  That might help me so I can-----</p></speech>

I may not have been clear on that.  It is about the cuts, the increase in fuel prices and the impact that has had on recipients of the fuel allowance.  There needs to be a specific focus on all of that because I believe it is very much a targeted payment going into the pockets of the people who need it the most.  With the increase in fuel costs we need to determine how much extra we need to put in people's pockets to see them being lifted out of that fuel poverty trap.  A report and, more importantly, recommendations on all of those aspects would be very useful.</p></speech>

The changes that were made to social welfare rates amount to age discrimination against young unemployed people.  I have pushed previous Ministers on this and the impact it is having.  In the context of housing and homelessness, the reduced payment is having a serious impact and I know that several agencies have made direct reference to that.  In the view of those working in the area, there is a direct link between the reduction in this payment and the prolonging of homelessness for some young people.  It is discrimination and we must call it for what it is.  I know the Minister will say that anyone who agrees to go onto any scheme will get an increase in his or her payment and that is fine.  However, the Minister's predecessor came out with some ludicrous comments at a committee meeting some time ago.  He said that he could not understand how young foreigners can get off a plane in Ireland and get a job at the drop of a hat and that this raises questions as to what our young unemployed people are doing.  I did not say that.  It was the previous Minister, now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who said it, or words to that effect.</p> <p>  The reality is that the youth unemployment rate is double the unemployment rate.  Some areas, including Arklow in County Wicklow in my own constituency, are youth unemployment black spots, with levels well above the national average.  Not only are we forcing people to continue living at home with their parents, we are also forcing them to live on buttons.  How someone has not taken a legal challenge to this is beyond me.  I believe it should be challenged and that such a challenge would be successful.  </p> <p>  I will certainly be supporting this amendment.</p></speech>

I would ask Deputies to withdraw the amendment because we are currently conducting a review.  Under the pathways to work action plan, we have committed to conducting a review of the impact of the changes made to social welfare payments to young people under the ages of 26 and 24.  That review is not going to be finalised until later this year.  The delay in finalising it is due to the fact that there is a piece of work being undertaken by NUI Maynooth at the moment.  It has nothing to do with the Department and was not commissioned by us.  It is being conducted to determine the impact of the reduction in the rates on participation in education.  That will feed into telling me whether what we did worked in terms of the original intentions.  I am as keen to find out about this as other Deputies.</p><p>That is why in this year's budget we gave everybody in those age categories the full &euro;5 increase rather than a percentage thereof as they would have received last year and the year before.  I acknowledge it is a small amount.  If the Deputy could give me a little more time, I could agree to the amendment but I cannot agree to it in the short term because I will not have received the research from NUI Maynooth.</p></speech>

That sounds like a very long time, but given that one is only now receiving reports that were asked for at this time last year, it probably is not that long a time.</p></speech>

Although it is not my amendment, I am concerned by the proposed nine-month timeframe.  I welcome that the issue is being considered and I would think it essential that whatever report is published be produced in time to feed into next year's budgetary process.  A six-month timeframe could be given because the budgetary process will approximately start in July.  It is essential that whatever report is produced and whatever recommendations it contains be available in time to feed in to the budgetary process.</p></speech>

If Deputy Gino Kenny were to amend his amendment for Report Stage to specify a six month timeframe rather than three, would the Minister be disposed to accept it?</p></speech>

Because I did not commission the report, I do not know when it will be finished.  It could be finished in two months or five.  Deputy Kenny may amend the amendment to specify six months but if we come back in six months' time and the report is not available, he must not be aggrieved.  I want to be able to give the committee a full report.  The report is being produced in order to feed in to budgetary decisions next year.</p> <p>  Giving young people the full &euro;5 increase was not a sign that we think we are being discriminatory.  The purpose of the measures is to incentivise young people to take other options rather than stay on the live register.  Although Deputies may laugh at me when I say that, I believe we should have greater ambition for our young people than for them to stay on the live register. </p> <p>  I am in the Deputy's hands.  The report will be completed in any case.  Its purpose is to ensure that at this time next year we will have information in order to allow us to make changes in next year's budget.</p></speech>

If I have made a mistake and will not be able to do it for a particular reason, I will not have a problem admitting that and will tell Deputies why I cannot do it.  My intention in considering the report is to see if what we have done has worked.  If it has not, it must be changed.  I am very conscious of that, which is why I am currently in discussions with the Commissioner about an extension and a slight change to the youth guarantee fund because a large number of those under 25 are not ready for employment and there are a variety of reasons for that.  It is not because they do not go out on a Tuesday and get a job.  There are a couple of significant barriers to employment and I need extra money to try to help those young people become employment ready.  I will do that this year if I can get extra money from the Commissioner.  I want to examine whether the changes we have made have worked.  If they have, that is to be welcomed, but if they did not work, I will have no problem changing them.  No matter who the Minister is, we are here to help people get out of situations whereby they cannot afford a proper standard of living and to try to help them better themselves through training or upskilling or to ensure that those in other situations have a decent fixed income to have a satisfactory life.</p></speech>

It addresses an area the Government has consistently not looked at in respect of raising money.  In other European countries, utilising employers' PRSI to provide services for their citizens is a key and significant factor.  Although I cannot currently lay my hands on the figures, an increase of 2% in employers' PRSI would garner over &euro;1 billion.  That should be considered as a progressive tax to be allocated to public services.  From reports I have seen regarding the situation in France and similar countries, people there do not pay more tax than Irish citizens in terms of PAYE or similar.</p><p>It is actually the employers' pay related social insurance, PRSI, that gives them the leeway to provide more services through the health service and so on, so I certainly support the amendment.</p></speech>

I tabled an amendment on bogus self-employment.  I did not get to speak on it, but obviously there is a serious issue there.  I have spoken to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, extensively, as have others.  We are missing out on PRSI contributions from employers through the establishment of bogus self-employment arrangements.  However, there is a broader issue there.  Look at the EU average.  Across the board, we are way behind on the level at which employers pay PRSI contributions.  If we came up to the EU average, it would be worth an extra &euro;8 billion a year.  There are huge issues facing us, including, obviously, the ticking time bomb in our pension system.  There are serious issues that we have to face up to here, so I will be supporting this amendment.  An extensive and very thorough piece of work needs to be done on all of this.  Hopefully, this will be the start, and I support it.</p></speech>

To make that comparison, would we not need a similar comparison of workers' rates of PRSI?  The employer and the employee pay PRSI.  What is important is the combined amount.  That comparison would be useful but we would need a comparison of both and not just the employer.  Employers' PRSI is low here by international standards, about which there is no doubt.</p></speech>

We have got the actuarial review to tell us what the state of it is, and we will probably launch a public consultation on pensions and the automatic enrolment provision that we are hoping to go forward with, if not next Tuesday, then the following Tuesday.  The only reason I mention that is that employer contributions will match the employee contributions, and contributions will be taken automatically from both employers and employees once that comes on board.  That is a cost associated with the employers.</p> <p>  There is also a wider scoping exercise being done at the moment of social insurance contributions made by all classes, not just those of employees but of employers.  It is in the context of what the European norms are.  I totally agree that, based on European norms, we are much lower, both on employee contributions and employer contributions.  However, we also have to recognise that those in countries who pay more get much more out of it, because this would be a social insurance contribution.  It is not something that could be spent on health or education.  It would have to be spent on the employees.  The review is currently being done.  I indicated at the time of the actuarial review's publication that we would spend the next couple of months conducting that review.  Again, I will do some of what members have asked me to do, but I definitely cannot do it within three months because it just is not physically possible.</p> <p>  However, what I cannot agree to, apart from the three-month period specified in the amendment, is the provision requiring me to lay a report before the House on the proposals to increase employers' PRSI, because I do not yet know if we will or not.  I will not know that until we have the full picture of what we can get, what changes we need, and what future funding we need.  That will determine whether one's insurance contribution or one's employer's insurance contribution will be increased.  That piece of work is going to be done.  It has been started off the back of the actuarial review that we received at the end of October.  It will be done in the next couple of months, and once I have that report, I can certainly lay it before the joint Oireachtas committee.  However, it is only when I have that information that I will be able to determine how much everybody pays.  What will determine that is the amount that we will need to have a sustainable pension fund going forward.</p></speech>
