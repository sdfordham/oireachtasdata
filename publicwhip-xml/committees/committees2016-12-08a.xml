We have in attendance our youngest stakeholder yet, Ms Jane Hayes-Nally, who is very welcome.  We are delighted to have the input of second level students.  I welcome Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, chairman of the governing authority at NUI Galway, Professor John Hegarty from the Royal Irish Academy, Dr. Catherine Day, chairman of the governing authority of University College Cork, and Ms Annie Hoey, president of the Union of Students in Ireland, some of whose members I had the opportunity to meet the day before yesterday in Buswells Hotel when they were making a presentation.  I also welcome Mr. Kieran McNulty, president of Trinity College Dublin Students Union.  We had the pleasure of meeting and discussing this subject briefly during the summer.  Ms Jane Hayes-Nally is president of the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  The witnesses are here to discuss the findings of the Cassells report, Investing in National Ambition: A Strategy for Funding Higher Education.  I acknowledge again the excellent work of Mr. Peter Cassells, his secretariat and all the members in bringing this piece of work before us.  This is the third day on which we have had the opportunity to have witnesses in to discuss the various options and the potential impact on those they represent.</p><p>I wish to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that any submissions or opening statements they make to the committee today will be published on the committee's website following this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I call Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness to make her opening statement.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I am, of course, very grateful to the committee for this opportunity to join in the current discussion on the funding of higher education and of the report of the Expert Group on Future Funding for Higher Education, normally known as the Peter Cassells group.  I am speaking here in my capacity as cathaoirleach of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na hOllscoile, the governing body of NUI Galway, NUIG.  In that capacity, I work closely with the president of NUIG, Professor James Browne, and with the other leaders of the university.  The &uacute;dar&aacute;s works with many of the academics and county councillors from the area, and also the student union leadership.  It is to some extent also relevant that, for some years previously, I was chair of the Irish Universities Quality Board.  That body has now been subsumed into Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, which is all about the quality of our higher education.<br/><br/>The committee will already have received the relevant submission made to it by the Irish Universities Association, IUA, together with the opening statement by Professor Don Barry of University of Limerick.  I am in general agreement with the points made by Professor Barry, and with the detailed arguments made in the IUA submission.  There is obviously no need for me to go into all the various tables and figures as I am in agreement with them.  I welcome the report of the expert group, so ably led by Mr. Peter Cassells.  The report clearly sets out the national benefits of investment in the higher education area.  <br/><br/>The difficulties caused by ten years of cutbacks in higher education funding have been extreme.  A crucial part of the work of the governing body, or &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na hOllscoile, concerns financial and budgeting issues.  The &uacute;dar&aacute;s members and I are acutely conscious of the constant effort by those in the university to stretch available resources to cover essential needs and to source funding from internal sources and external sources, through research grants, help from alumni and every other possible source.  It is a constant struggle.  In his opening statement, Professor Barry, as chair of the IUA, refers to the purpose of investment in higher education, which is the priority of the committee, as follows:</p><blockquote>Firstly, the more complex and changing world for which we are educating students, requires more sophisticated educational approaches.  The [Cassells] group captures this well in identifying the need to invest in improved student staff ratios, smaller tutorial groups, more one-to-one contact with students, more project work, enhanced feedback and more time to engage in diverse learning styles and to support at-risk students.</blockquote> <p>These are precisely the affected areas in NUIG.  That NUIG has succeeded, I am very proud to say, in moving up the ranking table of universities, by contrast with others, perhaps, does not mean we have found more money for ourselves, that we are better off or that we are not struggling all the time to make whatever investment is required to meet our needs.  At the coalface, in the oversight of the realities of university life, we in NUIG are only too aware of the difficulty, and sometimes impossibility, of meeting the needs of students.  If we fail to meet them, we also weaken the international standing of our universities.  More important, we fail this country and we fail our students.<br/><br/>The Cassells report identifies three groups that benefit from higher education &ndash; the State, students and employers.  The point of view of employers has been clearly set out in a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>by Mr. Danny McCoy, chief executive of IBEC, in which he states accepting the status quo is incompatible with our national ambitions and will condemn Ireland to become an education and research backwater.  Mr. McCoy adds: &quot;Ireland's reputation for having one of the best educated work forces in the world becomes increasingly threatened&quot;.  He concludes: &quot;Failure to invest now in third level will place an entire generation of students and the future of this country at a serious disadvantage&quot;. <br/><br/>Both the Cassells report and the IUA submission recommend that investment in higher education come from three sources.  It should involve a funding system involving the State, students and employers.  I agree with this conclusion and with the need to investigate the setting up of a loan system whereby graduates would contribute when their earnings reach a certain level.  This is an urgent matter and not one to be put off for another distant commission.<br/><br/>In considering the specific position of NUIG, the committee should not forget the importance of the university's statutory and strategic obligation to an Gaeilge, the Irish language.  In Vision 2020, NUIG's strategic plan for the period 2015 to 2020, under the heading &quot;Pobal na Gaeilge agus an Gaeltachta&quot;, reference is made to the university's statutory obligations regarding the provision of education through Irish and its commitment to respond to the living needs of the Irish-speaking community regionally and nationally.</p><p>NUIG is the primary national provider of post-primary initial teacher education through the medium of Irish.  Acadamh na hOllscola&iacute;ochta Gaeilge, established in 2004, operates fully through Irish and is responsible for the development and delivery of academic programmes, research and other services through the medium of Irish.  The university operates Gaeltacht centres in An Ceathr&uacute; Rua and Carna in County Galway and in Gaoth Dobhair in County Donegal.  All that requires investment both by the HEA and the university itself.<br/><br/>NUI Galway is the major higher education institution in the west, and serves the student population of the west and north west.  It is designated by the Higher Education Authority as the leader of a group of higher education centres in this entire area.  In considering the funding of higher education the committee must look at the population of students which is served.  There is a degree of prosperity in the city of Galway area but it cannot be doubted that in the rural areas of Galway, Mayo and Donegal students and their parents are unlikely to have the means to meet large upfront fees.  As my own son and his family live in An Spid&eacute;al and his children have been educated there I am well aware that the average family in the Gaeltacht and in Connemara generally will find university costs as fixed at present extremely difficult to meet.<br/><br/>&quot;A Reminder of Inequality in Society&quot; was the lead headline on <i>The Irish Times</i>list of feeder schools for third level institutions.  This committee, in its present discussion, must deal with the needs of society, of the economy and of higher education providers.  It must do so with justice.  Above all, it must deal with the needs of young people.  It must find the courage to move on this issue now.</p></speech>

I should have acknowledged that she is a former Member of the House also, having been a Member of the Seanad for many years.  She gave great and distinguished service to the Seanad.

The Royal Irish Academy is an independent body representative of academics across the entire country, North and South, who are elected on the basis of their achievements.<br/><br/>Regarding the background to the problem at hand, since 2008 the higher education system in Ireland has seen a very severe divestment of its funding base.  There has been a 38% decline in State grants from 2007 to 2014 while student numbers have increased by 25%.  There has been a 22% decrease in funding per student from &euro;11,000 to &euro;9,000 despite the student contribution charge trebling.  Academic and support staff numbers have fallen by 2,000 from 19,000 in that period.  The higher education capital budget has been reduced by 85%.  Despite the best efforts of committed staff to be more efficient and entrepreneurial and the patience of students, the net effect of the cuts is a significant decline in quality and the system is now, sadly, firmly on a downward slope.  That is evidenced by recent falls in the international university rankings and a deterioration in the student-staff ratio from 16:1 to 20:1.  The OECD average is 14:1.  The ratio is an important measure of the degree of personal interaction and mentoring between staff and students.<br/><br/>Investment in infrastructure across the system has also fallen from more than &euro;200 million in 2008 to &euro;35 million in 2014 with a resulting negative impact on the quality of the system's capital stock and infrastructure.  Added to that are the increased demands of the projected demographic increase in student numbers over the next 15 years.  It is clear that the system really is in crisis.  A strong, vibrant and internationally competitive higher education system is critical to Ireland's social, cultural and economic life.  Action is urgently needed to redress the crisis by increasing the scale of investment in higher education.  Recent external international shocks such as the Brexit referendum in the UK and threats to continued foreign direct investment make the case ever more compelling.  The future is about talent not tax.<br/><br/>The publication of the Cassells report is an important step in the development of a clear pathway for a sustainable future for the system.  The RIA welcomes the report and endorses its findings.  In its submission to the expert group the RIA suggested a new approach from the <i>status quo</i>, acknowledging that while further resources are needed the reality is that the State is unlikely and unwilling to carry the burden of the entire cost.  The RIA's proposals were similar to the final proposals of the expert group, showing a significant degree of consensus.  The RIA proposed a multifaceted approach to meet the required annual additional investment in the system, which we calculated at approximately &euro;1 billion.  That includes a 25% to 30% increase in staff to improve the student-staff ratio to 16:1, which is still below the OECD average.  Further growth in student numbers should only be considered following that adjustment in the interests of quality.<br/><br/>The cost of further investment in higher education should be borne equitably by its key stakeholders &ndash; the State, students and the institutions themselves.  An emergency capital investment fund of &euro;580 million per annum over ten years should be established to fund major repairs and replacements for existing capital stock.  Institutions should also be allowed to operate an annual surplus which could be used for infrastructural maintenance.  The student contribution charge should be replaced by a new student fee and support mechanism which would offer students the option of deferred payment through an income-contingent student loan and the opportunity to borrow living and maintenance costs.<br/><br/>I will say a final word about access.  The average annual cost of attending college away from home is up to &euro;11,000, while the maximum grant available is under &euro;6,000.  Those costs, coupled with the requirement for the upfront payment of fees, has had a detrimental effect on access.  A total of 40% of families borrow to finance participation in higher education and that has had a particularly negative effect on lower income groups which tend to be more debt averse.  Any new higher education funding model should therefore include provision for a well-developed student support system.  Income contingent student loans would have a positive effect by removing the need for upfront payment.  Part-time education, which provides an alternative higher education pathway for many, could also be incentivised by allowing part-time students to avail of the student supports available to their full-time classmates.  That could be supplemented by the introduction of a new tax relief for part-time post-graduate students.  The RIA commends the committee on its important work and looks forward to working with it as it builds consensus on how best to address this most critical issue at this most critical time for this country.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Catherine Day" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#D00500"><p>Thank you, Chair, for inviting me to make a presentation here today.  You referred to my previous role and I wish to make that my starting point.  When I was Secretary General of the European Commission I was deeply involved in the Europe 2020 strategy, which is the EU's strategy for growth and jobs.  I was also very involved in ensuring that third level education was one of the quantified targets of the strategy for the EU.  The point of making it a quantified target was to put the right emphasis on the hugely important role of higher education in ensuring Europe's future well-being and prosperity.  To ensure the European social model can continue to deliver on the high aspirations we have for citizens, it is necessary to invest more in the higher education system.</p><p>Coming from my previous background I naturally think it is very important that we set future Irish higher education policy in a broader European context.  That context has been given greater relevance by the recent Brexit development. </p><p> I am here today as chair of the governing body of UCC.  It has been interesting for me to have the opportunity to see how a key European policy is implemented on the ground.  I have also seen the real difficulties of trying to deliver an internationally high standard of university education with restrained resources.  </p><p> In the past ten years UCC has seen its undergraduate numbers grow from just over 11,500 to 13,000 and postgraduate students have increased to just over 4,000.  At the same time the increases have happened State funding has fallen by 38%.  On the one hand, the number of students has grown but, on the other hand, there is less money.  Faced with such a difficult situation, UCC supported by its governing body has practiced prudent budget management and not built up a significant deficit in difficult years.  This has been achieved at a cost, as previous speakers have said.  There has been limited investment in new facilities and increased staff-student ratios.  It is true that we can manage cutbacks and a lack of investment from one year to the next but we all know that postponing much needed investment just  pushes the problem down the road and makes it bigger in the medium-term.  It is critically important to remember that such a measure  affects the quality of education delivered.</p><p> In common with other universities, UCC has seen its staff-student ratio increase dramatically from 1:21 in 2006 to 1:26 plus today.  As we have just heard, the OECD average is 1:14 so the UCC is far out of line with the average OECD ratio.  An increased staff-student ratio has had a dramatic impact on the quality of education because it means less individual attention for students, reduced practical experience in laboratories and a reduced amount of tutorials or abolishing them completely.  An increased ratio has lots of impacts on vital aspects of a university education.   This is one of the reasons why Irish universities have fallen down the international ranking tables.  Reduced funding also means increased stress for staff, which has tempted some of them to move abroad.  Reduced funding has also reduced the capacity of UCC to attract the best academics in their fields of expertise.</p><p> Ireland rightly prides itself on traditionally putting a high value on education.  According to a recent report from the European University Association&rsquo;s public funding observatory, Ireland together with a few other countries like Croatia, Greece, Spain, Serbia and the UK have been classified as "systems in danger" because our funding to universities has decreased while student numbers have grown.</p><p> In common with the other speakers this morning, UCC views the Cassells report as setting out a compelling case for investing in national ambition through better funding for higher education.  UCC thinks that the report rightly puts an emphasis on investment, quality and verification.  The recent submission by the Irish Universities Association to this committee endorsed the Cassells report and its findings.  In my view, the IUA made a very reasoned case for increased investment in this sector.  Investment is at the heart of this issue.  We can go on as we are, failing to invest enough in our universities and for some time we will still have a somewhat functioning university sector.  However,  it will not be a university sector that can deliver on individual or collective expectations as a society.  All of this matters.  It matters to our competitiveness, our influence in the world and our ability to satisfy the aspirations of our citizens.</p><p> It has sometimes been said that funding for higher education is an elite issue but I disagree.  Just over half of our younger population have third level education.  Most parents work very hard to give their children the best possible education and today that means third level for the majority.  Therefore, such education has become the norm and a necessity if we are to maintain our standard of living into the future.  Investing in human capital is even more important than investing in physical infrastructure, particularly for a small open economy like ours that relies on trade and inward investment for its well-being.</p><p> There have been many calls for public funding and almost everyone can make a special case for increased funding.  I am not arguing that universities should be put ahead of other deserving priorities.  Instead, I wish to argue strongly that higher education is among the top priorities.</p><p> In my view three things must be done at the same time.  First, Ireland needs unequivocally to go for high standards in third level education.  We should not be satisfied to be in the lower half of EU members states in this sector.  Going for excellence in our university sector should be a public goal and the means to deliver same should follow.</p><p> Second, public investment in the university sector needs to be put on a sound footing.  Therefore, current and capital expenditure must grow to improve quality and meet demographic demand.  I will not go into all of the figures and data because they are available in excellent reports that have been published recently.  The argument has been extremely well made.  In my view, the Brexit context adds urgency to the need for funding and investment decisions now because they take time to come through in terms of results.</p><p> Third, universities need to diversify their sources of funding and they are all doing so.  There has been a tendency during the financial crisis to micro manage the sector using the threat of reduced funding to obtain compliance.  This approach has had a stifling effect and reduced the autonomy of universities.  I argue that as long as universities do not create new liabilities for the public purse then they should be given the flexibility and agility to generate funding and deploy resources to best effect, subject to supervision by their governing authorities.  Governance in the universities sectors has greatly improved in recent years.  A climate of greater trust between officialdom and the universities is needed to ensure that the universities deliver a top quality outcome in terms of well qualified students and high quality research.</p><p> Like the previous speakers, I support the conclusions of the Cassells report and the submission made by the Irish Universities Association.  Like them, I stress the urgency of taking clear decisions on future funding that provides adequately for sufficient investment to deliver high quality.  The universities have the capacity to deliver the kind of higher education system that this country needs going into the future and that they are eager to do so.  Unfortunately, they cannot do so without a significantly increased and sustainable future funding model.</p></speech>

Members can ask questions and indicate whether they want clarifications on anything that has been said by the first three contributors but first I will address a few questions to Mrs. Justice McGuinness.  I noted from her submission that she agreed with the idea that the funding system should involve the State's students and employers.  She called for an investigation into how a loan system could work for students.  Can she expand on her preferred design for such a system?  How does she envisage people with limited means can be encouraged to avail of these loans?  Access to education is hugely important and is an aspiration for all of us.  Would a loan system impact on inequality?</p> <p>  I liked the language that Professor Hegarty used in his submission when he suggested that the student contribution charge be replaced by what he called a "new student fee and support mechanism".  He did not simply call it a loan.  He also talked about the option of deferred payments using the income contingent loan and the opportunity to borrow living and maintenance costs.  He made a good case for the  costs incurred by students who must live away from home.  He shared the concern about people needing access to higher education as a means to enhance their potential. </p> <p>  I thank Dr. Daly for her interesting comments on the European context.  She painted the picture of increased student numbers and reduced Exchequer financing and how both have led to a failure to invest.  She also said that universities need to diversify their sources of funding.  I would be interested to hear more about the topic and also more about the impact of Brexit.</p> <p>  I now call members to ask questions and call Deputy Thomas Byrne to commence.</p></speech>

I wanted to ask Dr. Day something.  I thank her for being here and for all her service in the organisations in which she is involved.  It is a labour of love for many of the witnesses.  Dr. Day has considerable experience at European level.  I know the European Union does not specifically have education competence like we have.  Anyway, there are different systems of funding university education.  Other witnesses present will tell us about Germany and other countries where student contributions are not significant, where no student loan scheme exist or where funding is provided by the State.  Dr. Day has considerable experience of the European Commission.  Has she any insight into whether we should go for a loan scheme or why other countries do not have one?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#F00200"><p>I thank the deputations for their presentations.  We are all in agreement that we cannot continue with things as they are.  Under something changes, the quality of education in Ireland - something we have always been proud of - will plummet.</p> <p>  I have concerns similar to those raised by other members in respect of access.  I taught in a DEIS school for 16 years and I have seen the joy when the first child in a family declares intent to go to third level.  I have concerns that this move would diminish that incentive and that the loan would frighten the child, especially when they turn to parents who do not fit the typical support model to which the rest of us may be accustomed.  They may not get the necessary support at home.  Those are my thoughts on that point.</p> <p>  I am keen to hear from all the deputations on the potential impact of loans on emigration.  The statistics show that 20% of graduates emigrate and 10% emigrate on a permanent basis.  If it is the case that a person who stays abroad would not have to pay back the loans - it appears that it might be &ndash; will this lead to a complete brain drain?  Will our most wonderful and brilliant graduates stay abroad rather than repay?  One impact is that the loans would not be paid back and we would suffer the loss of wonderful graduates.  That needs to be explored.</p> <p>  How does Dr. Day see Brexit impacting on our universities and institutes of technology?</p> <p>  My final question is a general question for all three deputations.  I am curious about the drop-out rates, including the drop-out rates from universities to institutes of technology and from institutes of technology to post leaving certificate courses.  When students discover a lack of suitability and change around there is a loss of fees.  Is there a broader issue?  Do we need to explore something like the dual system in Germany?  Would that help to address it?  Is that something this country should explore?</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;or-thabhachtach go bhfuilimid ag pl&eacute; an &aacute;bhair seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; in am agus t&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im, mar is eol d&uacute;inn, sna hollscoileanna ar fud na t&iacute;re.  I have serious concerns.  My party has been advocating for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.  We have major concerns.  We have examined the research in England, where loans were introduced some time ago.  We have seen a fall of 14% in mature students and a fall of 40% in part-time students.  Let us consider lone parents.  One child in five comes from a lone-parent family.  This will have a catastrophic effect.  I realise one of the presentations this morning suggested that part-time education supports would be available for students in the same way as those available for full-time students.  I am keen for clarity on that point.  Reference was also made to the introduction of new tax reliefs for part-time post-graduate students.  I am not keen for any of our students to be disadvantaged in any way.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin referred to how we have lost a vast number of graduates - tens of thousands - through emigration already.  Why make the problem worse?  Research has also shown that post-graduates who have taken out loans emigrate.  That is a reality and a fact of life.</p> <p>  There are some benefits.  Like most Deputies, I have met representatives from the Union of Students in Ireland.  They outlined how graduates are of great benefit to us.  If we invest in our education system, we gain more through income tax when those graduates secure employment.</p> <p>  We need to consider the apprenticeship area.  This area is seriously under-valued.  We have a chronic shortage of apprenticeships.  I was at the education and training board conference some years ago.  The speakers flagged the serious shortage at the time.  The gaps in our system should be filled and need to be prioritised.  More apprenticeships will benefit the economy.  We need to be careful that we do not marginalise people.  Certainly, my party is in favour of a state-funded system because we have no wish to see students disadvantaged.</p></speech>

The first arises from listening to the three deputations.  There is broad and general consensus along the lines of the recommendations of the report.  This is my reading of the three contributions.  I welcome that the three groups seem to be on a similar page in that regard.</p> <p>  It is easy to say that we should put more money into everything.  It is the answer to everything.  It is easy to say that we have a bottomless pit of money in these times and that it is great.</p> <p>  I have a question on governance for the two lady witnesses who have direct and first-hand experience.  Dr. Day referred to significant improvements in governance in recent times.  What did she mean by that?  Could the witnesses give us some assurances on how far governance has evolved?  Can they provide us with some insight into why they would make such a statement?</p> <p>  I carried out some work recently on the amount of legal fees expended by universities in defending legal actions involving staff.  There have been several high-profile cases.  The increase in the amount of legal fees being spent by third level institutions and universities has rocketed.  By any standards the figures are extraordinary.  Can the witnesses offer a comment on that matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#F00500"><p>I thank all the witnesses for their contributions and for sharing their knowledge and wisdom on an issue of immense importance to all of us.</p> <p>  Dr. Day referred to autonomy.  I agree wholly with her on the point about the autonomy afforded to our universities and how they can use the resources available to them.  This has been a recurring theme in our discussions in this room.  I agree that additional autonomy should be afforded to our universities in terms of staff remuneration, how they spend the available resources and how they maximise the impact of those resources to the greatest possible extent to ensure better outcomes for their students.  This is something we need to discuss in the overall context of what we are doing now, in the context of the Cassells report and how we move forward from here.  Will the witnesses expand on their comments on how they see the process materialising?  This is an exceptionally important move and we need to include our consideration in whatever conclusion we arrive at.</p> <p>  Many people have raised my next question.  How do we effect a cultural change among the parents of Ireland to ensure they place a greater value on the apprenticeship and further education and training sector?  How do we ensure they see it as a legitimate route to a successful and sustainable career?  I am sorry to target Dr. Day with all these questions, but she will be especially familiar with the systems in Austria, Germany and other locations.  In these countries people chose at a young age whether to go down the fully academic route or to go the FET route.  Both lead to long, sustainable and happy careers.</p> <p>  I recall visiting the Dublin Aerospace facility three years ago.  The chief executive of that successful entity started off as an apprentice aircraft mechanic.  He rose up through the ranks.  From speaking to him it was apparent to me that he had an extensive knowledge of how the company worked from the ground up.  Such a career path is something that does not seem to have any value for many parents at this point in Ireland.  The conclusion drawn is that the needs of their children are best served by going to university or an institute of technology.  How do we effect that cultural change?  It is the opposite in certain countries in Europe not far from here.  I am keen to hear the thoughts of Dr. Day on that question.</p></speech>

In the delegates' opinion, what is the reason for the lack of concerted effort on the part of the education sector to pursue the national training levy, particularly given it is in surplus, and why is this not being seen as a viable option?  While many people are speaking about this, there is nobody getting up in arms about it.</p> <p>  I understand the presentations focused on the issue of income contingent loans and to public funding also being required.  It was also acknowledged that the introduction of income contingent loans is a withdrawal of public funding.  How in the delegates' opinion can this withdrawal of public funding be balanced against the likely increase in fees for students?  It would be helpful if when making presentations people could provide us with alternatives to the two suggestions set out in the Cassells report. </p></speech>

On how to diversify funding, which is the topic most debated at every governing body meeting and across the universities, as in all other cases there is no silver bullet or no one way of doing it.  For example, UCC has just signed up for a &euro;100 million from the EIB, which is one way of doing it.  While a loan has to be repaid the EIB rates are very favourable.  The money will be used to make capital investments in student accommodation, laboratory facilities and so on.  This is not the answer to future funding but it is part of it.  I understand that the EIB finances part of student loan systems in other member states so that this is an avenue that could also be explored.</p> <p>  The other area on which everybody is keen is philanthropy.  Not only is the university sector targeting the philanthropists, but so also is the charity sector and cultural bodies.  It is a source of funding and a means of staying in touch with one's alumni that is underdeveloped in Ireland as compared with other countries.  It could be helped by the introduction of a tax credit in return for a contribution to one's former university.  This is a way in which the State could help universities to get more funding without it necessarily having to pay for it.  All universities are competing strongly for funding under Horizon 2020, the European research programme.  I know that UCC has been very successful in that regard.  The question that arises is how one deals with the patents and the rights coming from the research that is developed in the universities.  These are also areas that could be developed.  These are all small contributions but we are living in an era when even small breaks in financing can help a lot.</p> <p>  On the question of loans in other member states, there is no perfect model.  In any event, every country has to develop its own model.  We can learn a lot from what has worked well and not worked well in the case of other countries.  We must be practical.  It is difficult to argue that there is not a need for increased funding for third level education.  If one starts from there one then has to be very pragmatic in terms of where one seeks to find that funding.  Given all the other calls on public funding in Ireland today and conceivably into the future it is hard to impossible to see how a fully State funded system would materialise.  This leads us to a need to identify other sources of funding.  I believe that a loan system, well designed, has its place.  Some of the objections to it, such as whether it would encourage people to emigrate, can be taken into account in the design of the system.  People are pursued across international boundaries for offences such as non-payment of speeding fines and so it is possible to ensure that people repay loans and so on.</p> <p>  The design of the system will be important.  As I said, it may be possible for organisations such as EIB to at least contribute to financing of a loan system.  It would be fundamental that any such system would promote access from communities that otherwise would not have it.  This can also be provided for as part of the design of the system.  The reality is that if we are going to meet the funding needs of the future in this sector then contributions will have to come from everywhere.  That is why Cassells talks about State funding, funding from students and from the employers, which picks on the point made earlier about the training levy.  All sources have to be pursued.  There are several beneficiaries from education, including society at large, the individual concerned and employers.   We have to find a way of ensuring that everyone contributes.  The impact afterwards on the individual can be dealt with by the design of the system.</p> <p>  Drop-out rates were mentioned.  I would like to pick up on one aspect of the drop-out rates because it is an issue that has been discussed a lot in the governing body of UCC.  To reduce the number of drop-outs, we need a higher number of staff.  An 18 year old on signing up for a subject at university does not always know whether he or she will be suited to it.  Often, he or she will not realise that until after a couple of months into the first year.  When professors and teaching staff identify that a student is struggling and is not in the right discipline they should be able to offer him or her guidance and counselling in regard to a transfer to another course so that he or she does not have to drop out.  UCC is currently trying to do this but it does not have sufficient means to do so.  If a student does not get that type of individual attention and the system does not pick up on it he or she can be lost to the system, which is devastating for the student but is also a loss for society.  That is one aspect of the drop-out rate that I wanted to mention.</p> <p>  On governance, there is a much stronger awareness now of the responsibility that comes with public funding, including the need for accountability.  Having been in charge of the accountability of the EU system to the political level I can say that the UCC system - I am sure it is the same for the other universities - is very much state-of-the-art in terms of identifying risks, mitigating and dealing with them and not running a deficit such that the State will have to pick up the tab.  That is no longer the philosophy.  Therefore, if the universities can raise money in different ways they should not have to be as controlled as they are when in receipt of direct State grant funding.  There should be more trust in the system.  That is what I mean by the governance having improved.  There is a need to trust the universities to know best what their students need, what their systems need to deliver a quality product and to be accountable for delivery of the quality.  </p> <p>  Brexit is a cause of great concern.  The competitive environment for Ireland is going to be much more challenging once the UK leaves the European Union, and for all kinds of reasons, including the fact that the pressure on the UK to be more competitive is going to be much greater when it is outside the European Union.  This will make the UK more aggressive in terms of competitiveness.  Our capacity to retain, attract and maintain the sort of service and industrial economy that we have will be important.  I would also like to reference agriculture in this context because UCC has a very strong research capacity in the food sector.  In all of these industries there is going to increased pressure once the UK leaves the EU.  We have an opportunity to market ourselves as the English speaking member state of the European Union.  We could be very attractive for inward investment provided we can provide the talent in the form of graduates that inward investors will be looking for.  Brexit is both an opportunity and a challenge for us.  The answer to that challenge lies, in part, in the provision of high quality third level education.</p> <p>  On apprenticeships, I believe the most important thing about third level education is learning how to learn.  A student who leaves school at 15 with no qualifications will find it hard to be adaptable in the future to learning new technologies because he or she will not by that age have learned how to learn.</p><p>What I see is a type of cross-over between what used to be called the academic and vocational education in that many people with a primary degree go on to do more vocational training.  They have higher level education but they also realise they need more vocational training.  The distinctions of old are fading but we must get people to understand that.  Parents see that through the experience of their children.  Perhaps that is a clue in part to how to change the culture.  What is most important is that one learns how to learn, then one learns how to be adaptable and flexible and that something one did between the ages of 18 and 22 years does not give one an automatic right for the future.  One must go on learning and be adaptable all the way through life.  That is what higher level education gives a person.</p></speech>

I call Professor Hegarty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John Hegarty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#H00300"><p>I will start with the questions on the reasons for the dropout rate and the reasons that more of our young people are not opting for the apprenticeship route.</p> <p>  There is a major issue at the transition from second to third level as to the suitability of everybody for higher education as distinct from further education or apprenticeships.  Among parents, there is a snob value in a sense that universities and higher education are better and that is the place to go even if the student is totally unsuited and would be better off elsewhere.  The league tables of the secondary schools which send pupils to universities copper-fastens this hierarchical view of education.  That is most pernicious.  There is a move in the higher education system, especially in the institutes of technology to offer courses from levels 6 and 7 to level 8, and that is indicative of the pathway from level 6 all the way to level 10.  The respect for levels 6 and 7 qualifications are not as high as it was.  This is a complicated matter which is a societal cultural issue.  The solution will be when graduates realise they came through the wrong route and will become the ambassadors for alternatives.  That is happening a little in the United States.  Many graduates who have paid significant fees to highly respected institutions find that it has not offered them the significant rewards in terms of employment and so on.  They are now expressing this.  There are students who are highly qualified who opt to go for a different route.  That speaks for itself.  We need to have that message articulated in some way.</p> <p>  The other issue is about who pays for higher education, is it the State or a student loan system.  We are advocating that it should be shared by all, partly on the basis that anything else is totally unrealistic.  I was Provost of Trinity College for ten years from 2001 to 2011, when we went from boom to bust and at no time during the boom period could the State bring the Irish higher education system up to the OECD average.  Why would we expect the State in the future to deliver that?  It is a major political issue.  If we want a high quality system, the investment must come in a different way, hence the diversity of sources.  </p> <p>  We were careful not to mention the term "loan" because it has a psychological impact.  The first impression is that the person will be saddled with major debt and he or she will have to pay it back no matter what, or otherwise his or her possessions will be repossessed.  It is important to state that what is envisaged is not a mortgage and is not similar to how the system operates in the UK or US.  We must ensure that people know that we are not thinking of that scale of student contribution.  That would be abhorrent for Irish people.  The State will be a major contributor to Irish higher education; it has to be because there is a significant public good associated with it.</p> <p>  There is an issue about whether a contribution will scare away certain elements of our society, the disadvantaged where perhaps there is no culture of going on to higher education and risk aversion to loans.  Will there be a risk aversion to this type of mechanism, which is not a mortgage and that if one does not make much money one never pays back.  That is also a culture and psychological issue.  In designing any system like this all those factors have to be taken into account.  There will still be a huge onus on the higher education institutions to be proactive in recruiting from all of those traditionally under represented groups, whether it is economically disadvantaged students, students with disability, mature students or part-time students.  As I understand it, the income contingent loans system has not turned off students from economic disadvantage in participating.  In the UK, it has a detrimental effect on mature and part-time students.  We must learn from that.  </p> <p>  There must be checks and balances.  There is a lot of work to be done.  Let us focus on Brexit and the other major political upheavals across the world.  I am convinced that our major attraction internationally will no longer be tax.  While it will still be important, it will be the talent of our people and that means access by everybody to a good education, not to an average or poor education.  If we do not have both of those we will not be able to compete as a country.</p></speech>

I would like to second what Professor Hegarty and Dr. Day have said.  They have dealt with the questions very well.</p> <p>  In response to the query on the reason for the dropout rate, I fully agree with Dr. Day's points.  This has been the experience in NUIG as well.  What is really lacking for students is the personal tutorial or personal pastoral resources that have had to be cut back because of the micro-management of the way in which the universities are allowed to employ a certain number of staff in a certain area and not in other areas.  The dropout rate is affected - I echo something that has been said in the discussion - particularly because of the way in which our students are leaving school and going into the university at a young age, with the kind of examination they have done in the leaving certificate.  Many university lecturers would worry and feel perhaps what may be needed in the university would be a first year where, as in the United States, students would be able to try out various different kinds of subjects and to learn how one learns for oneself in the university.  I recall when I first went to Trinity College, one of the lecturers said to me that they would not look after me like my teachers did in school and that we would not be watched to see whether we did our homework.  He said, "You're on your own here, folks."</p><p>While I am not saying people would be quite as harsh now as they were then, there is a certain feeling of being alone and coping with a big organisation all on one's own, and that is one of the reasons we need more investment in our students.  Dropouts cost money to the student, the State and the university, and we all need to try to stop that.</p><p> Regarding the culture Deputy Cannon mentioned, what Dr. Day said is very true, but sometimes we look across the water at mainland Europe and think it is all wonderful.  A few years ago, while Ireland held the chairmanship of the OSCE, I did a little work looking at human rights and various other educational matters in different European countries, among which was Austria and some parts of Germany, where this kind of system worked.  The people there were not slow to criticise their system and say they were deciding to split students off into doing an apprenticeship or whatever else while they were still far too young.  In this country we have downgraded what was the VEC system and have tried in a sort of snobbish way to say we will not call them VEC students and say they are different from the other children.  We decided to turn them all into high-grade academic people.  We have gone too far and we need to move to try to persuade people.  We persuade them by producing a good apprenticeship system instead of muddling along producing a few apprenticeships here and there.  We must provide a good system for people to go to before we start criticising the parents and saying they are all just taking the snob outlook.</p><p> Regarding governance and philanthropy, governance has improved greatly.  In NUIG we have a system by which virtually every person who is a member of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s also serves on one of its sub-committees and by which all these committees produce reports to the main meeting which are very carefully monitored.  I am convinced that we have considered very hard risks and above all where we can possibly source funds in every way.  We have developed our alumni trust extremely well and have had very good investment in buildings and the development of the campus in recent years.  Anybody who has walked around the campus in Galway will see that there are outstanding new buildings, the funding for many of which has come from our alumni.  We do not have in the west of Ireland all that many billionaires who can simply say they will give us funding for an enormous building out of their back pockets but we have our own alumni who have subscribed themselves and who have gathered together the money to do this.  We have done reasonably well in philanthropy and we will continue to do so.</p><p> Regarding the question whether the State should finance everything, which is the position of a few speakers, my heart would say yes, and anybody who knows the history of my life would know that I would be inclined to feel that way, but it is just not going to happen.  It will not be possible for the State, as things stand, to provide the entire funding for the higher education system.  This was the idea behind the removal of the fees 20 years ago.  However, because of this, fees have kind of crawled back again in the form of the student contribution and the system is as unequal as ever.  The removal of fees has not made the system more equal.  We are still faced with a system by which we want children from DEIS schools to be able to access third level education.</p><p> I can see there are downsides to a loan system, but it is the way in which it is designed that is important.  I agree with both the other speakers that we must look very hard to see what has worked in other countries and above all what has not worked and what has been a mistake.  Considering all the arguments made in the Cassells report, it looks to be probably the best solution.  At least let us see if we can design a system that would work in this way.  This does not let the State or the employers off the hook.  I completely agree with Senator Ruane, who mentioned the employers' training fund.  Mr. McCoy from IBEC in an article he wrote said there was a surplus in this fund and that it should be better used, and that is most certainly so.  This fund should be drawn down.  The employers will also gain from the better-educated graduates and they should therefore make more of a contribution.  I am a little cautious about suggesting the loan should extend to cover maintenance.</p><p> I consider that maintenance grants should still be made by and large as they are made now and that people should get maintenance grants more directly than through such a loan system.  This is again something that needs to be considered.  Of course people need maintenance, and of course in the end there will always be some people who cannot afford to take on loans or to maintain themselves.  There must be a way to encourage such people to go on to third level education.</p><p> That is more or less all I have to say.</p></speech>

I have spoken to a number of academics privately since the referendum on Brexit and since the beginning of the current D&aacute;il.  Some of them seem to believe a land of milk and honey awaits with Brexit in that Irish universities could access research funding that otherwise would go to the UK and that Ireland might be a more attractive place for UK academics.  They believe that if more funding goes into third level, we will be able to hire more people to come here who otherwise would continue in the UK.  Do the witnesses have any views on this?</p></speech>

First, most of Horizon 2020 is designed in such a way that funding is allocated according to the criterion of excellence, so there will still be competitive bidding.  It will not be the case that there is suddenly a big pot of money that will be reallocated to Ireland.  Second, when the UK leaves, it takes its budget contribution with it, so the EU budget will be smaller as a result.  Third, we do not know what kind of relationship will replace the current UK membership, but it is highly likely that part of that future relationship will give the UK access as a third country to European research.  Non-EU countries have such access.</p><p>Our criterion is excellence and international collaboration is considered to be a vital ingredient in the research project.  Fourth, the UK will be far-sighted enough, as part of a very focused competitiveness strategy, to continue out of UK Government funding to keep up a high level of funding for research because it understands it is key to its future prosperity.  For all those reasons, I come back to what I said.  It will be a tougher environment in which we will also have to make those investments.  There can be some positives but I do not think they will be specifically in the area of research funding.</p></speech>

Is it not true to say that whatever the new arrangements will be with the UK and the European Union, the UK will no longer be able to lead out on research so they might have to lean on Ireland?  We have a close relationship and both are English speaking countries.  Will there be an arrangement whereby Ireland collaborates with England on its current and future research but it will actually be Ireland that leads the research projects?  That means there would be an impact on rankings because the citations would be shared between the UK and Ireland.  Is that not something that could possibly happen?</p></speech>

I am here as a spokesperson for students, staff and teachers who formed the coalition for publicly funded higher education.  This coalition has the support of 1.9 million people and we are firmly united in our call for publicly funded higher education.<br/><br/>I have attended the past two presentations made to this committee on the future funding of higher education and I am aware that access is of great concern to everyone.  The focus on access has become too narrow.  Access to higher education should not just be about getting into college but getting on and beyond.  As members will see in our supplementary paper, key targets of the national access plan - lone parents, part-time learners, those with a disability, adults outside the education system and those from lower income families - will all be adversely affected by increased fees and an income contingent loan scheme.  There is also emerging evidence to indicate long-term effects of an income contingent loan scheme on future adult milestones such as accessing further credit, home ownership and mortgages.  We must choose a funding option that sees fair access to a better standard of living, free from financial burden and free from debt.  Far from being a radical idea, higher education systems mostly funded from public sources are actually the norm in Europe, while fully free public education exists in many strong and competitive economies, such as the Nordic economies and Scotland and Germany.<br/><br/>Universities are publicly funded in Germany, with 12 German universities in the 2014-2015 Times higher education world university rankings, up from ten the year before.  Despite the fact that Ireland has the second highest fees in Europe and the eighth highest in the world, it has dropped down in the same rankings.  In Germany, many vocational programmes are provided through a dual programme of training and education.  This dual system allows for a developed, responsive and flexible system where people are not siloed into higher education but are provided with more pathways and access to a better standard of living that suits students and their needs.  For young people from the EU, the chances of securing an apprenticeship in Germany have improved in recent years.  For the first time, the number of people entering higher education matches that of people enrolling in programmes in vocational training.  If we reimagine our higher education landscape by taking inspiration from the German vocational and apprenticeship models, we reduce the pressure on our universities and institutes of technology.  By providing alternative pathways for post-secondary level education, participation is more fruitful and retention is improved for all.  While considering how we will fund higher education, we should consider what ambitions we have for diversifying educational options.  The current Minister for Education and Skills has often reiterated his ambitions for apprenticeships and training, so USI encourages the committee to delve deeper into funding models like Germany before making a final recommendation.<br/><br/>People should be educated based on their ability, needs and wants rather than on the wealth of their parents or their potential future earnings.  Education is the most important investment any Government can make to ensure sustainable growth of the economy in the future.  Higher education transforms society, enhances competitiveness and strengthens the economy.  In most European countries, publicly funded or incredibly low fees are the norm, because education at every level is considered an intrinsic part of the social citizenship model.  There is public support for publicly funded higher education.  Out of 92,000 people who used our SmartVote web app last February, 57.3% agreed that third level education should be funded through general taxation.  Despite what the Cassells report outlines as a reason a publicly funded model is too ambitious, public opinion agrees it is fair and balanced to fund higher education through public taxation.<br/><br/>The committee will see from our report that students are suffering and the <i>status quo</i>cannot continue.  It is also clear that increased fees are not a fair, palatable or practicable option with or without an income contingent loan scheme.  Others who argue against a publicly funded higher education model declare it is not feasible.  If that is the case, we have to ask ourselves why, if it is not a viable option, did the expert group include it as an option to begin with?  Not to choose a publicly funded higher education system is just that - it is a choice.  A choice will be made by this committee.  I and the students who stand behind us hope this committee will hear the thousands who are joining us in our call for a publicly funded higher education system.</p></speech>

I am speaking on behalf of the 17,000 students I represent in Trinity but also as a student who graduated last week having undergone a four year course in law.  I was lucky to have received the SUSI grant for each of these years and to have had two parents who supported me.</p> <p>  The committee has a defining decision ahead of it.  Students spend between &euro;11,000 a year on college according to a DIT cost of living survey, if they live away from home.  I have had students come to my office every week asking for help, financial support and in some cases food to get by.  Accommodation costs rise and finding suitable accommodation remains difficult.  The cost of living also rises.  These students who have to work two to three part-time jobs, who have to barely get by on the SUSI money, if they get it at all, are very dependent on the outcome of this committee&rsquo;s review.  Our students in our union stand for no fee increases and this is what I am asking the committee for today.  Students, as a whole, are greatly concerned about the proposals of the July Cassells report.  We saw this at the USI rally in October when close to 2,000 Trinity students, which is a record, marched on the streets of Dublin with every other institution in Ireland.  The report rightly outlines that more investment is needed now in higher level education.  As Peter Cassells stated to the committee, the system is broken and needs a revamp.  Staff-student ratios are unacceptable and universities are now coming to the end of their reserves, not to mention the desperate state institutes of technology find themselves in.</p> <p>  Student fees increased in recessionary times from &euro;1,500 to &euro;3,000.  This report outlines in part how they could increase again to &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000, to say nothing of cuts to grants.  In a time of recovery, this is most unfair and a retrograde step for our country to take.  Make no mistake, an income contingent loan scheme of &euro;4,000 to &euro;5,000 is an increase in fees and will be seen as one.</p><p>While I know the system here is not the same as the one in UK or in the USA, the countries where loans may be seen as having had a moderate success still have many pitfalls.  Australia, for example, has tinkered with its system many times.  It has charged more money for specific courses such as medicine or law, and the system may even be left behind by the current government.  Youth Allowance - its version of SUSI - recipients are more likely to borrow from family and friends as well as others and go without educational books and materials than other university students.  One in five loans there are not paid back and there is, similar to here, much emigration.  Loans tend to rise.  They tend to scare off students, particularly mature and part-time students, and they tend more and more not to be paid back.  </p><p> The Institute of Technology presidents spoke passionately to this committee about maintaining access routes in their call for free education.  A point made against the previous free fee scheme in the 1990s was that it did not improve access.  A loan system will impede access for part-time and mature students.  However, it is not only financial barriers that impede access.  We have noted our recommendations for improving access in the report which was circulated to the committee.</p><p> If a proposed scheme will, at the worst, severely curtail access and, at best, keep access rates relatively the same as the loan system would do, why are we pursuing it?  The report outlines that SUSI should be maintained and enhanced, and I would agree.  Living costs need to be covered more than they are currently, as previous speakers have outlined.  </p><p> I do not want only to discuss the loan option, as much of the political and media attention is focused on it.  There are, after all, two other options.  Ms Annie Hoey outlined the arguments for a publicly funded education scheme and I ask that it would not be dismissed.  Our report outlines how such schemes work in Europe, not just in the idyllic models in Scandinavia.  The second option two has not been discussed much either.  It too should be examined and models should be created for all options, not just models for the loan option.</p><p> Our students have also brought answers and solutions to the committee.  The Cassells report speaks of increasing the employer's contribution.  It states, "This should be delivered by increasing the National Training Fund levy".  It further states, "Each 0.1 per cent increase in the levy could raise at least an additional &euro;50m per annum".  If we raise this by 0.5% or even 1% this would go a long way.  There needs to be a balance, on which I believe everyone is in agreement, but employers are categorically not playing their part.  The word "talent" is used to describe Ireland's workforce to the world.  There is a complete benefit for companies in contributing to higher and further education, and they need to do so more.  </p><p> This committee has asked for advice several times on how to sell the option picked for higher education.  This is a very easy way of selling it.  Increase the employer's contribution only slightly and ring-fence it for higher education.  </p><p> I thank the members for listening to me.  I would be grateful if they read our report which was written and compiled by students.  We are happy to come back and present or comment at any stage.  This is a time to decide what we as a country stand for in looking towards the future.  We need to decide if education truly is a public good and valued by this Government.  This decision will affect us and the students who come after us most of all.  I formally ask the members of this committee not to increase fees for students under any guise as part of their recommendation.  We are their teachers, mechanics, engineers, researchers, doctors, therapists, nurses and even Senators and politicians.  We are the future of this country and we deserve the best future that our country can give.  We will play our part.  We ask that our employers and politicians do the same.</p></speech>

I study eight leaving certificate subjects: three languages, three sciences and two mathematics subjects.  I am in fifth year and I am the president of the Irish Second-Level Students Union.  We represent the second-level students in Ireland and we believe in and strive for an education system without barriers.  I represent hundreds of thousands of students who say that no matter who we are, where we come from or how much money our parents make, we should have the right to an education and the opportunity to continuing to third level if that is what we want.</p> <p>  There are five children in my family ranging in age from 17 to 10 years.  My parents break their backs making sure we have everything we could want or need, despite the fact that my Dad does not have a college degree.  My mum is responsible for supporting our education at home, she has helped me with my mathematics homework and she also helped me to learn my spellings since I was four years old.  My mother&rsquo;s encouragement and support is at the core of my academic success and my love for learning.  I owe a great deal to my parents, but once, maybe twice a week, one of the older children will say something about college and that leads to a huge argument.  The problem is that my parents, like many parents in this country, do not know what is in store for us.  They cannot afford to easily send all five of us to third level education. They cannot send us to the colleges that we dream of.  My parents are reeling at the prospect of having to watch their children enter into an enormous level of debt from student loans.  They are already looking into ways to help me pay my fees so that I will not have to do this.  My parents do not want to see their children burdened with a huge debt that will impact the rest of their lives.  They love us and they do not want this as a future for us.</p> <p>  If all five of us decided to enter into third level with student loans, we would have a collective debt of &euro;100,000.  That would be a debt of &euro;100,000 hanging over one family.  How would this make any parent feel?  How would this make the parents in the members' constituencies feel?  What kind of a choice is that for a parent to make?  What kind of an issue is that for a teenager to have to consider?  What are my options and what will my choice mean for my brothers and sisters?  This poses the question: who gets to go to college from my family and who does not?  We need to see debt for what it really is, a barrier to education.  </p> <p>  I am only 17 years old and I am already worried about what student loans will mean for me.  Debt is debt.  Student loans will mean that I may not have access to credit later in life.  How would that impact on my life?  Would I be able to buy a house, own a car or  raise a family in my own country?  My parents passionately believe in education but they cannot support a decision that will cost us so much in the future.  They will do anything to prevent their children getting into debt because they know how hard it would be and how much we would struggle.</p> <p>  There is no justification for a scheme which would limit the access of Irish people to education. There is no justification for burdening our students with debts when we are in a position to fund these opportunities, just like the Cassells report deems viable. How is it that we are even debating this?  Why are my parents and I being put under this pressure when there is a report that states that there is a possible option which would allow every child the opportunity to progress to third level?</p> <p>  On many occasions my organisation has consulted second level students on what they want for their future and the students have said that education should be open to all, it should be equal and it should be accessible.  Most recently we hosted councils in Connaught, Munster and Leinster for the students of those regions.  We discussed and debated many issues during these events but most notably third level fees.  We discussed the impact these fees would have on students my age who hope to progress to third level.  Students as young as 13 years of age spoke of their fear that they will not get this opportunity.  College as we know it is too expensive for many of us but college as we fear it will become will be inaccessible to even more.  Free at the point of entry but extortionate at the point of exit is not what this nation stands for and the fear of debt will result in many families opting out of third level education, opting out of learning, opting out of a career and a future.</p> <p>  I know that student loans would mean an increase in fees and that this would deter students like me, from families like mine, from applying for third level courses.  As things stand, even grant aided, I would struggle to cover the cost of living while in third level, let alone with an increase in fees.  The idea that I will be saddled with debt before I have even begun my career is terrifying, but the added prospect that my siblings of I would not get the opportunity to progress to third level would be heartbreaking.  I urge the members of the committee not to support any increase to student fees and not to support the introduction of a student loan scheme that will limit the options of students just like me, students who love to learn, enjoy their education and dream of the opportunity to create a future.</p> <p>  What other options do I have?  My parents have taught me to always pay what I owe.  The members may think that we do not understand what income contingent loans are but we know for a fact that they mean an increase in fees and a burden of debt for the rest of our lives.</p> <p>  Right now in Australia, one in five student loans remain unpaid as a result of emigration or graduates failing to earn sufficient income for long enough periods.  Gender is a big problem in regard to paying back loans - women in the USA find it harder to pay back their loans than that of their male colleagues as women typically earn less than males.   Thousands of those who are living abroad are too afraid to return to New Zealand due to their student loan debt.  Is that what will happen to me, that I will be too afraid to come home, struggling to make repayments, saddled with debt before I am even 25?</p> <p>  I want a future.  I want the chance to stay in Ireland and to study here.  I, along with many of my fellow students, will contribute as a taxpayer to the generations that will come after us and we will help fund their education, but what happens if I cannot afford a future in Ireland?  One of my options is to leave the home I love and the family I adore and pursue my education in Germany.  Right now, no fees apply to international students in Germany, bar a small contribution charge of &euro;50.  Therefore, to the class of 2018, the message is "Willkommen in Deutschland".  A record number of foreign students are currently enrolled in German universities and half of them stay in the country after graduating.  Is this where my life will be then?  Is this where my children will be educated?</p> <p>  I and many of my fellow students are begging to be heard.</p><p>We are telling this country that we need publicly funded education in order for us to have a future in our own country.  We are not alone, however.  We are not only students calling for this.  We are among our parents, our teachers and our future lecturers.  We are united with members of national unions, organisations and charities.  Some 1.9 million people are represented.  We are joined by people who believe in the same right to education as we do.  My mother, who has supported my education, is sitting in the Gallery along with my sisters right now listening to me speak.  My mother loves me and would do anything for me to have a future.  Can the committee justify to her a system that would lock her daughter out and drive her eldest abroad, away from her home?</p><p> Le bhur dtoil, b&iacute;odh misneach agaibh.

I am sure her Mum and sisters are very proud of her today.  Ms Hayes-Nally paints a good and clear picture of the stress that can impact on family life in terms of funding decisions.  As the eldest of eleven, I totally understand where she is coming from.</p> <p>  What is clear from the last three presenters is that they feel an income contingent loan system would not be the best option that would be put before the people of this country.  It is also clear from what the three speakers have said that there needs to be a publicly funded higher education system.  I suppose we are in a situation where we are competing within the education budget for funding that is vitally needed for preschool education, primary and secondary, and special education as well, for investment in third level and further education, and we are also competing outside of education in terms of all our other priorities in health, justice, transport, etc.  There is only a certain pot available.  Are we saying that the taxpayers should pay a higher level of tax to fund third level?  If so, it will go back again on many parents and will have further impact.  We must look at ways by which it will not come straight back in another levy or fee, otherwise it would still have to be paid.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses later.  If taxpayers are paying more tax, then there will be a situation where maybe their own children will not be able to go to third level.  We need to consider the issues of fairness and equity.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.</p> <p>  I say, "Well done," to Ms Hayes-Nally.  She highlights whether introducing income contingent loans to young people is even morally permissible and the fears that they feel.  One area we have not looked at was raised only last week with me by a severely disabled young person who wanted to go on to third level education.  That person told me of being faced with high cost-of-living needs.  I am wondering have we taken into account those who already face a high cost merely to live, survive and be alive, and the thought of such students alone added onto that is not something that they are willing to risk.  We need to look at those cohorts.  I am guilty of always focusing only on the working class and the disadvantaged, but not taking into account the needs of other marginalised groups that are not spoken about as much, and maybe we need to look at that.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Ms Hoey.  How has the current system of fees affected students?  Ms Hoey also mentioned the idea of access going beyond merely reaching the key target groups outlined by the national access plan.  Could she elaborate on how each model affects them, based on her research?  I never thought about it.  I suppose the Trinity access programme looks at access right through to the end of one's degree and onwards.  It was merely something that interested me.</p> <p>  Could Ms Hoey outline the long-term effects of an income contingent loan scheme on future adult milestones, such as a mortgage, being able to a car and going on a holiday?  If one exceeds the threshold to pay an income contingent loan by, for example, &euro;100, and one must pay that loan, what impact will that have on the milestones?</p> <p>  Mr. McNulty might go into the pitfalls of the Australian model.  My fear around loans is that because there is not a technical report to go with this report to state how it all will work and be paid, at some stage are we leaving the door open for the State to step out, as it has done in other countries.  Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness stated earlier that we are not letting the State off the hook.  It might appear right now that we are not letting the State off the hook but we definitely might be leaving the door ajar for it to step out later on and for the area to become fully privatised.  If anyone can speak to that, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

While there may not be consensus here on how education should be funded, everyone would be in agreement that the three presenters are wonderful ambassadors for the youth of the country.  I say, "Well done," on a fantastic presentations and how they care for the future generations.</p> <p>  The concerns I expressed earlier were particularly highlighted by Ms Hayes-Nally's presentation.  When one thinks of a family of five ranging in age from 17 to ten, already Ms Hayes-Nally is worried about a burden of &euro;100,000 being placed on her family.  I note the love that her mother has given her for education and how obvious is the love that Ms Hayes-Nally has for her Mum, and that Ms Hayes-Nally is concerned that her mother may loose her daughter, as we expressed earlier the concern about emigration.  How do all three presenters answer those who say this is not a loan as we know it?  How do they answer the assertion that this is not a mortgage, it is not the typical debt and one will not be saddled with debt for life?  How do they answer that?</p> <p>  Ms Hoey rightly pointed out that when we talk about access it is getting in, staying in and beyond.  Often I have mentioned here the deficit in resources in college.  Ms Hoey mentioned the path to resources in keeping students in college that is lacking because of that deficit.  Ms Hoey referred to the USI having done research on publicly funded models in other countries.  Would Ms Hoey, or indeed, Mr. McNulty, elaborate on what the USI found out from that and the impact it has had on the countries in question?</p></speech>

I agree with the comments of the other committee members that they are a credit to society, in fact, to the education system that we have at present, and of course to their families who have served them well.</p> <p>  If, for example, we were to take as a given what Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness stated that this publicly funded system is never going to happen, then one is left with a choice between the present fee structure and an income contingent loan model.  I do not want to talk about a person's personal circumstances.  In many cases the children of college-going age in a family who want to go to college and do not qualify for a grant are borrowing already and the debt is payable straightaway at normal interest rates, and not contingent on one's employment.  If those are the two options - I accept there is a third option - is an income contingent loan model not superior to the private bank loan model that must work for many today?  I want to think about that because there is a heavy financial burden on parents.</p> <p>  If we are to reject Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness's argument, and if there is a higher court than the Supreme Court that says she is wrong - she is not normally wrong - and we go to the European courts on this one, how do we pay for it then?  Maybe it is unfair to ask the witnesses that question.  A lot of income tax would have to be generated.  Are they, in particular regard to the USI, proposing specific tax increases to pay for this?</p> <p>  The third level students will know more about this than those at second level.</p><p>One of the recommendations of the Cassells report is to enhance the maintenance grant.  Will the delegation give examples of where the maintenance system is failing, what are the problems with it and how are students suffering because of it?  Whatever system we go forward with, that is one recommendation which is often widely ignored.  We will have to deal with it.</p></speech>

They are a credit to their institutions and, indeed, to their families and communities which have supported them.  I was fortunate to have visited the Irish consulate in Boston three years ago.  There I met two recently graduated law students who were working as interns and enjoying the experience immensely.  One of them had just graduated from UCD and the other from a public college in Boston.  The student from UCD was debt free but the student from Boston had a debt of $120,000 attached to her education.  That night, I reflected on the argument and debate we were bound to have in this country on how we fund third level education.  I made the decision that neither of the two outcomes I encountered at the consulate were sustainable or acceptable.  It was not acceptable that a young person would be burdened with $120,000 of debt but neither could another young person, with probably a better law qualification, walk out of a third level institution with no debt.  Three years on, the Cassells report has arrived at a similar conclusion.</p> <p>  Ms Jane Hayes-Nally&rsquo;s contribution was excellent.  I am an advocate of the student&rsquo;s voice in education.  It has been suppressed for too long and we need to hear more from Ms Jane Hayes-Nally and people like her who have legitimate views in how we support them in educating themselves.</p> <p>  I am primarily an idealist.  Over my desk in Loughrea, I have a quote from Bill Moyers, a wonderful journalist in the US, "Ideas are great arrows, but there has to be a bow.  And politics is the bow of idealism".  After 13 years in politics, one has to temper one&rsquo;s idealism somewhat as one gets older.  There was a wonderful contrast between the witnesses&rsquo; perfectly idealistic view of how we should fund education, which I support, and that of Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, who would claim she has an equally idealistic view.  Life has taught us we have to be pragmatic about this as well.  One of the main recommendations of the Cassells report is that there should be some kind of loan for third level education.  Instead of having a blanket obstructionist view to this, young people&rsquo;s time would be far better spent explaining how they feel a loan scheme should operate.  They should point to what has gone wrong with such schemes in other countries and use that experience productively to ensure all contemplating going down the route of third level will not feel they do not have the option of pursuing it in Ireland.  Ireland has one of the best education systems in the world.  There is a whole cohort of families who are just above the income limit for the grant system but do not have the resources to put three young people through college.  For me, that is the cohort I want to ensure does not contemplate not pursuing a third level course.  Instead, I want us to create a system which supports them.  We would all use our energies more productively if we were to go down that route.</p></speech>

They give a detailed insight into reality.  I do not understand why we are so dismissive of state-funded education systems.  Other countries like Germany have managed such a system.  It is all about priorities.  Over the past several years education has not been the top priority of previous Governments.  That has led us into the case in which we are now.  Why should our students and future students pay for those bad decisions made by these previous Governments?</p> <p>  The high drop-out rates in our universities and institutes of technology are partly due to the cuts in guidance counsellors.  I have strongly advocated for the restoration of guidance counsellors.  It is about priorities and decision-making but we have not always got our priorities right.  We should not be dismissive of exploring the state-funded system.  It is listed as an option and we should explore it.  It is not for us to dismiss it because it will impact on students&rsquo; lives.</p></speech>

We are discussing the different challenges and problems that each option can present.  There is no straightforward solution.  No matter what we produce collaboratively for the Minister, there will be no straightforward way.  It is up to us to look at, to learn and to face up to the hard challenges and tasks when making recommendations on this issue.</p></speech>

I have met many of them in the past and listened to their different views.</p> <p>  We all support keeping student fees at the lowest rate possible.  I do not think any member believes they should go up by a significant amount.  In saying that, we have to be practical to work within the resources available at the moment.  We are after coming out of a recession and funding is getting back slowly.  We have to work within those available resources.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Cannon on the grants available to families.  I have also encountered families just over the qualifying limit.  There are other options which we need to examine.  Employers may need to contribute more.  The University of Limerick and Limerick Institute of Technology co-operated with several companies in the area to have tailored courses around the needs of employers.  This is another area we should examine across the country and to encourage some larger companies to come on board in tailoring courses with various third level institutions.  Graduates can then find employment with those companies rather than being forced to emigrate.</p></speech>

There is no point in having no fees when the cost of sending a student to college is high.  One has to go hand in hand with the other.  Linking in with businesses is very important.  Ring-fencing the levy and increasing it was mentioned earlier.  We have to look at the whole apprenticeship and skills area.</p><p>Senator Byrne spoke about the large companies, but we must also be mindful of the SME sector which is struggling, so we should not put an extra levy on those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.57" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran McNulty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#O00200"><p>I thank the committee members for their questions.  I will deal first with Senator Ruane's query about the Australian model.  As I mentioned in my submission, they have tinkered with their system many times, including charging more money for specific courses.  The Universities Australia report in 2013 stated that students receiving a youth allowance would not only have spent years in college struggling to survive on incomes below the poverty line, but will also have generated debts which could keep them impoverished for years.  That is quite a stark review of the income contingent loan system there, which is commonly referred to as the best in the world.<br/><br/>The difficulty of chasing loans from people who emigrate was mentioned earlier.  In 2012, there was a spate of headlines about people being arrested in New Zealand when coming home for holidays because they had not paid back their student loans.  That is how the New Zealand system has tried to recoup loans that have not been repaid.  I do not know if we want to go there.<br/><br/>There has been an overall decline in full-time undergraduates receiving youth allowance or AU study schemes from 42.4% in 2000 to 35.2% in 2006.  University fees in New Zealand increased for ten years until the government introduced legislation that allowed for increases of only 5% per annum.  If one contrasts this to the UK, although I know the system is not the same as in the UK, the loan system has only been in place since 2011.  It was said in 2011 that the threshold would never go above &pound;9,000 for student fees, yet universities pressured the British government into accepting &pound;9,250 and that will increase further.  This is what tends to happen with loans.<br/><br/>I will now turn to Deputy Thomas Byrne's questions.  The question of students who are just above the threshold for SUSI grants has arisen a lot.  Some 27% of students in my university receive the SUSI grant.  I would argue that a huge percentage are just over that threshold, so much more account needs to be given to levelling and maybe even to zoning.  That is because of adjacency rates, so if a student lived 21 km from university he or she got the full grant, but now if one lives within 45 km the grant is cut in half.  That needs to be examined, particularly given that transport costs in rural areas are quite high.  The system is not as competitive but if one is living in an urban area then accommodation costs need to be looked at also.<br/><br/>Senator Ruane asked whether a loan scheme would be preferable to the <i>status quo</i>.  I would not think so because as she rightly said, people are getting loans already.  I received a loan for my final year as well.  If an income contingent loan system is introduced, that would mean in effect that people would get two loans.  I was on SUSI but I still had to get a loan to cover my living expenses, although I do not live exorbitantly.  Option 2 has been categorised as the <i>status quo</i>but it is the <i>status quo</i>with more funding.  I would argue that Option 2 is allowing for a general decrease in the student contribution, ring-fencing it as it is, or for using public funding more to enhance the grant system.<br/><br/>The student assistance fund needs to be reviewed.  A separate union in our university has argued for the restoration of postgraduate grants, which could be looked at in our current system.  A SUSI review group would be great.<br/><br/>As regards those who argue for an income contingent loan system, I have never heard an acceptable answer from people on the Cassells report as to why there is an automatic increase in the fee in the two models laid out.  Since 2008 our fees have increased.  From 2011 to 2015 they have risen from &euro;1,500 to &euro;3,000.  In a time of recovery, why are we saying that it should go up to &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 while categorising this as a matter of fairness?  Is it necessary to have an income contingent loan scheme that goes to &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000?  My worry is that it would rise, which is why I am firmly opposed to it.  It is a slippery slope.  I would like to hear whether members of this committee support an increase in fees.  In choosing to examine the loan system that is, in effect, what the committee will be doing.</p></speech>

Would Ms Hoey like to respond?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Annie Hoey" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#O00400"><p>Yes.  I have scribbled my notes so I will jump from one thing to the other.  The feeling we are getting from our members on the ground, and this is from talking to the Irish second-level students' union as well, is that in recent years Ireland has become a very cold country for young people.  We still do not see a lot of hope for the future.  When we hear people talking about placing the burden of loans around our necks it is not filling my members within the Union of Students in Ireland, or members of the Irish second-level students' union, with a lot of hope about the value that is being placed on young people and their contribution to society.  We have taken an awful kicking in recent years and young people still feel they are being targeted while this debate is raging on.  Young people are astonished because on the one hand they are told they are the reason companies are coming here to invest and they are the future, but on the other hand people are talking about loans, debt and fees for higher education.</p> <p>  Ireland prides itself on its education system and we were promised we would have an option to continue to higher education.  However, we do not understand how or why this debate is occurring.  Young people feel left out in the cold about how their futures are being discussed, planned and funded.  We want to stay in this country and want to learn whether that will be through higher education, further education or vocational learning.  We want to contribute to society.  Some of us might like to go to Australia for a year or two, but that is entirely different to being chased out of a country because there is no place for us.  Young people feel Ireland is becoming a cold place to live in and that they are not overly welcome.</p> <p>  Adult milestones were mentioned.  The Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations did research beyond the impact of income contingent loans.  We talk a lot about how such loans will not incentivise or disincentivise people from various backgrounds getting in.  That is something we contest in our research, but in Australia they are looking at what happens beyond that.  In discussing people's futures we cannot look just at how they will be funded for the next four years, then cut funding and off they go into the wilderness and hope for the best.  A large amount of research is being done in Australia and New Zealand on the impact of income contingent loans, particularly around students' ability to save and buy a first home.  It will have a knock-on effect on the property market, although I do not want to go off on that tangent here.  It is, however, no secret that there is a rental crisis.  In Australia there is clear evidence to show that young people with income contingent loans are not able to get out of the rental property market.  They are stuck in the rental market for a long time, which obviously has knock-on effects.</p> <p>  There is also evidence showing that the number of 20 to 24-year-olds living at home has increased from 42% to 47%.  The increase for 25 to 29-year-olds living at home has risen from 12% to 17%.  A recent UK study showed that 40% of graduates of 2012 have had to return home as they cannot afford to live where they want to.  This has a knock-on effect on where they can work, the kind of jobs they can get, their career opportunities and options for promotion.  Some 47% of graduates having to return home is an enormous number of people who feel they cannot progress in society and make their desired contribution.  They have outrageous debts hanging over their heads, which is a real concern of ours.</p> <p>  There is also some evidence concerning family planning.  In Australia, young people with income contingent loans are putting off starting a family by an average of 3.3 years.  We are also worried about that trend.  I cannot believe I am sitting here as a student representative talking about family planning, but here we are.  That is the reality concerning such adult milestones, including starting families.  A delay of over three years will have a long-term impact in a couple of years time.</p> <p>  Questions were asked about funding higher education.  The Cassels report was remiss in not properly teasing out the three options.</p><p>I understand that the committee perhaps felt it needed to lean down on one option but I think it is a large gap in the report.  While we are students, not economists - perhaps some of us will be economists in the future - we have done preliminary research in regard to mapping.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, has done mapping of how it could potentially be funded in the future, and I have circulated that paper to the committee.  I would encourage members to talk to the experts from NERI who wrote that paper and ask them to come in and present to the committee how this could be funded in the future.</p><p> There are various taxation models which are based not just on income taxation but include other levies and taxation, particularly in regard to the National Training Fund.  We hear employers say they could not possibly get involved in another 0.1% increase whereas student fees have gone up by 350% in the last six years.  When people say no one else can possibly afford it, we have afforded it.  We have taken the burden of 350% over the past couple of years while the State decreased its investment and employers did not increase their investment.  We have weathered the burden of the increase in the cost of higher education.  Therefore, when talking about other groups and people increasing their contribution, and given we have increased our contribution by hundreds of per cent, I do not think it unreasonable for us to say it is high time other sources were looked at seriously.</p><p> With regard to public funding, as ideological as I am, I wish we could say it will happen in the next 12 months but it is not going to happen in the next 12 months.  We are talking about a 14-year to 15-year plan being put in place, far beyond the lifetime of this Government and it may even be beyond a time when I am talking about having children that this plan is fully implemented.  It is a 14-year plan to phase in publicly funded education in order to start moving towards a model we can be proud of.  While I wish it could be done overnight, it cannot be.</p><p> With regard to where the maintenance system is failing, we made a presentation to the previous education committee on the SUSI maintenance grant and what we would like to see in the grant reform, and I am more than happy to circulate that paper.  We found a lot of gaps in the grant reform and some people were slipping through, such as parents and independent students.  Estranged students were having huge difficulties in being able to prove estrangement.  A member of the USI executive was the person who brought that through and that person really struggled in being able to prove estrangement from their family, and had to go through never-ending hoops, jumps and loops to try to prove that.  If people want to prove estrangement, they need their parents to prove they are estranged from them, which is a little difficult when they are estranged from them.  Some people are slipping through these gaps in the SUSI grant system and those are the ones targeted in the national access plan.  We would see those as being the severe problems.  There is then the issue of people who are just above the thresholds and also issues such as the distance from college.  For example, to have people living on the Aran Islands considered as being adjacent is mad.  These are small things but they have very negative long-term impacts on the students they affect and their families.</p><p> There was a question about how to convince people this is not a loan as we know it.  I do not necessarily know this is something that can be done.  We have been talking to students and they are recoiling in horror not because we have not explained to them what an income-contingent loan is, but because they understand what it is and they understand what debt is.  We are the generation who for the last eight years watched our parents be ravaged by the recession.  Some of our parents lost their jobs and some of us had to move from our homes and schools.  Some of us have watched our parents struggle to put food on the table.  We know exactly what it is like to be faced with debt and with loans.  I am not entirely sure, particularly with this generation, that there will be a way to convince us this loan is any different to any other kind of loan.  Many of us are brought up, as Ms Hayes-Nally said, to pay back loans and to pay back what we borrow.  Telling us we will not have to pay it back is a somewhat misguided financial approach.</p><p> Before student debt is considered as a policy solution for inadequate public investment in higher education, the wider social and economic impact of this debt should be considered and monitored.  I would like to see some proper mapping of options 1 and 2 in regard to how they could be realised so the committee can make a fully informed decision about what the various options are, whether there needs to be a combination and how best we can move forward.  As I said, it is over 14 years.  We wish there was a magic wand but there is not.  We are talking about a 14-year investment in higher education, although all of us will be gone from this debate at that time.</p></speech>

The whole reason we are having this debate is the systematic under-funding in third level over the last number of years, particularly given the increase in the number of students.  Having listened to the presidents of the universities and institutes of technology in regard to the huge pressures they are under at this time, the debate is very relevant.  We need to have it and we need to put everything out there on the table.</p> <p>  In regard to the options the Cassells report has produced, we are certainly not limited to any one of those three, and we are open to looking at a hybrid or at other possibilities.  In fact, we have asked Peter Cassells to come back to us in regard to teasing out all of the different options.  We will certainly take on board the report the USI has produced for us and we may well come back on that.  We are giving due consideration to everything.</p></speech>

I thank everyone for their nice comments.  I would like to address Deputy Thomas Byrne's point that the ICL is preferable.  I do not think it is preferable because it opens the door to increased fees and it reduces State funding, which is not a good thing.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, who advised my organisation to look at more practical ways of going about things, what we propose has been deemed a viable option and we would be in support of it being phased in.  Perhaps it is ambitious but to reiterate Ms Hoey's point, young people are worth a lot to Ireland and I think we are worth that ambition and investment.  With regard to maintenance grants, in the way this is explored in the Cassells report maintenance grants will be scrapped and students will take out loans, so perhaps I will be equal to other students because everybody is taking out a loan, but I will not receive &euro;200 from my parents each week, as the student next to me might.</p></speech>

Ibec welcomes the report of the Expert Group on the Future Funding of Higher Education.  We believe this is the most authoritative and balanced report on the economic and social benefits of investing in higher education and the serious challenges faced by the sector.  We would also like to record our thanks to the Chairman of the expert group, Mr. Peter Cassells, and the secretariat who met Ibec&rsquo;s National Council and engaged extensively with the business community on this issue. </p> <p>  The report sets out the benefits of investment in higher education across the areas of economic growth, social development, culture and civic engagement.  I propose to focus on the economic benefits, while fully aware that the system fulfils a vital role in society that extends well beyond that of satisfying enterprise&rsquo;s needs for skills and-or research.</p> <p>  There is a significant inter-dependence between the economic and social benefits.  Business and higher education have a shared objective of developing adaptable, well-rounded, creative, cultured and ethically minded citizens who have an appetite for learning.</p> <p>  We should also remember that 30 years after the abolition of college tuition fees, just one in seven young people in the country&rsquo;s most disadvantaged areas progress to higher education.  In our most affluent suburbs, in some cases just a few miles away, almost every young person, 99% has this opportunity.  The report itself and evidence by the university and institute of technology presidents to this committee have highlighted the scale of the funding crisis in higher education.  This will only get worse with growing numbers of students.  I do not propose to restate the figures.  Suffice to say that this is not special pleading.  Poor education outcomes, overcrowded lecture halls and laboratories, deteriorating facilities and high student dropout rates will have severe economic and social consequences.  While international rankings are a very imperfect measure, the continuing decline of Irish universities will also damage our reputation with international investors, and undermine our ability to attract international students and academic talent.</p><p>I wish to focus on possible solutions. The Cassells report sets out three funding options which could deliver the necessary investment to address this challenge: a predominantly State-funded system, retention of the current upfront fee of &euro;3,000 or deferred payment of fees through an income contingent loan system.  All three options envisage increased State investment ranging from an additional &euro;1.3 billion for a State-funded system to &euro;563 million for a deferred fee payment system.<br/><br/>The first two options are not economically sustainable or socially desirable.  Our starting point should be that every student who has the ability and motivation to avail of a college education should be able to do so, whatever their personal circumstances.  However, if we are serious about education disadvantage, we should target State investment in areas such as early childhood education which will increase the likelihood of young people in disadvantaged areas taking up this opportunity.  Then we should provide the grants and support services to ensure that they can stay the course as students.<br/><br/>The second option of retaining the existing &euro;3,000 upfront student charge is basically accepting the <i>status quo</i>.  The Cassells report itself warns that this is completely incompatible with our national ambitions and will condemn Ireland to become an education and research backwater.  This option also ignores the undoubted pressure on many student and families to come up with a large up-front payment.  They will have got the worst of both worlds: fees without the support structure to pay them.  Meanwhile, Ireland&rsquo;s reputation for having one of the best educated workforces in the world becomes increasingly threatened.<br/><br/>The third option under which graduates would pay tuition fees when their earnings reach a certain level is the only equitable and sustainable option.  There are many elements of this option that have to be worked out including the level of fees, how such fees will be regulated and how the scheme can be pre-financed in the period before repayments are made.  Further, it would be economically foolish and socially unacceptable to saddle a generation of young people with the scale of debt that we see in the US and will probably see in the UK.  Therefore we need a balanced, fair and sustainable system that combines adequate State investment with an affordable student contribution. <br/><br/>Business is also willing to play its part.  Employers already pay over &euro;360 million a year into the national training fund through a payroll levy and individual companies contribute directly to higher education institutions through a broad range of upskilling, research and sponsorship initiatives.  A more structured approach to supporting programmes in areas of skills demand and more effective use of the national training fund should be explored. <br/><br/>Undoubtedly there are difficult political decisions to be made, but the time for debating the student fee issue has long passed.  Twelve years ago, the OECD advised the Government that it was impossible to have quality higher education by predominantly relying on State funding.  At that time, it suggested the introduction of an income contingent student loan system.  The basis for this recommendation has not changed.  Failure to invest now in third level will place an entire generation of students and the future of this country at a serious disadvantage.<br/><br/>Once again, I thank the committee for the opportunity to present the view of business on this critical issue.  It is important that it is resolved.  I wish the committee all the best with its endeavours.  I am also happy to take questions on the issues raised.</p></speech>

I also apologise for the absence of our president today.  He is in Brussels, which is why I have the job.  As the committee will be aware, farm families have always placed a very high value on third level education.  Farmers recognise the importance of higher education in delivering a strong future for the next generation, whether they return to work in agriculture or in other careers.<br/><br/>Higher education participation benefits the individual, society and the economy.  On this basis, we believe that the proposal in the report for higher education to be funded by a combination of contributors - the State, employers and students themselves &ndash; has merit.  However, we believe strongly that any contribution from a student must not be burdensome.  Any change to the funding regime in the future must not prove a barrier to participation for students from lower income groups.  We also believe that the committee should consider what impact high student fees could have on participation in certain courses or career areas.  The imposition of student charges must not lead to a situation whereby students are incentivised to pursue a course that is deemed to lead to a high-earning career or, conversely, to not pursue a course where the lifetime career earnings may be modest, such as farming.<br/><br/>I wish to deal with the issue of potential changes to the means test for third level grants, as proposed in the report.  It is worth noting that the report proposes the retention of maintenance grants for third level.  This is very important.  The report recommends:</p><blockquote>Increases in funding for higher education institutions must be matched by improvements in the student support system.  This should include an increase in the value of payments, particularly for the lowest income groups, the introduction of a capital assets test, and an extension of supports to part-time and postgraduate students.</blockquote> <p>The IFA is opposed to any attempt to include productive assets, such as farmland, in the means assessment for third level grants.  Productive assets are required by farm and other small businesses to generate income and are not a measure of additional ability to pay.  As the committee may be aware, the existing method of assessment of self-employed income for the maintenance grant disallows a number of expenses that are included in income tax computation.  These disallowances, which impact on farm families in the means assessment, include capital allowances, lease payments, stock relief and interest on borrowing for capital purposes.  Approximately 40% of students from farm families receive a maintenance grant, which can be compared with 33% of the general student population.  This simply reflects the fact that average incomes in farming are low, at approximately &euro;26,000.  Like all other families, where the farm income exceeds the threshold for grant qualification, the student will not qualify for a grant.  Any system that would impute additional income based on the value of productive assets would discriminate against a particular cohort of students, preventing this group from accessing a grant and potentially from attending college. <br/><br/>In its deliberations on the recommendations of the report, I ask that the committee take into account the concerns of farmers in this area.  The inclusion of productive assets in the means test for third level grants could deny access to higher education to students from low-income farming and other self-employed families and must not be introduced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#R00400"><p>I thank the committee and note that we are pleased to accept the invitation to address it and to outline the views of congress on the report on the future funding of higher education.  As the report rightly points out, higher education has made a significant contribution to the development of our country and it is essential that we reposition the sector so that it can continue to act as a driver of strong economic and social progress.  However, as the report points out, this will require significant increased levels of investment in higher education, further education, apprenticeship and other post-second level opportunities.</p><p> The report recommends that the funding for the sector be increased as follows: an increase in the annual core funding of the sector by &euro;600 million by 2021 and &euro;1 billion by 2030; a &euro;5.5 billion investment in capital expenditure over the next 15 years; and an additional &euro;100 million to enhance the provision of student supports.  Congress agrees that this level of increased funding is required and it is essential that the debate now moves to finding a sustainable and fair means of providing the required investment.  The report points to three possible options for the future funding of the sector, namely a predominately State-funded system; an increased State funding with continuing student fees; or an increased State funding with deferred payment of fees through income contingent loans.</p><p> Congress believes that the first option, a predominately State-funded system, is the most equitable and sustainable option.  Moving to a fully publicly funded system, in our view, will safeguard the contribution of the higher education sector to the economic and social development of the country.  We agree that providing additional funding to the sector must be done on a phased basis and the timeframes envisaged in the report are realistic and achievable.  A predominately State-funded system also avoids putting many thousands of future graduates into long-term debt.  This is important not only in light of our recent economic history but also from the experience of student loan schemes in other jurisdictions.  Ireland already has the third highest level of personal and household indebtedness in the EU.  The introduction of a student loan scheme will add to this already high level of indebtedness.  The experience of student loan schemes in the USA shows that 69% of graduates had to borrow money for their education and in the USA it takes a primary degree holder, on average, 21 years to pay off his or her student loan.  </p><p> As the report points out, employers are major beneficiaries of the outcomes of higher education.  Congress agrees with the recommendation in the report that employers should be required to make a structured contribution to the funding of higher education.  We further agree that this contribution should be made by increasing the national training fund levy.  The levy raised &euro;350 million in 2015.  Congress notes that every 0.1% increase in the levy will raise an additional &euro;50 million and we propose that the rate of contribution be increased so that &euro;700 million is raised through the levy annually.</p><p> If the required investment can be delivered, it places an onus and responsibility on our universities and institutes of technology to ensure that they maintain and improve the quality of teaching and learning and ensure there is an improved student experience arising from the increased investment; continue to adapt and respond to the changes taking place in our economy and society, with a particular focus on ensuring the employability of graduates through the provision of high quality career advice for students; provide significantly improved access to students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and immediately end the use of precarious forms of employment and offer conditions of employment so that the third level sector is seen as an employer of choice capable of attracting the most talented people.  </p><p> I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

It is clear that IBEC is in favour of the student loan system.  Does Mr. Tony Donohoe see any advantages to this?  How could it be addressed?  I note Mr. Richard Kennedy's concern about the inclusion of farming land in a means assessment.  As a farmer's daughter, I totally agree with him.  Does that mean he is in favour of a student loan system?  Could he expand on that?</p> <p>  Clearly ICTU is in favour of the State-funded system but there are many demands on the public purse including pay restoration.  I am interested in where Ms King feels that money should come from?  Is it from higher taxes or levies or cutting spending in other areas?</p></speech>

I will start with Mr. Donohoe.  He said that business is also willing to play its part.  Does that acknowledge it is not fully playing its part?  Is IBEC open to an increase in the national training fund levy that will be ring fenced for higher education?  Is the Irish Farmers' Association in favour of income contingent loans, which means the children of farmers would have to pay?  To date, many of them have not.  I am very open to looking at the fact that 40% of farmers' children are on maintenance grants and whether they should all be on maintenance grants.  We have a strange situation where we have mature students who are being assessed on their parents' income when they do not even live with their parents yet capital and assets of farmers is not taken into account when their children seek to go to education.  Somehow we have failed for a very long time to look at that.  How many of the farmers' families are not in a position to pay?  As we have so many politicians from outside of Dublin, we are sometimes afraid to look at the access of farmers and their children to education.  It is a conversation we need to have.</p> <p>  There was one comment by Mr. Donohoe on free fees.  Something we have not explored is that one in seven children from disadvantaged backgrounds went back into education.  That figure does not take account of the number of mature students from those backgrounds who went back into education.  When we say one in seven individuals, the research has failed to capture that it is actually one in seven families.  It filters out over time.  Among my peers and in my community, where a parent went back to education through the free fees system, their children are now just old enough to enter into the education system.  They will enter it because their parents or elder sibling had that access.  We have not even begun to account for the ripple effect on the children who are just now of age to go to college.  There is a generational change from when it was first introduced.  Sometimes it is not useful to look at how much free fees has or has not failed.  It has had an impact but we have not given it long enough.  We must consider the social and cultural capital and have a more three-pronged approach to access to education.</p></speech>

As with my colleagues, I would like clarity on his position on income contingent loans.  I have concerns, as I say every time we discuss the Cassells report, about equality of access to education and these income contingent loans.  We could lose our most skilled graduates to emigration because if they emigrate they will probably not be chased to repay the loans.</p> <p>  How much more will employers be willing to pay into the national training fund?  At the moment, it raises &euro;350 million but ICTU want it to be raised to &euro;700 million.  What say does ICTU currently have over how that &euro;350 million is spent?  If it was increased, what say would it like to have?</p></speech>

A decision will not be made by this committee.  Some of the previous speakers wished us well in making our decision.  We will not be making the decision.  We will possibly be giving recommendations but it will be for the Oireachtas as a whole and the Government to make a decision.</p> <p>  On farmers, there is always a debate about capital assets but the truth is the average farm income was &euro;24,000 last year.  Many farmers are very badly off.  That is often left out of the debate on capital assets.  There may or may not be an argument for capital assets but farm incomes are extremely low and precarious and that is the bottom line as to why many farmers' children are on maintenance grants.  </p> <p>  On the national training levy, there is no doubt it will play a role in whatever decision is made but the current levy is &euro;380 million a year.  If one doubles that, which would be a massive imposition, it is still only a tiny bit of the sum.  I cannot see anyone proposing that.  That is my observation.  I do not know if IBEC has any observation on the impact of the training levy.  The levy at the moment is 0.7% on employees.  It is &euro;382 million.  If it was brought up to 1%, it would still only be &euro;500 million.  It would be way short of where we need to be.  It will have to pay a role.  Does IBEC see any role for an increase in that?  How will it impact on its members?</p></speech>

Regardless of what way we look at this and regardless of how many newspapers set out details of feeder schools and all that information, which highlights the inequality in the system, we will not resolve the inequities until we give everybody the same chance.  That is the holy all of it.  One gains experience of these matters over the course of one's life.  I did not have the income to go to university and I know what that felt like.</p><p> On the matter of what farm households' assets are taken into account in the awarding of grants, and some people know what is involved in filling out a means-tested grant application, there are no questions about what assets a certain part of the community has or do not have.  If people have nothing it is very hard to get to third level and those people are denied access.  Another group of people at least have a filter which means they do not have the same denial of access.  There are farmers who are in low income categories and they should be treated no differently from others who are in low income categories.  We would not argue otherwise.</p><p> If we reflect on secondary education, which to some degree, was fee paying for a considerable period in the sense that it was either done through fee or scholarship, when access to it was opened up, the vast majority of young people received a second level education.  That was a major move.  Some people with whom I went to national school had one place to go after it - I was not one of them - and that was into the local factory because they could not afford all the costs that were involved in going to secondary school.  That is precisely where we are at in university terms.  There are categories of young people whose parents, having regard to their household income, could not contemplate the notion of sending their children to university because of all the costs involved in that.</p><p> I have children who have been to university and I was lucky enough to earn a living to be able to provide that level of support.  I know the costs involved in providing that.  It is not a question of guessing any of this.  I know what the denial of access to third level based on income means and I also know the cost levels involved.  There are groups of students in secondary schools today who, as long as those barriers to access are in place, will never have access to third level, nor even the prospect of it, until we address those barriers.</p><p> The Chairman asked me where we would get the money to fund the system.  I can think of &euro;620 million that could be immediately got and put into the system, which would be a major injection of capital.  We give our thriving, profitable big business accommodation and food sector a reduced VAT rate which denies this State &euro;620 million a year.  I am referring to global companies which pay the lowest of wages and which get this valuable reduced tax rate.  What sort of transformation would we make to society and to the lives of young people sitting in classrooms in different parts of the country today if the State were able to say that it would not give that sector that tax reduction but would put that &euro;620 million into the education system and thereby allow these young people equal access to university?  We should not build our third level education system, which is extremely important to young people to give them a chance in life, on the basis that they should get a loan and sure they may not have to pay it back.  That is a desperately bad foundation.  I disagree entirely with IBEC.</p><p> The business sector here is well capable of paying much more than it pays.  It gets a big benefit from having very well-educated people.  There is an incentive for those in that sector to invest in third level.  If they were to build up that resource as part of an investment in third level, the likelihood is that they would encourage people to stay here rather people having to leave the country.  There is a big element in that.  Many business people will say there are a few impediments very live in the economy.  One of them is maintaining the skills, another is maintaining women, in particular, with their skills in the workforce because of the lack of child care, and another is the unavailability of housing.  Education is a key element in that.  We have to make a seismic decision.  We view the Cassells report very positively.  It sets out the options in a very good fashion.  We have come down in favour of option one.  I hope I have answered the Chairman's question about funding.</p></speech>

Therefore, a limit should apply.  We also believe that people who cannot afford to pay should be able to get grants in the normal way but people whose income is above the threshold should be able to apply for a loan under the contingent loan scheme.  We are clear on that.</p> <p>  I do not know how much Ms Patricia King and I would have in common but, like her, I also understand the costs of education as a farmer.  My income was above the threshold and that was not a problem and I had to play my part the same as everybody else.  I would say to Senator Ruane and Deputy Catherine Martin that if land, which is the tool of our trade, was included in the calculation, the 40% of students from farm families who get the grant would be wiped out in terms of that percentage of students going to university.  If they note the Teagasc income farm survey, which is an independent one, the factual position is that the average farm income is extremely low and it is accepted that it is low.  Farmers who live in rural areas pay great attention to educating their families to the maximum of their ability and that would account for the differences between the two groups.  That is our position on it.  We understand there must be an increase in funding and we would favour the income contingent loan scheme, which should be capped to ensure it does not put too much of a burden on students.</p></speech>

The idea of State funding is very nice as a notion but the reality is that we will not have an additional &euro;1 billion that is set out in option one of the Cassells Report.  It is to be hoped we are entering a period of economic recovery and that we will see some of those more damaging cuts reversed, but if we are totally reliant on the State and the next economic downturn comes along, we can be guaranteed that it will be higher education funding that will be cut.  It is much easier to cut.  In education we do not have the headlines about people lying on hospital trolleys or about carer's allowance being cut.  It is a slow-burning problem for which we will pay the socially and economically, and we need to put in place a sustainable solution, which is to have co-financing.</p> <p>  I will come to the two questions around the national training fund and employers' propensity to pay and also some of the further issues Senator Ruane raised around access.  I sound a word of caution when we talk about the national training fund.  When we talk about companies in a skills context, we tend to envisage large multinationals which employ many graduates, but most people are employed by companies with fewer than 50 staff, many of which do not employ graduates.  There is a danger that they will see this as an employment tax with all the knock-on effects.</p> <p> In terms of IBEC's attitude to paying an increase in the national training fund, I would make two points.</p><p>First, any increase or adjustment to the national training fund must be part of a greater solution.  As Deputy Byrne said, given the scale of the funding shortfall, the employer contribution is not going to make a significant difference.  That is not to say that we should not increase the contribution.  However, under the options that Cassells set out. the amount was an additional &euro;150 million.  That is 0.05% of the total funding requirement.  We need to get real.  I am surprised at the amount of time that has been taken up at the first session of this committee discussing this magic amount of money that is to come from the business sector.  Incidentally, the same sector also creates the jobs that allow people to pay income tax which underpins our system.</p><p> Employers may not be prepared to engage on this if it is used for politically expedient reasons.  The increase in student fees is perceived as being precisely that.  If we use an increase in the national training fund as a sticking plaster to mend the deep cuts that have been imposed on this sector, it is a problem for us.  Any change needs to be part of a greater solution.</p><p> I wish to pick up on the point make by Deputy Martin relating to how the current national training fund is used at the moment.  The fund will be in surplus by &euro;272 million.  That goes from year to year.  A surplus exists and it is not used for any other reason except to balance the books.  My argument is that it should be used for educational purposes.</p><p> Employers already pay 0.7%.  They have little influence on how this is spent.  I have done a breakdown of the programmes the national training fund supports.  There are 16 different programmes.  Most of them are at further education level, the exceptions being Springboard and, it is hoped, more apprenticeships in future.  A report going back to 2008 published by Forf&aacute;s suggests few of these programmes have strong labour market outcomes.  The national training framework, NTF, is not being used for the purposes for which it was set up.  Until it is, employers will not be prepared to engage in this conversation.  However, we would if we had some influence on how the money was spent.  We might take a different view if we were confident that it was being used to meet skills requirements, but not if we believed it was being put into a black hole.  It is important that we do not lose sight of the bigger issue when we are talking about increases in the NTF.</p><p> Senator Ruane made a point about access.  Access is impacted primarily by culture.  If particular areas have little or no history of people going on to third level, that should be addressed by interventions far earlier in the system.  It is also impacted by the early education experience of those affected.  Again, this arises earlier in the system.</p><p> The third priority is around living costs, especially for people living away from home.  The living costs associated with going to college are far higher than any fees being discussed.  Cassells found no evidence that this had impacted access.  A more insidious class gradient is happening.  A total of 32% of people in university now are studying masters and postdoctoral programmes.  There is no support for students there or for part-time study.  That is creating another class gradient and more discrimination.  Unless we address that, as proposed by Cassells, we cannot really discuss an equitable system.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.84" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Doorley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#U00300"><p>My thanks to Senators and Deputies for the invitation.  The NYCI is the representative body of national youth organisations in Ireland.  We have a wide membership, as the committee has heard already.  Two of our members, the Union of Students in Ireland and the Irish Second-Level Students Union were before the committee this morning.  My input is to try to seek to represent the interests of young people aspiring to access and already engaged in higher education studies in Ireland.<br/><br/>I will not go into detail on what the expert group has set out.  Other contributors and the report have done that well enough.  I am keen to focus on solutions to the problem as well as to highlight some of the challenges and potential consequences of pursuing some of the options proposed the expert group report.<br/><br/>The expert group identified the scale of the funding required and proposed three funding options.  Option two corresponds to the <i>status quo</i>.  We accept this is not sustainable, not only from a funding perspective and in the sense of the financial pressures it is putting on the higher education sector but also because of the &euro;3,000 registration fee and a lack of sufficient supports in tackling inequity in the system.<br/><br/>Others have alluded to the fact that in one area of Dublin 4 a total of 85% of students progressed to third level while in Dublin 17 only 22% did.  It is clear that the current system is not working to address the inequity in the system.<br/><br/>As acknowledged by the expert group, option one is straightforward and supports the principles of access and participation.  There are good reasons to support the argument to continue and enhance State investment in higher education.  We take the view that higher education should be accessible to everyone.  It should be a right rather than a privilege.  Investment in higher education makes good social and economic returns.  These returns are reflected in statistics showing that 41% of people in Ireland now have a higher education qualification.  The proportion is even higher among the 25 to 34 years age cohort.  All societies need a highly skilled and highly educated population to attract investment and to stimulate and sustain economic growth.  The Government has published a skills strategy which is predicated on the idea that people have the skills they require.  Therefore, our aim should be to work towards this option.  We acknowledge that it cannot happen overnight and, therefore, we maintain the Government should bring forward a plan on how this can be achieved.  The report referred to a timeframe of 15 years and how it can be achieved in that timeframe.<br/><br/>Any increase in funding for the higher education sector must include measures to increase the participation of students with fewer opportunities than is the case at present.  We are rather concerned about the high level of non-progression of first year college students.  The Higher Education Authority produced a report the year before last.  It highlighted that 16% of students did not progress to second year.  That corresponds to more than 6,500 young people.  This represents a significant loss to those young people as well as the cost to their families and the loss of a year.  It is also a cost from a financial point of view and we need to address that issue.<br/><br/>Another option includes income contingent loans.  We are opposed to this idea.  It would represent a profound change in how we invest and support third level education.  First, we are concerned about the financial burden it would put on young people.  If we have learned anything from the crisis, it is the fact that heaping high levels of debt on people, especially young people, is not a sustainable model to pursue.  The report adverts to evidence from Australia and the UK.  We need to acknowledge that Ireland is not Australia or the UK and we have different circumstances.  Even in post-recession Ireland, young people are already facing an extremely challenging economic situation, including access to employment.  Where young people do get access to employment, they face issues around career progression and low rates of pay.<br/><br/>The report refers to income thresholds.  That is relevant for now, but young people have no guarantee that those income thresholds will not change at some stage in future.  This could also have a cooling effect on people or act as a deterrent.  Young people have to make a choice.  Should they take a low-paid job or get into debt?  Many young people would be deterred from third level if they believed they would have to pay debt further down the line.  It might be said that they do not have to pay it, but it is still there and they may have to pay it at some stage later on.</p><p>There is evidence in the report about Australia but Ireland has a much higher level of migration, particularly in the wake of the recent crisis, as we have seen.  I believe the Cassells report refers to the basic idea in question, but there are many details that it does not address in terms of a income contingent loan system.  I refer to the coverage, rates of payment, income thresholds and the question of who manages it.  There is reference to the State managing it, but one must ask whether that could change ten, 15 or 20 years down the road.  It would be a profound change.  Once one starts with a system and agrees to it, one cannot go back.  One cannot unscramble that egg.  Any Government that would bring in a contingent loan system would be engaged in major change.</p><p> As I said, we are opposed to the deferred contingent loan system.  We believe option 2 is the best in the longer term.  We accept it would require increased State investment but we have believed in this country that the primary and secondary level education sectors should be funded by the taxpayer.  I realise there are parent contributions; there is no doubt about that.  Fundamentally, we believe investing in education is good social practice.  Likewise, we believe this is the approach any Government should take in regard to the third level system.</p><p> I thank the committee for this opportunity.  I am happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I will not go through our entire introductory statement.  It has been circulated.</p> <p>  The national risk assessment has identified a lack of investment in education as one of the seven social risks facing the country.  Human capital has been singled out in that report as an area for investment.  Education is recognised as crucial to the achievement of our national objectives.  Competitiveness, social inclusion and active citizenship are also referred to.</p> <p>  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, population projections indicate considerable investment is required to ensure the higher education sector can continue to cope with the projected increase in demand.  In recent years, however, funding has been out of step with this.  Failure to invest in skills has been highlighted by the OECD as resulting in the danger of low levels of innovation, higher levels of underemployment, unemployment and vacant jobs.  Educational success is now about critical approaches to problem solving and the capacity to live in a multifaceted world.</p> <p>  The report highlighted Ireland should be considering benchmarking its funding against funding in the countries with which we aspire to compete.  This is an important point.  The report outlines some options in funding.  However, regardless of what options the Government takes, public investment will have to increase significantly over the next decade due to the shortfall in investment we have had and the demographic challenges of the future.  In this regard, we propose that a framework to 2028, with a roadmap, should be set out for sustainable funding and revenue.</p> <p>  There are strong arguments, from an equity perspective, that those who benefit from higher education and who can afford to contribute to the cost should do so.  People with higher education qualifications do reap a substantial earning premium in the labour market, which increases with age.  There are arguments against it, however, especially in light of any complementary strategy to do with long-term future funding.  An issue arises over fees in part-time education.  With regard to the current fiscal rules, would the Government loan guarantee be recorded on the general Government balance sheet?  That is a challenge we face.  We have argued consistently that there should be flexibility within the Stability and Growth Pact concerning public investment in fields such as education, health care and child care.</p> <p>  Ultimately, the funding for higher education has to be considered within the overall future funding requirements of the State.  I refer to the requirement to pay back our national debt and to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which has been transferred to the State.  Future pension payments, water infrastructure, broadband, child care and all these issues will require an increase in the overall national income, no matter what way one decides to fund higher education.  In that regard, we welcome this discussion but we believe the future income needs of the State need to be considered in the broader discussion, and higher education should be considered in light of education as a whole along with early childhood education and primary and second level education.  Life-long learning is crucial.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.90" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Diarmuid Hegarty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#V00600"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving the Higher Education Colleges Association an opportunity to represent the views of the private colleges on the future of education funding.  I attended the proceedings of the committee earlier this morning.  It seems quite clear to me this committee and the Oireachtas as a whole face very difficult decisions.  There is a real danger of a menagerie where the ostriches with their heads in the sand ignore the elephants in the room.  I fear the pressing demands of the electorate may cause history to judge our generation as ostriches.  We see our role as putting a spotlight on the elephants in the room.  As private institutions, our key message is that we can help and we want to help.</p> <p>  What are the elephants in the room?  There are two key ones.  First, the committee faces a major challenge in recommending how to meet the coming explosion in student numbers.  I really have not heard that stressed in earlier points made in respect of the Cassells committee.</p> <p>The second major challenge concerns addressing the 20 years of relative failure to improve significantly access to higher education among the disadvantaged.  If heads remain in the sand, these problems will reach crisis levels.  Both problems have to be addressed with a huge number of additional places, many of which we can provide.  We can do this at a much lower cost than the State sector and will not need any capital funding from the Exchequer.</p> <p>  The Cassells group projected a 29% increase in student numbers by the end of the next decade.  The Department's latest projections put that between 22.5% at the low end and 34% at the high end.  The actual percentage will depend on increases in the number of school leavers going to college and in the numbers of mature and overseas students.  In other words, we could need up to 60,000 extra full-time places by the end of the next decade.  That would increase higher education enrolment in Ireland up to a record 227,000 places.  How can anyone address the question of funding higher education without factoring in an expansion of the scale we know is coming?  The future students are already born and at school.  How will we fund the extra 60,000 places?  One should think for a moment about the consequence of not providing the places.  We would be depriving tens of thousands of young people of the right to go to college.  It would particularly affect the disadvantaged people in respect of whom much more has to be done to improve access.  Free fees have not worked, as shown in the research paper by Dr. Kevin Denny from UCD, quoted in our submission.</p> <p>  Individual institutions are doing what they can to increase access.  Let me give an example of a scholarship student on our lower degree programme.  She is adapting well to the challenge of self-motivation.  She describes college life as a fantastic experience and she is meeting many new people from different backgrounds.  She is not entitled to a maintenance grant but is working four days per week and is coping well with this challenge.  She is the eldest in a family of ten.  She is the first to go to college among her family and close friends.  She has been followed by her younger sister and is watched closely by others in her youth project.  I am referring to her words, not mine.</p> <p>  We need an overall systemic approach to tackling the issue of disadvantage in higher education.  I take issue with Ms Patricia King when she offers us &euro;620 million.  If we really want to increase access, that &euro;620 million has to go into first and second levels, where the problem is.  It is not a matter of funding.  All the research shows it is not a question of funding, it is performance at second level that is determining access to third level.</p> <p>  Another consequence of not dramatically expanding higher education would be a likely skills shortage in an economy due to expand by 34% over the next ten years, according to the ESRI.  That is even taking Brexit into account.  If the places are not provided, it would act as a drag on multinational investment in Ireland at a time when the advantages of our current tax regime are under threat.  Our detailed submission outlines how we can supply many additional places and how we can widen access.  I will be happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I thank Professor Hegarty.  He has certainly stated the elephant in the room in a very straightforward way.  That is the reality of the situation we are facing.</p><p>I thank Ms Michelle Murphy for her holistic approach to setting out the issues in regard to education and where education fits into society.  Does she see the student loan option as a suitable method or does she feel that higher taxation is the answer?<br/><br/>It was clear Mr. Doorley was against the <i>status quo</i>and opposed to the student loans system.  He feels the State-funded model is the way to go but I am interested in whether he believes the funding should come from increased taxation or cutting expenditure in other areas.<br/><br/>Do members have any questions?</p></speech>

For example, we probably need to hear from someone who knows the German system, and we have heard about the Australian system but we probably need to hear from someone with direct experience of it.  With regard to Professor Hegarty's contribution, the issue of demographics was discussed at other meetings but it is a huge issue that merits further discussion.  I thank all of the witnesses for their contributions.</p></speech>

Professor Hegarty made an interesting point on private colleges and how we can use that facility to cater not alone for current demand but projected demand going forward.  With regard to the current situation in this country and other jurisdictions that Professor Hegarty is aware of, how do the private colleges contribute?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1340" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#W00400"><p>I agree completely with Ms Murphy's point that education, health and child care are crucial in society.  Nonetheless, they are areas that have been neglected, let us face it, which is where we have got the priorities wrong.  As I stated earlier, there is a way around this and it simply means prioritising what is important.  That has not happened in the past and it needs to happen now.  It will affect future change and will affect our young people and society in general.  We need to have our priorities right.  We need to put pressure on the Government to ensure those areas are always prioritised.</p></speech>

As regards the funding and how other jurisdictions dealt with this, the British have approached it in a clever way in that they have extended the student loan funding to students of what they call "alternative providers".  They have learned the lesson from the United States by limiting the amount of the loan and they will only lend up to Stg&pound;6,000 a year in respect of a course in an alternative provider in the UK.  This prevents astronomic student loans building up where students are studying with private providers, as has been the case in the United States.  There is a way of learning lessons from elsewhere, and through the student loan system there is definitely a way of funding much greater access through the private colleges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Michelle Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#W00600"><p>I thank the Deputies and Senators.  To come back to the Chairman's first question, our organisation is on record that we foresee higher taxation, which means raising national income.  This is not just for funding higher education but for the pressures I outlined, which were also noted by Deputy Nolan, in regard to waste infrastructure, broadband, public transport and demographic pressures, not just in education but in health services, child care, the fair deal scheme and housing - the list goes on.  We have publicly supported this in the past and have written about it.</p> <p>  Within the context of increased PRSI and increased State funding, there is a strong argument from an equity perspective for an income-contingent loans scheme.  The Department of Education and Skills in 2009 published a very detailed paper looking at a variety of options and looking at countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom.  However, the detail has to be simple.  For example, is it the State that guarantees it?  Any form of income-contingent loan should not in any way prevent State resources being allocated to other areas where there is need, which is critical.</p> <p>  No matter what option is picked, more investment is needed.  At the moment there is significant pressure on the national income from other areas so, as a society, we are going to have to reconcile ourselves to the fact the Government will have to raise the amount of national income collected on an annual basis in order to fund the services and infrastructure that people expect.  I agree with Deputy Nolan that we need a framework for prioritisation and that framework has to be able to deliver a vibrant economy, decent services and infrastructure, good governance, sustainability and just taxation.  We need to be able to explain to the people that, in order to get their social services, we need to prioritise and, therefore, some things will have to wait.  However, they need to be convinced that, in the long run, the State will be able to deliver the services they expect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Doorley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016120800002#W00700"><p>The Chairman asked where the money should come from, which is the fundamental question the report is looking at.  We would argue this is about broadening the tax base through progressive taxation.  We know many people who do third level earn higher salaries but, as a result, they will contribute to the overall system through progressive taxation.  The idea is that we should not treat third level differently, given we do not ask people to take out loans to go to second level or to primary school, and, in a sense, we should look at education as a social good to which we all contribute, and we do that through the taxation system.</p> <p>  There is a concern that we will solve one problem - the fact the State has a funding problem at third level - but create another.  We know what happened in housing, in which the State was very involved.  The State built many houses and provided support to people through county councils to build their houses.  It then went out of that sector and decided the private sector will deal with it and people can take out loans.  We see now that the State is trying to solve a crisis.  What might happen is that the State could solve the problem so that we know where we will get the resources to deal with investment in third level, which is through the contingent loans system, but we are then loading that debt onto individuals throughout the country who will have that debt for perhaps 10 or 20 years.</p> <p>  It is very important that we look at this issue from a youth perspective, in particular in regard to the post-secondary level and young people's options to progress their career, and that we do not just talk about third level.  We seem to have a bit of an obsession with talking about third level.  I believe we also need to look at the vocational education sector and further education, and how that is going to be funded.  Mr. Donohoe mentioned that we can see from Australia and the UK that fees have a huge impact on part-time fees.  I did not go to college when I left school because it was not an option for me at the time, but I went back afterwards.  People who have decided not to go to third level when they leave school, but who want to go back afterwards to study part-time, could be disadvantaged by a loans system.</p> <p>  As Deputy Byrne said, the Government will make the decision on this.  However, due to the lack of detail, I do not know how anyone could recommend the model of a contingent loans system presented in the report.  While I accept the report acknowledges this, it does not address many of the necessary details.  It is as if I went into a bank to get a loan and was told it would give me X amount but would not tell me the interest rate.  There would have to be a lot more detail before anyone would agree to this.  We believe we could end up just solving the State's problem.  As Mr. Donohoe mentioned, if the State did go down the line of the contingent loans system, there is a real danger that, if the pressure does come on down the line, it would decide to decrease the income thresholds and put less money into third level, so the level of debt would increase and the number of people able to access it would decrease.</p> <p>  In terms of participation, particularly from low income groups and other under-represented groups, it is much more than just funding and is really around the supports at first and second level.  However, it is also around the other supports that people need at local level to help them to aspire to go to third level and to feel that, if they do go, they can get a meaningful career and job out of it afterwards.</p></speech>

The Governor of the Central Bank is at the Governing Council of the ECB today.  He sends his apologies in advance of his attendance before the committee on 20 December.</p> <p>  As the potential effects of the Bill are relevant from consumer protection, financial stability and prudential supervision perspectives, I am joined today by the Central Bank's director of consumer protection and the head of financial stability.</p> <p>  The Central Bank's mission of safeguarding stability and protecting consumers is at the heart of all that we do.  It encapsulates the dual and interdependent priorities for the bank in delivering on its mandate.  Effective regulation and supervision driving well-governed and well-managed firms, which support economic growth and employment in Ireland, are outcomes that are in consumers' long-term interests.</p><p>Similarly, the fair and equitable treatment of consumers is obviously fundamentally important in its own right but also in supporting the long-term viability of regulated firms and financial stability more generally.</p><p> The public debate surrounding Irish mortgage rates is understandable, as are the objectives of the Bill.  A cursory comparison shows that some variable interest rates in Ireland remain among the highest in the euro area, despite recent reductions.  However, the root causes of this are complex.  In my opening remarks, I will discuss some of the main features of the Irish private dwelling home, PDH, mortgage market, outline how some of the associated issues are affecting mortgage pricing in Ireland, and show that there has been significant progress in addressing these issues.  I will summarise why the Bill may not achieve its stated aims and may have negative unintended consequences.</p><p> Let us consider the Irish mortgage market.  As with the wider housing market, it is recovering but it is still suffering the effects of the crisis that beset Ireland and from the mortgage lending that took place in the period leading up to 2008.  Since the onset of the financial crisis, many mortgage holders have struggled to keep up with repayments.  While the situation is improving, it is still acute, both at system level and also for individual borrowers in distress.  The Central Bank has worked to ensure that the appropriate protections are in place for these borrowers who are in difficulty and to ensure that the banks have the financial and operational resources with which to resolve the problems.</p><p> At the end of June 2016, there were 740,834 PDH mortgage accounts in Ireland.  Of these, 57,500 are in default.  In other words, they are more than 90 days in arrears on their payments.  Of the 57,500, nearly 35,000 are more than two years in arrears.  A little over 120,000 PDH mortgage loans have been restructured, primarily due to repayment difficulties.</p><p> The Central Bank has utilised its legislative powers to protect consumers by imposing a number of codes of conduct and requirements on regulated firms, including the consumer protection code, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, or CCMA, and the minimum competency code.  While the Central Bank does not have a statutory function to regulate mortgage rates, we continue to prioritise the protection of mortgage holders. </p><p> A central element of the CCMA is that arrangements to solve mortgage arrears must be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower, and that repossession should be used only as a last resort.  Under the CCMA, a regulated entity may commence legal proceedings for repossession of a PDH only where it has made "every reasonable effort" to agree on an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower and where other clear requirements are adhered to.  The introduction of mortgage arrears resolution targets, MARTs, in 2013 drove a material change in the mix of restructures agreed, with a shift away from interest-only-type arrangements to more sustainable solutions.  As a direct consequence of these actions, together with improvements in the Irish economy, mortgage arrears are reducing, while every effort is being made to keep mortgage holders who are struggling to meet their payment obligations in their homes.  Mortgage arrears have fallen for 12 successive quarters and by 43% from peak, with more than 120,000 mortgage holders having their loans restructured, although note this is not necessarily a cheaper option for those borrowers.</p><p> None the less, mortgage lending is evidently riskier in Ireland than in other eurozone countries.  Furthermore, due to the economic and social policy choices that have been made, being able to effect the security that underpins the loan is more challenging in Ireland in the event of a default than in many other eurozone countries.  To illustrate this point, between 2009 and June 2016, just over 6,000 PDH properties have been repossessed in Ireland, two thirds of which were either voluntarily surrendered or abandoned by the borrower.  Approximately one in five mortgages is or has been in default, and fewer than one in 300 has lost possession of a house through the courts. </p><p> Let me move on to interest rates.  The stock of mortgages in Ireland can be broadly divided into fixed-rate mortgages and floating-rate mortgages, and the latter category can in turn be divided into standard variable rate mortgages, SVRs, and tracker rates.  More and more variable rate mortgages are priced according to loan-to-value considerations.  For the moment, I will stick with using SVR as a catch-all for non-tracker variable rate mortgages.</p><p> Currently, around 90% of outstanding mortgage loans for primary dwellings are on floating rates.  About 50% are SVRs, with the remainder being trackers.  Consequently, 90% of PDH mortgage borrowers are exposed to interest rate risk, and are vulnerable to interest rate rises.  </p><p> Turning to mortgage interest rates themselves, the average interest rate across mortgage products in Ireland has fallen over recent years, and currently stands at 2.64%.  This is quite close to that of the weighted average in eurozone countries at 2.55 % and is an exceptionally low level in historical terms for Irish borrowers, albeit that the average interest rate excluding tracker mortgages is 3.78%, despite having declined in recent years.</p><p> In the same way as it is an oversimplification to refer only to one average interest rate for Irish mortgages, there are perils in oversimplifying our comparison with other eurozone mortgage rates given the different characteristics of housing and mortgage markets in different member states, including home ownership, the history of default and the balance between fixed and variable rate mortgages.</p><p> I will now move on to the factors affecting mortgage rates.  In May 2015, the Central Bank published a paper on influences on standard variable mortgage pricing in Ireland.  This paper set out the range of factors which affect the margin that banks charge on variable rate mortgages, including the cost of funds, the credit risk associated with the lending, operational costs of running a bank, the cost of capital and the market structure and the competitive environment faced by each bank.</p><p> With regard to credit risk, despite considerable recent progress European Banking Authority, EBA, stress test data show that Ireland's mortgage default rate is more than ten times higher than that in many other eurozone and European Union countries.  In other words, as I touched on earlier, mortgages are higher risk in Ireland than in the majority of those countries with which mortgage rates are compared.  The EBA stress test data also show banks operating in Ireland need to hold significantly more capital for Irish mortgages on average per euro of mortgage lending than other European banks, with associated higher costs, and hence mortgage rates.  The low level of repossessions I referred to creates uncertainty on the recoverability of collateral.  Cross-country comparative research shows that increased recovery time is associated with lower availability of credit and higher interest rates.</p><p> A further determinant of bank lending margins, and hence pricing, is the degree of competition in the market.  The crisis resulted in considerable structural changes to the Irish banking sector, including increased concentration.  We have seen some nascent signs of restoration in competition, with the reductions in variable rates, some increasing product differentiation and potentially some small new entrants, but this is not of a significant scale at this stage.</p><p> The ability and willingness of consumers to switch mortgage products is vital to ensure a well-functioning market.  The level of switching of mortgages in Ireland is low, and much lower than before the crisis.  In this context, the additional transparency measures announced by the Central Bank in July, and which will come into effect from 1 February 2017, are aimed at increasing transparency and facilitating consumer choice.  This has become more important as we have started to see greater differentiation in product offerings and mortgage pricing.</p><p> The vast majority of SVR borrowers in positive and negative equity could benefit from either switching to another provider or to another product with the same provider.  Switching offers the dual benefits of potentially reducing monthly costs or the length of the mortgage, or both, with potential savings of tens of thousands of euros.  The more people who start to switch, the less ability the banks will have to differentiate between new borrowers and existing ones.</p><p> The Central Bank is also examining what additional measures it can take to address any impediments to switching, notwithstanding that there is a material difference between switching current account or utility provider and entering into an arrangement involving lending a customer sizeable sums on a 20-plus year basis.</p><p> Turning to our assessment of the Bill, it is far from certain it will be successful in delivering its understood aims.  We are concerned that the Bill focuses on the symptoms of a complex problem and may, therefore, not only be unsuccessful but run the risk of being counter-productive as it may have damaging side effects affecting the functioning of the market. </p><p> From both financial stability and consumer protection perspectives, it is essential that banks have sustainable business models that take into account the risks that are inherent in their lending practices.  There is a risk that capping interest rates will result in an under-pricing of credit risk, as was experienced in Ireland and internationally to such dangerous effect in the past.  Alternatively, were this legislation to be introduced, lenders may adapt their credit standards and offer variable mortgage loans only to new customers with a low risk profile, ultimately reducing credit availability.  Lenders could also raise interest rates on other loans, and increase fees and commissions, in order to maintain or achieve sustainable capital generation.</p><p> It is important that banks have the ability to generate capital to transition towards full implementation of new regulatory capital requirements.  Adequate capitalisation is essential for a properly functioning banking system and to ensure sufficient availability of credit for businesses and households, in addition to strengthening the resilience of banks to future shocks.  Additionally, the proposed legislation may have the unintended effect of stifling competition and innovation and dissuade entry of new participants to the Irish market.  International evidence indicates that competitive financing markets are important for the choice, quality and pricing of financial products, which are all in the interest of the consumer.  Furthermore, with regard to the interest rates charged on existing SVR mortgage loans, they are subject to existing contracts and contract law, which only a judge could override, not a public body such as the Central Bank. </p><p> We are also concerned about the extension of the bank's statutory functions to encompass the regulation of competition, which is a function already carried out by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CPCC.  We also note the European Central Bank's concerns raised in its opinion on the Bill, to which I referred, and the European Commission's view, as articulated in the summary of the post-programme surveillance statement issued last week.</p><p> I appreciate that the positions I have outlined today are arguments against what might be perceived as a quick action to reduce SVR mortgage rates, which are low by historical standards, albeit higher than in countries with much lower default histories.</p><p>Material improvements have been recorded in many of the factors underlying mortgage rates in recent years, most notably lower household indebtedness, lower numbers in negative equity, lower numbers in arrears or default, improved resilience of the banking sector, and ultimately a gradual progression from impaired functioning of our banking system so that it can support economic growth, employment, and incomes.  These improvements have coincided with some reductions in SVR rates.  Further progress is expected in the coming years as the impact of the measures taken continue to feed through to the mortgage market and financial system, and as the economic recovery continues.</p><p> The issues in the mortgage market are complex and rooted in the crisis.  Clear economic and social policy choices have been made in managing the crisis and navigating a path out of it.  Short-term fixes may have long-term negative consequences for consumers.  Decisions to intervene legislatively in the mortgage market, as with any market, should be taken with due cognisance of the market, the factors that lead to the perception of market failure, the underlying causes, and the risks associated with the action and the likely outcomes.    Notwithstanding these concerns, as the Governor has previously stated, if these powers are conferred upon the Bank, we will do as we always do and strive to deliver to the best of our abilities the duties and mandate that are given to us.  The Central Bank remains focused on delivery of its full mandate.  It is committed to working with all stakeholders to support the continued normalisation of the Irish mortgage market.</p></speech>

I also thank him for his opening remarks.</p> <p>  As Mr. Sibley will know, the Bill passed Second Stage unopposed in the D&aacute;il last May.  We are now approaching the end of the pre-legislative scrutiny phase that takes places before embarking on a detailed analysis of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I have always acknowledged and put on the record on a number of occasions that it would be better if legislation was unnecessary.  There has been some progress on variable rate pricing but in my view there has not been enough progress.  I have acknowledged the need for banks to have sustainable business models, to be profitable and to have adequate capital levels and compared that with how a certain cohort of customers have been treated.  My party and I have reached the conclusion that variable rate customers have been and are being treated unfairly.  We have concluded that they have been discriminated against.  We have concluded that there is no economic justification for the types of rates that continue to be charged in the Irish market on variable rate mortgage products.  </p> <p>  My first question relates to the consumer protection code of 2012 that requires regulated entities or banks to act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of their customers and the integrity of the market.  Is it fair, as is required under the code, for certain banks to treat their existing variable rate mortgage customers very differently from how they treat their new customers?  For example, Permanent TSB applies a significant price difference of 0.5%.  Is it fair that a pillar bank like the Bank of Ireland has openly said it will keep its variable rate pricing high to encourage customers to sign up to fixed rate products?  Does Mr. Sibley and the Central Bank view those types of practices as being fair on consumers in the Irish market?</p></speech>

We operate in a market economy where we hope there is competition in the market.  The Bill refers to market failure and the need for competition.  In a competitive market there will be a choice of products.  At any given moment there will be a differentiation between products and their price.  Over a period the choices and experiences of consumers will vary greatly if the market works in a competitive manner.</p> <p>  Is it fair to have a situation whereby two borrowers who live next door to each other in identical semi-detached houses but one householder is on an SVR while the other is on a tracker rate?  One borrower could be in sizeable negative equity having paid a lot more for the same house.  Is that fair?  One borrower could be in very significant mortgage arrears and not contributing to mortgage payments relative to the other one.  Is that fair?  I am not sure it is for the Central Bank to opine on whether there is a degree of wisdom or luck in the choices made by consumers.  The Central Bank is responsible for making sure that there is clear transparency, and that there is consistency in terms of products and how the terms and conditions are articulated and applied.  Over time that will result in differences in terms of the experiences of consumers.  </p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Sheridan, will comment on the CCPC point.</p></speech>

Mr. Sibley has given a number of examples and asked whether it is fair.   We are talking about existing customers and new customers availing of the same product but being given different offers.  Clearly, inaction by the Central Bank on that issue deems the process to be fair.  The Cental Bank does not seem to have an issue with this practice.</p></speech>

If I look at the banks that heavily differentiate between fixed rate and variable rate pricing in terms of the products offered to both new and existing customers, then north of 97% of SVR customers can switch from their current mortgage rate to a lower one.  They have that choice.  One of the banks has clearly articulated that choice at this committee and it is also the case with the other banks.  Customers do have a choice.  They are not being discriminated against in terms of that choice.  They have exactly the same ability as a new customer to move to a much reduced rate relative to the one that they have today.  In terms of market functioning and competitiveness there is choice.</p></speech>

There will be a loss of flexibility, for example.  If the variable rate falls below the fixed rate the borrower cannot avail of same.  If he or she wants to make a lump sum payment or move house and switch the mortgage penalties will be incurred.  Mr. Sibley's answer is not good enough.</p></speech>

In terms of issuing the loan in the first place our priority is to make sure that the banks ensure the loan is affordable.  That is a key point in the code.  If people get into difficulty the code requires that the banks try to work with the borrower to ensure that an arrangement is put in place.</p> <p>  In terms of fair pricing, the committee is aware of our role in pricing.  In the past there was a standard variable rate contract.  The name gives it away as the rate was standard.  In many ways the market was more transparent and simpler because new borrowers and existing borrowers would get the SVR and people could compare them more easily.  As members will be aware, banks have moved away from an SVR by introducing lower rates to encourage borrowers to switch. </p> <p>  One of the reasons that we have introduced new measures in the code is because the market has become more complex.  The lenders say they have made the lower rates that were available to new customers available to existing customers.  However, the customer must take action to avail of the lower rates.  Our new requirements impose an obligation on the lenders to inform the borrowers if there is a better product available and one that is better value for the borrower.  I agree with the Deputy that the market has become more complex but that is one of the reasons we have introduced new measures.</p></speech>

Taking all of that into account, is it the view of the Central Bank that variable rate mortgages in Ireland are appropriately priced, in particular the cost of funds, capital and risk of default?</p><p>I accept that it is not a function of the bank to have a view on whether they are appropriately priced.  However, does it have a view in that regard and where does the bank see them going?  As I said, there has been some progress in terms of an increase in product offerings and reductions in rates but does the Central Bank believe the current rates are appropriate?</p></speech>

There is a degree of differentiation in bank strategies in that some are still heavily lending at variable rates with others, as mentioned already, being more focused on a fixed rate perspective.  An important factor in terms of pricing of mortgages, which is not touched on in the Bill, is credit risk.  Credit risk in Ireland is very elevated because of the very high levels of default and, from a secured lending perspective, the difficulty in terms of effecting that security, which is at a much lower rate in Ireland that in the majority of other eurozone countries.  This causes problems from a secured lending perspective.  Unsecured lending rates in Ireland are much higher than secured lending rates.  There are now options available to the vast majority of borrowers.  I would strongly encourage borrowers to look at the options available to them.  This is part of the work that the Central Bank is doing in regard to the measures that come into force on 1 February next.  Borrowers will have the ability to choose to save money on their mortgages today.  As I said, overall in terms of SDI borrowers more than 80% of them can save money by switching.  This could have a material affect and save them tens of thousands of euro over the lifetime of the mortgage.</p></speech>

We want borrowers to be aware that if their existing lender has a better option within its suite that could benefit them they should be made aware of it.  From 1 February lenders will also have to make available to borrowers information on the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's website, which provides a mortgage tool that allows borrowers to see what is available in the market.  We are working to ensure lenders promote the benefits of switching to their borrowers.  We are currently undertaking further research in regard to what additional measures we can introduce to help borrowers switch.  We are also looking to other countries to see what they have done and while each market is slightly different and so it is difficult to see what measures would work here we are getting some good ideas from the process.  To inform our work, we are talking to consumers around their experiences of the switching process and we plan to introduce additional measures in 2017.</p></speech>

In 2014-16, the percentage number of switchers was 2% and it is expected to be 8% for 2016.  The level of switching pretty much collapsed in part because of the issues that borrowers were facing and, to a degree, the level of trackers in the system and the level of competition and differentiation in the market.  That differentiation is growing now and so the opportunity for borrowers to switch and the benefits of doing so is becoming more relevant.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website provides an excellent switching tool which allows borrowers to compare their current mortgage offering with those available in the market.</p></speech>

It is one of our concerns, particularly in relation to unregulated loan owners because we do not regulate their activities.  While we regulate the banks we do not regulate the interest rates by virtue of the fact that the regulation of lending into the market is in itself a self control.  That is one of our concerns in terms of the unregulated sector and interest rates therein.  We monitor what they are doing in terms loans that have been transferred to them.  We do that through the servicing agents they have all appointed.  To date, there has been no sign of interest rates on mortgages being increased post sale but we are keeping a close eye on that.  If we see that the behaviour is such that would not be tolerated by regulated companies we can go back to Government on the matter.  It is more difficult for us in that sector.</p></speech>

For example, in regard to mortgages, there are restrictions in place in Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Croatia, Hungary, Italy and Poland.  One of the ECB's main observations in regard to the Bill is that it does not believe the Central Bank should have a role in competition.  That is a point that can be teased out.</p> <p>  However, the ECB also makes the point that in the aforementioned countries the cap on the interest rates is enshrined directly in legislation and that the role of a Central Bank is to come up with a reference or benchmark rate as opposed to what is provided for in this Bill which gives the power to the Central Bank to set a cap following a market assessment.  We already have caps on interest rates in Ireland in relation to credit unions, the rate for which is 12% per annum.  The Central Bank also has to set a cap in respect of each moneylender's licence.  I understand the bank is co-sponsoring a study with Social Finance Ireland on how more restrictions could be placed on the interest rates that can be charged by the money lending sector.  There does not seem to be any ideological opposition to having caps on interest rates because they are already in place in some sectors of the economy.  If the Central Bank did not have the competition role as set out in the Bill - which can be dealt with by way of amendment - and instead was tasked with devising a methodology for arriving at a reference rate would the bank's position be different and more supportive of the objectives of the Bill?</p></speech>

We very much want to see the functioning of the mortgage market improve.  There is no disagreement from the Central Bank that the market is not functioning as it should be.  It is better than it was and continues to improve but it is not where it needs to be.  There are caps in place and we are aware of them.  As the Deputy stated these are set by legislation but an alternative might be to designate the Central Bank as the competent authority in that regard.</p><p> In terms of setting reference rates, the danger in going down that path is that there could well be a tendency to migrate towards them.  To use an analogy, with the macro-prudential mortgage measures that were implemented, we have seen there is a tendency to treat those in an incorrect way potentially as targets rather than necessarily banks making individual decisions from a risk basis.  We would not necessarily rule it out but the concerns we have about this Bill are around the side effects and unintended consequences of it.  If other things are being looked at, that is fine, but we need to make sure we are focused on the outcomes we want, the factors that are causing the problem that we perceive and then legislate if we are going to legislate on that basis.</p></speech>

In terms of the mortgage market, competition and the concern about rates in Ireland, if there was a degree of unfairness, overcharging or abnormal profits being made, where are those new entrants?  With European Union legislation, there is not a necessity for Central Bank authorisation.  A big bank with lower funding costs, without a  drag from non-performing loans or from tracker mortgages and in a stronger position underneath the Irish banks could branch in here, under freedom of establishment or freedom of services, and it would not even need to have an operation here.  It could lend at much lower rates than the Irish banks, but why does that not happen?  One of the reasons is that we still have uncertainty in the Irish market, as shown by the high level of non-performing loans.</p></speech>

There would be a degree of engagement, discussion and ongoing fact finding, both from the bank perspective and from the regulatory perspective.  That can take quite a long time.  It depends how quickly the bank wants to move but from the point that the application is received in the Central Bank, the process is relatively quick.  It is typically a matter of months.  However, in terms of when one would start the clock running, it is difficult to say because there could be an initial discussion and quite a long time may elapse before  an application is submitted.</p></speech>

I appreciate it is a two-way street and we are not privy to the details, but does Mr. Sibley believe the Central Bank is sufficiently resourced and gives the priority required to new applications or expressions of interest, particularly given the increased interest in licensing as a result of Brexit and the additional resources that will be allocated to the Central Bank next year to deal with that?

We will act as we always do in trying to deliver our mandate to the best of our ability.  That includes dealing with potential and actual authorisations and applications.  We have a key role as a gatekeeper to make sure, both from a consumer protection and financial stability perspective, that those firms that are seeking to come here are suitably robust and have minor management here, but there will not be any favouritism in terms of potential new entrants that are Brexit related relative to those that are seeking to serve the domestic market.  We will prioritise and allocate resources to make sure that we are dealing with these issues.  We have resourcing challenges, as was reported again today, but we will make that the authorisation process is done in a timely fashion in line with our publicly stated standards.</p></speech>

The most recent application and authorisation from the bank's perspective was Credit Suisse and that was a third country branch.  We had a large number of people involved in that authorisation because there is a degree of complexity with the business model and it cuts across two different supervisory areas.

That would indicate that the mortgage market is continuing to return to a degree more of functionality that it had last year, two years ago, three years ago and today.  There is, therefore, no objection on that basis.  The concern around the Bill is that it is treating the symptoms.  There is a symptom now in terms of variable rate mortgage pricing being higher relative to other eurozone countries.  As I noted, there are dangers in that comparison if it is overly simplified.  What we are really saying, however, is that the underlying factors - the causes of the difference between mortgage rates in Ireland versus other eurozone countries - are the things on which we should focus.  These are the things on which the Central Bank is focusing and is continuing to try to address.</p></speech>

He spoke about the difficulty in respect of repossession, which I will allude to later.  Does the Central Bank believe there is currently scope for interest rates to be reduced further by the financial institutions?</p></speech>

Banks are making commercial decisions as to how they structure pricing across their books and there is now greater choice for consumers as to the type of mortgages and the mortgage products they have and the price they pay for those mortgages.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.164" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120800002#F00500"><p>We appreciate and recognise that interest rates are reducing.  Someone who takes out a mortgage with a loan to value ratio of 50% will not present a serious problem as the mortgage does not involve risk.  Are the variable interest rates being charged for such mortgages excessive or appropriate given the risks at this point?  They are much higher than those applied by our competitors in the rest of Europe.</p></speech>

The level of defaults in Ireland is up to ten times higher than in other eurozone countries.  The figures are in the table I circulated.  The mortgage market here has other differences when compared with other countries.  There are, therefore, fundamental reasons.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.166" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120800002#F00700"><p>Even if there is a default on the mortgage for a property where the loan to value ratio is 50%, the bank will not lose anything.  How could a bank lose in such a scenario given that it could repossess the property secured on the loan?  Unless property prices had declined by in excess of 50%, it would receive the loan back in full.</p></speech>

There is a degree of uncertainty or fracture between the secured part and the lending part.  There is a higher risk here as it takes a lot longer to effect the process to which the Deputy referred than it does in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120800002#F00900"><p>That is interesting because Mr. Sibley stated we need to deal with the underlying issues.  He has just repeated the point made in this opening statement about the length of time, difficulty or uncertainty associated with dealing with the repossession of the secured property.  Is the Central Bank saying we need to make it easier to repossess properties and give the banks more security?  Mr. Sibley stated that the only protection available to people in terms of vulture funds increasing interest rates to 10% was the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Is the code of conduct causing uncertainty for banks?  Where does the Central Bank stand on this matter because it appears to be sending out different messages?  On the one hand, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears provides security for borrowers, while on the other, it is causing difficulties for lenders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.169" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120800002#F01000"><p>I am absolutely not saying that the Central Bank is seeking for there to be more repossessions.  What I have tried to set out in my opening statement and subsequent remarks is an explanation of the reasons mortgage rates are higher in Ireland than in other jurisdictions.  If I look at the mortgage market today, it has definitely improved in terms of the level of arrears.  However, there are sizeable numbers of borrowers who are greater than two years past due on their payments.  We are not looking necessarily for an increase in repossessions.  I am setting out an explanation as to why variable rate pricing might be higher in Ireland where we have that circumstance.  The Central Bank has worked really hard-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120800002#F01100"><p>All the banks have provisioned for losses in respect of those who are more than two years in arrears.  One cannot apply a high variable rate to new or existing customers to try to claw back money that has already been provided for the banks.  In fact, the banks are taking some of this money back onto their books because circumstances have changed and improved.  As such, the argument made on this issue does not stack up.  The only argument that could stack up is in respect of the uncertainty about the length of time involved in securing repossession, an issue Mr. Sibley has repeatedly raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120800002#F01200"><p>Banks should be pricing according to the risks associated with lending.  These include credit risk, which includes, to a degree, interest rate risk, to which I referred earlier, and other costs such as funding and operational costs, for example, the continued operations that are required to deal with mortgage arrears and so on.  In terms of what this means in practice, the capital the banks are required to hold in Ireland relative to other eurozone countries is much higher because the probability of default is much higher here and the loss given on default is much higher.</p> <p>  The Central Bank has worked very hard to ensure there are protections in place for borrowers.  As a result of that, 120,000 borrowers, the vast majority of whom were in payment difficulties, have had sustainable solutions put in place.  Of these, 88% are meeting the terms of those arrangements.  This has been effective in terms of bringing down arrears and has ensured there is a minimal amount of repossessions in the system.  However, this has not been a free choice.  </p></speech>

We have been questioning bankers on the tracker mortgage scandal.  For four years the Central Bank sat on its hands and showed an absolutely disgraceful attitude on this issue.  We now know 9,000 people had their tracker mortgages removed or did not have them reinstated when it was appropriate to do so.  Even after the High Court decision in the matter, the Central Bank did nothing, which is a disgrace.  Mr. Sibley may respond to my comments but I wish to move on to questions on the Bill on which this meeting is focused.</p> <p>  Mr. Sibley said in his opening statement, "Furthermore, with regard to the interest rates charged on existing SVR mortgage loans, they are subject to existing contracts and contract law, which only a judge could override, not a public body such as the Central Bank."  Is this statement based on a legal opinion received by the Central Bank or an assessment done by the Central Bank?</p></speech>

That is an internal view discussed with our internal legal team.  It is important that we talk about the tracker redress work as the Deputy has raised it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Sheridan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120800002#F01500"><p>Over the years, we have been dealing with individual institutions on various tracker issues leading to conclusions where borrowers were having their tracker rates reinstated.  We saw, however, that these issues kept arising and we decided we needed to do a system wide review.  It is the largest review the Central Bank has ever done on the consumer protection side and it is very comprehensive.  The banks must look back at any tracker mortgage they have sold since tracker mortgages entered the market.  We are determined to make sure that everyone who has been impacted is appropriately redressed with compensation.  We have, therefore, been working hard on this issue for the past few years, which is the reason we implemented the tracker examination.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016120800002#F01600"><p>With respect, I disagree.  The joint committee wrote to the Central Bank on foot of a request from the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation asking it to carry out a system wide review.  The Central Bank did this around this time last year.  Four years prior to that, individuals were taking cases to the Financial Services Ombudsman and their cases were upheld.</p><p>Cases were taken to the High Court where they were also upheld, yet the Central Bank did nothing.  When the case was before the Supreme Court the Central Bank said nothing publicly in regard to the issue.  It was not the Central Bank that identified the problem.  It never identified the issue even though hundreds of millions of euro were taken from customers.  Customers identified the issue more than five years ago.  They were forced to go through all the different systems and the Central Bank, which was supposed to protect the customer, regulate the banks properly and deal with inappropriate behaviour within the institutions did nothing publicly until last year.  Serious questions arise.  I do not direct what I say personally but at the institution.  Given the situation from which we have emerged, I question the <i>laissez-faire</i>attitude to bankers stealing hundreds of millions of euro from their own customers, amounting to 9,000 individuals and, as a result, took homes from customers in some cases and bankrupted others.  I have said that straight up to the bankers.  It is absolutely appalling.  The Central Bank did nothing until last year about the issue.<br/><br/>Questions must be asked.  If memory serves me, approximately 86 cases were before the Financial Services Ombudsman and many others made requests.  The Financial Services Ombudsman said it would wait until the Supreme Court made a decision on the test case before it.  The situation dragged on for years.  The Central Bank had the ability at any time during those years to step in and to give some protection to those individuals.  It is the bankers who were responsible for the situation not the Central Bank but at any point during that period the Central Bank could have brought an end to the pain, suffering and mental health breakdowns that affected individuals.  The Central Bank had the ability and responsibility to step in and demand that the banks would explain what was happening.  Now we find that 9,000 individuals were dealt with by the banks in that way right across the system.  All the banks made the same mistake.  It was robbery and now it is dressed up as a redress scheme.  It is like somebody burgling a house, taking a flat screen TV, getting caught and walking in the next day and saying &quot;I'm sorry.  Here is the redress scheme.  I am giving you your flat screen TV back.&quot;  That is what happened with the bankers.  That is what they are doing.  It is called something else because they are wearing pinstripe suits and doing it behind leather cushioned desks.  The Central Bank had the responsibility and obligation to step in and deal with the situation five years ago not last year when it was asked to do so by this committee and by external groups acting on behalf of mortgage holders.</p></speech>

We also very recently took enforcement action on this very issue.  The engagement on this issue by the Central Bank goes back many years.</p></speech>

On that specific case, the appeals to the High Court and Supreme Court certainly made it difficult for us to progress the issue but we have been taking action and we have signalled that we will take further enforcement action against other entities for what they have done.  We recognise that this is a very serious issue and we are putting the resources into it.  That is the reason we are undertaking this examination and we will continue to use our supervisory and enforcement powers where we feel we have to.</p></speech>

That is the point.  The bankers would not have owned up to the wrongdoing had the Central Bank not called for an industry-wide review.  I appreciate that but the fact that it is being led by the banks themselves is wrong.  The Central Bank should be carrying out the review.  It is relying on the institutions to come forward with data and the Central Bank is supervising the review but it is a problem that it is not leading the review.</p> <p>  We will come to discuss the issue again because Governor Lane will be before this committee.  The events occurred before his time but what was allowed to happen to customers by the Central Bank is disgraceful.  It had a responsibility to regulate the institutions concerned and to intervene on behalf of customers.  The Central Bank took action but it did so far too late.</p> <p>  I wish to return to the Bill because it is very important.</p></speech>

What do they think of two banks appearing before an Oireachtas committee and saying that because of what they did 14 families lost their homes?  What would they say to them?  The banks openly admitted they did wrong and that what they did caused the loss of homes in 14 cases.</p></speech>

The question is whether they would have identified the issue.  For me, it is a disgrace.  This is one of the real big fallouts from the tracker examination, namely, that people have lost their homes because of what the banks have done.</p></speech>

We will challenge the bank until we are satisfied with the scheme.  The second point is that we have built in an appeals process for individuals within the framework if people are not happy.  Ultimately, if people are still unhappy they can go to the Ombudsman or further.  We are not precluding people from taking further action but we are trying to make it easy so that people do not have to do that by ensuring the redress and compensation are adequate in the first place.</p></speech>

It infuriates me that this has happened.  I know some people personally who were affected and what they have gone through.</p> <p>  Returning to the Bill, as Deputy Michael McGrath said, it has passed Second Stage and there was unanimous support for it.  There might have been a bit of reluctance from some of the Government parties but the majority of the Members in the D&aacute;il are very much in support of not only a reduction in standard variable rates but to introduce a type of system which would empower the Central Bank to introduce caps.  That will only work if the Central Bank will use the power.  Our responsibility in the Houses of the Oireachtas is to provide the toolkit for the Central Bank and then allow it to decide which tool it wishes to use to deal with whatever issues arise.  The concern is that if we pass the legislation that the Central Bank will send a signal to the institutions that it will never use those powers.  I share Deputy Michael McGrath's view on the Bill because we tabled legislation of a similar nature ourselves.  We also tabled legislation on moneylenders and had it debated.  Legislation is not the best way to deal with the issues that arise.  What we want to do is force the financial institutions to start to reduce their interest rates to a more acceptable level.  We do appreciate that has happened to some extent in the past year.  If the Oireachtas passes the legislation will the Central Bank use it?</p></speech>

If powers are conferred on us by the Oireachtas, then we have a duty to use those powers and to deliver the mandate given to us.  We have deep reservations about the Bill for the reasons we have outlined, not because of the objectives but because of concern over whether it will be effective and the potential side effects or unintended consequences.  However, if the Bill is passed, then it is of course an instruction or additional mandate for the Central Bank.</p></speech>

The question was dealt with by other witnesses.  The question need not apply only to a vulture fund; it could be a regulated entity such as AIB or Bank of Ireland.  The limited powers the Central Bank has basically amount to no powers in this regard.  Mr. Sibley can correct me if I am wrong, but if the Central Bank had this tool at the moment, it would not use it because the bank has a different view of how to address this issue.  Where is the tipping point?  When would the Central Bank start to introduce or use these tools?  Let us suppose a vulture fund applied a 6% interest rate on mortgages.  Would the Central Bank use these tools?</p></speech>

I would not use the precise term Deputy Doherty has used.  However, we would absolutely discharge what is required under the Bill.  The Bill refers to a quarterly assessment of the market to determine whether there has been market failure.  We would undertake that assessment and make a determination based on that assessment.  We have not done an assessment in the way the Bill articulates at this stage.  As I noted earlier, there is no reference to credit risk in the Bill and that is an absolutely fundamental driver of pricing in Ireland.</p></speech>

Do these factors not suggest that the environment is less risky and that this should be reflected somehow in the margins?  These figures do not tally with the use of margins and the profitability of the banks in the sense of their costs being continuously reduced.

It is the link between the key indicators of economic performance, the degree of credit risk in the economy and the borrowing rates the banks are charging.  We are suggesting that there is a link between credit risk and lending rates in the economy.  It is certainly the case that the key indicators of credit risk have been improving in recent years.  In particular, I wish to highlight the indicators of household indebtedness, the numbers of households in negative equity, the amount of arrears in the economy and the unemployment rate.</p> <p>  The rate of household indebtedness has fallen from 200% of household disposable income in 2012, which was the worst position, to approximately 150%.  This is a material improvement.  The trend is continuing in the right direction.  However, this rate remains the fourth highest in the European Union.  Negative equity is where the value of the loan is greater than the value of the house.  Some 40% of all loans were in negative equity at the end of 2012.  The figure is now down to 15%.  This is still an extremely high number.  The current trend of house price increases and amortisation mortgages suggests that this will continue to reduce significantly in future years.  The trends in arrears have been mentioned already.  In value terms, they have declined from approximately 17% at the peak in 2013 to approximately 11.5% now.  Unemployment is a particularly important indicator.  Unemployment has fallen from 15% at the end of 2011 and is now at 8%.  We expect the rate to continue to fall.  Let us put this change in context.  When we had numbers close to full employment, unemployment fell to approximately 4%.</p> <p>  The overall situation is that all these indicators have been improving.  This has coincided with the reduction in interest rates and lending rates during the past two years.  It has also coincided with more competition, because as household indebtedness falls and as households come out of negative equity, they are in more of a position to switch mortgages either within the same institution or a different institution.  All these indicators remain particularly high by European standards.  We are still in a riskier position than other European countries.</p></speech>

There is the issue of dealing with whatever the legacy was in terms of the period when the borrower was in difficulty, and there are arrangements in place to deal with that.  However, the borrower's ongoing repayment capacity might be similar to or the same as it was at the time he or she took out the mortgage.</p></speech>

The legislation introduced something slightly different.  It is too early at this stage to say how effective that will be.  Essentially, we are regulating the credit servicing firms and we have ensured the mortgage arrears code, for example, will continue to provide protections for people after the loan is sold.  However, it is early days yet in terms of how that will work because we regulate the intermediary who is acting on behalf of the loan owner.  We must be notified if a loan is going to be sold by a regulated firm and we have requirements in place to provide that borrowers must be informed about what is happening as well.  Clearly, however, a borrower goes into a different situation after a loan is sold.  One day they are the customer of a bank and the next day they have an account with a fund from abroad.  Their circumstances change but we have tried to ensure, in terms of how the borrower is treated, that if they are struggling to keep up repayments, the protections continue to apply.</p></speech>

Regarding the banks, when the loan is sold, they might say they have no further interest in it, but in the tracker examination, for example, we have put the onus on the banks that originated those loans to look back at the loans to see if people were treated appropriately.  Therefore, it is not a complete ability to walk away from their actions and how they treated those people before the loan was sold.</p></speech>

The ability to switch is available to people.  Clearly, with fixed rate mortgages there are penalties for switching, so there would be terms regarding the penalty that would be applied if one switches before the end of the fixed term.  Generally, there is no prohibition on switching with standard variable rate mortgages and others.  In reality, however, if somebody gets into arrears or has negative equity, the ability to switch is impacted, but not necessarily by the contract <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>

Mr. Sheridan, you said earlier that the Central Bank had limited powers if mortgages are bought by a vulture fund.  Let us say you are dealing with a mortgage holder with one of the pillar banks who has an issue with that institution and, at the same time, you are dealing with a mortgage holder who has a similar mortgage with a vulture fund who has the same issue, be it over the rate they are being charged, the terms and conditions or how they are being enforced.  How do you deal with both queries?  Under the code of practice on mortgage arrears, when dealing with mortgage holders, how are they different in terms of your powers?  I am seeking a practical example rather than you saying you have limited powers.</p></speech>

It is something we thought about when we were given these new powers to regulate something that is the servicing agent rather than the loan owner.  Our powers with the banks and the other regulated credit firms are that we can talk directly to the CEOs, we can go to board meetings and we can engage at the highest level.</p></speech>

Does he believe that the current banking institutions in Ireland have the financial fitness to be able to lend the appropriate amount of loans?  We have a major shortage of homes in this country.  I note that at the foundation of the State, at one stage, the banks were not lending.  The Government moved in the early 1920s and told the banks that if they did not lend they would be nationalised.  It is not quite akin to that, but the Central Bank is in the cockpit.</p><p>Do we have a banking system that is fit for purpose that can provide lending to enable hard-pressed young people to buy starter homes?  There is a lost decade, people who would traditionally have purchased in their twenties but are now in rented accommodation in their 30s.  They are worried that by the time they are in their 40s they will not qualify for a mortgage. </p></speech>

The health of the banks is improving but there is still a degree of fragility as in the mortgage market and there is a degree of vulnerability in the banks as well.  They are not in rude health.  They are certainly much stronger and more resilient than they were.  There is evidence that there is strong momentum to address mortgage arrears and bring their levels down.  They will continue to fall, absent any significant shock which we hope will not happen.  I would envisage that trend continuing and I hope differentiation and competition in the market will continue to improve.  There is potential for new entrants and perhaps they could be encouraged by some of the underlying factors we talked about being further addressed.</p> <p>  In terms of the capacity of the banks to fund the 25,000 homes, or whatever the number might be in reality, we are working on that.  It is not just a question of mortgage lending but of where the funding comes from for the developers.  There are many difficulties in the housing market which go well beyond the Central Bank's responsibility.  Many of those need to be considered. </p></speech>

Everybody understands that there is a long-standing problem with supply, which partly reflects the legacy of the crisis.  The number of houses being supplied is perhaps half our long-term requirements.  There are many issues outside the control of the Central Bank.  Many measures have been taken in respect of housing supply which we in the bank regard as the key challenge relating to the housing sector.</p> <p>  There is an issue in respect of the banking sector's capacity to finance economic development and homebuilding.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, produced an analysis of this earlier this week.  Our analysis is under way.  We have produced macroeconomic scenarios in financial stability and with our colleagues on the economic modelling side and those on Mr. Sibley's side we are analysing the impact on the banking sector.  A well capitalised banking sector is essential to ensure the sufficient supply of credit to the real economy.  This is why we are concerned with the capitalisation and viability of the banking sector, for the flow of funds to consumers, borrowers and the housebuilding sector. </p> <p>  The ESRI study finds, and we agree, that there are additional channels to channelling the deposits of Irish citizens which can become limited in respect of the needs of the economy.  These additional possible sources of funding include the issuance of covered bonds and the possible entry of foreign banks into the Irish retail sector.  These are important because these foreign banks generally have access to stable medium to long-term funding through their parent bank and are therefore not reliant on the domestic deposits.  Without labouring the point, the issue of new entry underlines the importance of the open and competitive market alongside very strong prudential management.  We need to avoid a situation where as the economy develops new competition leads to excessively risky spending.</p></speech>

I look forward to the Central Bank's analysis of how mortgages purchased by vulture funds are working.  We will bring it back before the committee because there appears to be a major gap or shortfall for mortgage holders whose mortgages are now held by vulture funds.  Although the terms and conditions should follow the emphasis is on enforceability.  People are coming to us about this and it needs to be dealt with.</p></speech>

To ensure that we are clear, we have been working really hard, led by consumer protection but also supported by our enforcement colleagues and banking supervision, to ensure that this issue is dealt with, that no more harm is caused and that consumers and customers are put right.  We are identifying where there have been issues and then addressing redress and compensation as appropriate and ensuring that there is an appropriate structure and framework to go through which is suitable and at the right level for the harm that has been caused to the borrowers.  We are identifying a mechanism in place for those borrowers to appeal and to get free independent advice on what they have been offered and beyond that into the courts if appropriate.  That has worked reasonably well.  The fine in terms of enforcement action is likely to either run alongside or come after that.  It is not the fines first.  The most important thing for us is to stop the harm to consumers and ensure that they are put right.  Alongside that, we are then running enforcement investigations to see what the root cause of the issue was and to take the appropriate penal action in terms of the banks.</p></speech>

He wrote to me in August when I raised my concerns on that with him and made it clear in his letter that the preferred approach of the Central Bank was that the loan owners would be regulated.  That would be the subject of the legislation.  It was a policy decision of Government to go down the route that was travelled in the end whereby the intermediaries were regulated under the credit servicing legislation.  My view is that there is a gap there because it is ultimately the owner of the loan who makes the critical decisions, as the Acting Chairman indicated, around interest rates, agreeing to restructure loans and, indeed, around enforcement and calling in a loan ultimately.  Given the inability of the Central Bank to engage directly, it is just the intermediary like Pepper or whomever is regulated.  Mr. Sibley said the Central Bank can contact them but there is no obligation on them to have any contact whatsoever.  That is a real gap and it will play itself out over time.  Mr. Sheridan has answered some questions on it there but if one takes the area of mortgages, there are now 10,000 PDH family home mortgages which are owned by  unregulated loan owners and there is a real exposure there.</p> <p>  On the retail credit firms, can Mr. Sheridan clarify who they are typically?  Is it credit unions?  Who are the retail credit firms?</p></speech>

It is firms like Pepper, for example, lending in their own right.  They are not banks and the same standards do not apply as apply to banks.  However, there are specific standards we impose.</p></speech>

We have had a lot of loans bought by unregulated funds from NAMA, the IRBC special liquidator and the banks.  Those business loans are now owned by funds which will churn them.  They will turn them over within a three to five-year horizon.  My concern is vulture funds to one extent but this has played out in other economies in the past with loans sold on again and again and they may end up in some pretty unsavoury hands in the end.</p><p>Ultimately, this is what happens and the entities in question are completely unregulated, although they are required to appoint an intermediary under the credit servicing legislation.  I have heard of cases in Dublin involving offers being made and people being asked if they were interested in particular bundles of loans.  While it is properties that are being touted, it is loans that are being sold.  If I am a hotelier and I know the hotelier down the road has a loan with a fund, I could make an approach to buy his loan with nothing but destructive intentions as regards the other hotelier's business.  Will Mr. Sheridan comment on this?  Where will loans end up when they are repeatedly sold and what are the exposures?</p></speech>

Small and medium enterprise and commercial loans are being sold.  The benefit of the legislation we have is that irrespective of who the owner is, the protections in place for those who are with a bank or whatever continue after the loan has been sold, in other words, irrespective of who is the owner of the loan.  The provisions of the code on mortgage arrears and the code for small and medium enterprises continue to apply.  I am not saying the relationship and risks have not changed for the borrower but at least the protections have been, if one likes, embedded.</p></speech>

Where we have powers and responsibility under the recent changes is to make sure the codes and protections the borrowers have, namely, the SME code, code of conduct on mortgage arrears and so on, travel with the borrower.  The regulated firms that deal with and service the borrower have an absolute responsibility to make sure they adhere to those codes.</p> <p>  In terms of the strategy that is being followed by the ultimate owner, they will be takers of that provided it is not in conflict with the codes.  I do not disagree that there are risks and potential issues around that.  Without delving too far into the issue, there are also potential benefits for having these types of operations.  In the circumstances of Ireland, for example, they have enabled the National Asset Management Agency, which was mentioned, to clean up its books and move on to being able to service the economy again.  There are upsides and downsides to that.  The Acting Chairman highlighted some of the risks.  There are some upsides in terms of the strength of the banking system and its ability to serve the economy and customers' needs in future.  I accept there are risks. </p></speech>

It is difficult to say with precision that there is one particular rule or type.</p></speech>

If somebody takes a loan from a bank which is subsequently sold to a fund and sold on several more times, it could end up in the hands of a semi-organised crime gang.  This gang may then appoint a credit servicing firm as an intermediary and instruct it to shut down all the businesses involved and call in the loans.  This can be done provided it complies with the terms of the codes.  There is a real exposure in such a scenario.</p></speech>

The argument used by the Government was that such a requirement would restrict the origination of new loans from non-bank lenders and with the sources of finance in the economy broadening, which is a good thing, it would cause problems if the entities involved had to be regulated.  The Central Bank could insist that a sale of a loan could only be executed where the purchaser of the loan was a regulated entity.  That would not prevent the origination of new sources of finance from non-bank sources.  Do the witnesses wish to comment on that?</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance provided information on this issue in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled during the week.  In the section of the Cental Bank that deals with regulating credit institutions, the staff vacancy rate stands at 12%.  The vacancy rate in the area of insurance supervision is 9%, while the vacancy rate in the area of consumer protection is 10%.  The number of staff vacancies across the Central Bank stands at 149.  Clearly, the bank is experiencing a major problem attracting and retaining key staff across its functions.</p><p>What impact is the situation having on the Central Bank's ability to perform its functions?  What is the rationale?  Is it remuneration and terms of conditions?  What is the problem? </p></speech>

I mean in terms of actual people employed by the Central Bank.  At the same time we have experienced a higher degree of turnover than we would like in certain areas.  We are managing, I think.  We are endeavouring to and succeeding in terms of delivering our responsibilities and mandate.  We have to prioritise where we have vacancies.  There are risks associated with losing staff.  In particular, where we lost experienced staff we have to replace them with less experienced staff or allow time for new staff to come up to speed.  At this stage the staff situation is being managed.</p> <p>  There is a lot to be said for working for the Central Bank in terms of the variety, interests and importance of what we do.  There are great opportunities for staff to develop, which we strongly advocate.  We also try very hard to ensure that the proposition we have for staff is rounded and that we deliver all of those benefits that potential staff could expect.  Having said that, we are in a position where the market, particularly for front-line supervision staff and the legal and enforcement perspective, has moved on a great deal from the limits that we operate in within the Central Bank.  I would always expect that there will be a bit of gap between what the Central Bank can pay and perhaps what is available in the private sector.  That is not inappropriate but the gap is quite sizeable now and does cause us problems both in terms of attracting people and retaining our key skillsets and that we need in order to discharge our function.  To date, we have continued to deliver.  There are risks associated with high turnover rates and vacancies.  </p></speech>

The approach taken with this section differs from previous years, and previous Statute Law Revision Acts.  With previous Acts, it was the practice to deem all statutes of a particular category, for example, secondary instruments prior to 1821, to be repealed with the exception to those statutes listed in the Schedule.  This was because these Acts repealed several thousand statutes, leaving only a handful in force.  It was reasonable, therefore, to list only the legislation that was being retained on the Statute Book.  In this case, it is more reasonable to list the spent and obsolete Acts in the Schedule and provide for their repeal in the Bill.  That is what we have done in this section.  The Schedule lists the specific Acts identified in the course of the review as appropriate for repeal because they have ceased to be relevant or have become unnecessary.</p></speech>

We talked about pausing this current piece of work because there are other priority areas on which the particular unit that deals with this area feels that it needs to focus in the course of next year.  As I explained to Deputy O'Callaghan at the time, Statute law revision is important work that has been ongoing for a number of years.  There is more work still to do.  Let us consider this particular Statute Law Revision Bill.  It is the first time that we are considering Acts that were enacted by the Oireachtas.  That is another important step in terms of cleaning up the Statute Book.  There is further work to do in this area and it needs to be done.

Our organisation recognises the importance of open disclosure for those who receive services from health and social service providers, for those who deliver such services and for their operation and improvement.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance sought to develop clear and practical recommendations to ensure the safety of patients.  Its report represents an important juncture in the development of services, ultimately with a view to improving services and ensuring organisational, regulatory and educational reform to create a culture of patient safety in the health system.  One of the key recommendations made in the report concerns the development and support of a culture of open disclosure for patients and their families following adverse events.  Our organisation supports the development and implementation of a system of open disclosure to improve the position of individual service users who have been the subject of adverse events and which can contribute to the improvement of the safety of the delivery of services more generally and to the ability of health care professionals to deliver services in an ethically sound manner.  In this regard, we note that the Health Service Executive developed extensive guidelines on open disclosure which were launched in 2013.  We further note that the operation of these guidelines, in particular on two pilot sites, has been the subject of recent extensive evaluation.  The development of guidelines by the Health Service Executive would not be expected to result in an immediate transformation of the manner in which services are delivered throughout the public health service.  Even within public health services where the policy is in existence there are significant difficulties and concerns about full implementation of a system of open disclosure.  This is the case notwithstanding the experience of our members and the empathy they share with service users which drives them towards a conclusion that open disclosure is the appropriate way to respond to incidents of concern.  It is the right thing to do and should be facilitated with legislative protections to assuage the very serious concerns of health care professionals.</p> <p>  In emphasising that health care professionals, including nurses and midwives, wish to participate in a system of open disclosure to improve the experience of service users, to improve the service and to ensure ethical delivery of that service it must also be recognised that health care professionals, including our members, experience significant anxiety about how disclosures might be made, the consequences of these disclosures, the messages they might be seen to communicate to service users and the potential consequences of these messages in terms of civil litigation and regulatory processes.  Nurses and midwives working in health services are predominantly concerned about the potential regulatory consequences which might flow from implementation of a system of open disclosure.  Our members face the potential of losing their licences to practise nursing and midwifery and consequently their careers and livelihoods and moreover facing a public inquiry with associated difficult and pervasive, yet selective and at times toxic, media coverage.  This is not to say our members are not also concerned with the potential for civil litigation arising from disclosures made.  This remains a significant concern in terms of the potential for any statement made to amount to an admission of liability or contribute to establishing liability in later proceedings.</p> <p>  A detailed submission has been prepared for the committee addressing the views of our members on all heads of the Bill.  However, for the purposes of this address, I ask the committee to recognise and support the protection provided by the Bill in civil legal proceedings and professional regulatory processes.  Any successful advancement in this area will be dependent on effective protection being available to professionals.  Thus, at a minimum, the level of protection proposed must be maintained.</p> <p>  While welcoming the protection referred to, I ask the committee to consider whether it considers the definitional parameters included in head 6(2) to be sufficient to comprehend the grounds of potential liability advanced in the legislation regulating the practices of health care professionals.  While the Legislature appears to have endeavoured to take as wide an approach as possible to the definition of this protection, recalling that the Legislature is attempting to deal with circumstances which involve a number of pieces of legislation which regulate a wide variety of professionals, there is a lingering concern that the interpretation of this protection by regulators may be such as to limit the protection afforded.  In this context, our organisation recommends that the protection be amended to read: "A disclosure by a health service provider, made in accordance with standards set under head 4, does not constitute an express or implied admission of unprofessional conduct, carelessness, incompetence, unsatisfactory professional performance or any other ground of complaint, for the purposes of any enactment regulating the practice or conduct of an employee".  It is considered this small amendment would ensure the maximum possible protection for health care professionals, including nurses and midwives, and thus facilitate the implementation of a best practice regime without the attendant fear of regulatory processes arising merely from a disclosure or an apology.</p> <p>  Additionally, in respect of the protection of records, there is a notable omission in head 7 in that records created by health service providers solely for the purposes of making a disclosure which are made in accordance with standards set out in head 4 will be not protected from admission in professional regulatory proceedings.  As the committee will be aware, the protection afforded to health service providers, as provided for in head 6(2), comprehends the interrelationship between a disclosure or an apology and the professional regulatory domain.  If it is the case that the disclosure or apology, in and of itself, will not constitute an express or implied admission in the terms described, it is surely also the case that protection must be afforded to records created solely for the purposes of making such a disclosure.  If such protection is not provided, there will be a paradoxical situation where the making of a disclosure will not amount to evidence of liability in a professional regulatory context but the records created by health service providers solely for the purposes of making such a disclosure may amount to evidence of liability in a professional regulatory context.  In order to ensure the appropriate protection is afforded to health service professionals, with a view, in turn, to promoting best practice so as to improve the experience of service users, the safety of services and, ultimately, facilitate the ethical delivery of care, records created solely for that purpose should not be cognisable by professional regulatory tribunals for the purposes of establishing an express or implied admission of engaging in conduct which is the preserve of those tribunals.  Our organisation strongly urges the committee to consider an amendment to this head to ensure a record created by a health service provider solely for the purposes of making a disclosure, made in accordance with standards set out in head 4, would not be admissible in any professional regulatory proceedings as evidence of an express or implied admission of unprofessional conduct, carelessness, incompetence, unsatisfactory professional performance or any other ground of complaint, for the purposes of any enactment regulating the practice or conduct of an employee.</p><p>The INMO strongly urges the committee to consider an amendment to this head to ensure a record created by a health service provider solely for the purpose of making a disclosure, made in accordance with standards set out under head 4, would not be admissible in any professional regulatory proceedings as evidence of an express or implied admission of unprofessional conduct, carelessness, incompetence, unsatisfactory professional performance or any other ground of complaint for the purposes of any enactment regulating the practice or conduct of an employee.  Additionally, on the promulgation of standards by the commission and the authority, we suggest the Legislature provide guidance for these bodies, in addition to the matters referred to, to ensure there would be appropriate leadership which is necessary for the change process, to ensure revised practices and policies would be subject to effective review and to ensure staff would be adequately trained to embrace this new paradigm.  Furthermore, the committee will note that we have made observations on the interpretation section and the scope of personal services in the context of open disclosures.  </p><p> The INMO appreciates the opportunity to make a contribution on this important issue.  The implementation of open disclosure provisions and the associated benefits flowing therefrom offer significant potential to ensure the experience of service users will be improved, with the safety of services, and health care professionals, including nurses and midwives, will be facilitated to the maximum extent possible in delivering ethical care services.  It is extremely important that such protections as are are proposed be retained.  We strongly urge the committee to consider this commentary in regard to the necessity to make certain improvements.  In particular, its attention is drawn to the proposed amendments to head 6(2) and 7.  These improvements would further facilitate the implementation of best practice by allaying the fears of registered professionals.  The fear such professionals feel about public professional regulatory processes cannot be overstated.</p></speech>

The IMO supports open disclosure not only as a measure to prevent litigation but, more importantly, because patients have the right to an apology and explanation when things go wrong.  Doctors and other health care professionals have a duty to be open, honest and transparent with patients; to reflect on adverse events and to take steps to ensure such incidents will not be repeated.  Open disclosure is not about apportioning blame but about keeping patients informed of investigations and preventing future patient safety incidents.  Open disclosure recognises that health care professionals are often the second victims of patient safety incidents and successful policies ensure both patients and health care staff are supported throughout the disclosure process and the patient safety investigation.</p> <p>  The practise of medicine is increasingly complex and while the majority of health care professionals aim to provide the best care for their patients, incidents do occur.  Harm is rarely due to wilful misconduct.  Harm is most often due to systems failure or unintentional human error.  Patients are entitled to a full and open disclosure, including an apology, following an adverse event.  Fear of litigation, fitness to practise procedures and damage to reputation have been identified as major barriers to apologising to patients following an adverse event. The IMO has been calling for a number of years for legislation to support open disclosure and protect medical practitioners in admitting liability and from fitness to practise hearings when apologising to patients following an adverse event.  Therefore, it welcomes the proposed Bill.  Doctors, as well as patients, must have confidence in the open disclosure process.  It is essential, therefore, that the proposed legislation and the standards to be set by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission be concise and unambiguous.   </p> <p>  The purpose of the legislation is to ensure open disclosure will not be an admission of liability and, therefore, even the fact that an open disclosure has been made cannot be construed as an admission of liability.  Standards for disclosing patient safety incidents must ensure disclosure will be timely and factual and that principles of patient consent and confidentiality will be protected.  There must be clarity about thresholds for disclosure and responsibility for disclosure.  While the legislation will provide doctors with medico legal clarity when it comes to apologising, open disclosure policies can fail without an organisational culture that supports open disclosure.  Open disclosure is stressful and time-consuming.  Often it can take some time to establish the facts.  There may be differences of opinion or a breakdown in communication.  </p> <p>  The evaluation of the HSE&rsquo;s national open disclosure pilot scheme identified a number of critical success factors in open disclosure and recommended that the roll-out across the HSE include a supportive hospital environment and organisational culture, leadership, sufficient resources within the hospital, including a risk management department with expertise to support and engage clinical and non-clinical staff in open disclosure, good quality training, clear guidance on reporting and multidisciplinary approaches to reporting and learning.  In addition to developing standards for open disclosure, the Department of Health, the HSE and other health care organisations must ensure all of the supportive structures and resources will be in place to support open disclosure not only in hospitals but also in general practice and community settings, including education and training programmes, support from colleagues and line managers, guidance material, counselling services and risk management teams.  There must be some recognition that open disclosure will reduce the time spent on clinical duties.</p> <p>  A greater focus must be placed on prevention of patient safety incidents.  IMO doctors are increasingly concerned about the effects of successive budget cuts and reduced staffing levels on patient safety and quality of care.  OECD figures from 2013 show that Irish public hospitals operate at 93.8% capacity, well over the established safe occupancy threshold of 85% and above the identified 92.5% tipping point that has been shown to result in significantly higher patient mortality.  The largest barrier to patient safety in the country is the low number of medical specialists per head of population and the inadequate distribution of resources based on medical or social need.  Health services are significantly overstretched and clinicians are dealing with a constant stream of emergency patients without the time or resources to engage adequately in audit and patient safety and quality improvement initiatives.  It is imperative that all clinical services operate with sufficient minimum financial and manpower resources to provide safe, quality and evidence-based care.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.442" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016120800002#F00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving me the opportunity to address them on this important issue.  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, has over 2,500 members and represents 85% of hospital consultants in Ireland.  The association and its members support the adoption of a national policy on and standards for open disclosure.  In fact, the association has been engaging constructively since May 2013 with the HSE&rsquo;s national advocacy unit and the State Claims Agency in this regard.  It is to be welcomed that the policy and standards will soon be placed on a statutory footing.<br/><br/>As doctors, patient safety is at the heart of everything we do.  It must be recognised that the provision of health care is complex and becoming more complex with the passage of time.  In the provision of complex care adverse outcomes will always occur for a proportion of patients.  In some cases, the adverse outcome arises as part of the normal risk of complications associated with therapy, surgery and other procedures.  In a more limited number of cases mistakes and errors may occur.  Naturally, the risk of mistakes and errors is exacerbated where care is being provided in a health system that is under-resourced and overstretched.  When things do go wrong, it is important that we communicate with patients and their families in an open, honest and transparent manner.  However, we must also recognise and cater for the needs of the far greater number of patients and their relatives who encounter a recognised complication of therapy not related to deficient care but which is nonetheless disabling and distressing for those involved.<br/><br/>In so far as the draft heads of the Bill are concerned, we note that much of the detail of open disclosure will be contained in standards to be set out by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission following enactment of the legislation.  We note, however, that the heads of the Bill include a definition of &quot;patient safety incident&quot; which, as drafted, extends to events where no actual injury or harm has occurred.  This is a more expansive definition in the light of the current national guidelines which define an &quot;an adverse event&quot; as an incident which results in actual<i></i>harm.  In this context, the association urges the committee to consider applying the standards as detailed in the current national guidelines.</p><p>We consider this to be important because otherwise we would end up with open disclosures for many incidents such as patients spending a night on a trolley which could be regarded as a patient safety incident without causing harm; surgery being cancelled because there are not enough theatre nurses available, or a patient waiting six months to be seen in the outpatients department.  It is important that there be some harm in dealing with the patient safety issue.  Contemporary medical care has to take account of individual variation in the response to patients and allow doctors to administer patient specific therapy.  Variations in care, the way it is provided and its outcome are well recognised as an acceptable part of practice.  They are to be encouraged and should not be regarded as a safety incident.  We are concerned that variations in care that did not result in patient harm might end up being regarded as a safety incident and subject to open disclosure.  This flexible approach to patient care should be adopted to take account of the normal processes of patient care which might be inhibited by an excessively expansive definition of patient safety incident.</p><p> The association welcomes the inclusion of provisions that an apology made in connection with an allegation of clinical negligence will not constitute express or an implied admission of fault or liability and that evidence of an apology will not be admissible in associated court proceedings.  Nonetheless, while the association supports open disclosure, there remains a concern that it could potentially have a negative impact in increasing the number of clinical negligence claims in the courts.   The association understands from the national advocacy unit that there is no evidence in other countries to indicate that litigation increases following open disclosure.  We are conscious that this experience may not be extrapolated directly from other jurisdictions which have a fundamentally different legislative framework and claims culture.  Overall, Ireland experiences a significant number of legal claims alleging clinical negligence.  This, of course, gives rise to serious implications for the State in terms of compensation and legal costs.  It also impacts on the affordability of clinical indemnity cover for doctors.  The cost of clinical indemnity cover in Ireland has doubled in recent years.  The net effect of the escalating costs is that some consultants have ceased practice, retired early, limited the scope of their practice or emigrated.  Our understanding is the State Claims Agency has also experienced a significant rise in the level and cost of claims in recent years.  These are all risks linked with open disclosure.  Accordingly, while welcoming the introduction of the legislation on open disclosure, the association would also welcome the introduction of more extensive legislation to address the concerns in this area.  In particular, it considers that the open disclosure legislation would be enhanced if it also provided for a mediation service.  Such a service would ideally help to remove the concerns of patients and their families without recourse to an adversarial legal process and would benefit patients, doctors and everybody involved in the health care system. </p><p> When litigation does occur, it is preferable for it to be conducted speedily.  The last Government introduced legislation on pre-action protocols to speed up the exchange of information between parties in clinical indemnity cases, but this legislation has not yet taken effect.  We understand it is awaiting an order from the Minister for Justice and Equality.  </p><p> The association would also welcome the committee's support for the reform of the law of tort applying to clinical indemnity cases.  Other jurisdictions reformed the law in this regard several decades ago.  The Medical Protection Society, the indemnifier for Ireland, has proposed that a Bill also be introduced to define the tort of clinical negligence such that a wrong that unfairly causes someone else to suffer loss or harm would only be established where both a breach of duty and direct causation of injury was proved.  It is very important that the breach of duty or practice be shown to have directly caused the injury.  We understand the Department of Health is concluding an assessment of the potential benefits of reducing the caps and extending the provisions of the State Claims Agency's clinical indemnity scheme. </p><p> Many of the association's members have supported and continue to support the implementation of the current open disclosure policy and guidelines.  The association wishes to reaffirm its support for open disclosure and will continue to engage constructively with all relevant stakeholders having particular regard to the draft legislation and the subsequent formulation of standards by the relevant authorities.  The association and its doctor members welcome the work of the committee in this important area.  We continue to be available to engage with it.</p></speech>

I think everybody agrees that we must introduce a duty of candour or open disclosure in such a way as to ensure confidence in the system on the part of those availing of and providing the service.  It must be fair and equitable and defend the integrity and rights of individuals providing the service.  Clinicians have a right to integrity and respect and to defend it, even if it means through litigation.  The hope always is that open disclosure and a duty of candour would reduce recourse to the adversarial and legal process and that people might be able to accept open disclosure as final.</p> <p>  Dr. Ryan spoke about a mediation service.  Will he give us some further information?  Would it be possible for a mediation service to be provided within the scope of the Bill whereby the service and the evidence provided would not drift and be used in a court case?  It is one thing to provide for open disclosure, but it is another to sit around a table and start discussing a mediation process that might eventually break down and end up in the adversarial court system.  Are there examples in other countries? </p> <p>  At what stage is there an obligation on a clinician or a health care professional to look an administrator or manager in the eye and say the service is no longer safe?  At what stage is there a moral or ethical duty on members of the association to say they can no longer do something because it is unsafe?  We have seen cases where very often it is the doctor or nurse who talks to the patient or the family about an adverse event and those who may ultimately be responsible are nowhere to be seen, as in the case of the report on the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise.  Is there an obligation on us to extend the duty of open disclosure and candour not only to clinicians and the medical professionals working on the front line but also to senior management in the health service and those who may ultimately be responsible?  I would like to hear the delegates' views on that matter.  I am not talking about headhunting, but open disclosure ultimately involves accountability for those who have experienced an adverse event.</p><p>Perhaps I might have clarity on these issues. </p><p> As regards its organisational mindset, the HSE is made up of myriad organisations, including representatives of trade unions and professional bodies.  Is there an awareness and an acceptance among Dr. Ryan's members that having a duty of candour and open disclosure would be positive, or is it just at the top levels where people sit around tables and have a chat and believe it is the right thing to do?  Are the individual members who do their jobs every day supportive of the process involving open disclosure and a duty of candour?  Are they even aware of what it is about?  Have broad discussions taken place with the membership about this legislation and what it could entail for individuals?  They may have to stand in a room, issue an apology and explain what happened among their peers.</p><p> The D&aacute;il recently dealt with a Bill concerning the State Claims Agency.  When enacted, it will obligate clinicians in the private sector to take out professional indemnity insurance.  The State Claims Agency will pay out approximately &euro;212 million in costs this year.  In 2014 it paid out &euro;106 million; therefore, the figure has doubled in the space of two years.  That is a frightening statistic in view of the fact that a lot of that money could have been spent elsewhere in funding services to prevent adverse events.  </p><p> How difficult is it to recruit and retain staff?  Dr. Ryan mentioned that some people were throwing in the towel owing to indemnity insurance costs.  I assume that there are huge variations.  In dermatology, for example, the costs are reasonable, but they are expensive in obstetrics and gynaecology.  Is there any way to have a cross-cover system in place?  We talk about risk sharing and equalisation in the health insurance market; is there any way, therefore, we could be imaginative in risk sharing in the insurance cover market for health professionals?  If not, we will have loads of dermatologists but very few obstetricians, which would not be great for either profession.</p></speech>

I will deal with the ones about the public system first.  </p> <p>  On open disclosure, there will be a lot of ramifications not just for clinicians but also for those involved in the administration of the health care system.  From my own experience of talking to relatives of patients who have suffered an injury or died as a result of a procedure, they obviously want an apology.  They want openness and candour, but they also want a promise that an event will not recur.  The vast majority of relatives are more concerned to ensure it will not happen to anybody else.  It is a big problem in the health care system if the hospital system is run at 95% capacity and does not have enough consultants.  The open disclosure legislation will leave a clinician in a position where he or she has apologised for an adverse event but cannot give a guarantee or make a promise that it will not happen again because he or she has no direct control or influence over how the hospital is funded, resourced or organised.  With open disclosure there will have to be a greater element of clinical governance within the hospital system in order that hospitals will be run more on a medical than a bureaucratic basis.  That would be the natural follow on from the transparency and openness that will result from having an open disclosure policy.  These may be good for the hospital system as the truth never hurt anybody.  It is worth telling the truth - that one cannot run a hospital system at 95% capacity and expect nobody to suffer.  There will, therefore, be a lot of knock-on effects.  I do not expect the knock-on effects to be felt by doctors and nurses; the big knock-on effect will be felt by those who organise and administer the health system.  That will happen down the line as a result of this legislation.</p> <p>  The second question was about the mediation service.  Very often after an adverse event or an unexpected death that was not necessarily due to an error, the family are faced with a group of nurses and doctors whom they may not trust that much or whom they have only recently met.  Their loved one has died or suffered an injury and very often they need a third party who can say: "Look, everything was done properly here.  In these circumstances it is to be expected that some patients will not do well.  The doctors and nurses did everything they could to try to care for your relative, but, unfortunately, things did not work out as they would have hoped."  Currently that service is provided by a solicitor.  The family receive a copy of the notes, go to a solicitor and ask for a medical opinion which they receive from a third party and the case immediately steps into the adversarial arena; therefore, the costs go up and the level of animosity increases.  The duration of the proceedings and the time taken to arrive at a resolution of the family's concerns increase exponentially.  It would be far better if there was a third party, perhaps even an external person, to counsel the family on what actually happened, that the doctors, nurses and hospital did the best for their loved one and did not actually do anything wrong.  That is important if one wants to defuse the avalanche.</p></speech>

My specialty is intensive care.  When one attends international meetings, one hears a lot about adverse events.  There is always a session on medical and administrative error.  Some 80% of errors are systemic.  Individual errors that cause harm to a patient are extraordinarily rare.  System errors which cause harm to patients include deficient systems, overburdened systems, under-resourced systems and systems in which all of the doctors are tired, there are not enough nurses or beds or there is inadequate access to diagnostic imaging.  Doctors recognise this from their own experience, their knowledge of the literature and information they receive in attending international meetings.  Having said that, everybody makes mistakes during his or her professional career.  It is recognised that at some stage in their medical careers most people will be sued, either because of an error or an alleged error.  Mistakes do happen and when they do, we need to be able to own up to them openly and honestly and allow the family to be compensated for any wrong or injury suffered as a result of mistakes we have made.  There is no harm in this; it is good.</p></speech>

The Medical Protection Society and the State Claims Agency are promoting mediation services as an alternative.</p><p>Based on the most recent information I have seen, probably from 12 months ago, the take-up was running at approximately 3% to 5% of cases.  I am sure the State Claims Agency could provide more up-to-date information if its representatives were to come before the committee.</p><p> A very interesting question was raised about how one could ensure mediation, as an exercise in itself, would not spill over and be a precursor to litigation.  If we could find some way of ensuring mediation would be effective and resolve the matter, it would be hugely important in having matters resolved more quickly and also at reduced cost.  The State Claims Agency would be in a position to give its insight based on operating mediation services in recent years.</p><p> In response to the question on risk sharing between specialties, there are a number of indemnifiers in the market which, I hope, compete on price and other such matters.  With the spread of risk between various specialties, by the very nature of procedures one carries out, it might prove difficult to introduce risk sharing and loan burden sharing in terms of cost.  That will probably be the biggest obstacle in doing so because individuals can move between indemnifiers-insurers.</p></speech>

The Medical Council&rsquo;s guide to professional ethical practice places an obligation on doctors to do this when they have patient safety concerns about how a service is being provided.  That said, it leads to the Deputy&rsquo;s next question in the sense that there is no obligation on the administrator or manager to do anything about it when these concerns are raised.  That can create a difficulty for many doctors.</p> <p>  The other interesting thing about the Medical Council guidelines is that if a doctor is in a managerial position, there are ethical obligations placed on him or her to ensure patient safety and provide safe patient care.  A different standard is applied to managers who are doctors and managers who are not doctors because the former are at risk of being reported to their regulator if they are in a management position and a patient safety incident occurs.  That is of concern.  Our members have put forward motions at meetings to support the introduction of ethical obligations for health care managers to be accountable and have a duty similar to managers who are doctors.</p></speech>

The intention is that it would protect doctors in disclosing that information.  From discussions with our members, they are in favour of having such a regime.</p></speech>

The most recent version of the code of professional conduct and ethics for nurses and midwives carries an ethical obligation to report issues of concern.  We must be realistic in this committee.  Sometimes people are afraid to report concerns.  There are consequences in that regard.  We have had people accused of professional misconduct before the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland for failing to report concerns in circumstances where they had done so and their concerns had been ignored.</p> <p>  Dr. Duddy also made a very good point about the professional responsibility held by managers who are professionals.  There will always be a cadre of nurses and midwives who are at director and assistant director level managing a significant workforce and who are torn in meeting their obligations.  I represent members who are fighting tooth and nail to stop lay managers, as we call them, bringing clinical managers into meetings to issue a clinical imprimatur about dangerous decisions to cut care services or reduce resources.  Professionals are being used in that way within the service to provide cover for others, for example, doctors and registered nurses and midwives.  They are being asked to sign off on a reduction in services which they find extremely difficult.</p> <p>  The core question was whether there should be an ethical or moral duty extended to other personnel in managerial positions.  The answer is yes, there should.  It is not the case that they are responsible to no one.  This is not a question of putting staff against staff within the health service.  These managers are responsible to their employer and everyone has that responsibility, but what they do not have liability for &ndash; I say this advisedly &ndash; is being paraded in front of the media before their professional regulatory tribunal.  Sheer fear fills nurses and midwives when they receive a letter from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  It is frightening.  People are suicidal at the thought of appearing in public hearings before the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.  I can say this because almost 80% of my work involves representing nurses and midwives who appear before tribunals.  They are ordinary people earning ordinary wages who did not take a job to be regulated in that way, but that is not the purpose of this meeting.  That is the system that is in place and I do not challenge it, but we must be realistic and say the burden carried by registered professionals in services is extraordinarily high and the burden should be shared with others because many incidents are heavily affected by the systemic difficulties in the health service.  Individual professionals are defending themselves before their regulatory body against the system which resists any admittance of a systemic error and tries to blame everything on an individual.  The moral and ethical duty should be extended.  I am sure members of the committee are aware that the Department of Health is working on a code of conduct for all staff within the health service.  It should carry with it some other regulatory responsibility, for which we have long called.  It has been a motion at our annual conference that all persons providing health services be subject to regulation, not just the registered professionals.</p> <p>  A question was also asked about the organisational mindset.  It was whether we had engaged with our members on their view of the importance of open disclosure.  To paraphrase, the question was whether it was a big ticket item.  We discussed the issue at our annual conference in May and there was unanimous support for having a system of open disclosure and on the importance of open disclosure for those receiving services in terms of the improvement of safety, but there was a morbid fear of professional regulatory proceedings, in particular.</p> <p>  One must bear in mind that most, but not all, of our members are working in the public health service in which the clinical indemnity scheme deals with the civil litigation element as opposed to individual private insurance holders; therefore, that issue did not come to the fore as much.  Fear was expressed about the making of a disclosure, an apology, or both, and this being admitted in professional regulatory proceedings.  I ask the committee to pay special attention to the fact that within the heads of the Bill there is protection against documents produced solely for the purpose of making such a disclosure or an apology not being admissible in civil proceedings, but they would be admissible in professional regulatory proceedings because they are not subject to any protection.  It is very much a paradox to understand how one would create a real culture of patient safety where people would make disclosures, including what my colleagues have said, namely, that in a minority of cases it might amount to an admission of wrongdoing.  The fact that a disclosure was made would not be admissible, but any document prepared in making it would be.  The question is whether people would say it.  They would have to produce documents in the first instance and it is not realistic that they would.  That is a significant omission from the Bill.  I am not sure whether it is by design or by accident, but it is something that requires significant attention.  There is a mindset within the professions of nursing and midwifery that staff want to empathise with the patient or service user.  They want to talk to patients when something goes wrong or there is a near miss to explain what happened, but the big fear is of professional regulatory proceedings.  There is also a systemic problem within the system.  We do not have a universal culture bedded in which is responsive in a timely fashion to the needs of patients.</p><p>We have good examples throughout the health service of people being responded to in a timely fashion, but we also have appalling examples.  We see this leading to regulatory cases and civil litigation where people are not given the service they deserve when something goes wrong or there is a near miss.  In that regard, we support it.  Our members also support it strongly.  However, there must be leadership within the organisation, effective implementation and effective protection for it to be useful.  Otherwise, it will be a great thing at a very high level that everyone supports but which very few do.</p></speech>

On the current level of sheer distress, our IMO colleague has mentioned that most hospitals operate daily at full capacity.  He gave the figures for 2015.  I can tell the committee that the figures for 2016 will be much higher.  All of our members - midwives and nurses - within most acute hospitals and primary care facilities within the community complete daily a disclaimer notice highlighting the potential for risk within every single unit and department.  To answer Deputy Billy Kelleher who queried whether we were highlighting the risks, nurses and midwives most certainly are.</p> <p>  There are two ends to the culture story.  There are always two sides to every biscuit.  While there is the culture of the organisation, there is still the pervasive culture of blame within it and to run for the hills when something happens.  Unfortunately, those who provide care 24/7 - nurses and medics - are usually the front-line individuals who are at the end of giving the information.  I stress that our colleague in the Irish Hospital Consultants Association referred to the multidisciplinary team.  This team encompasses the service managers, as well those involved in decision-making processes.  I agree with Deputy Billy Kelleher that there should be a duty of candour.  Following the Mid Staffordshire crisis, duty of candour legislation has been introduced in the United Kingdom and it is not possible to run for the hills or be transferred laterally or centrally.  We have gone down this route, but whether I am a maternity or obstetric consultant, work within the integumentary system or another system of care or a nurse on a medical or surgical floor, that is my work domain.  I am not easily transferable elsewhere and away from the immediate issues at hand.  I cannot disappear into the ether.  I will always be there and always have to face the music.</p> <p>  On culture and the mindset, at the end of the day most Irish people - citizens of the country - just want answers, but the unruly bureaucracy in the system mitigates against this.  I think it was mentioned, but the ability to put the structures and processes needed in place is key.  Clarity and guidelines are key.  My colleague, Mr. Mathews, referred to support for second and third victims - nurses, medics, medical professionals and members of the multidisciplinary team who are also victims in this scenario.  We have to keep track of this also.  Culturally, within Irish society, change is difficult, as is change in any cultural mindset, but particularly when involved in civil litigation or regulatory processes.  It is pervasive and inbuilt into the mindset.  The media perhaps have a lot to contribute with regard to what is sometimes very toxic coverage of events that are live and real for many of our members, as well as for the patients and victims and their families.  That aspect also needs to be considered.</p> <p>  I agree that there should be a duty of candour.  I would not want anyone to run for the hills.  The music has to faced by everyone, but we need to be careful in the blame culture.  We have to get the facts right.  Good clarification is important.</p></speech>

I will refer to some of the issues touched on, the first of which concerns where there is an adverse event but no explanation of the outcome.  I know of a case where it was decided that an external person would be appointed to carry out a review.  The person to carry out the review was agreed to, but someone in administration decided they were not suitable.  Eighteen months later, the expert review has still not taken place.  While they can meet the family affected, the hospital staff would prefer to meet them and say what the external review found.  However, because someone on the administration side of the HSE was dictating who should carry out the external review, the process has been delayed.  In such cases the matter proceeds to litigation because the family immediately presume something is being hidden, while everyone in the hospital wants to ensure fair and accurate information is given.  That is one issue.  Have the delegates come across that issue, the lack of understanding on the administration side of the HSE of the urgency attached to giving answers to the families affected?</p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise has been touched on.  A number of parties are involved when there is an adverse event and some staff are extremely traumatised by it, but there is a lack of support for staff.  This issue is being raised more and more.  There is a feeling the adverse event only affects the patient or his or her family, but it also affects staff.  What is the delegates' view on how we can improve the support levels for staff within hospitals?</p> <p>  The third issue that has been touched on and which I wish to mention briefly is direct causation.  The delegates have stated different jurisdictions have examined the issue.  Will they outline what those jurisdictions are and the difference the change has made.  One of our problems is that we have now moved ahead of the United States in terms of the level of litigation within the health service and medical services.  This cannot continue as it is costing a serious amount of money.  We heard the figures this morning.  We need to start working on how we can reduce the level of litigation and expedite the giving of explanations.  Without introducing legislation, what immediate steps could be taken at ground level within various medical facilities?  We seem to have parked this issue in a lot of places, but there has been very little change.  I have heard of cases of people who prepared statements for inquests where no legal advice of any description was given before the statements were submitted.  I am speaking about front-line staff, doctors and nurses, whom administration did not facilitate.  What is the delegates' experience?  What can be done at ground level at this stage to assist staff on the front line in order to reduce the problems being encountered?  If a member of staff has experienced an adverse event, that will affect his or her work rate.  How can we work with him or her?  I am speaking about taking decisive action within a short period to help staff and ensure we can assist them in order that they can better perform in their jobs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.466" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Harkin-Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016120800002#L00200"><p>As regards there being a lack of support, I have to agree with Senator Colm Burke.  There is an entity within the HSE or, from a public service perspective, the employer, of which the union is the organiser and in which the preparation of statements is part of the role of the union.  Staff working within hospitals are left to their own devices, with minimal support, and there is minimal guidance for managers on how to access support.  The same support systems are not operated in all areas.  The occupational health service is overwhelmed because of the current financial crisis in terms of retention and recruitment.  Staffing levels have dropped because there has been no replacement of the quantified number of medical professionals required to man these departments.  There is another very lonely entity which comprises carers.  We work in a caring organisation but minimal care is provided for carers, which is a worry.</p> <p>  Speaking from an organisational perspective, there are good structures in place.  Our members are regularly updated on the services we provide at our annual delegate conference, branch meetings, section meetings and on our website.  There are also structures that are regularly advertised on the HSE's website.  However, I caution that they do not always operate on a 24/7 or 7/7 basis.  As the representative body of members, in the past we have occasionally had to deal with very stressed employees at perhaps 8 p.m. or 10 p.m. in a call which could have lasted for an hour and a half or two hours.  Post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with it.</p> <p>  The initial pilot training on open disclosure consisted of an half an hour information session followed by three and a half hours of role play.  However, the mechanism used in the roll-out of that training worries me because a system in which the trainer is trained is not the proper one to cascade information down to all employees.  It is important that information on open disclosure be available much more widely and incorporated into the induction programme for medical staff, including nurses and midwives.  The general public also needs information on open disclosure.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct that the delays are a problem.  Timeliness is important.  The information needs to get out, as Dr. Duddy mentioned.  When information is not timely, there is the mindset that the HSE is hiding something.  Therefore, timing is key.  The information must be made available within 24 or 48 hours, or even immediately.  We talk about the golden rule in treating myocardial infarction, MI, or heart attack patients.  It is equally important when an adverse event occurs that that golden rule also be instigated as it keeps the wolf from the door which is vitally important.  </p> <p>  That is all I want to say.  My colleague Mr. Edward Mathews might like to say something.</p></speech>

On the lack of understanding in giving information to patients, there is good evidence in the numbers of patients and families who say they have taken a court case just to find out what happened.  There is a sense that the institution's primary concern is the protection of its own reputation.  There is a sense that it is defending itself rather than allowing the patient or his or her family to find out what happened.  That is a common organisational response.  We saw it in other instances with the Catholic Church and so on in which the response was to defend the institution.  I hope this open disclosure legislation will bring that culture to an end in order that health care professionals will act without having to worry about potential knock-on effects on the part of management or their employer.  At the end of the day, that is what this is about: allowing patients and their families access to information when an adverse event happens.</p> <p>  The Senator's second question was about the lack of support for staff when involved in an adverse event.  Again, there is very good evidence in the medical literature as regards the second victim syndrome which health care professionals experience across the board when an adverse event occurs.  Like Dr. Ryan, I work in neurosurgery, an area in which we frequently look after critically-ill patients and in which there are poor outcomes, as I have experienced myself.  The support from colleagues and employers has been variable.  It is something that should be instituted across the board, particularly in high-stress medical specialties such as intensive care, general surgery, neurosurgery, obstetrics and so on.  There should be some obligation on the employer to provide support for staff who have been involved in these events.  That is something we mentioned in our statement.</p></speech>

That issue is discussed at a point at which everything has failed because there has been a complete breakdown of trust and everybody has become adversarial.  The law of tort was reformed in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s and in Australia in 2002.  Whether a variation of care was coincidental with or had led directly to an adverse outcome is important because care is variable and should be individualised and personalised.  It should not be regarded as poor or of a lesser standard just because there has been some minor variation.  Oftentimes, one sees minor variations of care quoted in the media as if they were causative.  That issue needs to be addressed if for no other reason than that it is unfair on the family, the doctors and the health care administration that there is unnecessary litigation and unnecessarily high awards.  It is only logical that if a case goes to litigation to pursue a wrong, the wrong has to be proved and the causation determined, rather than inferred, implied, imputed or suggested.  It must be proved that an action led directly to harm.</p> <p>  On the administration of health care systems, all centralised health care bureaucracies assume an animus of their own and tend to become depersonalised.  Very often the people who head up centralised health care systems have little or no direct clinical contact with the patients at any stage during their careers.  All one has to do is look at the NHS and the Mid Staffordshire report to see how attempts to micro-manage patient care from a bureaucratic office at some remove from the direct patient interface failed, compromised care and led to an adverse outcome.  That brings us back to how the health care system is governed.  It highlights the complete absence of clinical governance in the Irish health care system, with the sole exception of the voluntary maternity hospitals which have proved outstanding successes in providing excellent care for large numbers of women on a minimal budget.  There is a problem with an excessively bureaucratic and isolated health care administration trying to run what is essentially a service system.  That is my response to Senator Colm Burke's second question.</p> <p>  On the staffing issue, in high acuity areas we have to accept that there will be staff burnout.  Everybody is not capable of dealing with stress seven days a week, 24 hours a day for five or ten years, at the end of which period most people will burn out.  That is natural.  Anybody with any empathy will suffer from symptoms of burnout after a period of prolonged stress, but we need empathetic staff on the front line to look after patients.</p><p>Many younger nurses come to intensive care, practise for five or ten years and then move to some other sphere in the health care system.  They bring valuable knowledge and behaviours with them to the rest of the system.  It is good that there is movement in the health care system.  It is good for the the system and staff.  There is nothing worse than forcing a nurse or a doctor to stay in place when he or she is burning out because he or she cannot deal with the stress.  That is a natural part of a high acuity care system.</p><p> There is the question of whether medical staff were prepared for the Coroner's Court.  In the past the Coroner's Court provided a great service for relatives.  After somebody had died and if there was a question about the quality of care provided, we were always able to refer a case to the coroner.  The coroner was a dispassionate, independent reviewer of the quality of care provided and the court was a great forum to attend.  Unfortunately, however, the Coroner's Court has become adversarial, which it is not supposed to be.  One ends up in the court testifying to the coroner but being cross-examined by a barrister.  The point of the Coroner's Court is that there is a free exchange of information.  One is there as the coroner's witness to provide him or her with help in determining the cause of death, but the presence of barristers for both sides completely inhibits this.  The over-legalisation of the adjudication of what happens in patients who suffer adverse outcomes inhibits open disclosure.  That is a problem.</p></speech>

I have a question for Dr. Duddy on the practicality of making an open disclosure in a timely fashion.  Who do he believe should be present at that open disclosure?

Obviously, it might not be made to the patient but to a relative or a number of relatives.  How would Dr. Duddy see the process being set up within 24 or 48 hours of an adverse event occurring?</p></speech>

That is one of the difficulties with its practical implementation because, obviously, there are implications for patient confidentiality and the patient's consent to information being revealed to a third party.  One way would be, whenever a patient is admitted to hospital, having him or her identify next-of-kin.  If he or she is conscious, he or she should be able to understand some of his or her information would be revealed to the next-of-kin should an adverse event happen, even when they were not aware of it.  That might be one way of doing it.</p></speech>

However, all parties could be informed in advance that it would be an open conversation to explain what had happened.  We are always told in our training that apologising is not an automatic admission of liability.  Perhaps it might be made clear that the purpose of the conversation is to apologise or explain what went wrong, as opposed to starting from a defensive footing.  There are ways in which it could be communicated clearly to patients and their families.</p></speech>

They include the medical and-or surgical lead person.  In terms of a nursing or midwifery staff presence, whether it should be a staff nurse or midwife, a clinical midwife manager or a clinical nurse manager would depend on the circumstances involved, but it is important.  There should also be somebody from administration present.  I am conscious that we are talking about service users and that it is an extraordinarily vulnerable time for people.  It is within the heads of the Bill that the Legislature has advised the commission and the authority that they should produce in their guidelines how a person who is receiving the disclosure should be supported.  That is important also.  Perhaps it might be done by the patient advocacy office or other services within the HSE.  The Bill does not cover the HSE only.  It covers both private and public care services.</p> <p>  The point we have made in our submission which is important and touches on the points the Chairman is making is that while the heads of the Bill provide wide scope for the authority and the commission to provide guidelines - there is guidance given on a number of matters - noticeably absent is anything relating to governance, review or leadership within an organisation to make an open disclosure and the training of staff in that regard.  That includes staff who will have to make the disclosure and people who will have to manage it in a 24/7 cycle and facilitate meetings.  If they are to be run properly, they will not be meetings at which somebody will say, "We will have that down in the nurse manager's office."  It will have to be planned and properly delivered.  One significant amendment that could be considered - it refers to Senator Colm Burke's point about improving matters on the ground - is making it a requirement for the authority and the commission in their standards to direct how organisations should approach governing in this way, leading to an open disclosure policy, how it would be reviewed and, importantly, how staff would be trained in that regard.</p> <p>  On what is said to people at the beginning, one need not say in a meeting that they cannot use what is said.  The protections provided in the Bill relate to professional regulatory and civil liability proceedings.  People can be invited to attend the meeting and told it is taking place in the context of making an open disclosure.  They can be told what it is.  At that difficult time in a person's life there is no need to mire him or her in the minutiae of legal niceties.  Once the meeting has been convened and people are notified that a meeting is being held under this heading, if things fail later and when matters come to be considered by solicitors and-or the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, the Medical Council, CORU or other regulators, they will know then about the information.  It is not a matter to which I have given huge consideration but, from an empathetic point of view, I share Dr. Duddy's concern that it hardly seems to be an open discussion if one starts by saying, "Anything I say to you now cannot be said to anybody else."</p></speech>

Perhaps it is also the experience of my colleagues.  When something has gone wrong, openness and speed are key.  It is important not to wait until the morning and for the administrative staff to come to work.  It is important not to wait for a formal meeting to be held.  It is important for the doctors concerned to tell the truth on a one-to-one basis.  Personally, I show the patient the chart and walk him or her through it, sometimes in the middle of the night.  That is the only way to do it.  If there is a delay, the patient or relatives immediately see it as an attempt to hide things.  It must be done as soon as possible after the event and in as open a manner as possible, with full and free access to as many of the medical notes and much of the information as is available to show the patient or relatives on a confidential basis.  One cannot wait for the administration staff to come to work.  If something goes wrong on a Friday night, one cannot wait until the Monday.  It must be done there and then; one must start the process oneself.  As a consultant working in an Irish hospital, one must take ownership of the process.  It is the consultant's patient.  Perhaps the consultant advised the patient to undergo the procedure or perhaps he or she performed it.  It is the consultant's problem and he or she must take ownership of it.  It is nobody else's problem.</p><p>We cannot have a situation where administration staff are attempting to control the process.</p></speech>

I will offer one example.  In Limerick the protocol was in operation 283 times between 1 January and 14 November, that is, 88% of the time.  I am happy to share the figures with the committee.  We obtained them as part of the freedom of information process.</p><p>I am mindful that there seems to be a divergence of views.  I am acutely aware that accountability does not and should not mean taking responsibility for systemic failure and systematic and long-term under-funding of the health service, although that is often what happens.  I appreciate the point made by Dr. Ryan.</p><p>I am keen to hear the views of the deputations on this point.  When an adverse incident takes place and the patient or relative is informed at the earliest possible opportunity, the process does not always involve one person.  Several people can be involved and they should be all involved.  Sometimes it results from a systemic fault that is not easily explainable.  It may or may not have something to do with the rules that apply.  That brings me to my question.  We have had a discussion about it, but I am keen to tease the matter out further.  Who should be present when the disclosure is being made or, to put it another way, the chat is taking place?  I am keen to get a clearer picture of where we are going.  My view is that all of the people involved should be fully trained as they will require protected time.  Moreover, it will have to be part of the <i>modus operandi</i>of every hospital and health care facility.  Let us suppose there are three people in a room, two of whom are regulated health care professionals and of one of whom is not.  The process is over for the person involved in administration.  I mean no disrespect to such persons, but the process is over for them once they have the difficult conversation.  Unfortunately or fortunately - whatever way we view it - for the regulated health care professional, the discussion might only be the start of a long process in dealing with the relevant regulatory body.  There has been some discussion about this matter and I am keen to know whether the suggestion is that the people involved in administration should somehow be regulated statutorily.  Is it enough for guidelines to be issued?  I have a view about this.  I am conscious that there will be three people in the room, two of whom will be accountable to another body outside the hospital and the HSE but the third might not be and the process will be over for that person.  I am interested in hearing the views of the deputations on that point.</p><p>There was considerable discussion of the adversarial process in place.  We also need to be cognisant of the fact that we are dealing with people who for whatever reason have had a bad experience.  I am unsure whether education alone will be enough or whether this legislation plus education will be enough to change the culture.  I have had experience of this at what is now the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland which used to be known as An Bord Altranais.  Often what happens is that people are not satisfied with the answer they have received and pursue the matter.  Individuals are held to account for failures that are not within their control.  The people who have some of the answers and are responsible for some of the rules and regulations - generally known as the bureaucracy - will never sit in front of a regulatory body.  I am conscious that this legislation does not address that point, but do the deputations believe it can or should?  Is other legislation required?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016120800002#N00600"><p>I wish to refer to some of the points raised by Deputy Louise O'Reilly.  Reference was made to this being a consultant's problem.  The question is: who is in charge?  I am mindful of the fact that there are recruitment challenges within the HSE and I am seeking the views of the deputations since they represent the people who work in hospitals.  Let us suppose a hospital consultant is in charge of a team but had no involvement in its recruitment.  Perhaps there is anecdotal evidence that some of those filling posts may not be the optimum people to fill them because of a shortage of applicants.  Perhaps I have it wrong, but how on earth can a hospital consultant be the person to take the hit when he or she had no involvement in the recruitment of the team?  He or she may not necessarily be 100% happy with the standards of those operating in it.  It seems a little unfair, therefore, that the hospital consultant is the person who is in the firing line.</p> <p>  Let us suppose an adverse effect occurs at birth.  There are certain practicalities.  Given all of the dealings I have had in hospitals in recent years, it is my understanding everyone is usually working at maximum capacity.  How then can we pull a consultant out of the system and into a room when he or she probably has 40 other things to do?  Let us assume the mother is alive, that the father is present and that something has happened to the newborn infant.  I can picture myself in that scene.  If two doctors and a person involved in administration were to land in on me, I would immediately take the view that it was a little much.  The consultant leads the team and is responsible, but what are the practicalities involved?  How would a panel of individuals landing in on a patient after an adverse event be perceived by the patient?</p> <p>  We need to protect staff.  Let us suppose medical staff are working in situations that are not the optimum and that things are not ideal in an emergency department or delivery suite.  How will the hospital be made liable for the terrible conditions in which staff may be working?  Sometimes things are not within the control of staff at all.  A team might be down two staff members; there might be a leak or perhaps someone did not put the trolley in the right place.  I am concerned that someone who entered medicine to help and cure people is constantly blamed when everything goes wrong, especially when some things could not possibly be his or her fault.</p> <p>  There is also the question of burnout having worked for ten years at maximum capacity.  Is this issue dealt with at any stage when people are training?  Are they told that they will have ten good years in intensive care and will then be put out to pasture for the remainder of their careers?  It seems that we are not placing much value on people if it is acceptable that we will work the living Jesus out of them for ten years and then send them away on their bike because we can get in another gang of fools to be worn out in the following ten years.  The team is ultimately responsible.  </p> <p>  There is also the right to one's good name.  I am always mindful of this when I hear things in the news about certain events.  Someone from RTE may be in front of a medical person who may not necessarily have done anything wrong.  I am conscious that this must be of concern to his or her family.  Obviously, people assume that if others are on television, they have done something wrong.  I am conscious of the stress this might cause for their families, as well as for themselves.  What is in place to protect them and provide counselling for them to deal with any post-traumatic stress they might suffer after an incident?</p> <p>  Let us suppose a professional is involved in a situation where something bad has happened and he or she goes to the patient to explain what has happened.  How will he or she treat someone else immediately after that?  Is this built into the skill set such that the professional will be able to compartmentalise it and move on to the next job?  This is about professionals being the fall guy and being in charge but perhaps not being able to control the situation.  It is a question of being held responsible for things they cannot possibly control.  I am keen to hear the comments of the deputations on that point.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to leave earlier, but I had to attend another committee meeting.  Unfortunately, the medical profession has not yet identified a way to enable people to bilocate, but I am hopeful.  </p><p>I thank the delegations for sharing their views with us.  A few simple things affect us all and we all have personal experiences.  For the individual directly affected, it can have a positive or a negative impact that will never leave.  In the past year and a half I had five experiences with which I was unhappy.  The matters were not personal but concerned my constituents.  If things had been done differently at different times, the outcomes would have been different.  I appreciate the suggestion the health sector is under-resourced, understaffed and overstretched, but I am not sure it applies in all cases.  Three things happen.  First, there is a fatality and the case ends up in court.  Serious problems arise, including castigation, etc.  Second, there is permanent damage, which is sad, especially where children are involved.  Obviously, the parents are traumatised, as is the child, and forever will be.  Is there something wrong with the procedures in dealing with some cases?  I do not know the answer as I am not an expert in this area.  Third, there is the event that is near fatal.  Fortunately, in this case the person recovers.  Without a shadow of doubt, there should be a meeting held and an admission of responsibility.  Unfortunately, none of this happened and it was left to me to arrange a meeting at which nothing was admitted because an apology would have provided a basis for future litigation.  I do not see why a meeting cannot take place, without prejudice, and there cannot be an admission.  I do not see why an <i>ex gratia</i>payment cannot be issued in some cases in a situation where hundreds of thousands of euro or, in some cases, millions would otherwise be awarded through the courts. </p><p>I agree entirely with Dr. Ryan that one is better off in being upfront in addressing cases from the beginning.  There should be a policy of dealing with cases when things go wrong, which would mean openness and disclosure.  Such a policy would generate public confidence and a patient would realise he or she was dealing with an institution which would not cover anything up, even for its own sake, which wouldl outline the circumstances involved, the situation that presented itself and whether it could have been prevented.  By all means, the health service should take that route.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with mediation.  On numerous occasions I have participated in mediation in such cases and other circumstances.  In some cases the courts had failed, but I will not continue in this vein.  The point that abides with me is simple.  Public and patient confidence must be restored.  If it does not prevail, it will dampen the medical profession, hospital services, general medical services, etc.  To what extent can the delegations advance the possibility of mediation and the offer of an <i>ex gratia</i>payment without prejudice?  Even though irreparable damage has been caused to a person or a person may have passed away, in some cases the hurt can be assuaged by somebody deciding to make an offer.  Let us remember that if a case goes further, it will cost a hell of a lot more.</p></speech>

Her question was linked with Deputy Kate O'Connell's request that hospitals be made responsible for poor conditions.  In short, I do not think simple guidelines would be sufficient.  I have already spoken about the double standards.  If a doctor or a nursing professional is in a management role, he or she is accountable to his or her regulatory body, whereas an administrator who is not a health care professional is not.  There needs to be proper regulatory oversight of those in administrative roles in the health care service.</p> <p>  Deputy Kate O'Connell asked why hospital consultants should be responsible for the actions of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, they have not hired.  That raises a few questions because a lot of the time NCHDs come from other countries and have not worked in the Irish system before.  They are thrown in at the deep end in a different culture and health care environment in which speak people speak a different language.  The Medical Council is working on a programme, Safe Start, to assist new doctors in joining the system, both interns who have graduated from Irish universities and those who come here from abroad.  Having a proper induction process to introduce them to the health care system in Ireland will improve matters.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the issue of burnout was addressed during training.  I can only answer from my own experience as a trainee in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and confirm that it provides such training.  It identifies the symptoms of burnout in order that one will be able recognise them in oneself, will know how to address them and what support systems have been put in place by the college and one's employer to prevent burnout from happening.  The issue has been addressed in the surgery community, but I cannot speak for other specialties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.489" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Edward Mathews" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016120800002#O00500"><p>On the number of people who should be present in a room which was Deputy Louise O'Reilly's specific question, my answer is not simple.  My colleague has made the point that in some cases they should include the consultant, which is absolutely appropriate.  In some cases it might involve a nursing and midwifery issue and they might include the nurse or midwife.  When I mentioned an administrator being present, I was referring to nursing administrators.  There are administrators available 24/7.  I see my colleague's point very clearly.  One should not have to wait for the general manager to come in the following morning.  Who should be present depends on the circumstances involved.  Those who are able to provide adequate explanations should be present.  To reflect my colleague's remarks, there is potential initially to have an interim meeting to explain what happened, to be followed perhaps by a follow-up meeting if there has been a systemic error.</p> <p>  I will address the point made by Deputy Bernard J. Durkan.  There has absolutely been no suggestion from this side of the room, certainly from my organisation, that staff shortages or anything else are a explanation for everything that goes wrong.  Mistakes are made; there are systemic and individual errors.  There are things which happen that are not anyone's fault.  </p> <p>  On the regulation of managers, there is regulation of health care professionals to protect the public because those who hold a licence to practise have the potential to do great good, but they can also do great harm if they do something wrong.  Managers and administrators in the health service have the potential to do great good and also great harm and I have yet to understand why we are regulated and they are not.  I cannot make our stance any clearer. </p> <p>  The majority of Deputy Kate O'Connell's questions were directed at my physician colleagues.  I will address her questions about the fitness to practise process and the support available in the service.  I can tell her that there is perfunctory or zero support for those going through regulatory processes.  It is non-existent.  It falls to organisations such as the IHCA, the IMO, the INMO or our parallel representative organisations to support them.  One will have individual instances in which people are supported by good managers.  I do not wish to deny that that happens, but there is no systemic support available.</p> <p>  A point was made about inquests.  Our members now have a huge fear of inquests.  When they attend, they worry that they will be torn apart in cross-examination.  The counsel or representative who is supposed to be present to support them is there to support the institution or the employer and will not even intervene in the most egregious cross-examination.  </p> <p>  I am conscious that time is short.  The committee is considering the issue of protection in making a disclosure.  We have not made the following point.  The heads of the Bill are very important in that they extend not only to health services but also to personal and social services.</p><p>There is a rider in the definitions included in the Bill which states it only refers to health or personal social services provided to deal with medical issues.  Many elderly people or those with a disability receive personal social services provided for them by professionals which do not have a curative or a treatment element.  For example, it may involve a social outing.  Why should they or their connected persons be excluded from an open disclosure if they fall while on a social outing, for instance?  Why should it not be explained because it was not related to treating or preventing an illness?  There is a valid proposition to be made that this aspect should be included.  If we are talking about service users, say, a person with a disability, an elderly person or connected persons, they will want to know what happened.  Why should they be treated less favourably because they are availing of a service not provided for medical reasons?  We are supportive of this measure.  We request the committee to give serious consideration to the substantive submission we have made in seeking amendments to the definition of "professional regulatory processes", as well as extending the documentary protections to professional regulatory processes.</p></speech>

Somebody has to be accountable for the quality of patient care provided.  Currently, it is consultants who take that responsibility every day and they need to be supported.</p> <p>  The non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, and nurse recruitment process is a HR disaster.  The HR system in the HSE regards health care staff as a liability, not as an asset, and treats them as such.  That is why we cannot recruit or retain staff in the health care system.</p> <p>  As to when one should admit there has been a problem and who should be in the room, very often one has to continue caring for the patient whom one may have just harmed.  One has to maintain that patient&rsquo;s trust.  If the patient in any way senses one is prevaricating, obfuscating or being less than open, one loses his or her trust and the atmosphere becomes poisonous.  One has to be honest, open and upfront as early as possible.  Sometimes the details of what has happened are confidential to the nurses and doctors looking after the patient and it would be inappropriate to have an administrator in the room.  However, the admission has to be made early, open, full and honest, but one has to maintain the trust of the patient.  If one is open and honest with the patient and apologises when something has gone wrong, one will not be sued.  There will be no litigation.  All the patient will want is an apology and some guarantee the same adverse event will not happen again in the future.  There will, however, be implications for the health care system of such openness and honesty.  One implication will be there will be a need to have more resources focused on the front line and more clinical governance of the system.</p></speech>

I take the opportunity to publicly congratulate Mr. Molloy and his wife, R&oacute;is&iacute;n, on their receipt of a People of the Year award last Saturday.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for the invitation to meet it.  While we respect that it is hearing from a range of stakeholders, as patient advocates, we call for a statutory requirement on health care professionals to disclose to patients when an adverse event occurs.  My older brother, Raymond, has cerebral palsy and paraplegia resulting from an injury at birth.  My wife, Fiona, suffered from severe post-natal depression following the birth of our children.  These and other experiences led us to found the Irish Patients Association.  <br/><br/>The Irish Patients Association was launched on the RTE programme &quot;Today with Pat Kenny&quot; 21 years ago.  At the time patients were disempowered; they had no voice; they were talked down to by the system.  Even within the system there were these silo effects.  The patients' charter was nothing more than a piece of paper, with no real commitment to deliver on its aspirations.  The words &quot;patient advocacy&quot; were new and for many on waiting lists, the advocate of choice was their local Deputy.  During the years we have been involved in many areas of the health care system, always faithful to patients and their families by keeping them at the centre of all decision making.  Reform has been glacial.  However, much has been done to improve quality and safety.  We welcome and support this, but it is a matter of trust: trust in the system for patients and wider society.  It is, however, also a matter of rights.  We cannot remember everyone, but we can remember Mrs. Rebecca O'Malley whose cancer diagnosis was delayed; the late Mr. Kevin Murphy whose mum, Margaret, is with us this morning; Mrs. Savita Halappanavar who died as a result of delayed treatment; Ms Bimbo Onanuga whose death was recorded as medical misadventure; Ms Dhara Kivlehan who died as a result of delayed treatment; Mr. Colin Evans who died as a result of a medication error; the late baby Mark Molloy whose dad, Mark Snr., is with us this morning and the late Mr. Gerry Feeney, aspects of whose hospital care were deemed to be unacceptable. <br/><br/><b></b>Do we have a problem?<b></b>Yes, we do.  I refer the committee to a recent study, the findings of which were published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>on 10 February 2016, entitled, The Irish National Adverse Events Study, INAES: The frequency and nature of adverse events in Irish hospitals - a retrospective record review of 2009 data byNatasha Rafter<i>et al.  </i>One in eight patients admitted to hospital during 2009 experienced adverse events.  Of these, 20.8% witnessed moderate recovery within one month; in 8.6% of cases there was a permanent disability of less than 50%, whiile in 6.7% cases the event contributed to the death of the patient.  How many of these patients were told that the mistake was avoidable?  This is just the tip of the iceberg as no adverse events were studied in the community, by the family doctor or in nursing homes and there was no study of the impact of unequal access to health care for those waiting too long to be seen or undergo surgery.  <br/><br/>The issue of consent has changed the doctor-patient relationship in the past 20 years.  The HSE's policy on consent states, &quot;It is a basic rule of common law that consent must be obtained for clinical examination, treatment or investigation&quot;.  The Constitution reaffirms this rule, as does international law.  Therefore, any exception to the rule would be subject to intense judicial scrutiny since the purpose of the rule is to uphold one of the most basic of all rights, that is, the right to bodily integrity.  The argument in favour of consent as an indispensable precursor to treatment is born out of the concept of patient autonomy which, in turn, is based on the rights of individual self-determination and bodily integrity in Article 40.3 of the Constitution. <br/><br/>Simply put, a patient does not consent to an adverse event.  As stated, it is not lawful to undertake an examination, treatment or an investigation without such consent.  Surely, the patient has a statutory right to be told when such a violation of consent occurs or if the management of services has caused an event?</p><p>Who is best served by the establishment&rsquo;s current position that there should not be a statutory obligation for the patient to be told?  Management, policymakers and other agencies have an obligation to disclose adverse events.  The Medical Council of Ireland is not an inquiry as it certainly does not use information it has and knows the consequences of issuing it or not.<br/><br/>In addition to supporting the law, a patient safety advocacy agency must be independent of the Department of Health and the HSE similar to HIQA which is a jewel in the regulatory crown.  The language of advocacy is moving from passive participation to the language of rights and active involvement in many ways.  Change and reform in the health care system must not be preceded by preventable funerals and injury to patients.  We need to make open disclosure the law because it is needed and members can do it <br/><br/>I would like during the questions and answers session to address the issue of accountability of management and public servants who govern the day-to-day system.<b></b>I thank the Chairman and members for giving me this opportunity.  I introduce Ms Margaret Murphy.</p></speech>

I am the external lead adviser of the World Health Organization's patients for patient safety programme which advocates for a culture of safe care that is more inclusive of patients and families.  Advocates like me in the WHO are not career advocates.  We have not chosen this work for ourselves, rather it is a response to circumstances that has brought us to this work.  It is a responsibility that has been thrust upon us by events, one which we would gladly forfeit for the restoration of the lives and well-being of our loved ones who have been harmed by health care, albeit unintentionally.  The previous Minister for Health actually described non-disclosure as tantamount to a hit-and-run road accident.</p> <p>  It is also very important to understand disclosure is not about blame, neither accepting blame nor apportioning blame, rather it is about integrity.  It is about being truly professional and demonstrating that professionalism.  It is about preserving that relationship of trust between doctor and patient.  It is about learning and improvement.  I would say exhortations, training and resolve alone will not work despite the very good work being undertaken at the moment by the HSE and the State Claims Agency in respect of rolling out a training programme.  Exhortations alone will not work as they will take too long to work.  There is an absolute need for mandatory open disclosure underpinned by legislation, which is certainly evidenced by a number of items.  We are asking the legislators to do the right thing for the people, their constituents.</p> <p>  It is an inalienable right of any patient entrusting their own care and that of loved ones to the health care system to have the assurance that in the event of error, open disclosure will be practised, learning will occur and improvements to prevent recurrence will be put in place.  The continuing mantra from patients leaving the courts is that they do not want it to happen to anybody else.</p> <p>  There is a very real need to break the cycle of deny and defend which catapults patients and families into a litigation process to gain access to truth and acceptance of responsibility.  I would love the opportunity to illustrate this in respect of my family's case.  Families have an entitlement to the respectful management of serious clinical events in accordance with the process outlined by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, IHI White Paper.  Closing ranks, lame excuses, collegiality and inappropriate responses undermine the system we are trying to bring to a state of excellence.</p> <p>  It will support staff, especially front-line staff in doing the right thing because with legislation they must do so in contrast to putting their heads above the parapet and stepping out from the crowd.  It will address the shared abandonment which staff and families often experience in the aftermath of events.  I would like to have an opportunity to give an example from a staff member.  There is a need to move away from the language of "encouraging" or "promoting" open disclosure to saying disclosure is what we have to do because it is the law.  The members of the Oireachtas are the law makers.</p> <p>  We need to dispel the myths.  It will not result in an escalation of litigation, as borne out by the Michigan experience.  I can furnish the statistics from it, for example, the experience of Dr Rick Van Pelt and his patient Linda Kenny.  Neither will it result in avoidance of reporting because it is the law.  Some 90% of the respondents to the Irish Medical Council survey said they trusted doctors to tell the truth.  Is it not more unacceptable when that high level of trust can sometimes be betrayed?</p> <p>  We need to strengthen the effectiveness of the HSE training initiative in respect of disclosure.  In regard to disclosure training events, I would like to know who attends, the attendance rates and the number of high level staff who attend, are being trained and are promoting disclosure.  We need to interrogate this.</p> <p>  For me as an individual it is important because I am Kevin's mother, I was present at his birth.  I know every detail of that birth.  I was also present when he died and, as his mother, I needed and deserved to know everything about the circumstances which brought that about.  However, over and above that, I needed to be assured that lessons would be learned and that those lessons would be disseminated all in the hope of preventing a recurrence.  Patients like Kevin and me place our trust in the legislators.</p></speech>

We would like to take the opportunity to welcome the many improvements and patient safety supports and initiatives that have been introduced in the past three years.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, our experience is of a system where great lengths will be pursued to contain adverse events by people at all levels and in various roles, who appear to have the fall-back position of complete impunity in the knowledge that while their actions may have catastrophic consequences for patients and a significant effect on front-line staff, there are no effective mechanisms in place to make them accountable for poor performance.  While the State will continue to pick up the tab for the financial consequences of their actions, it is the lack of a statutory accountability framework that we believe is the single biggest impediment to health care reform in Ireland.</p> <p>  In the immediate aftermath of Mark&rsquo;s death, we asked the management of the maternity unit why our son had died.  We essentially sought open disclosure but were misled.  Before R&oacute;is&iacute;n left hospital seven days later, we asked the same question and were misled again.  We know now that they had the answers at that time.  We met the management of the hospital five weeks later and were once again not given the answers that they had.  As each tier of HSE management did not give us the answers that were known to them about Mark&rsquo;s death, we moved to a higher tier all the way to national director level, and were, as the then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar said last year, lied to many times.  Of course, as we now know, our experience was the same as that of many others.</p> <p>  I have read through the committee transcript of the meeting with the chief medical officer, Dr. Tony Holohan, and Dr. Kathleen MacLellan from the Department of Health and agree with the vast majority of their submission, particularly in relation to making open disclosure mandatory within the HSE for a certain level of adverse event and above.  However, where we disagree is on whether open disclosure should be voluntary or statutory.</p> <p>  The management investigation that resulted from our last appearance before this committee in May 2015 is now more than one year overdue for completion, and estimates suggest it will be at least March 2017 before it is complete.  This investigation is about non-disclosure by senior HSE management and this, in particular, is where we feel voluntary open disclosure in the health service collapses.</p> <p>  It is no secret that there is an apparent significant disconnect between HSE front-line staff and management, yet the enormity of the cultural shift that this voluntary initiative would require, like with any company, would demand top-down buy-in and full support if it were to be effective.  How can we expect front-line staff to disclose openly and voluntarily when they witness management going to such lengths to contain incidents?  Unfortunately, it simply will not happen.</p> <p>  While to err is human, self-preservation is one of our most basic instincts.  We submit to the committee that the battle to encourage an open disclosure culture in the health service is long since lost at this stage and only through the introduction of statutorily based open disclosure and, most important, and this is such an important point, overseen by a broader legal accountability framework for all health care professionals in Ireland, can we have confidence that patients will be appropriately informed when things go wrong.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and members.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Ms Catherine Tarrant, solicitor and head of clinical claims.</p> <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is designated as the State Claims Agency, SCA, when performing the claims and risk management functions delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  The SCA's principle objectives are to act fairly and ethically in its dealings with people who have suffered injuries and who take legal actions against the State or State bodies while acting in the best interests of taxpayers, and the families of the people concerned; and to implement targeted personal injury and property damage risk work programmes to mitigate litigation risk in State authorities and health care enterprises to reduce the costs of future litigation against the State.  The SCA's remit covers personal injury and third party property damage risks and claims relating to certain State authorities, including the State itself, Ministers, the Attorney General, the Health Service Executive, HSE, the voluntary health care sector, an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Irish Prison Service, the Defence Forces and community and comprehensive schools.</p> <p>  In October 2010, the SCA and the HSE, with the support of the Medical Protection Society, MPS, commenced a two-year open disclosure pilot project at two sites, the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, and Cork University Hospital.  The project objective was to provide training and other resources to support managers, doctors and other health care professionals in engaging in the open disclosure process with patients and their families; to provide support and guidance for health care professionals on how to communicate with patients and their families following an adverse event and to manage the challenges and communication which can occur; and to demonstrate the importance of open disclosure for patients and their families, health and social care staff and the wider organisation.  It was planned that the learning from the pilot project would be used to inform the development of a national policy and supporting guidelines on open disclosure, as well as to provide a standardised national open disclosure framework to be implemented across all health and social care services that would progress, foster and practically support a culture of openness in an informed, sensitive, inclusive and safe environment.</p> <p>  Subsequently, an independent external evaluation of the project was proposed by the national project team to ensure independence, objectivity and transparency for all of the stakeholders involved.  The evaluation of the project was deemed important in assessing the impact of the work undertaken within both pilot sites, progress to date, to what extent the project had met its objectives, and whether a change of practice had occurred.  The learning from the pilot projects, international best practice and the drafting of the two hospital policies was used as the basis for drafting the national policy and guidance which was launched by the then Minister for Health, Senator James Reilly, on 12 November 2013.  Three further supporting documents were also launched, including a staff support booklet, patient information leaflet and staff briefing guide.</p> <p>  The findings from the evaluation demonstrated that the main barriers to implementing open disclosure included concerns over increased litigation costs, fear of damaging or losing the relationship with the patient, fear of a loss of reputation or career progression, lack of institutional support, lack of training in how to practice open disclosure, and the emotional impact on clinicians of adverse events.</p> <p>  In 2010 the SCA undertook the open disclosure project in conjunction with the HSE so as to ensure an open and consistent approach to communications when things go wrong in health care.  The agency took the view that it was time to formalise the process of expressing regret upon the happening of an adverse event, keeping the patient informed, providing feedback on investigations and outlining the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event.  Since 2010, the SCA and the HSE have jointly trained almost 3,000 staff in open disclosure and approximately 9,000 staff have been briefed.  This morning I was informed by a colleague that this figure has grown to 14,000.</p> <p>  Training in open disclosure is critical to its success.  How clinicians and other practitioners communicate with a patient when things go wrong is important.  The quality and frankness of the communication following an adverse event may determine whether that patient will make a complaint or claim.  Providing clinicians and practitioners with the proper skills of communication with patients in what can be a difficult and stressful set of circumstances, following an adverse event, is of the utmost importance.</p> <p>  The SCA strongly supports the Department of Health's legislative provisions to support open disclosure which will ensure clarity for everyone involved in the open disclosure process and provide consistency across the many parts of the health system as to how open disclosure is understood and delivered.  The SCA welcomes the provision within the intended legislation which provides legal protection and privilege in connection with open disclosure of adverse events to patients.  The agency endorses the provision of such legal protection and privilege for the information and apology to be made available to a patient as required by the intended legislation.  The agency welcomes the fact that an apology may not be interpreted as an admission of liability and may not be used as such in litigation against the health enterprise.  This important provision will, in our view, create a climate of open engagement by practitioners, freed from the worry of an apology constituting an admission of liability and will, therefore, create a more balanced environment within which practitioners can honestly and conscientiously engage with patients in the aftermath of an adverse event.</p> <p>  It is our view that a voluntary system of open disclosure is the optimal approach and the Bill's provisions will provide the appropriate balance to protect patients and practitioners involved in open disclosure.</p></speech>

In my opening statement I referred to the Michigan experience.  Back in 2004 the University of Michigan health system adopted a full disclosure policy, not necessarily as a result of legislation.  In its words, it moved from a deny-and-defend approach to "apologise and learn when we are wrong, explain and vigorously defend when we are right and view court as a last resort".  As a result, between August 2001 and August 2007, the ratio of litigated cases were reduced from 65% to 27%, average claims processing time was reduced from 20.3 months to eight months, insurance reserves were reduced by two thirds and average litigation costs more than halved.  Savings were then invested in patient safety initiatives.  Not only is it the right thing to do, but there is a good business case for it, too.</p> <p>  The United Kingdom has enshrined a duty of candour in legislation.  This statutory duty came in at the end of 2014.  We are hearing anecdotally that it is having a positive effect on changing the culture in the health system.  It is appreciated that changing culture does not happen overnight.  However, having the duty of candour in place certainly helps focus attention.  For decades we have campaigned for a statutory duty as opposed to just guidance or contractual arrangements.  Small parts of the medical profession have resisted, fuelled mainly by warnings from medical defence organisations that it would have unintended consequences, make matters worse or drive reporting underground.  There is no evidence that unintended consequences have resulted in the United Kingdom.  All of the major organisations now accept statutory duty.</p> <p>  The arguments for and against duty of candour were meticulously considered as part of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust public inquiry which came down firmly in favour of introducing a statutory duty.  It is now one of the fundamental standards for health and social care providers in England, underpinned by the United Kingdom's Care Quality Commission statutory regulations.</p><p>The authorities in Scotland recently carefully considered whether to introduce a statutory duty and, following consultation, the Scottish Parliament passed legislation to bring such a duty into effect.  It should become operational in 2017.  Wales and Northern Ireland have signalled their intention to do likewise.  There are operational lessons to be learned from the United Kingdom and we would have to consider these.</p><p> The Canadian Patient Safety Institute is compiling a dossier of how the disclosure debate stands in all of its provinces.  The Government of Saskatchewan passed legislation requiring the reporting and investigation of critical incidents in health care as of September 2004.  The Manitoba Government passed legislation in 2005 to amend the Regional Health Authorities Act and there are other examples.  The amendments in legislation required that critical incidents be reported.  If a critical incident occurs, the regional health authority or prescribed health organisation must ensure appropriate steps are taken to fully inform the individual, including the patient, of the facts of what occurred, the consequences of the critical incident as they become known, the actions taken and the actions that will be taken to address the consequences.  A complete record of the critical incident must be made promptly and must be accessible to the individual in question.  Disclosure is not an event but a process.</p><p> This approach supports staff, especially front-line staff, to do the right thing because it is what they must do.  I will give an example in respect of the registrar who looked after Kevin who clearly accepted a significant degree of responsibility for the sad outcome.  I had a chance encounter with him while exiting a lift six weeks after Kevin's death.  As he made to enter the lift, our eyes locked and he was clearly trying to place me.  All I said to him was that I was Kevin Murphy's mother.  The man's face blanched and he blurted the out words, "I did not think he would die."  He backed out of the lift and ran away down the corridor.  We had just come from a very unsatisfactory encounter with a head of department and I turned to my husband and said, "Oh my God, they have abandoned us but they have abandoned him too."</p><p> A substantial amount of work needs to be done on this issue.  I will explain the abandonment we experienced when we met the individual in question.  At a significant point in Kevin's care, crucial blood tests were telephoned to the general practitioner's surgery.  These were written down on a Post-it note by the practice nurse who, as a result of the conversation, offered the correct diagnosis to the general practitioner.  However, the general practitioner came up with his own differential diagnosis and when writing the letter of referral to the hospital filtered the test results, only including those elements that supported his diagnosis and omitting the critical calcium reading, which was the issue.  As a consequence, this reading was not seen by the various people looking after Kevin.  When we met the head of department he showed me the Post-it note.  This is how patients are treated in the aftermath of events.  He asked me what I made of it and I said there was a very high calcium level at 5.73 mmol/L where the normal range is between 2.05 and 2.75 mmol/l.  He said that even if the reading had been seen by his consultant colleague, it would not have meant anything to him.  I asked why this would have been the case and he replied that the reading was not written as he would write it.  I asked to see the note again.  It used the term "cal" for calcium, "sod" for sodium and "pot" for potassium.  I asked him whether he was saying that because it was not written in scientific notation, it would not mean anything to someone like him.  The man actually replied "Yes".  It was at that point that I lost faith because I identified a reluctance to be decent, honest and humane and to have compassion for heartbroken people.  That is what drove us down the road of litigation, which is a road that patients do not go down.</p><p> Monetary compensation was never an issue for us as a family.  A sum of money does not exist that would equate to my Kevin.  We could not imagine any circumstance in which we would derive a benefit or pleasure and, as a consequence, we donated the settlement figure to two charities, B&oacute;thar and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.  I am totally convinced that proper disclosure and honesty would have been far more beneficial to us and the clinical staff involved.  Instead of focusing so much energy on defending a lawsuit, this energy could have been invested in identifying improvement measures and putting them into place.  Perhaps one of the first things we have do is examine why essentially decent and professional people often behave in a very inhumane manner in the aftermath of adverse events.</p><p> I repeat my plea for legislation to be introduced because legislation would make reporting happen.  We do not need wriggle room because leaving wriggle room would mean people would avail of it.  I have made copies of my expanded statement for each member should they wish to read it.  I thank the committee for its indulgence.</p></speech>

The question for us is whether they need to be compelled to do the right thing.  In such a circumstance, what must we do to ensure they feel fully supported?  As Ms Murphy acknowledged, there are people in the health service who want to do the right thing but may not feel they should have to answer for the system.</p> <p>  When they appeared before the joint committee, officials from the Department of Health expressed a fear that mandatory open disclosure would lead to a box-ticking exercise.  I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses, including those from the State Claims Agency, on that matter.</p> <p>  I congratulate Mark and R&oacute;is&iacute;n Molloy on their much deserved award.  I am sure they are very proud.</p> <p>  With regard to the training that was provided as part of the pilot scheme, was protected time given to that training and what number of staff were trained?  Mr. Molloy referred to the legal accountability framework and the need for health care professionals to have a legal accountability framework.  It could be argued that there are some provisions in place already, with some professionals having outside regulatory bodies while others do not.  Is it Mr. Molloy's view that a legal accountability framework should cover all persons in hospitals or should it be confined to health professionals, namely, doctors and nurses?  Should it extend to administrators, those who run the canteen and hospital cleaners?  Should it be in place for everybody?  </p> <p>  I thank the delegates for their attendance and the evidence they have given.</p></speech>

I congratulate the deledgates on their presentations.</p> <p>  Speaking to a previous delegation to the committee, I noted that Deputies are regularly called to mediate and intervene.  One of the questions frequently put to us is whether we are competent to make a decision in a particular case.  I am regularly asked this question and I always reply in the affirmative, although I am not medically competent to do so.  On some occasions, one does not require a great deal of expertise to be able to determine that something is going wrong.  In a number of the cases described, it would have been clear to any layperson that something had gone wrong.  For instance, in this day and age, no one should acquire an infection from a hypodermic needle, particularly one that would cause permanent damage to a patient or child.  Similarly, women should not be placed at significant risk in childbirth, as has occurred in certain cases about which we have been informed.</p><p>We need to get away from that risk and remember that the patients, two patients in some of those cases, have rights and entitlements.  On the question of whether voluntary disclosure versus a statutory obligation is the way to go, there is no doubt in my mind.  It has to be mandatory.  Otherwise, the choice will be on the one hand and on the other.</p><p> I remember once being asked about a particularly traumatic case involving a lot of people and my immediate line at that time was that there should be an admission and things should proceed from there.  It was going to happen anyway.  There was going to have to be an admission and that was what happened.  However, it did not happen until after protracted legal disputes.  It should not have to happen that way because the trauma and suffering affecting the patient and the family are sufficient without having to have to go through the proof part of it later in court.  That may well have to be the case, but at least there would be some recognition of their trauma at an earlier stage.</p><p> There is a grave danger.  In the past it is possible that things went unchallenged and unnoted but we have now reached a situation in terms of what the public expects and what professionals expect also in terms of professional protection whereby disclosure is necessary in everybody's interests, including of those who have temporary or permanent damage.  I accept the point about the principle versus the monetary compensation.  I have mentioned before that there should be some immediate response by way of acceptance that something went wrong and an attempt should be made to cross the bridge to the patient or other relatives by simply saying something went wrong and, without debate and without prejudice, some compensation should be made.  There would be then at least a recognition that the authorities admitted that something went wrong or at least acknowledged that something went wrong and, as a result, it might in some way assuage the hurt and trauma.  The trauma will stay forever and a day but the hurt at that particular moment can in some way be assuaged by the manner in which the patient and the patient's family is treated.</p></speech>

I am very conscious in responding on open disclosure of acknowledging the terrible tragedy of Margaret and Mark's personal stories.  It was actually that kind of tragedy that propelled us to begin our open disclosure project back in 2010.  Specifically, I address the Deputy's question about whether I think it should be compulsory or voluntary.  We take the view that it should be voluntary; we sometimes have in medical negligence matters.  We have found that where people are told they have to go into mediation, as has happened sometimes where mediation has been ordered, it has not been a satisfactory process.  One is compelling people to do something.  We think that at the heart of the patient-doctor relationship lies frankness and when things go wrong it should be acknowledged on a voluntary basis.  It creates a climate of much more openness and less box-ticking.  I agree with the Department about that.  It also creates a real conscientious engagement by practitioners and doctors with a process on a much more open basis.  That is certainly our view.</p></speech>

One cannot force someone to mediate because by its very nature mediation is voluntary.  I certainly would not support any forced mediation purely because it would just not work.  The question related to the actual disclosure itself.</p></speech>

I am not a legal person, but I have spoken to a few people and they say there will be very few courts which would make a decision simply on an apology.  It would not really have that great a significance, albeit it is part of it.  It may actually be to someone's credit.  The reason we are looking for statutory mandatory open disclosure is that we are not of the view that it will drive things underground.  We live in a law abiding society where people abide by the laws as best they can.  It is so important because we know from what is happening out there and from the various studies that they are the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p>  To try to answer Deputy Louise O'Reilly's question on accountability, it is true, as Mark is on record saying, that doctors, nurses, pharmacists, allied professions are all regulated.  If they do not perform at their best, they can be hauled before the regulator and may ultimately lose their incomes.  Within the hierarchy of the public service, there is not that accountability, but there should be.  We hear at times, as the Deputies know themselves when they have heard about the reconfiguration of health systems nationally, that some service may be closed.  However, we never see that resource actually moved to wherever it is supposed to go.  That is part of accountability and open disclosure, too.  It is not simply saying that it is the frontline staff who have to go and make that disclosure.  If resources are needed to make the system safer, as we know there are having heard about one hospital yesterday that needs more investment, that is not within the remit of the CEO, the national director or the director of the HSE.  It is up to the Government and the Department of Finance on behalf of society to make that investment.</p> <p>  We deal with about 500 cases per year and in the past 21 years that is a lot of people with whom we have had contact.  In a huge percentage of those cases, the people were not interested in litigation.  As Margaret and Mark said, they want to know what happened and why and an apology.  We say to people that they should go back to the hospital in a year's time and see what has been implemented from the study.  It is an aspect about which we do not often hear.  What has actually come out of that event?  I hope that has provided the committee with some insight.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.525" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016120800002#U01600"><p>I would like the committee members to put themselves in the shoes of someone who has experienced harm in health care and to ask what they would want for themselves.  Would they really want the physician and the organisation to have the option to speak honestly to them or would they want the assurance that the physician or the organisation must speak honestly to them?  If that is what the members would want for themselves, it is incumbent on them to make it possible for the rest of us.  That is my stake in the ground as it were.</p><p>Furthermore, mandatory open disclosure will actually support staff rather than cause them to go underground.  It will move the relevance of the training much higher on individuals' agendas and I imagine the uptake of training will increase.  Staff themselves will demand high-quality training because it needs to be in the contract.  This is part of how we do things in the health care system.</p><p> I mentioned Ms Linda Kenney and Dr. Rick van Pelt in the United States.  He was the anaesthesiologist who made the error.  This is all about people, specifically doctors who, having done harm, find themselves in vulnerable situations.  It must be one of the most horrific experiences to know one has contributed to the death of an individual.  The instinct is fight or flight, but we are better than the animals and we need to rise above that.  Dr. Rick van Pelt connected with a part of himself he did not know existed.  He so desperately wanted to speak to his patient.  He was told by insurers, the hospital and colleagues not to go there and that he did not know the can of worms he would open.  He went along with this advice for a while but eventually could not take it any longer and doctor and patient met.  It was a difficult meeting between the doctor and the woman he almost killed, but he said that on that day, with great relief, an 800 lb gorilla got off his back.  That is some image, to be toting around an 800 lb gorilla 24/7, and one can get shut of it by having a decent conversation with another human being.  The sky will not fall.  Together, Ms Linda Kenney and Dr. Rick van Pelt founded the organisation Medically Induced Trauma Support Services, MITSS, which supports patient, family and clinician when things go wrong.  Good things can, therefore, come out of such cases.  I have seen them present jointly at conferences and they are a wonder to behold.  To avoid the wriggle room and confusion, that must be how things are done here.  The members of the committee are the legislators.  We ask them to legislate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.528" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Molloy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016120800002#V00300"><p>Yes.  We live in a locality where there are many health care workers and front-line staff and we have found that most of them will tell us they would embrace open disclosure.  It would give them a safe environment to disclose.  Many staff will say a certain event happened not because of them but because of the environment in which they work.  However, they fear management and they fear recrimination if they tell, almost like whistleblowers, but if open disclosure is in place as the law for all people, it creates a safe environment.</p> <p>  We regularly hear that our doctors and nurses are going to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and America.  These are the hubs of open disclosure.  It is the law in the United Kingdom.  The NHS did not break down in 2014 when open disclosure became legal.  Doctors and nurses are still entering the NHS.  There is no fear on the part of medical staff and no desire to walk away from this.  It has been embraced, and this is the direction in which people are going.</p> <p>  I have a fear, which I have mentioned to the Department of Health, that health care workers of a lesser ability may decide to come to Ireland to work because in the United Kingdom one must own up to one's mistakes whereas in Ireland one does not have to do so.  Such workers may think they may sail under the radar for a while.  It is important to note that when the former Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, came to Portlaoise and spoke to families, the same names came up time and again.  These were not one-off incidents.  Had there been a legal duty of open disclosure, many of those repeat events may not have happened.</p> <p>  Regarding the accountability framework, the HSE is the biggest employer in the State, with 100,000 employees, and it does not have a mechanism to discipline its own staff.  It is crazy.  One staff member of &Aacute;ras Attracta served some time in prison but he is still employed by the HSE.  The HSE cannot discipline him under its own mechanisms.</p> <p>  Open disclosure comes to the fore in management.  Nurses and doctors can appear before their professional bodies but only where a complaint is made, and this is important.  We were told Mark's death was just one of those things and were told to go away.  Had we done so, nobody would have been put forward to face questions as to whether they were fit to practise.  We knew Mark died so we were able to follow up on the matter.  What about the people who do not know an adverse event has happened?  This regularly happens in the health service.  This is the near miss.  I work in construction.  I am a quantity surveyor.  Near misses are so important.  They prevent things happening time and again.  This is what needs to be reported on and this is why the accountability framework is so important.  When these near misses occur, there is a legal duty on people to report them.  We have a management investigation ongoing.  I have the HSE's open disclosure policy here with me.  Two of its signatories are people in front of whom R&oacute;is&iacute;n and I sat before we went to the media.  We appealed to them to do something about this.  We said it is going on in every regional hospital in the State.  They did nothing.  Subsequently, when HIQA investigated the matter, they tried to block the investigation, and the investigation which in turn arose from that is ongoing.  These are the signatories to the open disclosure document produced by the HSE.  This is the top-down management that will introduce this voluntary measure across the board with which people will comply, yet they do not comply with it themselves.  It must be on a statutory footing if it is to work.</p></speech>

I wish to start with Mr. Breen of the State Claims Agency.  He might indicate to us the change in the level of litigation in the past three or four years, in particular the figures paid out in 2014, 2015 and 2016.  What is his view in this regard for the next 12 months to two years?  My understanding from listening to Deputy Kelleher this morning is that the figure has almost doubled in the past two to three years.  Obviously, the system we have is not working.  Therefore, it is important we take on board the open disclosure being talked about to see whether we can have a better system put in place.</p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise concerns staffing levels in hospitals, especially where there is a whole changeover of medical staff.  With nursing staff, there is a little more permanency, but many general doctors, in particular in the past few years, have been hired as locums and agency staff.  I am concerned about the handover process within hospitals and whether we have a safe handover system.  According to Mr. Breen's information, what is the evidence that this is causing some of the problems whereby, for example, an agency doctor is on one site today and a totally different site tomorrow and, therefore, the patients cannot get an explanation and the consultant is left trying to put the pieces together?  From Mr. Breen's experience, has this been causing a problem?</p> <p>  Another issue is coming up which I have heard articulated by people who work in the hospital system.  Given that so many staff have left the Irish medical scene and gone to England, Australia, Canada and the United States, we are not necessarily getting the best staff in many areas.  The big challenge has been in maternity services.  A report in 2003 indicated that by 2012 we should have 180 maternity consultants.  Currently, I think we have about 130 whole-time equivalent consultants in maternity services.  This is the field which sees the highest level of litigation.  There does not appear to be an urgency on the part of the HSE and the Department to resolve this issue.</p> <p>  My final question is for Mr. McMahon.  He talked about 21 years' experience.  I know he is convinced this is the right way to go, but in that 21 years, has anything really changed or are we just getting more of the same?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016120800002#W00100"><p>I thank all of the delegates for their perspectives and being with us.  I feel the need for a virtual moment to honour the fact people have died and have had their lives hugely changed.  There are two parents here and there are so many others.  I know from my own work in the disability area that some people got there for these reasons.</p> <p>  Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen has a full understanding of the situation in which people find themselves.  That said, the presentation by the State Claims Agency stated, "While acting in the best interests of taxpayers..."  Taxpayers have a lot of skin in the game.  They keep the whole show on the road and they have been under a lot of pressure.  However, let us suppose the State Claims Agency's remit was to act, "in the best interests of the health and well-being of the people of Ireland".  While the agency does not get to decide what are its terms of reference, I believe that is a significantly different place to come from.  Mr. Breen might want to venture a comment on that.</p> <p>  Ms Murphy talked about the Canadian situation in recent years, the UK duty of candour and the Michigan experience.  To what extent have those changes, and others like them, in any way impacted on Ms Murphy coming to her view?  She also spoke about Dr. Rick van Pelt and his road to Damascus conversion, or at least it was not too different from it.  It strikes me as an irony that he and many others were, in a sense, compelled to keep their mouths shut, and they are being told by the current system that the thing to do is to keep schtum, yet the view of the State Claims Agency and others is to let this be voluntary.  Is there not a case to go down the road of a mandatory approach?  If the place goes to the dogs in terms of claims, the State is well able to shut the door quickly if it needs to.  Would that not be a better way to go at this time?  We wear seatbelts and we do not drink and drive because of penalty points, not because we woke up some morning and realised, "I could die if I do not wear a seatbelt" or, "I could kill someone".  It was that type of compulsion that led to people saying, "I should not even smoke in my own house, even though there is no law against it."  Is it not possible that compulsion is the thing to wake up us lazy people and make us ask why we were not doing what we should?</p> <p>  I thank the delegates for attending.</p></speech>

An extremely important part of what we do is to sit down and think what we have done this day, this week or this year.  There is a growing acceptance among the medical profession that, rather than being diminished or disempowered by this, it is actually fulfilling and empowering for the doctor to do it.  That is being carried out among all the medical professions, certainly in general practice.  I just wanted to make that comment.</p></speech>

Mr. Breen and I want to clarify that when we speak about our mandate being to act in the best interests of the taxpayer, that is very much the part of our job that focuses on an unjustly inflated claim that may be made by a patient's solicitor or, indeed, a patient's family's solicitor.  Where we come from in that regard is to deal with the quantification of claims and to ensure unjustly inflated claims are weeded out.</p></speech>

I accept what Ms Tarrant is saying.</p></speech>

As soon as the matter becomes clear to us that any substandard care has taken place, we have a policy of admitting liability early, where appropriate, and we make every effort to deal expeditiously with every meritorious claim that is brought to us.  Mr. Breen has addressed our view in regard to the mandatory or voluntary position.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-12-08a.536" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016120800002#W00600"><p>If I could come back to that point, it is not that we have any kind of ideological objection to a mandatory or voluntary approach.  It is a genuine feeling on our side, given we meet lots of participants in the health service such as junior hospital doctors, registrars, consultants, nurse practitioners and others.  The view generally is that there are times when one has to compel people in terms of behavioural models in regard to drink driving and so on.  It is different in the area of health, however, given the complexity that can attach to any particular case.  For an obstetric case involving the tragedy of a cerebral palsy baby, for example, because it is so complex, the idea of a mandatory approach would drive people in a certain way and mean they will be more protective, rather than more expressive of an open and frank environment.  That is our view based on-----</p></speech>

The Department has given evidence before the committee that it becomes something that requires to be done because it is mandated to be done, rather than something which should go to the absolute heart of the patient and health enterprise relationship.  There should always be a voluntariness about admitting wrong when there is wrong.  Our position consistently from the day we took over the clinical indemnity scheme has been that doctors or nurses should always admit when they are wrong and they should engage with the patient very frankly.  We have always taken that view.  There is nothing to be gained by our agency ever defending a case which is not defensible or where we are giving advice to people or having people who, as the Senator said, are compelled to keep their mouths shut.  On the contrary, we tell people they should talk frankly to patients, they should tell them when they are wrong and they should tell them about what they are going to do within the system to prevent a recurrence.  There would be nothing to be gained for us at the litigation end from defending something which is indefensible.  As Ms Tarrant said, we always try, at the earliest point in time, to admit liability in the litigation process, rather than defend and deny, which leads nowhere other than to more excessive costs.  I hope that addresses the point.</p></speech>

From my own experience, if the box had been ticked on the morning Mark died and somebody had held up his or her hands and told us why he had died, it would have saved us two, three or four years of absolute emotional torment in trying to find out why he had died.  R&oacute;is&iacute;n was also badly injured that morning and was lucky to pull through.  As we sit here today, we still do not know what happened to her.  The consultant will not tell us what happened to her and why she was injured.  I would take a box ticking exercise at any stage over the torment of trying to find out.</p></speech>

The reality is that there is a very high level of overprotection.  People are very careful about what they disclose.  I cannot see it getting any worse; it is bad enough as it is.</p> <p>  It was absolutely wonderful to hear the Chairman describe what he and his colleague had in place.  As a family, we have seen the dark side of health care, but we have also seen its bright side.  Currently, our family are enjoying very good care from particular individuals in the health care system and it is right that I acknowledge it.  I  become very uncomfortable when I hear about the complexity of health care, that it is something special and different and that situations need to be handled differently from how they are handled in other industries.  Open disclosure underpinned by legislation would be a comfort to health care professionals who want to disclose.  They are doing it within the confines of the law and it would be a very real comfort to them.  It would also be a great example for others.  </p> <p>  Dr. Albert Wu talks about the golden moment, which he says is in the days and weeks immediately following an adverse event.  He acknowledges all of the reasons Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen mentioned people do not disclose or have an aversion to disclosing because they are very real concerns for individuals.  Mandatory open disclosure will drive the training and supports that will be necessary to allow people to engage in it.  It will help them to do it even better than the training provided.  It will become the way things are done.  It will be a big task and it will not be easy.  A job of work will have to be done.  It is not just about writing a few lines in a statute.  I am totally convinced that it will be a wonderful job of work that will benefit patients, families, clinicians and the health care system as a whole.  We are wonderful at writing policies and I see policies from all over the world.  Ours are up there with the best of them, but we are absolutely rubbish at implementation.</p></speech>

Before we set out the project at the beginning in 2010, we carried out a great deal of research into how we could roll out our project.  Having said that, when we rolled it out, we did not come to any conclusion until we got to the end of it and re-evaluated what it had achieved and what we thought the future might look like.  We looked at all of the international comparators and the experience in other places and came to a view on the matter.  I fully understand Ms Murphy&rsquo;s position.  I have a great deal of empathy for it and can understand that sometimes human behaviour has to be sanctions-led and mandated.  We all understand this in terms of behavioural models.  We took an overall view.  I do not think there is a huge difference between us.  If the Oireachtas was to decide this would be mandatory, those of us in the system who are dealing with it at our end and at the practitioner end would obviously get on with it.</p></speech>

I will say two things about this.  In terms of international comparisons, because it has only been in place since 2002, our scheme is regarded actuarially as immature.  It was always going to develop along a certain trajectory which is very much within our actuarial estimations.  Having said that, there are a number of complications which arise largely from the fact that in the Gill Russell case the Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court's decision on reducing the discount rate, the rate used in calculating special damages related to the cost of future care and so on.  It grossly increased the value of awards in catastrophic injury cases, in particular.</p> <p>  We have a system which we have tried to operate for families in which we operate what we call periodic payment orders.  They are not underpinned by legislation.  We wanted to give families certainty that they would receive the exact amount and that they would never have to worry about the risk of investment and so on.  We did this on an interim basis in the hope periodic payment order legislation would eventually come through.  I understand it will come through in the next while.  We were settling cases on the basis of interim payments.  They returned to court every two, three or five years, depending on the system we were operating.  Unfortunately, what has happened is that, understandably, in very many cases, parents and families have run out of patience with the system.  They do not like coming back to court on return dates.  They do not like the fact that their children have to be re-examined.  We understand this and sympathise with them.  In many cases, people have opted for a lump sum rather than continuing periodic payments, but this complicates litigation costs.  To give the committee an idea, this year we expect to spend somewhere in the region of &euro;220 million on the clinical indemnity scheme.  Next year we think that figure will jump sharply and probably exceed &euro;300 million.  There are certain volatilities and assumptions in our actuarial model about this.  The ingredients are whether we will have the pre-action protocols and the periodic payment order legislation in place.  If they were to be put in place, it would have a dramatic effect on how we might reduce the cost.</p></speech>

The reason is that in very many cases, when one looks at liability and causation, one will find that there is a complex set of factors feeding into it.  The Senator will not be surprised by this.  We do not look at what an individual doctor does.  We look broadly at how and why an event happened.  Afterwards our risk management team tries to apply the lessons learned with the hospitals.</p><p>I have no doubt, however, that the resource issues which are recognised are contributing somewhat.  One sees it mostly, for example, in emergency departments and such areas.</p></speech>

I advise members that following a decision yesterday in the committee, we will take the Courts Bill 2016 and the first three sections will be removed.  This committee must physically do that.  It is not something that can be done in advance.  Deputies Seamus Healy, Jim O'Callaghan, Catherine Murphy, R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, Richard Boyd Barrett, Br&iacute;d Smith and Gino Kenny have tabled four amendments in the first section.  The Deputies can press those amendments if they choose but knowing that when I put the proposition on the section, that the section will fall.  The Deputies can advise the Chairman that they are withdrawing the amendment.  The option is entirely the Deputies', I am in their hands.  I advise that this is the mechanism by which we can proceed with section 4 and the rest of the Bill as it presents.  I am in the hands of the Deputies when it comes to it.  Deputy Healy has amendment No. 1 and he has the choice to have his amendment addressed or he can withdraw it.  This is informal advice as the situation is unusual.  I am only advising members as I would have appreciated as a member of the committee myself in the past.  I am indicating that Deputies have the option to withdraw their amendments when I ask if the section stands part of the Bill as it will be lost.  That will apply also to sections 2 and 3.  Is this helpful and are there any questions in that regard?  We are okay.</p> <p>  I advise that all mobile phones should be switched off as, even in silent mode, they cause interference with the recording equipment in the D&aacute;il Chamber.

D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann formally declares that a housing emergency exists in the State and while this emergency continues the right of any person to remain in the dwelling in which the person currently resides will take precedence over any property right of any other person&mdash;<blockquote>(a) accordingly no court or other authority shall order the removal of the current occupant of a dwelling, or by its decisions enable such removal notwithstanding the provisions of any Act currently in force including the provisions of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013,<br /><br />(b) the housing emergency declared in this section can only be terminated by a vote of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, and the Government including any Minister of the Government are precluded from annulling the housing emergency without approval in such a vote,<br /><br />(c) in view of the Housing Emergency declared here, the power of any Minister of Government to raise the market value threshold of &euro;75,000 for single or multiple dwellings for consideration of possession of dwellings cases by the Circuit Court by activating or commencing sections of existing Acts without approval by a vote of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, is cancelled.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote> <p>I wish to press this amendment.  I understand that the first three sections are to be deleted, but this amendment is an addendum, or addition, and it is not at all related to the Hogan judgment, which has no bearing on this amendment by way of addendum.  It is a significant amendment and in my view it is important.  It is the cornerstone of any proper procedure to address the housing emergency we have in the State now.</p></speech>

I can only indicate to the Deputy that there is an expectation, and anticipation, that section 2 will not stand part of the Bill.  That is unusual but I must say it because it has already been addressed by the committee members.  I am advising the Deputy that he will embark upon an exercise at the end of which he will find that section 2 will not continue.  This is the agreement, as already stated, of members of the committee and the Minister.</p></speech>

I understand the reservations and hesitation of the committee on sections 1 to 3, inclusive.  I thanked Deputy Jim O'Callaghan for raising the matter last week.  It means that those sections are no longer part of the Bill.  I regret the omission.  Having said that, I thank the committee for its readiness to proceed with the remaining sections dealing with the Office of the Taxing Master.  It is important that members like Deputy Jim O'Callaghan raise issues of concern.  I did it for many years from the Opposition side.  It is important that members feel free to do so and raise matters of concern as this is where we discuss them.  I am happy to proceed with the remaining sections and hope we can get through the Bill before the time elapses.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 8 provides for the procedures for the completion or carryover of any work in hand in the Office of the Taxing Master.  Amendment No. 9 provides for the consequential changes that need to be made to the Long Title of the Bill to include these provisions.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are being made in support of the smooth and orderly transition of the Office of the Taxing Master to that of a new legal costs adjudicator under the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, including the completion of any case in hand that has already been referred for taxation and where the initial Taxing Master is no longer available.  The Office of the Taxing Master will become the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator once the relevant provisions of Part 10 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 are commenced.  The commencement of this major undertaking and the coming on stream of the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator are anticipated to take place early in the new year.  Members will recall that the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator will be bolstered in its legal costs adjudications by a set of legal cost principles contained in Schedule 1 to the 2015 Act.  It will have modern strategic and business management structures and maintain a register of its legal cost determinations which will be accessible by the public.  These structural reforms will complement the wider legal cost transparency measures in the 2015 Act.  It should also be noted that the title of the new office moves away from the use of the term &quot;taxation&quot; which was confusing for the general public which would more usually associate it with the work of the Revenue Commissioners but which bears no relation to it.  </p><p>The legal services regulation rules were originally published in the autumn of 2011 and it was anticipated that the legal costs and other provisions would be enacted within a period of two years from that date.</p><p>However, the enactment of the Legal Services Regulation Bill did not take place until December 2015, with the competing legislative priorities of the troika programme and a change of Government in between.  It is now going to be the case, therefore, that the terms of office of existing Taxing Masters will have expired before the changeover to the new legal costs adjudicators under the Legal Services Regulation Act will have taken place.  Amendment No. 7 provides a practical means of managing and bridging this emerging gap.</p><p> At present, paragraph 18(6) of the Eighth Schedule to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, as amended, provides that a person appointed to the office of Taxing Master shall not be eligible for re-appointment or to have the term of appointment extended.  Amendment No. 7 proposes to overcome this prohibition.  It does this by seeking to allow for extension of the term of appointment concerned up to a maximum of three years - this is now to be found in the proposed new paragraph 18 (7) of the Eighth Schedule.  For the reasons I have outlined, the extension of the period of appointment of a Taxing Master is now considered a crucial option to have for the orderly and effective transition of the Office of the Taxing Master to that of the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators.  It will allow for the retention of critical working capacity and management expertise as may be considered appropriate to lead and drive this complex process.  It will also enable the necessary steps to be taken for any existing workload of taxation cases to be brought to completion.  Due to the automatic expiry of the existing term of office of a Taxing Master under current law this capacity and expertise will otherwise start to become unavailable in the coming weeks.</p><p> The proposed three year period of extension will also allow for the operation, as may be considered appropriate, of the transitional provisions of section 164 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  This section provides for the designation by the Minister for Justice and Equality of a person who is serving as a Taxing Master to perform the functions of the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator or of a legal costs adjudicator in what will be the newly established Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicators.  This designation will be effective for the remainder of the relevant term of office as a Taxing Master.  The additional paragraphs 18(8) and (9) for the Eighth Schedule under amendment No. 7 provide that the new power to extend the term of office under paragraph 18(7) may, in the strict circumstances prescribed, be exercised after the term of office has expired and that such a post-expiry determination shall have retrospective effect.  Provision is being made for such a contingency to enable extension of a term of office to take place notwithstanding the date on which this Bill may be enacted.</p><p> Amendment No. 8 proposes to change the Eighth Schedule to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 by the insertion of a new paragraph 18A.  The new paragraph deals with a variety of working options to be applied in completing the functions of a Taxing Master which may not have been fully performed on the occasion of his or her vacating office.  This amendment is considered necessary to allow for the completion of matters referred for taxation which may be in train at the time a Taxing Master vacates his or her office.  This is intended to provide the maximum degree of clarity regarding the procedural requirements arising from the completion of a particular matter by a Taxing Master who is not the Taxing Master to whom the matter was originally assigned and where the initial Taxing Master is no longer available.</p><p> The new paragraph 18A contains six subparagraphs.  Subparagraph (1) deals with interpretation matters relating to the paragraph as a whole.  Subparagraph (2) provides, in general terms, that another Taxing Master may perform functions relating to a particular matter which had been assigned to an initial Taxing Master who is not available to perform those functions.  Subparagraph (3) provides that the alternative Taxing Master shall conduct a complete re-hearing of a matter on which an initial Taxing Master had commenced but not completed a hearing.  However, it should also be noted that it is also open to the parties concerned to consent in such instances to the first hearing being resumed.  Subparagraph (4) provides, in general terms, for the exercise by the alternative Taxing Master of the jurisdiction and powers initially conferred where the initial Taxing Master is no longer available.  Subparagraph (5) provides that the Taxing Master who has been duly designated by the Government to be responsible for the management of the Office of the Taxing Master shall have the power to determine any question regarding the application of these bridging provisions to a particular matter and, in consequence of any such determination, to give directions.  Subparagraph (6) provides that the new paragraph 18A is without prejudice to the general law but that a particular procedure set out in the paragraph shall prevail.</p><p> Amendment No. 11 is a technical amendment proposed by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It is somewhat self explanatory in that it proposes the amendment of the long Title of the Bill.  The proposed amendment to the long Title is to add the necessary element that the Eighth Schedule to the Act of 1961 and section 139(2) of the Act of 2015 are also to be amended by this Bill.</p><p> There is also the additional amendment proposing to delete the words "and, in particular," up to "Valuation Act 2001", as suggested earlier.</p></speech>

It is amending certain enactments concerning the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court.  If one looks at the contents of the Bill, sections 4 to 9, inclusive, which we have put in, are all amendments.  Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, have been deleted or have fallen.  As a result, I suggest that while I agree with the deletion proposed by the Minister of State I would also include the first two lines so that it would read, "An Act", and I would then take out "to make provision in relation to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court", and what the Minister of State has suggested, so that the new Title would be: "An Act to amend certain enactments concerning the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court ... ", and leave the rest of it as is.  Obviously, the Minister may want to include something about the amendment to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961 and the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, if he wants to.</p></speech>
