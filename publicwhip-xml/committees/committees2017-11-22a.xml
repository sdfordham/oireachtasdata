I welcome Ms O'Sullivan and her colleagues.  She submitted the petition in her own name but in so doing was assisted by three of her fellow students, Ms Adrianne Ward, Ms Ellen McKimm and Ms Faye Dolan who have accompanied her to present it.  We are delighted to have them before the committee.  This is a significant day for them as secondary school students in appearing before a parliamentary committee, as it is for members.  They are the first petitioners to be invited to appear before the committee since it was established in July 2016.  It is, therefore, a momentous occasion for those on both sides of the equation.  We compliment them on taking the initiative and, as third year secondary school students, participating in the petitions process.  They have submitted a petition on an issue about which they all feel passionately.  It took great strength of character to have the confidence to engage in the petitions process.  As Chairman of the committee, I want to see more engagement of this nature.  The committee is absolutely delighted that we have four formidable young people who are blazing a trail and setting the benchmark.  We also welcome their parents and members of the school community who are in the Visitors Gallery.  I am sure they are all extremely proud in seeing four formidable young women presenting before a parliamentary committee.</p><p>Before I invite Ms O'Sullivan to make her submission, I wish to update her on a few developments.  The committee deliberated once again on the petition in private session and agreed to further actions in it progression.  It has agreed to forward to her a copy of the latest response received from the Department of Education and Skills.  We will seek submissions from the Irish Second Level Students Union and the Teaching Council of Ireland on their views on the duration of the English junior certificate examination and the importance of holding mock examinations.  We will invite the State Examination Commission to appear once again before the committee in early 2018 - because of the nature of the work programme, it will not happen before then - to provide an update on the progress made in its engagement with stakeholders and their feedback on the service it provides.</p><p>Ms O'Sullivan made a pertinent and appropriate point about the use of plain English.  It was well made.  The committee is acutely conscious of it and will have further discussions on how we can work through the issues involved.  It is important that those who petition Parliament do not face impenetrable language.  The language used has to be as accessible as possible to all people, regardless of who they are.  The point was well made and we are working on the issue.  I ask Ms O'Sullivan to address the petition and take at face value that we are working through the plain English element.  In advance of her commencing her presentation, in accordance with procedure - this is where the language used gets at little legalistic - it is important that I read the note on privilege which is part of our protocols in Parliament.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  A copy of the petition has been circulated to them.  </p><p>Without further ado, I invite Ms O'Sullivan to make her submission.</p></speech>

I am 15 years old, as I was in March last when I started this petition.  I am from Glasnevin, Dublin and I attend Loreto College, St. Stephen's Green.  I am accompanied today by Ms Ellen McKimm, Ms Faye Dolan and Ms Adrianne Ward.  We are the main drivers of this petition but our English teacher, Ms Courtney, and the entire English class were on board with it from the beginning.  This was not specifically intended to be a Loreto College petition but the core values that our school and headmistress, Ms Dempsey, promote are closely tied to social justice which is very relevant to a process such as this.</p> <p>  As it is a long time since members did their intermediate or junior certification examination, I would like to explain some context.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara O'Sullivan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017112200002#C00300"><p>Prior to this year, the English junior certification examination consisted of two papers, each of which was two and a half hours long.  These papers had a clear structure for which students could prepare.  Unfortunately, modern examination style requires a certain level of technique in that students need to know how they are going to respond to questions.  Previously, students knew the marking schemes, had the ability to look at past papers and had teachers who understood what the examiners were looking for.  For June 2017, a new examination system was introduced.  The only change this year was in respect of English.  There was supposed to be a number of assessments during the year and a portfolio but that did not work out as planned.  We have been hearing about a new examination since I was in fourth class in primary school, almost five years ago.  Last year, the State Examinations Commission, SEC, released some sample papers.  We welcomed these sample papers with open arms as they were supposed to clarify everything.  However, they brought more confusion.  There was no consistent structure, no consistent marking scheme and it was clear from the very beginning that there was not enough time to fill the booklet provided to the best of our ability.</p> <p>  I will explain further.  These sample papers were supposed to help us prepare for our mocks.  The first sample paper had three sections, the second had two and the third had four.  Within these sections, the questions followed no clear order and they seemed to ramble on in varying lengths with different marking values.  When I learned that we were to do this English paper in two hours, I was shocked.  Without any consistency, working out how much time to spend on each question was practically a guessing game.  I know several students who brought calculators to their English examination.  There was no way for students who cannot write at a phenomenal speed to plan beforehand.  When we did the mock examination, the papers were different again from the sample papers.  This is when I started seriously thinking about the petition.  I was not the only one feeling stressed about the exam.  Like me, nobody could believe the number of questions they were supposed to answer in such a short time.  It was like a competition to see how fast one could write instead of an actual test of one's knowledge and ability.  Those who managed to finish the paper did not have any time to read over it.  For students to have the opportunity to express their thoughts and analysis as eloquently as expected, I truly believe more time is necessary.  Trying to squeeze three years of learning into a two-hour examination for a subject like English seems ridiculous.  Furthermore, this dramatic decrease in time only serves to widen the gap between the junior and leaving certificate cycles, when we will be back to two long exams of more than six hours in total.  </p> <p>  One key element of the new junior cycle is to carefully plan, draft and redraft everything we write.  This new English examination directly contradicts this philosophy.  None of it makes sense.  One Friday night, I set up the petition from home.  In less than a day it had 3,000 signatories and currently it has over 12,000.  These supporters are from all across the county and include parents, teachers and students.  Many of them have left comments agreeing that there just was not enough time.  Many have talked about the stress students are under already being in an examination year and how this added to it.  This showed how social media can really give young people power.  The petition got its fuel from being shared on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat.  It also shows the level of pressure these examinations put on young people at one of the most stressful times of their lives, their first ever State examination, as English is the first State examination the majority of students in this country undertake.  While we were stating clearly that this was an issue, who was listening?  I started making phone calls only to be directed from one place to another.  The Department of Education and Skills said this was a matter for the State Examinations Commission and the State Examinations Commission said only the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Department of Education and Skills could change things.  The State Examinations Commission also said it was not responsible for the quality of the mock examinations papers, which left me wondering who was.  While the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was very helpful, it is not responsible for examinations.  No Government organisation seemed to be taking responsibility for the mock examinations.</p> <p>  To be honest, I felt like little serious consideration was being given to the request to add time or change the examination in any way.  However, I later learned from this committee that there may have been changes.  Despite what I was led to believe at the time, the examination had not been finalised.  In addition, while we had studied two novels, which are a huge part of the course, neither came up on the day.  I know that in the future, other subject examinations will be changed and that it will be difficult for the Department to get every examination right.  However, if it is not listening to the experience and concerns of students and teachers, then creating a fair means of assessment becomes even more difficult.  </p> <p>  I still feel that the situation with mock examinations is a major issue.  The objective of the mock examinations is to make life less stressful for students by giving them an idea of what is to come.  It is widely accepted, and proven by the geographical spread of responders to the petition, that the majority of secondary schools in Ireland undergo mock examinations of some form.  The schools either buy their mock papers from commercial companies or have teachers in the school draft them.  With new examinations, this current system will become even more ineffective.  As mentioned previously in respect of the English paper, only a few samples were made by the SEC with little to no pattern and no marking scheme.  Both teachers and private companies were therefore unable to make mock papers that were reflective of the examination in June.  If the mocks are set on the basis of inconsistent papers they will not fulfil their purpose, rather they will do the opposite and create more stress.  Unless something is done this will continue to be the case for junior and leaving certificate examinations.  The State needs to introduce guidelines for situations like this as otherwise, this will become a bigger issue in the coming years as all subjects in the junior certificate cycle will potentially change.  We do not know if that is the case.  It was especially important for this year's students to be prepared for English as it was their first ever State examination.  However, many students entered the exam centre very stressed and feeling unprepared as they were expecting a very difficult paper.  With a mock paper that stretched over 25 pages it was nearly impossible to finish in the allocated time.</p> <p>  I hope that this situation is being reviewed in terms of the actual examinations and the mocks for all subjects.  This Joint Committee on Public Petitions is an excellent initiative.  As mentioned earlier, I had hoped to discuss the issue of plain English but I understand that the committee is dealing with that issue, which is amazing.  As a democratic society that needs its people to be able to think and vote for themselves I believe disregarding the opinions of its youth, particularly in respect of education, is a terrible mistake.  As a future young voter, I am disappointed by how little effect the dissatisfaction of students, parents and teachers nationwide had on the decisions made by the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and within D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is great that these changes will be made but our examination took place last June.  I understand that is hard for these things to happen quickly and while we care about future students, we regret the changes were not in effect when our examination took place in June.  I am glad this petition is before the committee, even though it is after our examinations, as I hope it will improve matters for future students.  I again thank the committee for inviting us here today and for giving us the opportunity to voice our concerns.  As mentioned previously, Ellen, Adrianne, Faye and I are happy to answer questions. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1282" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017112200002#C00500"><p>I welcome Ms O'Sullivan and her colleagues.  Without sounding too patronising, I compliment them on taking this initiative, which I am sure has taken up a lot of their time and energy.  This is my first experience in my seven years as a parliamentarian to engage with people who are below the voting age, the issue of whether 16 year olds should have the right to vote being another area of discussion.  There are two separate elements to today's presentation and petition, namely, the extension of time for the examination and the pre-examination or mock examination process.  Ms O'Sullivan is correct that it has been a number of years since some members sat their intermediate or junior certificate examinations - Deputy Cassells was particularly upset in this regard.  In may case, it was the intermediate certificate examination.  I have three daughters who in the past five years have done between them three junior certificate examinations and two leaving certificate examinations.  The pre-junior certificate examinations are the preparation for the junior certificate examination and the junior certificate and pre-leaving certificate examinations are preparation for the leaving certificate examinations.  </p> <p>  I have always been struck by the fact that the State plays a very small role in the mock examinations process and that preparation and marking of these papers is paid for by the schools and parents, respectively.  I accept Ms O'Sullivan's point that the new curriculum made the mock examinations very difficult for her but does she accept that next year's junior certificate students will at least have the benefit of this year's junior certification examination papers?  Does she still believe schools can organise mock or pre-examinations or does she believe the Department should have a role because it did not have a role in the past?</p><p>I believe it does need a role because in terms of the nature of this examination, it has not provided a structure or a marking scheme so no matter how many years pass, it will still be a surprise because examinations such as history and geography have a very clear number of sections and structures and it is beneficial to practice with past papers but from now on it will no longer be beneficial because there is no set structure or consistency.  As I mentioned, with the sample papers, our examination had four sections but one of the sample papers had two, another had three and another had four so the idea of more past papers will not be very beneficial, and I believe that guidelines need to be introduced.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1282" speakername="Dara Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017112200002#D00300"><p>The only comment I would add is that guidelines would be fine but, to date, the Department has kept a fairly distant approach to letting schools organise their own preparation examinations.  There is an element of self-policing in terms of trying to give some guidance.  I certainly believe the marking structure should be based on the marking structure of what we know of the examinations.  We have all seen the preparation of pre-papers and the booklets that are provided on a commercial basis for pre-examinations but if I was to give advice on manoeuvring through the Departments we have here, I would suggest it might be a welcome development to separate the two "asks" and look in a focused way for the extension of time.  The witness makes a strong point that to have two long papers for the leaving certificate and one shorter paper for the junior certificate is a big difference.  Watching my children doing examinations I see that there are two very different elements to English.  There is the literary side - poetry, prose and plays - and the linguistic element.  My own sense, and we must sometimes defer to the greater knowledge in the Department, is that the witnesses make a strong case for an extra 30 minutes and it might be good to focus on that "ask".  That is just one person's point of view.</p> <p>  I compliment Ms O'Sullivan on her response to my question.  She has a clear understanding and focus.  We do listen to the experts, the teachers, the parents and the civil servants but we should not forget that the witnesses are the people who have to sit down, take out the pen and start answering these questions.  I hope future generations will benefit from the work they have done.</p></speech>

When going into many other examinations such as my home economics examination I knew I had a section for short questions, a section for long questions and I had my time allocated beforehand, but going into my English junior certificate examination and my mock examination I had no idea how many sections there would be or how to allocate my time.  As Ms O'Sullivan said in her contribution, I had to bring a calculator into my English examination and it was a strange way of multiplying the marks to work out the time, which took away even more time.  Essentially, we want the extra time but we also believe the structure needs to be clarified because it leads to a very stressful situation that all students are facing nationwide going into these examinations, which has what we see as an easy fix.  They manage to clarify the structure for all the other examinations so we do not understand why they cannot clarify it for English.</p></speech>

In Ireland we need one, which is an amazing facility that not many people know about.  It suits Ireland very well in that we have such a small population but it is amazing that we are able to give such a direct input.  Voting is amazing and it has all these knock-on effects but sometimes it is difficult, especially for young people, to see the direct effect of voting for a certain person and how that plays out.  However, a petition is very specific and we were able to ask for help on an issue that directly affected us.</p></speech>

We did not believe it was a fair assessment in that it did not assess all areas of the English curriculum and it was very much a case of thinking while writing.  We did not have time to formulate a view or an opinion.  We had to pick up the pen and write.  Otherwise, we would not finish the paper.  It needs to be more of an examination, particularly in a subject like English where one can make one's point well and have time to think through one's answers.  We would have benefited from the extra 30 minutes because I know some people did not finish the examination in June.</p></speech>

I want to congratulate them on their petition and the support they got.  As they said, they only needed one signature but they managed to get 12,000 supporters.  That told us as a committee and as Members of the Oireachtas that this is a live issue with regard to what they brought to our attention and perhaps highlighted a disconnect between those who are setting examinations and people like the witnesses who have to sit them.  I was looking at the governance structure of the State Examinations Commission and there are no representatives such as the witnesses on its board.  That might be something we could look into.

It is vitally important to the English curriculum that students have a wide knowledge of English as a subject so the additional 30 minutes and a clearer structure should be hugely beneficial to teachers and students.

The witnesses' opening statement said that one of the key elements of the new junior cycle is that students carefully plan, draft and redraft everything they write but that the new English exam directly contradicts that philosophy.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that and explain what they mean.</p></speech>

I cannot remember all the specifics steps listed but it started with planning and then a first and second draft.  There were approximately seven steps in total, ending with publication.  One was to rewrite.  It was all about taking time, redoing and fixing work but one does not have time to redraft anything during the two-hour exam.  I am a relatively fast writer and did not stop writing during my English exam.  If I did not have an idea right there and then, I moved on because there was not enough time for reflection.  Two hours is insufficient for an exam on a subject such as English that fundamentally takes a large amount of time.  We have been given several months to prepare for our presentation to the committee because we understand that in the real world it is important to come across in a certain way and have control over that but during the English exam students have to rush to get all of their answers written down.  That contradicts not only what we are taught about the junior cycle, but also life in the real world at work and in college.</p></speech>

However, at the time of submitting the petition we felt that the State Examinations Commission was unlikely to change the entire paper because we compiled the petition in March and the exam was due to take place in June.  We felt that extending the exam time might provide a solution through making the effects of such an exam less severe.  Adding time would make it less difficult to deal with not having structure or a marking scheme.  If 30 minutes were added, I am unsure we would be totally satisfied but it would greatly improve the situation.</p></speech>

I compliment them on their very well-formulated submission.  They are here to discuss and argue their case.  We have met with the Department and the State Examinations Board to tease out the proposals.  The nature of the debate has evolved.  When we received the petition, it dealt primarily with the time aspect but the witnesses have also focused on the structures.  I wholeheartedly agree with them that it is very important for a student to have a structure when approaching an exam, and that is particularly so for the English paper.  In my day, there was a very structured paper containing a creative writing section in paper one and questions on poetry and the remainder of the syllabus on paper two.  A student knew he or she would have to hit certain time limits when compiling his or her thoughts.  Deputy Dara Murphy asked a question regarding whether guidelines would be adequate and the witnesses seemed to suggest they would not.  Does the entire paper have to be rethought?</p></speech>

I am glad the disclosures are being continued.  The witnesses have approached the issue on the basis of an extension of the exam time and we will remain on that point for the moment.  Ms McKimm said it was a race against the clock.  We probed representatives of the Department on that issue.  The witnesses said in their opening statement that they were disappointed with the time allocation.  The representatives of the Department were very adamant that the time aspect should be maintained and they set out a rationale for that which I want to explore with the witnesses.  We were all students at one stage.  I remember time pressures not only in the English exam, but also in history, in which one had to answer five essay-style questions for the leaving certificate and one would get to question three and realise one would have to go hell for leather to complete the final two.  I could never understand that.  The representatives of the Department said the whole point of the exam is to elicit what it can from students in a very constrained period.  The intention is not to let a student write flowing pieces<i>ad infinitum</i>but, rather, to test them under constraints.  Deputy Ryan raised the issue of the philosophy of the exam.  I would like to hear the arguments, perhaps those of Ms Dolan who has not yet had an opportunity to speak, on whether there is merit in the Department saying that it wants to test students under very tight time constraints, which I acknowledge many people feel is unfair.</p></speech>

Both individually are potentially a sound ethos for an exam but the Department is trying to implement the two if that was its rationale for creating a shorter exam.</p></speech>

The Department had been under pressure to say it did not want the exam to be a pressure cooker situation for young students and that it wanted to elicit creativity.   If it had maintained the time limit, students might have the opportunity to realise that ambition.   The committee could revert to the Department on that point.</p></speech>

I was in the Seanad.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  As a former schoolteacher who was part of a group that tried to bring changes to the applied leaving certificate for young people who struggled with the mainstream leaving certificate and give them the option to stay in school, I commend the witnesses on being so proactive.</p> <p>  I did my leaving certificate in 1984, which is a long time ago, and the issue of stress was as relevant then as it is now.</p><p>I apologise if I missed this in the question and answer session.  How could we help them as students to not feel as stressed?  Obviously, one must have an examination of some description.  As a school teacher, one must be able to grade and judge work and allow students to show their full potential.  I am a great believer in Laszlo - one starts at the bottom and one gets to the top, and one reaches one's potential.  One should be able to do that.  On the issue of stress, how can we de-stress students?</p><p> Social media was mentioned in the presentation and the word "fuel" used in terms of social media.  I have a different word for social media.  Although it is a different topic, I would love to hear their views on how we can ensure people remain safe and secure on social media but that is another day's work.</p><p> On the mock examinations, the petitioners raised a good point in their presentation.  In my time as a school teacher, there was no consistency in the mock examination in terms of the quality of the paper, the format and the type of questioning, which in some cases, as was stated, bore no relationship at all to the leaving certificate or junior certificate examination.  There is merit in the point, although I do not know how we will do this.  Deputy Shane Cassells spoke about the Department of Education and Skills examinations commission.  Maybe we could look at how we could ensure a quality mock examination.  For those who do not know what is meant by mock examinations, I refer to pre-examinations.</p><p> Of course, there is the other linked issue of correcting.  In some schools, the teachers themselves do the correcting.  In others, it goes outside.  Do the petitioners have a view on that.</p><p> My final point is on the new junior certificate reform.  I note there are different views on that.  As a school teacher and somebody who spent a number of years in college and only had an end-of-term examination, I have come over to the view of there being continual assessment, project work and perhaps an essay as part of the examination process rather than the two-and-a-half hour end of term examination.</p><p> I am disappointed the petitioners did not get the response they were looking for to some of the questions from the different groups.  The committee might re-engage with the Department or the State Examinations Commission.</p><p> I thank the petitioners for being here.  It is great that they have the confidence and bravery to initiate a petition and to come in and make a presentation.  Apologies for being late.</p></speech>

The line committee, the committee that would have competence in relation to content, etc., would be the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  We are currently engaged with that committee on some of the issues highlighted.</p><p>One of the points that threw itself up in lights for me was the issue of how the content within the Civic, Social and Political Education, CSPE, subject relates to the role of the Joint Committee on Public Petitions of Parliament.  That is a major takeaway for me.</p><p>The petition remains open.  We will take on board some of the points the petitioners have made here today.  We will engage further with the stakeholders involved.  If the final outcome of this is that there is no change or the <i>status quo</i>remains, what is most important, both for me and for the members, is that the petitioners are here before an Oireachtas committee, they have taken the time to put forward a petition and they have impressed us with their depth of knowledge in terms of answers that they have given to questions.  In the first instance, any of their cohort who are looking at this, anybody throughout the country, any teacher worth his or her salt, will use this segment of their submission as a teaching tool to educate their fellow students about what they, too, can do on issues of public concern and they now have the ability to come forward and make submissions to a petitions committee.</p><p>If they do not get the desired outcome, I would say: &quot;That's life.&quot;  One will accept the results, one way or the other.  It may go your way and it may not.  However, the fact that they have been here before us today is as, if not even more, important because it clearly signals to us that there are excellent young people out there.  Like Deputy Dara Murphy, I do not want to patronise the petitioners in any way but I am not sure whether I would have had the confidence when I was going through my junior certificate if somebody had invited me in to the petitions committee or any committee of the D&aacute;il to make a submission.  I am here as a Member of the House but on a personal level, I do not think I would have had the confidence to do what they have done.</p><p>We are very grateful to the petitioners for coming before the committee today.  If I may say, the Loreto ethos, with which I have personal interaction in my own part of the world, is alive and well.  The petitioners are fine examples, not only of that ethos but of the best what we have to offer, and what the future holds.  If four articulate students such as these can come before us and hold themselves with dignity in front of an Oireachtas committee, they are up there with the best of them.  I thank them very much for being here.</p><p>We wish the petitioners well in their continuing studies.  I hope that everything went or will go well for them, in terms of the junior certification examinations.  I am hoping that in life everything will go well for them because they have been a fine example of the best that we have to offer in this country, and I mean that sincerely.</p><p>I will adjourn the meeting now.  We will make refreshments available to the petitioners afterwards.  We have a little pack to give them as well, just as a little gift.  We hope that there are hundreds, and possibly, of students who will look at this.  We hope that teachers will look at this and use it in the best possible way as an example of what the Committee on Public Petitions is available to do for people.  I thank our guests for being here.  We are delighted to have them.</p></speech>

The draft minutes of our meetings of 15 November have been circulated.  Are there any matters arising?  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We have received six items of correspondence, all of which are noted.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Arising from the correspondence received, Dr. Abigail Aiken has submitted a clarification on the research data in the presentation she made to the committee.  I intend to read the clarification into the record at the conclusion of our public business today.  I am conscious that we are under time pressure given that members want to deal with issues relating to bias on the part of the committee.  I suggest we defer the second issue arising - proposed witness for module 3 - until after our public session in the interests of our witnesses today, one of whom can only be with us for a short time as she has a plane to catch.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

We agreed at last week's meeting to review our proceedings as claims are circulating within the committee and outside.  Deputies Anne Rabbitte and Catherine Murphy raised the issue and the latter suggested we have this discussion.  The committee agreed.  I intend that this be kept to as short a time as possible bearing in mind that we have witnesses to come in.  I ask members to restrict their contributions to a maximum of five minutes and to avoid repetition.  If we need more time, we can come back to it.  If that is all right, it would be a good way to proceed.  I call Deputy Murphy to speak first as it was she who suggested the statements.  We can take it from there according to who indicates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#A00500"><p>This is a two-pronged process, of which the Citizens' Assembly was the first element.  We were asked to consider the report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on the eighth amendment of the Constitution and to report in turn to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Our brief does not say anything more than that.  At the beginning, we decided that we would not repeat the Citizens' Assembly process but would instead consider the recommendations.  The people who were invited here were invited to consider those recommendations.</p> <p>  Looking at those we have invited, the World Health Organization was one.  It very definitely said it was not pro-pregnancy or pro-abortion but was rather concerned with how it is regulated if it is in place.  If the evidence is cold, clinical evidence, stating the eighth amendment is damaging prenatal and maternal outcomes and one is simply presenting information, it does not make it biased; it makes it factual.  A lot of the evidence has been factual.  We had two witnesses from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and two witnesses from the largest maternity hospitals in Dublin.  Indeed, Professor Fergal Malone made a point of stating that he does not categorise himself.  I would have said the two witnesses from the Irish College of General Practitioners were neutral health experts dealing with a legal situation and telling us what the impediments were.  That was the questioning that happened.  We had witnesses from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, someone from the HSE, the former Supreme Court judge who chaired the Citizens' Assembly, senior counsel and the UK-based obstetrician who wrote the report on the death of Savita Halappanavar.  When one looks at the regimes around Europe, one sees that we have one of the most restrictive.  It is very difficult to see where one would have drawn someone to write that report.  He was based in the UK.  We had psychologists and academics who presented us with facts.  Facts do not alter and what was presented was peer-reviewed, which is something we were very deliberate about.  As such, this notion that there were 24 on one side and four on the other is utter nonsense.  It is very important to respect the people who come before us in the context in which they come in front of us.</p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly went through a range of different hearings.  We decided not to bring in advocacy groups.  If one goes through the Citizens' Assembly report to look at who presented at the assembly, one sees that there were two sides.  That is not what we are being asked to do here.  We have been asked to look at the report the Citizens' Assembly produced which means we have had to get people who could help us to take it on and look at the issues that would present in the context of the recommendations, if implemented.  I feel very strongly that we should not allow this to become a narrative that is lie because that would discredit those who are sitting in this room.  It is not going to be a constructive contribution to public discourse when we get around to debating this issue in the context of a referendum.</p><p>I support Deputy Murphy in what she has just said and there is no need to repeat it.  From the outset, our task was to examine the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  In the first few meetings, we were trying to get witnesses in to seek clarity as to how the Citizens' Assembly came to those recommendations and to open our eyes as to how it ended up as it did.  It is obviously a challenge that we are an outlier in Europe in maternal health and the provision of abortion services.  We looked at national people, urban versus rural, Irish versus international, and some people might say they were all pro-choice.  Maybe the world is becoming slightly more pro-choice.  It would be very difficult to get a medical expert with a lot of experience in the fields of obstetrics and gynaecology to come here to say the eighth amendment has been good for women's health.  I support what Deputy Murphy has said.  No one can say other than that all the members of the committee have worked very hard to come here prepared by reading statements beforehand and seeking evidence.  Publicly, some members have come on a journey throughout the process.  If that is so, it is evidence that the committee is doing its work.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

It was to examine and have a good variation between urban and rural.  We have had the World Health Organization and the best of people before us.  The only reason for my fair, balanced and reasoned commentary last week was that there is a narrative out there.  The last thing I want when I walk away from the committee when its work is done is to have it presented as one-sided.  I cannot let that happen on my watch and it would have been remiss of me not to have said it.  My only ask related to the fact that there were groups which declined the opportunity to come before us.  That is not our fault but they are letting down a cohort of people they represent.  I ask the Chairman if there is a way to give them the space or a slot that might be a particular viewpoint.  Can the space be created?  Who is next in the pecking order and who is further down to allow us to still afford the viewpoint to create balance?  Let no one have the opportunity to say the committee was biased from the word go because, X, Y or Z was not here.  That is not what I want.  I have sat here and been open-minded and engaged all the way along with all of my colleagues, but there is a piece of the jigsaw that still needs to come in front of me.</p></speech>

Bodies like the World Health Organization, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Irish College of General Practitioners have status as representative bodies or, in the case of the commission, through statute.  They are not there on any side of an argument.  They are there because of who they are and what they represent.  I agree that the balance presented is untrue.  However, I also share Deputy Rabbitte's concern on those people who have withdrawn and not come before us.  One of the reasons is that they have misinterpreted the decision we made on not retaining Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>as it is.  All that was doing was to say we would move on; in other words, that the <i>status quo</i>would not remain.  If the <i>status quo</i>had remained, we would not have been making any recommendation for a referendum and there would have been no point moving to the next stage.  That point was made earlier.</p><p>It might be no harm to go back to these people to say they have misunderstood what the committee has decided so far.  I would like to have the opportunity to ask questions of those groups.  I regret very much the deliberate attempt to misrepresent the committee in the public arena.  What has been said about what the committee has been trying to do is not true.  I do not know if it is worth contacting those groups again to tell them they have misunderstood the committee and the people who have come before the committee.</p></speech>

It is about tactics and undermining a process.  It is about the <i>status quo</i>losing a grip on what they feel is the moral standard in any given country or over women's access to health care.  This is the sting of a dying wasp and we do not need to discuss whether it is bias or not.  We can see the calibre of speakers we had before us.  If anything in relation to bias, I left the room many times looking at the level of time some speakers were given.  One week when speakers were supposed to have six minutes, Senator Mullen had three times that and I had my own six minutes.  However, I do not leave here screaming &quot;Bias&quot; and saying that my voice was not heard.  This room was representative of the mandates of the membership.  All parties and technical groups are here.  We all have a mandate to be here and we should all abide by the same rules.  If one looks at the list of speakers, I submitted six and only two of whom were chosen.  Deputy Mattie McGrath had three or four chosen.  We all put our individual speakers in and I am sure the proportion is spread according to the people in the room.  There is no bias.  It is not our fault if some of those speakers have pulled out.</p></speech>

I am not rejecting it entirely, but I find it difficult to accept.  If we are going to speak in that vein and ask for groups to come back, we need to spell out what groups we are talking about.  We need to name them rather than just to have a nebulous reference to groups who are misunderstanding something.  It is important that we identify and name the groups we think should be given a second chance and invited back again while we are having this discussion.</p> <p>  There has been a deliberate attempt to paint the Chairman as somehow biased and I find it extremely disturbing and wrong.  It is evidentially untrue.  It is a false perception.  There was even a complaint to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, of which I am a member, accusing the Chairman of repeatedly calling a member of the committee a liar.  The committee was about to write to the Chairman to remind her of her duties when I asked that we see the transcripts of her saying repeatedly that the person was a liar as I knew it had never happened.  I do not know where the matter has gone since then.  It is important that we defend the Chairman and her role and fairness otherwise there will be this attempt to say the entire exercise here is flawed and its outcome must therefore be flawed.  I want that on the record.  The majority of the committee agrees with me but we need to find a way to express it as a majority.</p></speech>

Much of it is pathetic.  We issued invitations to people but perhaps they feel the weight of their argument is not sufficient or they feel unable to articulate it.  There were some fairly eminent people on the list who pulled out who I know are more than capable of holding their own in the cut and thrust of debate, but if they felt their arguments would not stand up in the face of the facts and felt unable to come in, we did enough in issuing the invitation.  If it is the view of the committee that another chance should be given to people to present an alternative view, I would not object.  However, I am not necessarily convinced we need an alternative view.  What we have heard very clearly are the facts.  As was pointed out previously, there is not really an alternative to the facts because they are the facts.</p> <p>  I echo Deputy Smith's points in relation to the Chairman.  No member of the committee who takes his or her work seriously, attends meetings and pays attention to what is happening would in any way, shape or form accuse our Chairman of bias.  It is not fair.  The Chairman enjoys the support of the vast majority of the members of the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.73" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#C00100"><p>I mean this as no criticism but I agree with Senator Ruane that in terms of bias and speaking time, Senator Mullen and Deputy McGrath have had far more speaking time allocated than was given to other members.  I believe the Chairman gave extreme latitude to those members to the committee, and I understand why she did so, but it was not appreciated, which is regrettable.  There are certain groups that appear before this committee - medical professionals operating in this State - who hold more weight than medical professionals operating outside this State because they are operating within the current legal regime we are seeking to change.  The general practitioners' group, the Master and former Master of the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street and the Master of the Rotunda Hospital are individuals who are working every day with mothers, pregnant women and children.  The suggestion that they are somehow motivated by some sort of less than honourable motive is totally discredited.  I believe their motivations are sincere, honest, genuine and in the best interests of women's health.  It is very difficult to ignore medical professional after medical professional appearing before this committee telling us that the eighth amendment is not in the best interests of women's health.  It is very difficult to ignore that.</p> <p>  Regarding the suggestion that the committee is biased because somehow we are not 50-50, the country is not 50-50 on either side.  It is my view that a majority in this country wants at least some change and I believe this committee is representative of that.  Every member of this committee had an opportunity to suggest witnesses, which we all did.  We had to justify why those witnesses should appear before this committee and why the State should foot the bill for them to travel if they were going to travel.  There is nothing wrong with that.  It is the same process as happens with every committee.  Regarding the witnesses who chose not to attend, that was not this committee's doing.  We invited them to attend but they chose not to do so.  Regarding the suggestion that a statement from those particular groups would be read into the record because they did not want to come here and take questions, we cannot question that evidence so it is clearly not the same as evidence given to a committee when a person physically attends and can take questions.</p> <p>  There is no doubt in my mind that there are certain members of this committee who have sought at every opportunity to undermine the work of this committee and, quite frankly, I found the consistent attack on the Chairman to be unbelievable.  I think she deserves a medal at the end of this for her patience.  She has been consistently under attack at every opportunity and it is not a personal thing.  It is part of the process that has been engaged in by certain members to undermine our work.  I believe the public has seen through that.  At the end of the day, this committee will not decide on what happens to the eighth amendment and whether it is retained, amended or repealed.  The people of this country will decide and that is something we must bear in mind.</p></speech>

Any time the question of abortion has come into the Oireachtas, and I am in my eleventh year, everybody prefaces the debate by saying that we will be reasonable and sensitive and act with responsibility.  All these pious statements are made.  However, this committee has experienced very little of that.  In fact, I must say that some of the aggression shown towards our witnesses has bordered on the unchristian.  The idea that anybody who states that this committee is a set up to rubber stamp matters, that it has already decided and that there is a majority of whatever it is, is not being fair to the public and is definitely being very unfair to their colleagues on the committee.  If people really feel that this is the situation, perhaps they should ask why they are remaining on the committee if they have such little faith in the process, their colleagues and the Chairman, who has been eminently fair.  The public knows she has been fair.</p> <p>  I have nothing against anybody here.  Everyone here has the right to their opinion and beliefs.  Many of us are on a learning curve.  Some people came in here very decided on their position.  I find my position has changed since I became a member because of the information I have received.  I really regret that one cohort of witnesses has decided for whatever reason not to give us the benefit of their wisdom.  The people who might have an influence on such people should go back to them and ask them to come back in.  We would like to hear what they have to say, we would learn from what they have to say and we are open enough to listen to them.  This should be the last debate about the credibility or otherwise of this committee.  Every Oireachtas committee is entitled to be taken very seriously and responsibly.  People must make their minds up.  Are they going to engage with the committee in a productive manner or should they be here at all?</p></speech>

I will try my best to address the main points, which is that this committee has hastily but all too belatedly convened a session because it knows that the cat is out of the bag about the flawed processes and attitudes that have existed within this committee from the start.</p> <p>  As far as possible, I have tried to avoid a criticism of the Chairman.  I think I used the word "bias" on one occasion because I have not always felt that she was impartial but, by and large, my criticism would be that she probably had a very difficult job in the first place but she has failed to preside over a process and make the necessary proposals that would try to procure objectivity as far as possible on this very difficult issue.  I say that as somebody who has been in the Seanad for ten years.  I have known the Chairman for a long time and I like her, but I cannot be dishonest about the way I feel this committee has operated.  I can only act with integrity if I tell it as I see it.</p> <p>  While I had intended to address what various speakers had to say seriatum, I do not know at whom the notion of unchristian behaviour was being levelled.  Speaking for myself, and I am sure, Deputies McGrath and Fitzpatrick, as one of those on the committee who has opposed the motion, all I can say is that I have certainly tried to respect every person's dignity at all times.  I do not think I have ever attacked it.  I have sought to robustly question in extremely difficult circumstances where there was nothing like the time needed to address various tendentious stuff going on where experts came in and then lashed into their views to a very considerable degree.  Although I was grateful on those occasions where, on a grace and favour basis, the Chairman allotted more time, probably because she perceived that I was representing a minority view, as do Deputies McGrath and Fitzpatrick, at least within this committee, it is too much to expect that we would regard as removing all of the problem when time after time, there were questions that desperately needed to be asked which people here were simply not interested in asking because they would tend to undermine advocacy for abortion and which I would have asked had I received the time.  Time and again, I have made the comparison with the Committee of Public Accounts where there is serious inquiry into what is being said.  This committee has failed almost at all times to engage in that kind of inquiry and that is simply not my fault or the fault of Deputies McGrath and Fitzpatrick.  It perhaps reflects the fact that we are in a serious minority on the committee and that most other members did not see that they had a need even to ask questions that would go against the grain of their own point of view.</p> <p>  From the outset, I stressed that the mandate given to the committee by the Houses was to consider the report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.  I stress that there should be an opportunity to consider in detail the approach taken by the Citizens' Assembly to its work and the strengths and weaknesses in that regard.  There was little support for this among committee members.  The committee clearly wished only to examine whether and how the assembly's recommendations should be implemented.  We heard that from Deputy Murphy here today.  She started off by saying that we were asked to consider the report and recommendations and decided that we were not going to repeat the Citizens' Assembly but were going to consider its recommendations.</p><p>What is that if not a direct admission that she, and the committee, wanted to truncate the mandate given to it by the Houses of the Oireachtas?  As far as I can recall, the Chairman failed in that instance to propose that the committee needed to address the full mandate given to it by the Houses.  That is just for starters.<br/><br/>Much was made by the Chairman and others of the need to avoid repeating the work of the Citizens' Assembly.  This was simply unsatisfactory because it presupposed that there was no need to analyse how the assembly had done its work.  I pointed out the danger at one point that the committee wanted to do less rather than more work, which caused indignation and was rejected by several members.  However, it was on the basis of not wanting to repeat the work of the assembly that a consensus was arrived at - I looked at <i>The Irish Times</i>report on the matter earlier - to the effect that the committee would not hear from advocacy groups, just from so-called experts.  I opposed that exclusion of advocacy groups and my objection was noted.  The committee then went on to invite numerous pro-abortion advocacy groups.  No pro-life advocacy group was invited.  What more evidence do we need of a flawed process, flawed attitudes and closed minds coming from within the committee?  Only one pro-life advocacy group, which clarified an issue relating to its own work - I am referring to Both Lives Matter - offered to come before the committee and this offer was declined by the secretariat on the basis that advocacy groups were not being invited.  The latter was despite the fact that the group in question had been invited.<br/><br/>Despite concerns I expressed on numerous occasions, and I will stop when I am out of time and if the Chairman wants to-----</p></speech>

At the outset, the committee invited 24 pro-repeal witnesses to present before it and just three pro-life witnesses.  I thank the clerk to the committee for his endurance and forbearance in co-operating with me in trying to find out the full list.  Then, in a most extraordinary move, just three weeks into the 12 weeks of hearings, this committee voted not to retain the eighth amendment in full thereby demonstrating that it had no interest in hearing from all witnesses before making a decision.  This move alone has destroyed the credibility of the committee and put to bed any claim that it conducted itself in an impartial way.  By voting so early in the process, the committee behaved in a juvenile and contemptuous fashion towards the democratic process and our duty as elected parliamentarians to scrutinise and ask the hard questions before voting on any proposal, most particularly when it involves a life-and-death issue.  This vote, which was taken just three weeks into the hearings, means that the committee gave its verdict on the eighth amendment after hearing from less than a third of the witnesses who were invited to appear before it.  We voted after hearing from 14 pro-repeal witnesses and just one pro-life speaker.  That is incredible.  Seeking now to justify this farce by engaging in some kind of blame game is, quite frankly, embarrassing.  The clear message sent to the public is that the entire thing is a stitch-up and that there is nobody to blame for this other than the members who voted in for abortion in week 3 before we heard from two thirds of the witnesses we invited to appear before us.</p> <p>  When members reflected on what they had done, there was a scramble to extend matters late in the day in respect of pro-life speakers.  Clearly, this was an attempt to gloss over the appallingly skewed line of speakers and the fact that the committee had already voted for abortion.  To add insult to injury, when the two additional pro-life speakers who were invited to appear declined the offer and cited the abortion vote that had taken place, pro-life groups were criticised by committee members for not accepting the invitation to speak.  It is disgraceful that the three pro-life groups were invited to present not because the committee wanted to listen to their expert opinions but because the committee needed cover for the one-sided way in which it had conducted its activities.  The spin emanating from this committee about pro-life individuals being invited to attend and refusing to do so needs to stop.  It is highly misleading and does not put matters in context.  Everyone in this room knows why they were invited late in the day.  It is time that a modicum of respect was shown and people on this committee were upfront and admitted to what they know to be true, namely, that these hearings have a pre-determined outcome and have been a charade from the start.  Given that the committee voted for abortion before hearing the evidence from both sides, it is perfectly reasonable and understandable that pro-life people are reluctant to take part in the process this late.  The committee has already made up its mind and just wants a few more pro-life groups to attend to disguise what is a deeply flawed and one-sided process.</p> <p>  For the record, it is not the case that lots of pro-life groups and individuals were contacted after the initial three were invited.  My understanding is that only two additional pro-life individuals and groups were contacted, bringing it to a total of five pro-life invitations against 28 or 29 on the pro-repeal side.  These figures have been supplied by the secretariat.  When members of the committee say they are blue in the face from looking for pro-life witnesses to come forward, there is no basis for such claims.  If people here became blue in the face that easily as a result of asking just two more witnesses to attend, they should go to the doctor and have their blood pressure checked.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Connell knows that.  The Chairman said at the beginning of the process that this committee would not repeat any of the work of the Citizens' Assembly and then proceeded to invite 12 of the same witnesses who appeared before the assembly.  I lay that charge with the Chairman.  She made that statement on the record and then invited 12 groups that appeared before the Citizens' Assembly.  The Chairman also said at the outset that only experts would be invited to the hearings and that no advocacy groups on either side would be invited.  However, pro-abortion advocacy groups such as the Irish Family Planning Association, the New York-based Centre for Reproductive Rights and the largest abortion group in the UK, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, were all invited.  How does that square with the Chairman's statement?</p> <p>  In contrast, not a single one of the numerous families who say their owe their lives and the lives of their children to the eighth amendment were ever invited to present.  That is really incredible when one thinks about it - all those stories from families who nearly aborted their children but did not do so because, as they say, the time it took to prepare to travel to England was the time they needed to change their minds.  To think that the committee has not heard a single one of these stories is inexcusable, not to mention all the other areas it has not considered from contemporary models of adoption - and we cannot discuss adoption here at all - to putting better supports in place for women experiencing unexpected pregnancies.  All of the focus has been on abortion and putting the eighth amendment on trial rather than having an honest and open examination of the issue that also focuses on all that is positive about the amendment.  It is impossible to argue with pro-life supporters who say this committee is irredeemably broken and has lost all credibility.</p><p>I would like to state one more thing for the record.  The Chairman and others claim that they asked pro-life members of this committee to submit names at the outset, and that we supposedly only came up with six or seven.  The truth is that we made it very clear back at the start that we believed it to be the collective responsibility of the committee and the secretariat to actively pursue a balance in this regard.</p><p> How much time do I have left?  I have more to say but the members obviously do not want to hear it.  I take grave offence at Deputy Rabbitte, who has now left, and at Senator Ned O'Sullivan coming in here and reading out Fianna F&aacute;il press releases.  At its recent Ard-Fheis Fianna F&aacute;il voted overwhelmingly to keep the eighth amendment and yet now it sends party members in here to attack us.  Deputy Lisa Chambers-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#E00800"><p>We all do our best to be as fair as we possibly can towards the people who come before us.  We can only deal with those who come before us; we cannot deal with those who do not.  Nor can we presume that their cases will be made unless they come before us and we have the opportunity to ask them questions.  That is fair.  As the Chairman knows, I was among those who proposed not having a vote until we had finished the proceedings.  I held that view very strongly.  It does not make any difference how this committee votes, however, as it is the people who will decide.  The suggestion that the committee has voted 'for' abortion is thus incorrect because it is the people and the people alone who can make that decision.  The job of this committee is simply to stress-test the report of the Citizens' Assembly; find out how it came to its conclusions; and ask relevant questions of the members of that assembly and of others who have expertise or something to offer in these circumstances.  I am only one person and I know that everybody here has tried his or her best to be as fair as possible and to ask pertinent questions, not necessarily in order to get the desired answer, but to get an answer that will in some way address the issues raised and conclusions reached by the Citizens' Assembly.</p> <p>  I would suggest, if it is of any help, that our colleagues Senator Mullen and Deputy McGrath might give us some names or indeed might themselves invite people they consider suitable to come before the committee.  They should let us know in the next week or so if these people are available to come before the committee and if they would be satisfied to do so.  If that means that we end up with two or three new witnesses then let us facilitate that.  I am all in favour of democracy.  Most of the people in question, however, have already been invited by the secretariat and most have turned this offer down.  I suggest, then, that our colleagues here invite directly the people who they would like to see come before this committee.  As far as I am concerned and, I am sure, as far as our Chairman is concerned, I am quite certain that we will give these witnesses every opportunity to make their case and then we will ask relevant questions.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#E01000"><p>Accusations have been made that this committee is biased.  I refute that; I do not think that it is biased.  There is no doubt but that there are individual members sitting on the committee who have a bias, but as a committee we are not biased.  An assertion has also been made that only three pro-life members sit on this committee, something I think certain other members here would dispute.  The fact that these members have not stood outside the gates of Leinster House giving press conferences, because they have been in here carrying out their role on the committee by questioning witnesses, does not make them pro-choice.  I do not consider myself pro-choice, for example, or indeed pro-life at this stage.  I am realist and I am going on the factual evidence presented to this committee.</p> <p>   Deputy Mattie McGrath made a particular comment that needs to be addressed.  He suggested that the clerk of the committee informed him that 24 pro-repeal groups had appeared before us. I am aware that the clerk cannot speak at these meetings and it is thus unfair to quote him here when he cannot defend himself.  I cannot speak for the clerk but I very much doubt that he gave Deputy McGrath that information and I find it very unfair of the Deputy to make an accusation like this in the knowledge that the clerk cannot correct him.   The Deputy also claimed that the clerk had told him that four pro-life groups had appeared before us.  Not only have he and Senator Mullen questioned the role of the Chairman, they are now questioning the role of the clerk of this committee, something I consider to be absolutely disgraceful.  Their behaviour in this committee has been downright disgraceful.  </p> <p>  Senator Mullen's comments today were also disgraceful when he claimed that there was no time to ask questions and that more time should have been given.  Other than the first two meetings, which I was had to miss due to ill health, I have attended every single meeting and listened to every single witness who presented here.  I may not have asked questions of every single witness but I listened to their evidence, unlike Senator Mullen and Deputy McGrath who did not attend every session and were not present for every witness.  I do not know how they now claim that they did not have sufficient opportunity to question witnesses.  Witnesses appeared before this committee and gave evidence that Senator Mullen and Deputy McGrath did not even hear, never mind question, because they were too busy trying to propagate the idea that this committee is biased.  I put it to Senator Mullen that the only biased person here is Senator Mullen himself.  This committee is not biased.</p></speech>

The world is looking on and three or four men are having arguments here while women and their health need to be debated.  We are delaying the process.  Women out there are waiting for a result to do with their reproductive health.  What are we like?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1406" speakername="Catherine Noone" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#F03800"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Can we all just stop?  I have a few words to say.  Chairing this committee is both a privilege and a challenge.  It is a privilege in that I am facilitating members who have rolled up their sleeves to examine these issues in great detail and it is a challenge in light of the fact that the issue is so emotionally divisive.  Believe it or not, I do not take it personally.  I cannot do so.  In general, it is not intended personally and I respect what Senator Mullen had to say in that regard.</p><p>We were given a report from the Citizens' Assembly in which it recommended a change in the Constitution so as to make 13 grounds for the termination of pregnancy lawful.  That is a major step.  We were charged with examining whether this change is necessary and, if so, how it could be implemented.  To do that, we invited a range of experts in areas such as obstetrics, human rights and international developments in the area of reproductive health care.</p><p>In the context of examining this issue by subjecting the recommendations of the assembly to full public scrutiny, the map given to us by Ms Leah Hoctor two weeks ago, which showed all of Europe, with the exception of Malta and Ireland, showed that we are an outlier.  We have heard contributions to the effect that because the UK is a provider of abortion for Irish women, we can be an outlier.  It was important, therefore, for the committee to understand what would be likely to happen if that ceased and the terminations performed in the UK were performed in our hospitals.  That is why we wanted information on worldwide trends and what happens if restrictive laws are removed.</p><p>Witnesses from the WHO and bodies such as the Guttmacher Institute and the Center for Reproductive Rights were asked to contribute to the committee so that we, as members, might have a strong understanding of these issues.  We also sought information on the illegal importation of abortion pills.  As such, our work has very much been based on what is happening on the ground.</p><p>I have listened to claims that the committee has been biased in its approach.  It would have made the committee better informed if those who argue vehemently for maintaining the <i>status quo</i>gave evidence.  That goes without saying.  However, it did not happen.  We are all aware of their views, though.  In any event, those occupying polarised positions on both sides may struggle to make themselves relevant.  Long may that continue because it will result in a more rational debate when the issues are put to the people.</p><p>I wish to make a few more points.  The committee decided who would attend, not me.  I do not know how many times I have to say it, but that is the reality.  As a committee, we agreed to limit the number of advocacy groups appearing before us because of our time constraints.  No vote has been taken in this room on the question of introducing abortion.  I want to be very clear about that.  I have said this a few times, but I will say it again because it clearly needs to be repeated - we voted to address the <i>status quo</i>.  We voted on our belief that Article 40.3.3<sup>o</sup>needed to be addressed.  The actual words were &quot;not retained in full&quot;.  We have agreed to address the <i>status quo</i>, but we have not decided anything further than that.  Anything that has been said outside the committee other than that is incorrect and a misinterpretation, so I ask members to please be constructive with this process and try not to undermine it.</p><p>Both Lives Matter was invited to this committee and declined to attend.  An advocacy group of a similar persuasion will attend this afternoon.</p><p>This is a difficult committee to sit on for all of us and it is an exceptionally difficult committee to chair.  It is probably the most difficult in both respects in the history of the State.  Let us all try to be reasonable and respectful to one another.</p><p>I want to suspend the meeting for two or three minutes to invite the witnesses in.</p></speech>

I welcome members and the viewers who are watching the proceedings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  We will be holding two separate sessions this afternoon.  In the first session, we will meet a representative from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service.  In the second session, we will meet a representative from One Day More, the support group for parents who have received poor pre-natal prognoses.  Before I introduce our witnesses, at the request of the broadcasting and recording services, members and visitors are asked to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to aeroplane mode.  On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to our first witness, Dr. Patricia Lohr, medical director of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service.  I must advise Dr. Lohr on the matter of privilege before we begin our proceedings proper.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now invite Dr. Lohr to make her presentation.</p></speech>

I have a prepared statement and afterwards I will be happy to take any questions members may have.</p> <p>  My name is Patricia Lohr.  I am the medical director of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, BPAS.  I trained in obstetrics and gynaecology at the Harbor-UCLA medical centre in Torrance, California.  I followed this with a fellowship in family planning and contraception research and a masters degree in public health at the University of Pittsburgh.  I am a fellow of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and of the US Society of Family Planning.  I have an honorary fellowship form the UK Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare.  During my career, I have focused on the delivery of evidence based abortion care and family planning, including developing protocols, training doctors and nurses, providing services and conducting research.  I am currently a member of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, abortion task force for which I am currently working on post-graduate curriculum development and a pathway for the care of women needing abortions who are medically complex.  I am a founding member and the treasurer of the British Society of Abortion Care Providers which is an RCOG specialist society and currently sit on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, termination of pregnancy guideline committee which has been tasked with development a new evidence-based guideline for England.  I was a member of the development group that wrote the last RCOG guidance on abortion care and have contributed to other national and international guidelines on contraception.</p> <p>  BPAS is a charity which was established in 1968 to provide not-for-profit abortion care that the National Health Service, NHS, at the time either could not or would not provide.  Today, we provide contraception, pregnancy options counselling, abortion care and miscarriage management from more than 40 centres across England, Wales and Scotland.  As part of our charitable remit, we also provide education on the causes and consequences of unwanted pregnancy and our nurses visit schools and colleges to provide information about contraception and fertility to young people to empower them with the knowledge to make their own reproductive decisions.</p> <p>  The majority of our services are provided under contract to the NHS, meaning the vast majority of women we see do not pay for their treatment.  That now includes women from Northern Ireland, whose care is funded by the UK government and will be managed through a central booking service.  The remainder are fee paying patients who overwhelmingly come from the Republic of Ireland. We provide care at or below cost to women from Ireland in recognition of the financial challenges they have already faced in reaching the UK and we have a policy of never turning any woman away based on her ability to pay.</p> <p>  While it is true that I am someone who believes strongly that abortion care is a fundamental part of women's reproductive health care, I am here today to provide this committee with factual information on the experience of Irish women who travel to the UK, how their abortion care is provided and the limitations of the current framework for providing the highest standard of care.  As an organisation, we have no financial interest in Ireland changing its laws and will continue to provide not-for-profit services to Irish women if they cannot access abortion at home.  In the UK, with the exception of Northern Ireland, a woman can access lawful abortion if she meets the terms of the Abortion Act 1967 and two doctors agree, in good faith, that she does so.  Any abortion outside of that framework falls under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and carries the threat of life in prison for the woman and anyone who helps her.  All abortions must be performed in NHS hospitals or at specifically licensed premises such as those run by BPAS.</p> <p>  The majority of abortions are performed under ground C, which stipulates that the pregnancy has not exceeded its 24th week and that the continuation of the pregnancy would involve risk, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman.  A smaller number are performed under ground E, namely, that if the pregnancy continued the baby would be born with a serious mental or physical disability.  The vast majority of abortions, 92% last year, were carried out at under 13 weeks' gestation and 81% were carried out at under ten weeks.  This is in no small part due to the increasing availability of medical abortion, which can be offered at some of the earliest gestations.  Medical abortion involves taking two medications, mifepristone and misoprostol, ideally 24 to 48 hours apart for maximum efficacy.  Medical abortions account for more than 60% of the total number of abortions performed, although this method becomes less acceptable to women as gestational age advances.</p> <p>  Small numbers of abortions are performed after 20 weeks' gestation and account for approximately 1% of the total number of abortions performed.  Some of these will be for reasons of foetal anomaly which are not detected until the scan at 20 weeks.  Others will involve late detection of pregnancy, sometimes as a result of contraceptive use which has disturbed bleeding patterns, so that a missed period is not interpreted as a potential marker of pregnancy.  While teenage pregnancies have declined dramatically over the past decade, a younger woman with an unwanted pregnancy is proportionately more likely to need a later abortion.  This may be because a pregnancy was not suspected or because she has felt unable to confide in anyone about her circumstances.</p> <p>  In terms of the overall picture of abortion within the UK, the rate is stable at around 16 per 1,000 women.  This rate is largely unchanged since the late 1990s.  The age profile at which women have abortions is changing, however.  The teenage pregnancy rate has decreased dramatically and more older women are requesting abortion care.  At BPAS, we see more women over the age of 35 requesting abortion than women under 20.  It is estimated that one in three women will need an abortion in their lifetimes and that one in five pregnancies end in abortion.</p> <p>  The abortion rate in England and Wales is similar to that in other socially and economically comparable countries such as France and Sweden.  The UK is not an outlier in regard to its abortion rate.  There is, in any event, no evidence that laws influence the numbers of abortions.  The respected Guttmacher Institute has shown, for example, that the rate of abortion in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws is comparable with that in countries with more liberal frameworks.</p> <p>  To address specifically the issue of women from Ireland needing abortion care, last year 3,625 women were recorded in the annual abortion statistics produced by the Department of Health in England as having given an Irish address when they presented for treatment.</p><p>Over the past ten years, the number of women giving Irish addresses has fallen from 4,600 in 2008.  This decline may be underpinned by a number of factors, including better access to contraceptive services and emergency contraception, increased access to abortion medication and increased awareness that free treatment can be obtained with a UK address.  A paper published in the <i>British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology</i>in July reported that between January 2010 and December 2015, some 5,650 women from Ireland and Northern Ireland contacted one online provider alone to request medical termination of pregnancy.<br/><br/>BPAS has been providing abortion care to women from Ireland since 1968.  There is little difference between the reasons women from Ireland present and the reasons women from the UK present; they are diverse and multifaceted.  They may involve financial hardship, knowing one's family is complete, inadequate partner or family support, domestic violence or simply a woman feeling she is not in a position to care for a baby at that point in her life.  While some abortions take place of pregnancies that were planned and wanted, such as those for foetal anomaly, the majority of the women we see were trying to avoid pregnancy when they conceived.  In fact, the majority of women from Ireland we treat were using some form of contraception when they conceived.  We undertook an analysis of 2,703 women from Ireland who were treated at BPAS over a four-year period and found the following: 3% were using a method such as an intrauterine contraceptive, implant or sterilisation; 29% were using injections, oral contraceptives, such as the pill, a patch or a ring; and almost 50% were using condoms, diaphragms or fertility awareness-based methods.  Only 20% were not using any method at all at the time they conceived.  Of Irish women who receive abortion care in the UK, 70% are married or with a partner, and nearly half have already had at least one previous birth, meaning they are already mothers.  All this is in keeping with information we have for women from the UK seeking abortion.<br/><br/>What is different for Irish women?  As previously noted, medical abortion now accounts for the majority of early terminations in the UK.  Many women prefer it as it is akin to a natural miscarriage, they can avoid an anaesthetic and they can be at home when the pregnancy passes.  In contrast, the majority of early abortions provided for Irish women are performed surgically - 71%, compared to 28% for women resident in England and Wales.  This is because for financial and practical reasons, many women travelling from Ireland often aim to fly in and out of the UK within a day and, as medical abortion involves leaving the clinic after taking the second set of medication and going home to pass the pregnancy, it is not clinically optimal for this to happen on the way to the airport or the flight home.  Effectively, this means that women from Ireland are in all practical senses denied a choice of abortion method.<br/><br/>Irish women also have abortions at slightly later gestations than women having abortions who are resident in England and Wales.  The vast majority, 81%, of residents of England and Wales present between three and nine weeks' gestation, compared to 69% of women from the Republic of Ireland.  At ten to 12 weeks' gestation, 11% of residents from England and Wales and 16% from the Republic of Ireland present.  At the latest gestational bracket, 20 weeks or over, 2% of women resident in England or Wales present, compared to 3.2% of women resident in the Republic of Ireland.  Nearly a third of abortions, 31%, for women from the Republic of Ireland are performed at ten weeks or over, compared to 20% for women resident in England and Wales.  Abortion is an extremely safe procedure, but the earlier in pregnancy it is performed the better for women's physical and mental well-being.  Reasons for later presentation include the time it takes to organise travel and make logistical arrangements, particularly for those with work and child care commitments.<br/><br/>All women who receive NHS-funded treatment at BPAS are entitled to contraception counselling.  They can choose from the full range of methods available and, if they wish, can leave with the method of their choice.  Provision of contraception at the time of abortion has several advantages - the woman is known not to be pregnant, and it confers immediate protection against pregnancy and, with regard to implants and intrauterine contraception, increases the likelihood she will receive the method compared to women who must return to undergo insertion at a later date.  Irish women who attend BPAS are also offered contraceptive counselling, and the overwhelming majority take it up.  However, because of the costs associated with receiving their chosen method, as well as the logistics of integrating contraception care with travel, in our analysis only 31% chose to receive their preferred method from BPAS.  This is compared to 85% of women we see who are funded for their contraception care.  This means that an important opportunity to enable women to make a choice about contraception and receive that method is lost.  It is possible women visit their general practitioner or family planning clinic on return to Ireland and receive the method they have chosen, but we have no way of establishing this or following it up.<br/><br/>Regarding post-abortion care, all women undergoing an abortion at BPAS have access to a 24-hour telephone support line.  While follow-up appointments are only provided to those women who want them, all women know they can contact the clinic which treated them and return for a check-up or discuss their concerns at any time.  Women from the Republic of Ireland too can access the telephone support line, but if they have any concerns that need in-person care they will typically access local services, which can present its own problems in view of the stigma and secrecy that continues to surround travel for abortion.<br/><br/>Complications from abortion are uncommon, and serious complications are rare.  In its paper, Best Practice in Comprehensive Abortion Care, the RCOG recommended that women be advised of the following risks.  Failure occurs in one to two in 100 cases of either medical or surgical abortion.  Fewer than two in 100 surgical abortions and approximately five in 100 medical abortions are incomplete and need some form of intervention in order to complete the procedure.  The following complications may occur.  Blood loss needing transfusion occurs in fewer than one in 1,000 cases in the first trimester, rising to approximately four in 1,000 at 20 weeks' gestation or more.  Uterine rupture with second trimester medical abortion occurs in fewer than one in 1,000 cases.  With surgical abortion there is a similar low risk of cervical trauma - fewer than one in 100 overall, but the risk is lower in the first trimester - or of uterine perforation, which occurs in approximately one to four cases per 1,000, and again the risk is lower in the first trimester.  It is sometimes necessary to provide further treatment for complications such as a blood transfusion, laparoscopy, laparotomy and, very rarely, hysterectomy.  An upper genital tract infection can occur after abortion, with varying degrees of severity, and is most likely associated with pre-existing infection.<br/><br/>Regarding the mental health impact of abortion, the risk of developing mental health problems is the same for a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy whether she has an abortion or goes on to have the baby.  While most women will not require further counselling, post-abortion counselling is available to all women who have had an abortion at BPAS, either over the phone or in person.  Needless to say, for women travelling from Ireland the option of in-person counselling at BPAS would be difficult, although this is available through some of the agencies in Ireland.  We can advise women undergoing abortion for foetal anomaly on the transport of foetal remains for autopsy, burial or cremation.  Women from Ireland must take the foetal remains home themselves and find a carrier that will accept the remains on board.  If they want an autopsy or other testing for the foetal remains, this would be self-funded.<br/><br/>What can Ireland learn from the UK?  If Ireland overhauls its abortion laws, which is certainly not for me to prejudge, it would do well to avoid some of the pitfalls and problems that the UK framework presents.  The Abortion Act 1967 was passed at a time when abortion provision was almost entirely surgical and when all surgical procedures were riskier than they are today.  Against this backdrop, it is unsurprising that politicians stipulated that all procedures should be carried out in an NHS hospital or in specific premises licensed by the Secretary of State for Health and that all such procedures should be performed by a doctor.</p><p>Few could have imagined in 1967 that early abortion could be safely provided using medication.  Our laws have prevented the provision of early medical abortion in line with guidance from the World Health Organization, which recommends that women should be able to use misoprostol at home once lawfully prescribed.  This means that women can time the passing of their pregnancy and do not have to risk bleeding or miscarriage on the way home, nor do they have to attend multiple appointments.<br/><br/>I spoke earlier about the number of women from Ireland using online abortion services and it may surprise the committee to know that women living in areas of the UK where funded, legal abortion is available are also turning online.  Over a four month period more than 500 women in England, Wales and Scotland requested help from <i>Women on Web</i>, one of the online medication abortion providers.  For some women, the multiple appointments, sometimes considerable distances from where they live, were an absolute impediment to accessing lawful care.<br/><br/>Our laws have also prevented the full development of nurse and midwife-led services that are now the standard in other areas of care like colposcopy.  Nurses are lawfully able to provide surgical and medical miscarriage management using the same techniques as an early termination but are prohibited from providing that service to women needing an abortion.  With regard to premises, there is no reason why early abortion, whether by vacuum aspiration or pills, could not be safely provided from a GP surgery but again our laws make that all but impossible.<br/><br/>Keeping abortion within the criminal law, as opposed to regulated by health care law like all other procedures, can be hugely stigmatising.  Canada and parts of Australia have opted for the decriminalisation of abortion, regulating it through health care law and professional standards.  There is no evidence that abortion is more widely used or indeed more available as a result.  We do not need a criminal code to impose a time limit for example, but keeping the procedure outwith the criminal law and the subject of professional guidance and health care regulation means that lawful abortion care can be provided in accordance with the highest clinical standards and best practice.  Ireland has the opportunity to create a humane abortion framework that is fit for the 21st century.  I hope the information that I have provided to the committee is helpful for this discussion and I am happy to take any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

I believe it is a barrier to individuals engaging in the field of abortion provision.  Many women are not aware that abortion sits within the criminal code, but it is the case that some women are aware and they are aware that they have to meet certain criteria in order to obtain a lawful abortion.  I have been made aware of cases at the British Pregnancy Advisory Service where women have concealed the reasons why they are coming for the abortion because they were worried it would not meet the criteria.  I will give the committee an example.  A woman was experiencing extreme lower abdominal pain during her pregnancy, so much so that she felt she could not continue the pregnancy.  She did not believe that this reason would meet the lawful criteria for an abortion.  When she met with our doctors she told us a different reason for wanting to obtain an abortion, which did fit with the Act.  It was ultimately discovered that this woman had an ectopic pregnancy and a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy was delayed.</p> <p>  There are very few things now, thankfully,  that lead to maternal mortality in this part of the world.  Unrecognised ectopic pregnancy, however, is one of them.  For some patients it has potentially devastating consequences.  I have made reference to a paper that was published about women in the UK who have contacted Women on Web about obtaining abortion medications because they felt they could not leave the house, perhaps they had a controlling partner or it was a domestic violence situation, maybe they could not afford multiple visits to the clinic, etc.  The framework within which those women have to obtain an abortion is a barrier.</p></speech>

Would Dr. Lohr's assessment be that this contradicts that argument?</p></speech>

In many parts of the world where abortion is illegal or highly restricted that is not the case and women turn to unsafe means to end their pregnancies.  This is associated with a very high maternal mortality rate in those countries.  In Ireland's case we see that women who are able to afford to travel are able to obtain safe abortion care but I am sure there will be a number of women who cannot afford to travel who go on to continue pregnancies here that they would otherwise have terminated had abortion been available in Ireland.  As we are aware, more and more women are obtaining abortion medications online here.  While that is not an inherently unsafe activity these women lack the follow-up and other services they may benefit from, such as early pregnancy diagnostic services.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  What is the extent of the risk associated with ordinary, conventional birth and with abortion?  Has Dr. Lohr compared the figures in the UK and how do they stack up?</p><p>To what extent is counselling that comes before, during or after the process of terminating a pregnancy available in the UK for women in Ireland who travel over to have a termination?  Have the witnesses studied the statistics in other European countries?  In some cases, there is a vastly different number of abortions per 1,000 in countries where abortion is permitted.  Have the witnesses come to a conclusion as to why that might be?  Switzerland and Sweden might be compared, since the rate in Sweden is approximately three times as high as Switzerland.</p></speech>

Giving birth has got safer in the UK in the last few years and having an abortion is extremely safe.  The reports on maternal mortality for the triennium of 2006 to 2008, which the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, refers to in its abortion guideline, state that 107 direct deaths were associated with pregnancy out of 2.29 million maternities, giving a rate of 11.39 per 100,000 maternities.  In comparison, two abortion-related deaths were reported in that triennium, of 628,342 abortions, which works out to a rate of 0.32 deaths per 100,000 maternities.  I looked at some of the reports published since.  Maternal mortality at the time of birth has gone down somewhat and the rate of deaths from abortion has not increased.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was about counselling for women from Ireland.  I can speak for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, BPAS.  We make our telephone counselling services available to women from Ireland.  They could access in-person counselling with us if they so wished but that would mean coming back to the UK.  We provide women with phone-based counselling, which many women prefer.  They usually only need a few discussions but can have as many as they need.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the rate of abortions across European countries.  I am not an epidemiologist but looking at where the UK sits in the list of European countries, which the Deputy might have been shown a slide of in an early presentation, we are comparable.  Abortion may have a higher rate in some countries than others for various reasons, as variable as the reasons women choose abortion but they are typically and commonly related to the availability of contraceptive services so where contraceptive services are widely available and funded, we tend to see a lower abortion rate.  One sometimes sees cases where abortion services are well-funded, for example, in the UK, where women still avail themselves of having an abortion when they feel the need to end a pregnancy by termination.</p></speech>

Upper genital tract infection, treated with oral antibiotics, is reported variably in the studies and often depends on the diagnostic criteria used.  Where the diagnostic criteria are very strict, for example in cases of fever and evidence of increased of white blood cell count, the rates are quite low.  There are higher rates where diagnostic criteria are vague, somewhere around one in 100.  Those are typically treated with oral antibiotics.  They are not cases of sepsis.  Cases of serious sepsis are extremely uncommon.</p></speech>

I will ask Dr. Lohr about the experience of Irish women.  She has informed us of the care pathways that BPAS provides.  There is an issue for Irish women with regard to where the role of BPAS ends in the care pathways, particularly with regard to contraception counselling post-abortion.  What is the effect of that?  We have had previous evidence that would suggest that post-abortion contraceptive advice reduces the recurrence of further abortions.  Is there any factual evidence related to that?  What are Dr. Lohr's own feelings about not being able to continue the care pathway for women who have come to her services from Ireland?</p></speech>

A number of studies have been done, looking at different models of contraceptive counselling before the abortion.  None of the variations, whether specialist counselling or dedicated counselling, has been associated with the reduction in subsequent unintended pregnancies or abortion, particularly in the long term.  We know that when women receive the method and start it straight away, that is associated with reduced risk.  The only way that can happen is if the contraceptive counselling happens before the abortion.  Every woman in our service is asked whether she wishes to use a method of family planning.  If she does, we engage her in a discussion about which method of contraception would be right for her and we aim to provide it at the time of the abortion so that she is immediately and optimally protected.</p></speech>

Illegal abortions are very difficult to count.  We do know a bit about women who presented to hospital, for example, after having obtained an unsafe abortion in the UK before the Act was passed.  Once the Act was passed the numbers of women having abortion did not go up dramatically.  I guess that is what the Deputy refers to as floodgates.  What we do know and can see in statistics is that, as abortion services became more widely available and abortion became better funded, and women became aware that those services were available and were safe, they did avail of them.  Now we see that the number of women accessing abortion has been very stable for several years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#L00300"><p>I thank Dr. Lohr for her presentation and for coming before the committee to give evidence and answer questions.</p> <p>  Could Dr. Lohr please respond to the concern that there is a risk abortion will be used as a form of contraception?  Could she please paint a picture of the reasons for different age groups of women obtaining abortion, for example, among women younger than 20, aged between 20 and 30 and those over 40?  Are there different reasons in those age categories?</p> <p>  I was struck by Dr. Lohr's figures, that 71% of early abortions provided for Irish women are surgical compared with 28% for women resident in England and Wales.  That was because the Irish women had to travel back and forth in one day.  The medical abortion, the tablet, cannot be offered to them.  Do women arrive at the clinic seeking a medical abortion, thinking that is what they will have but then hear that they cannot have that service but will have to have a surgical abortion?  </p> <p>  It appears from Dr. Lohr's presentation that there are more risks associated with surgical abortions than with medical, for example, uterine rupture, bleeding and other complications.  Would it be fair to say surgical abortions are more risky and that Irish women do not have the choice when they go to the UK but have to have more surgical than medical abortions? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Patricia Lohr" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#L00400"><p>I will take the last question first, about the risks of surgical and medical abortions.  Proportionally, early medical abortions have a slightly higher rate of complications than surgical abortions.  It is the profile of the complications that differs.  With a surgical abortion a woman runs a very low but present risk of cervical or uterine injury.  The most common complications of medical abortion are relatively minor, for example, some retain tissue that might need an additional intervention, although the bleeding risks are certainly higher.</p> <p>  In response to the question of whether women come into our clinics looking for a medical abortion and we tell them they cannot have it because they are there only for a day, we always try to meet the woman's request with regard to the method of abortion.  We would never prevent a woman having a certain form of abortion but we would talk with her about the process involved.  We would be honest about the regimen for early medical abortion which typically occurs over two days.  Under the law in England and Wales - now Scotland is different &ndash; a woman must come into the clinic to receive both sets of medications.  We would describe the process to her and assess her medical eligibility for either regimen and would leave it to her to decide.  For all intents and purposes, however, from a practical point of view, most women coming from Ireland need to come and go in the same day.  They have already had to gather the funds to pay for the abortion and travel so to add an overnight stay and another day away from work or home is too difficult.  That is why the majority of those women choose surgical procedures. </p> <p>  The Deputy asked about differing reasons for abortion at different ages.  We do see differences.  Teenagers, those younger than 20, are often unable to care for a child, they may still be in school and it is not optimal for them to have a child.  Women in their 20s and 30s are often looking to delay childbirth.  We have seen the age of first time motherhood has gone up in the UK, as in many countries.  Women are delaying childbirth for several years and it is important to note that most women in the UK are using contraceptive methods but all contraceptive methods have a failure rate and in typical use the failure rate for example, of the oral contraceptive pill is approximately nine in 100.  If a woman is trying to prevent pregnancy for ten or 15 years it is possible, even if she is using her contraceptive method absolutely the way it is supposed to be used, that she might experience a contraceptive failure and if she is not ready to parent she will seek an abortion.  Older women typically have completed their childbearing, for example, they did not expect to be able to get pregnant.  They already have children and are seeking termination often for those reasons. </p> <p>  The last question was about contraception and I have forgotten what the Deputy asked, I am so sorry. </p></speech>

They were not intending to become pregnant and were intending to use a method of contraception to prevent a pregnancy.  On that basis I do not see evidence that women are using abortion as a method of contraception.  It is a backup for when contraception fails, or in a very small number of cases, as I have described, there are foetal or sometimes even maternal indications to end the pregnancy.</p></speech>

The head of Dr. Lohr's organisation, Ann Furedi, recently spoke on television about how she feels that abortion should be available for sex selection, if a woman finds that she is expecting a baby girl but wanted a baby boy that should be grounds for an abortion.  I think most people find it quite upsetting that anyone would think a baby's life should be ended simply because she is a girl.  Does Dr. Lohr think that abortion should be allowed on grounds of gender so that a woman can abort a baby girl if she wants a boy instead?  The name of the programme is "Loose Women".

What she may have been clarifying is that abortion on gender grounds is not one of the five grounds for lawful abortion in the UK.  A woman may present to us stating initially that she wants to have an abortion on the basis of foetal sex.  If that were the only reason she put forward to have her abortion, we would not be able to perform that lawfully.  If, however, a woman presented saying, "I know my pregnancy is - pick your foetal sex - and I am at risk of exclusion from my family, domestic violence, etc.,", there may, in fact, be lawful grounds because that might risk her physical or mental health.</p></speech>

She also stated on the same programme when she was talking about sex selection that it should always be down to the woman to make the decision for herself because she will live with it.</p></speech>

Most people would be horrified at this thought which suggests the life of a baby can be ended so easily.  There was no question of attempts being made to save the baby's life, just that abortion should be available after six months.  Currently, English law allows an abortion up to birth if a baby has a disability like Down's syndrome.  The members of the committee are already familiar with the frightening statistic that 90% of babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome in the womb are aborted.  How many abortions have been carried out in BPAS clinics where the reason given was that the baby had a disability?  Have any of these abortions involved babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome?</p></speech>

I cannot understand how an organisation with more than 40 locations in the UK has not been able to come here and provide me with the two answers I seek.  I asked how many abortions had been carried out in BPAS clinics.  I am not asking for any personal information.  I am trying to give people here a picture of what kind of an organisation or charity Dr. Lohr is involved with.  It is horrifying that the CEO of the charity is encouraging gender selection.  I said it here a few weeks ago and people were nearly laughing.  That a charity in the UK is looking at the selection of genders is something I cannot understand.</p> <p>  I believe very strongly that we trust women.  This is something I have also heard members of Dr. Lohr's organisation saying.  If one trusts women, one must also trust them with full information about abortion including the fact that the baby's heart starts to beat at just 21 days in the womb and the fact that one in five pregnancies in England and Wales ends in abortion.  The committee is tasked with looking at the impact of the eighth amendment in Ireland.  This means undertaking to ensure that the public is fully informed of the development of a baby in the womb and how the eighth amendment is responsible for saving tens of thousands of lives in Ireland.  If we are really going to trust women, does it mean we must run a nationwide education programme on all the good things the eighth amendment has done, the remarkable development of an unborn child and the fact that in England and Wales, over 190,000 babies lose their lives to abortion every year?</p></speech>

If I repeat something that was asked already, ignore me.  I can look back at the record.  Deputy Durkan touched on the rate of termination in the UK.  I was sourcing some documents about the rate in the Netherlands which used to be the lowest but which has risen slightly in recent years.  Dr. Lohr quoted a figure of 16 per 1,000 and I think the Netherlands stands at approximately 8.6 per 1,000.  Some sources attribute that to Irish people travelling there.  The Netherlands, like the UK, has quite a high number of Irish women who travel there for termination.  As part of the continuing development of abortion services, has the UK done anything to try to reduce its rate?  In Holland, they have a non-moralistic treatment of teenagers with education and access to contraception and so on.  Can Dr. Lohr outline those things?</p> <p>  Ground E in the 1967 Act was quoted by Dr. Lohr who said it was for the case of a baby with a serious mental or physical disability?  How is "serious" defined?  On occasion, people here have thrown out the term "cleft palate", but from listening to the experts it is often a combination of conditions.  It is not simply the case that a child has Down's syndrome.</p><p>It might be a child who has Down's syndrome coupled with kidney problems, a heart defect and so on.  Perhaps the witness would elaborate on that issue.  In regard to the limitations of the UK system around the abortion pill, why has nobody in the UK Parliament brought forward a measure to try to change that position?  What are the barriers to it in a country that would be seen to have a liberal approach?  Why has the United Kingdom as a country not done anything to date to address this issue?</p><p> Dr. Lohr referred in her opening statement to never turning anybody away.  What does that mean?  Does it mean that no woman is turned away when she makes contact by phone or when she lands on the doorstep?  I am thinking in this regard about women who are being prevented from travel.  Why in her view was the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, BPAS, set up to provide abortion services rather than this service being provided by the UK maternity hospitals under the National Health Service?  The evidence suggests that reducing barriers to access to contraception tends to reduce abortion rates because of the reduction in unplanned pregnancies.  As contraception is free in the UK, perhaps Dr. Lohr would elaborate on that point.</p></speech>

As I have said, most women who present for abortions in the UK had not intended to become pregnant.  Widespread availability of free contraception in family planning clinics has been important in the UK, as has been the concerted effort to reduce teenage pregnancies by ensuring that young people have available to them the full range of contraceptive methods, including national guidance which supports the use of long-acting methods of contraception in young people, which many doctors and nurses may have been reticent to provide in the past, as well as the education of young and older people about their bodies, the risks of becoming pregnant, when a woman can and cannot get pregnant and how one might prevent pregnancy.  Last but not least, the availability of emergency contraception in order that women can prevent a pregnancy if they have had an episode of unintended, unprotected intercourse has also been hugely important.  All of these initiatives have been undertaken to try to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy.</p> <p>  As discussed, no contraceptive method is perfect and in typical use, the failure rates are relatively high, even with what most people might consider to be some of the more effective methods such as the injectable or oral contraceptive pill.  There is a finite degree to which one can prevent the need for abortion through access to contraception or sex and relationship education.  As we know, and as already referenced today, a small number of abortions are for pregnancies which are very much wanted but because the woman has a medical condition it is unsafe for her to continue to the pregnancy or, as described, there is a foetal anomaly which is an indication for a termination.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked how ground E was defined.  As with all of the grounds for abortion in the UK, it is up to a doctor to determine whether the woman's presentation meets the ground of the Act.  There is language in the Act, and in particular ground E, that describes foetal anomaly, to which a doctor may refer but we do not, for example, have a list of foetal anomalies which meet those criteria.  I agree with the Deputy that doctors look to the whole picture, particularly in cases where the pregnancy is less than 24 weeks.  It may be the case that some terminations may be performed later, for example, in cases of chromosomal abnormality, but the woman would also qualify for an abortion under ground C, that is, risk to mental or physical health.</p></speech>

The Deputy will find that it is not actually a medical category.  There is a consideration of the severity of the anomaly and how that might then affect the child once it is born.  If it is the case that one doctor believes that the abortion could lawfully be performed under ground E and another doctor does not then the doctors may consider whether it could be lawful to perform the abortion under another ground.  If the pregnancy is within the 24 weeks, that can be considered.  For example, the ground of mental or physical well-being applies up to 24 weeks of gestation.  If it is the case that a pregnancy is over 24 weeks' gestation, which is the limit for grounds C and D, then the woman would have to seek the opinion of, for example, another doctor.</p></speech>

I would like to tease out with her the issue of criminality of abortion as it applies in this State and, as mentioned by Dr. Lohr in her presentation, to Northern Ireland.  Three women in Northern Ireland already have been charged with attaining the abortion pill.  Dr. Lohr mentioned that there has been a reduction in the number of women seeking abortions in the UK.  She also said that this is probably a consequence of the availability of the abortion pill.  The statistics provided by her in that regard tally with those provided by other experts who have appeared before the committee.  In Ireland, attainment of the abortion pill is an offence for which a person could go to prison for 14 years.  Likewise, it is an offence in Northern Ireland that carries a similar sentence.  </p> <p>  What Dr. Lohr said fits with the testimonies to the committee from the Irish Family Planning Association and others, namely, that women mainly seek abortions for socioeconomic reasons.  Therefore, they risk losing their liberty in this State because of their socioeconomic circumstances.  For some women, particularly refugees or asylum seekers, travelling to the UK can often be out of reach financially.  In Dr. Lohr's opinion, is a medical abortion, as opposed to a surgical abortion, the less risky option for a woman in terms of her physical health, mental health and, in the case of an Irish woman, her liberty?  In other words if a woman could have a medical abortion in this country, this would be better for her than being obliged to travel to the UK for a surgical abortion because, as outlined by Dr. Lohr, having to travel to the UK often means an abortion takes place later in the pregnancy.  I would welcome a response from Dr. Lohr to that point.  Also, would she agree that the availability of a medical abortion is preferable and safer?  Dr. Lohr mentioned in her presentation that Canada and parts of Australia have opted for decriminalisation.  The UK abortion laws are almost as old as I am and without them, women in this country would not have access to abortion.</p><p> Are they a bit outdated in that they still criminalise the woman?  I did not realise that there was a life sentence attached to illegal abortion in Britain but that is effectively the same here, in the North and in other countries.  Will Dr. Lohr give us some insight as to why Canada and Australia opted for decriminalisation?  If we get to the point where we have to frame legislation and regulation around abortion, hopefully we will, that would be a good insight for us to have.</p></speech>

I answered an earlier question regarding the comparable rates of complications in medical and surgical abortion.  It is the case that while complications with either method are extremely low, there is a slightly higher risk of complications after an early medical abortion compared with surgical but the risk profile is different.  The sorts of complications that one sees after early medical abortion are relatively minor and can often be resolved with relatively minor interventions, for instance, one might use another dose of medications to remove any extra tissue that has not been passed.  The processes for medical and surgical abortion are extremely different, however, and I think it is extremely important that women have access to both because they are so different.  Women often prefer medical abortion because it is private, they do not need to have a surgical intervention, have an anaesthetic or go into a clinic in some places.  They can pass the pregnancy at home and have their partner with them and that is important to some women.  For other women, it is important to them to have their abortion done in a clinical setting, to be performed quickly since with a medical abortion there is a somewhat unpredictable time to the passage of the pregnancy, whereas with a surgical abortion it is a day-case procedure, it is timed and one knows when one will be finished.  Often those process-related elements matter in some ways more to women than the absolute rate of complications because the complications are low either way and they are pretty similar.  It is important women have access to both.</p> <p>  On medical abortion in Ireland and women availing of abortion medications online, it is entirely unsurprising because it is very expensive to travel.  What one sees here is what has been seen in many other countries before abortion was legalised or liberalised, which is that women who can afford to travel for abortions or can afford to pay for them do so and women who cannot do not and go on to have unwanted pregnancies.  There are consequences of having unwanted pregnancies too.  </p> <p>  On affordability, delivering medical abortion services is a very affordable way of delivering abortion services.  It can be entirely nurse-led, the medications are not very expensive and the rate of complications are low.  It can be offered from a number of locations, which means that it can be less expensive for the woman as she does not have to travel as far to access services, for example.  It is a very good model of care, is a highly effective mode of abortion care and is very accessible.</p> <p>  One issue I had not touched on regarding surgical abortion in my answer to the previous question is that women who have surgical abortions not only need to come over themselves to have the procedure but should have someone come with them and to travel back with them.  If they have had a general anaesthetic or some sedation, they should have someone to take care of them afterwards and that adds to the cost.  That might see women delaying the procedure further in order to gather the money.</p></speech>

She does not believe and she advocates for a scenario where unborn babies have no right to life.  One thing that has not been put on the record is that BPAS received a scathing health and safety reprimand from the British Care Quality Commission after 11 serious incidents in a 15-month period involving women being transferred for emergency medical care in hospitals after undergoing abortions in BPAS clinics.  Since Dr. Lohr is coming here to advise us on our laws and on what she regards as best practice, it is necessary that this serious reprimand be flagged.  Is that light in which we should view Dr. Lohr's supportive attitude to the idea that abortion should be available outside hospitals and at home, as the World Health Organization pushes for?</p> <p>  She quotes supportively a claim by the Guttmacher Institute, which she says is respected although I believe complaints were made about it coming before the Citizens' Assembly; it does advocate for abortion.  Its claim, which is strange to many, is that the rate of abortions in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws is comparable with those with more liberal frameworks.  She put the rate in Britain as 16 per 1,000 women.  Does that include medical abortions?</p></speech>

In Ireland, taking Dr. Lohr's figures, it is approximately one in 19, so not quite four times the rate in Britain.  Dr. Lohr is not the first witness to come before the committee not to note that.  I do not believe she is suggesting that three times as many women from Ireland are going to the Netherlands as to Britain for abortion.  Does she accept that we have a much lower abortion rate than Britain and that maybe linked to the protective effect of laws that promote the life of two persons, mother and baby?</p> <p> Dr. Lohr uses terms such as "abortion care" and "when the pregnancy passes", which many people would regard as euphemistic.  If one believes there are two humans deserving of care, that situation does not care for the unborn child.  Dr. Lohr is an obstetrician.  Am I correct in presuming that she has done abortions for BPAS and other organisations?</p></speech>

BPAS, as with all non-hospital based providers in the UK under regulation, may only provide abortions to 24 weeks of gestation.</p></speech>

The Senator characterised it as a reprimand.  All health care organisations have opportunities to learn from mistakes.  Complications happen and learning must happen afterwards.  What was identified in the Care Quality Commission report, as had already been identified internally at BPAS through serious incident investigations and learning that followed, was that we did need to do better at that clinic.  However, that will be found in any regulated and inspected health care environment.  If anything, it supports the idea that abortion, like any other medical procedure when regulated, has the opportunity to improve and better provide services.</p> <p>  I believe the Senator was trying to say that the fact that we had had this report meant it should not be used as a justification that abortion may be provided safely out of hospital and at home.  It is probably better to turn to published studies on the locations where abortions can be safely provided.</p><p>We know from a number of publications that, for example, early medical abortion and vacuum aspiration can be safely provided from clinic-based settings.  A number of studies have demonstrated that medical abortion can safely occur in the home environment.</p><p> There was a comment about an assumption of the abortion rate in Ireland and a connection was drawn between the abortion rate I cited in the UK.  The Senator asked whether I thought three times as many women were travelling to the Netherlands.  Have I paraphrased that correctly?</p></speech>

National statistics are not collected, for example, of women who obtain medication over the Internet.  I am unaware of whether the Netherlands reports separately on women giving Irish addresses who are treated in that country.  As I stated, we can only count in the UK the number of women who give Irish addresses.  There may be a number of women coming from Ireland who do not give Irish addresses and who therefore would not be counted in national statistics.</p></speech>

I believe I am correct in saying that most abortions in the UK happen under the broad mental health grounds, with sign-off from two doctors.  Are women ever denied an abortion on these grounds?  What would the reasons be for a denial?  Does the phrasing of the grounds and the verification process ever act as a barrier?</p></speech>

Within our service, there have been circumstances like we discussed earlier where the doctors have not always agreed on the grounds and so there has had to be more discussion about whether the woman would be eligible and under which grounds.  There have been circumstances where doctors have felt a woman needs to go away and think more about the abortion or there have been cases where women have presented requesting abortions on the grounds of foetal sex.  In and of itself, that does not meet the grounds for the Act and further discussion would have to happen to ascertain whether the impact of continuing the pregnancy would mean the women would qualify for an abortion under another one of the grounds.</p></speech>

This is where an abortion might be authorised on the potential impact of continuing the pregnancy on the woman's existing children.  We often see it with regard to considerations of socio-economic status.  For example, a woman would have children and cannot afford to have another child.  Socio-economic considerations can come into play under ground C and within the Act the doctor is given the ability to consider the woman's current position and her foreseeable future.  Such wording is used within the Act.</p></speech>

In the UK, a doctor must always sign the prescription for the medical abortion drugs, for example, and they must always authorise the abortion.  Those medications can then be delivered by a nurse and peri-abortion management can be done by a nurse in our setting.  It is a more affordable model of care than utilising doctors to deliver abortion care and this has allowed us to set up a number of small units closer to women's homes around the country.  That has been a strong contributory factor in the increase of early medical abortion and the knock-on effect of having the gestational age that women are able to obtain abortions come down.</p></speech>

In the United States, when I provided abortion care, I did it during my office hours doing gynaecology.  I might have seen one woman for an abortion and the next might have had abnormal uterine bleeding, for example.  I might have seen the next woman because of a vaginal discharge.  All of those women sat in the waiting room, anonymous to one another about why they were there.  They were less likely to be a target.

I thank Dr. Lohr for coming in.  It is an interesting point as Senator Mullen made the point about Dr. Lohr's services being the subject of a critical review while in the D&aacute;il Chamber they are discussing Portlaoise hospital.  It is the subject of scathing reports arising from the death of babies.  The solution was not to shut the maternity service but to improve it.  Dr. Lohr's comments on the need for every medical procedure to be constantly improved were well made.  We have an unusual position as Irish people have a constitutional right to have an abortion but we do not have the right to have it in Ireland.  On behalf of the tens of thousands of Irish women who have availed of Dr. Lohr's services, I sincerely thank her for that.</p> <p>  Will the witness speak to the point about the irony that our abortion regime, if one likes, arises from the 1967 Act, which is the only avenue Irish women in the main have been given if they have the money to travel?</p><p>In the context of the 50th anniversary of that Act and the increasing dialogue on the need to modernise the British service, what are the best lessons for us, given that we will be starting, in essence, from scratch?  The witness has addressed medical abortion, but I was struck by the point that in a scenario where there is funded legal abortion services, hundreds of women in England or Wales are accessing the service from Women On Web.  Is that an illegal activity or is it a grey area?  How can we learn from that?  <br/><br/>I am confused.  We have spoken before about the call by the head of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists asking for nurses and midwives to be allowed to administer the abortion pill on the basis of one doctor.  My understanding was that that does not exist now and that it has to be two doctors, and that nurses and midwives cannot do it, or that they can when there are two doctors.  Perhaps the witness could clarify that; it is potentially an important way forward. <br/><br/>The impact of decriminalisation and what it would mean is another area that is linked to this.  It is a discussion that is happening in Britain at the moment and has been discussed in every session we have had here.  What will it mean and how can we learn about it? <br/><br/><b>Dr. Patricia Lohr:</b>The Deputy is correct to observe that Irish women currently have their abortions within the confines of the 1967 Act.  There are a number of problems for women with the way the Act is written.  A positive from the Act is that those definitions of the grounds for abortion are widely interpreted, and that has meant that most women who need to have an abortion are able to access that, but it is the case that there are some women who cannot.  For example, the door closes when the gestation passes 24 weeks unless there is a serious foetal anomaly or a threat to life.<br/><br/>The question of when a woman's life becomes endangered is an important one.  Where women present stating that they are suicidal, what are the mechanisms that one needs to go to in order to ensure that is the case?  That puts up serious barriers and creates a situation where women and doctors are struggling to ensure that they are working within the law, while what the woman needs is to end the pregnancy which is so burdening her.<br/><br/>The Deputy mentioned women accessing or trying to access Women on Web because they feel that the current framework under which abortion is delivered in the UK is a barrier.  It consists of having to go into a clinic and using the medications in the clinic, having to have more than one appointment and having to have a doctor sign off.  In some cases, although it is not a funding requirement some of the funding bodies require that a woman goes to her GP and gets a referral into abortion care.  For a woman who does not want her GP to know that she is having an abortion that is a barrier for her.  Women on Web do not provide medications to women living in Britain.  It would be an illegal activity if those women did obtain medications over the Internet.  Women on Web will provide women with advice and guidance on how they may obtain lawful abortion care.  However, we know from the requests received by Women on Web it is the case that the way that medical abortion is delivered and the restrictions on how women can obtain those medications is a barrier to them accessing services which could be provided safely and better.  If we were able to provide women with truly telemedical medical abortion services, such as those that exist in some parts of the United States, they could freely and openly have a consultation, perhaps using a web chat-type module.  They would have access to follow-up ultrasound scans, anti-D immunoglobulin etc., that women who obtain these medications over the Internet are not always able to access.  <br/><br/>Are my answers too lengthy?  I am trying to pick up on each of the points.</p></speech>

As Deputy Daly has pointed out, there are of course thousands of women in this State who owe a debt of gratitude for the provision of services that we simply cannot access in this State.</p> <p>  The witness is saying, on the issue of the provision of abortion pills, that the absolute best scenario is that treatment is delivered as close to home as possible for the woman herself.  Speaking practically, the necessary pills could be provided by a nurse; there would not need to be any level of specialist skills.  A GP could do it.  One need not work in the area of obstetrics-gynaecology.  Is that the case?</p> <p>  On the issue of conscientious objection, the witness referred to work that she had carried out in the United States where she provided a full range of health care.  The master of one of our maternity hospitals was very clear about what a full range of health care is for women.  In the facility where the witness provided that health care was there accommodation made for a person who might have a conscientious objection?  The issue is often raised by people.  I am sure that accommodation can be made, but I would like the benefit of the witness's experience.  </p></speech>

She or he may give those medications under the direction of a doctor.  A doctor must prescribe the medications and then the nurse or midwife may administer those medications and manage the abortion through to aftercare.  It is absolutely the case that nurses, midwives and GPs can do this safely.  What they need to do is understand the medications in the same way that they would understand any other medication they would provide, including the indications, the contraindications, the side effects, the potential complications and how to manage them.  It may not even be the case that a GP himself or herself would have to manage all of the complications.  They could work, for example, with a hospital setting.  If a woman needed a surgical evacuation for incomplete medical abortion they could work with a colleague to provide that if it was not provided in their office, although as I have said it is safe to provide early vacuum aspirations from an office-based setting.</p> <p>  It is normal to provide for conscientious objection no matter where one is working in obstetrics and gynaecology.  In fact, it is protected within the abortion Act for the treatment itself.  Individuals may enact their conscientious objection to participate in abortion treatment, but that does not absolve them from participating, for example, in the management of complications of abortions.  That has been the case in other places where I have worked, where I was providing the full range of women's health care.  </p></speech>

I join with recent speakers in acknowledging the service that her agency provides to a great number of Irish citizens, women and their partners, service which for a range of reasons are not available here.</p> <p>  I want to clarify an area that was covered by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.</p><p>On the matter of Irish women having surgical abortions,  71% compared to 28% for female residents in England and Wales, am I correct in assuming the 72% of English and Welsh concerned opt for the medical option for reasons of perceived safety or just for convenience?  As a corollary to that, if there is a safety factor, would it be of concern to Dr. Lohr's agency that such a high percentage of Irish women are not able to avail of the medical procedure?  To take it a little further, would Dr. Lohr - it is difficult logistically for many as it is a stressful time - advise women perhaps to stay a little longer?  Whereas Dr. Lohr referred to the fact they liked to fly in and out of the UK on the one day, it is a big decision for people to take.  I wonder if Dr. Lohr would encourage them to stay a little longer and, therefore, be able to avail of both options.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Patricia Lohr" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#R00200"><p>I will take the latter one first.  We do advise that women stay because the most likely time to experience a complication is in the first several hours or 24 hours after an abortion.  We talk to women about how it is preferable to stay but the reality is that most women cannot afford to stay, and it may not only be for financial reasons.  They cannot afford to be away for reasons of secrecy and stigma, to be unaccounted for.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked why so many women in Britain choose the medical option.  The reasons are very varied.  Some women perceive it as being safer because it is a non-interventional method of abortion.  Some women choose it because it is readily available.  It is offered in a number of locations.  When women have an unwanted pregnancy, they would like to be not pregnant as quickly as they can and if they can avail of a medical abortion more quickly than a surgical abortion, they may opt for that in order to achieve the abortion more quickly.</p> <p>  However, as I said previously, there are aspects of the process and the characteristic of the method that also matter.  It is non-surgical so they do not have to have an anaesthetic.  They can pass the pregnancy at home or be with their partner.  They just prefer that option to having to come into a clinic and have an interventional procedure which may be associated with an anaesthetic that they also do not want to be exposed to.</p></speech>

I am seeking clarification more than anything else because many of the questions have been asked.</p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Lohr could explain this to me.  It is possibly a lack of understanding on my behalf but when a person presents for an abortion at one of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service clinics - I am just trying to tease out the idea here - is there the opportunity for scans or anything else like that, particularly for late pregnancy presentations?  The reason I ask that question is that we had various speakers in over the past number of weeks who discussed the viability of the child in the womb.  I am just wondering if the service looks at that.  Dr. Lohr stated earlier, in response to one of the members who asked about fatal foetal abnormalities, that the service does not really record it.  Does the service record it?  My questions are about viability and scanning, and the crisis pregnancy management, particularly for a late presentation.</p></speech>

When I say, "viability", I mean in early pregnancy because we provide miscarriage management and if we identify a miscarriage or a miscarriage in process, we would have a different conversation with the woman than  if we were counselling her about an abortion.  We also scan to determine the gestational age.</p> <p>  BPAS does not scan for anomalies.  The women we treat who have been diagnosed with a foetal anomaly will normally have been referred in to us from a foetal medicine centre and it is not in our ability to perform those sorts of ultrasounds.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I am a member of a group called One Day More, a support group that came about because of the experiences of parents who received a poor prenatal diagnosis for their babies, that they would not survive either until or for very long after birth, or that their babies had significant developmental defects or anomalies that would impact them for life.  When we received the poor prenatal diagnosis for our children, some of us were fortunate enough to speak to someone who had gone through a similar experience.  We found this emotional and personal support to be of enormous help and in the end it is what prompted the setting up of One Day More.</p> <p>  The experiences of mothers like myself and families generally in maternity hospitals varies from very good indeed to very difficult and disappointing.  One mother was told at her initial scan that her baby looked like a Michelin man and was asked why she was persisting with a futile pregnancy.  This was followed up at each of her antenatal appointments, when she was asked to consider abortion and had to keep refusing until eventually she was advised to pick a plot to bury her daughter in.  This kind of language is very insensitive, as the committee will appreciate.  This little girl celebrated her third birthday last week.  Another mother who refused to abort her baby who had Down's syndrome was contacted after each hospital appointment to change her mind and consider abortion.  She did not change her mind and gave birth to her daughter last summer.  That experience was a very negative one for her.</p> <p>  Couples have also contacted One Day More after they came home from England having had an abortion and told us that if they had known of One Day More, they might have considered continuing with the pregnancy had they known there were supports and perinatal hospice care such as the kind we are offering and trying to develop.  All of this shows how necessary these supports and efforts are and I think it is safe to conclude that many couples would not choose abortion if perinatal hospice care was talked about more than abortion. </p> <p>  Some medical experts try to reassure people that abortion would only be available to women who want it, not to those who do not; they and their babies would be given every care and support throughout pregnancy and birth.  However, we can see from the experiences of women who contact One Day More that they did not receive this kind of support.  They were dealt with insensitively and felt like they were almost causing problems for the hospital in not going for abortion.  Some of our members&rsquo; babies died before birth, and some very shortly after birth.  Thankfully, some of those children are still alive and many are thriving against all predictions and expectations.</p> <p>  There is a very important point to make about this, which is that medical prognoses can be inaccurate, wrong, and occasionally very wrong or wide of the mark.  Doctors cannot always accurately predict outcomes and parents of sick babies can be amazed at how much better things turn out for their baby than was initially thought.  Hope is a vital human instinct and gives us strength and support at difficult times all through life.  Challenging pregnancies are really no different.  One Day More exists to offer support and hope to parents of very sick and disabled babies before, during and after birth. </p> <p>  As well as providing direct support to parents, One Day More raises funds for better provision of perinatal hospice care.  We also provide care boxes for families awaiting the arrival of their baby with a focus on making the time they have together as precious as possible.  When death is expected, the experience is bittersweet but it is incredibly uplifting to hear families describe the wonderful memories their time with their baby gave them and how much love they all felt towards each other and the baby.  Even babies who do not live very long can bring with them tremendous gifts which cannot be predicted or quantified but only felt by going through the experience.</p> <p>  The committee may not be aware of my own personal experience.  I became pregnant with my son, John, in early summer 2002.  He was my second child.  All was fine as far as I thought and I felt okay, though very tired, having a very active two year old daughter.  I had a routine scan at 24 weeks - I could not attend the appointment at 20 weeks, which is the more typical time for this scan - in mid-December 2002 and on that occasion the nurse said she saw something amiss.  She saw what she described as &ldquo;shortened limbs&rdquo; and could not see hands, although she said that might be positional.  My husband and I had to come back the next day for an in-depth scan and the committee can imagine how we felt overnight.  It was a very traumatic and difficult 24 hours</p> <p>  The next day, we went into the hospital and a consultant obstetrician carried out a very detailed scan which seemed to take forever, but was probably about 20 minutes.  He wanted to check everything out very intensely and take measurements.  I remember just looking away from the scanning machine the whole time, facing the wall.  I did not want to look anywhere near this machine.  I was numb and very anxious.  Afterwards he said these words which I will never forget: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a very serious abnormality.  The baby&rsquo;s limbs haven&rsquo;t grown, there are two very short arm buds and I can&rsquo;t even get a measurement on the legs.&rdquo;  He then showed us the pictures that he had saved and described in detail what he saw.  I remember looking at the baby&rsquo;s face on the scan and thinking he looked like my husband, especially round the eyes.  The doctor told us it was a little boy.  He finished by saying: &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never do anything but lie on a bed.  I am obliged to tell you that if you want to travel to England it won&rsquo;t be a problem.&rdquo;  Obviously, he was referring to the time limits that applied at that time, that there would not be a difficulty, because of the abnormality.  I remember instinctively replying that, no I would not go to England.  I had just seen my baby&rsquo;s face and even though I had no idea how I was going to cope, I felt very strongly that I had no right to interfere with this child&rsquo;s life in any way.  I just did not have that right.  This certainty was instinctive protectiveness on my part more than anything else at that time, but it does not mean I was not extremely scared.  I did not relish the prospect of how my life and my family's life would have to change.</p><p> I recall that during my pregnancy I felt jealous of women whose babies were not going to survive - their babies were destined to die in the womb or shortly afterwards - because at least their stories had a beginning, middle and end.  My story was not going to end soon and the future looked extremely uncertain and scary.</p><p>  I had a number of friends who were expecting babies at the time.  All of them were healthy, they had no problems and their babies arrived safe and sound.  I felt very sorry for myself in the midst of them and almost felt like I was living on another planet.  My bump attracted comments like "Gosh, you're so neat" or "I'm sure you're all thrilled to be having another baby".  I heard Claire Cullen-Delsol refer to this kind of experience during pregnancy.  I can certainly identify with all of those harrowing experiences and the feelings of isolation that all mothers with difficult pregnancies go through.  I agree with Claire and with others have called for much more antenatal care to be provided to women and their families when they have received a difficult diagnosis.  The fathers are also affected.  They do not know how to process their emotions or how to be.  The situation may not be happening to them but they feel so responsible.  As a country, looking forward, we need to invest in antenatal services, carry out research and provide for care.</p><p> I was very fortunate that I had support from family and friends, but I also pushed myself to stay connected to the world I lived in rather than go completely in on myself.  That is a human survival instinct.  When times are tough, one digs deep and one is frequently surprised by what one can cope with.  It is only afterwards, looking back, that one asks "How did I cope with that?"  One does cope.</p><p> I do not say this lightly, but we did not receive much in the way of support from the hospital, with one exception, namely, the "scan doctor", as we called him, who I had to attend separately from my own doctor.  All the other medical staff appeared unconcerned about us and our baby.  We just went through the motions and did what we had to do.  We turned up to the hospital, kept all of our appointments and I was repeatedly scanned.  I hunkered down and just wanted to get the birth out of the way.</p><p> I asked my consultant what would happen when John was born.  He said that nothing would happen because there was no reason to think there would be a need for medical intervention and the birth would be treated like a normal birth.  On the day that John was born, I went into hospital around 10 a.m.  The doctor broke my waters and I went into labour.  My husband and I were in a room and there was only a student midwife with us.  A neonatologist who I think was a senior registrar, came in and spoke about our baby.  He took a phone call while there and said "Oh yeah, weird case - no limbs".  That is a typical example of the treatment we received.  I was so focused on blocking everything out and getting on with having my baby that I said nothing.  I restrained my husband from objecting because he was rather upset by that comment.</p><p> John was born just after 2 p.m. that day.  My consultant told me about half an hour before John was born that he had to leave the hospital to see other patients in his consulting rooms if that was okay with me.  At that point, I really did not care who was there because I felt very alone.  I got the feeling that the consultant was choosing not to be present at the birth.  It was not as if he was not leaving to deal with an urgent matter.  He did not return to the hospital that day.  I recall that he came to me the next day.  I do not know if he ever went to see John.  I will explain why I say that.  I was separated from John after he was born and I do not recall seeing him for the rest of the time I was in hospital, which was about four days.</p><p> John was delivered by a doctor who I had never met before.  Right after John was born, I recall seeing other doctors.  I remember seeing a whole lot of people wearing white coats standing at the foot of my bed when John had literally only been born a few minutes before.  One of them announced that the baby would be taken to the special care baby unit for tests.  He was not sick and I recall that his APGAR score was 9.  John was physically hale, hearty and healthy other than the physical abnormality.  I was heartbroken that he could not be with me as I wanted to breast-feed him.  I had let the hospital know that but they were just taking him away, I felt, in a way that just suited them rather than me.  At such a time one is vulnerable and tired.  These people were complete strangers and they looked serious and expressionless, so I did not challenge them.</p><p> John spent his first two days in the special care baby unit while I was in a room on another floor of the hospital.  I do not quite know where I was; I was I was not in the typical maternity wing.  I can only describe this as a horrendous time because no provision was made for me and John in terms of our comfort and privacy.</p><p> I remember that the weather was warm that April.  The sun shone through the window of the special care unit and I had to sit on a plastic waiting room chair.  Any woman who has had a baby will know that is not a very comfortable place to be for the first few days.  I felt that I was in the way because there were lots of sick and premature babies around me.  John was not sick or premature but he was in an incubator.  I just felt that I was in the way.  There was no nurse there for us.  The feeding did not go at all well and I was very distressed by the whole event.  I so wanted to give my son, John, an experience of closeness because he could not use his hands or feet to move or comfort himself at all.  He just did not have them and I really wanted to bond with him.  After two days, John was unceremoniously, and unannounced, brought down to me.  Finally, we got some privacy and I was able to breast-feed him in peace and that went very well for ten months or so.</p><p> I remember that it was very awkward going into the communal changing room for nappy changing.  I tried it a few times but silence fell as soon as I came in the door.  All of the chat between the new mothers just stopped.  So, I just did it in my room.  I just could not deal with it really.  Overall, I could not wait to get out of that hospital.  I did not feel anybody was particularly nice to us except the one doctor who carried out the scans and who I went back to during my third pregnancy.</p><p> So, back to a vision for future prenatal and perinatal care.  One Day More, Every Life Counts and organisations like Hugh&rsquo;s House represent concrete examples of reaching out to women with very poor prenatal diagnoses and prognoses.  These efforts are a drop in the ocean compared with what could be achieved in the way of supports if our Government would undertake research and investment in these areas.  Women who have gone through this know what it is like and what would help other women.  They are a tremendous resource to tap into if there is a will on the part of the Government to really look at giving women meaningful support.</p><p> It is very disappointing to see that all through this process, and that of the Citizens&rsquo;  Assembly, and during the past five years or so, the only serious focus of political effort has been towards introducing abortion.  Looking back, I can honestly say - hand on heart - that the experience of having my son in 2003 has had a hugely positive impact on me, my family and beyond.  I could not have foreseen this at the time that I was carrying him but that is the nature of life.  We cannot predict the future, how things will go, how we will feel or what help we might be able to get down the line.  It is a mistake to plan these things out because we risk painting for ourselves a bleaker picture than what actually happens.  That is a human tendency.  We always look at the dark side or the worst-case scenario.  Doctors feel duty bound to provide that in order to avoid unrealistic expectations.  It is very important, therefore, to have these positive supports there for women.</p><p> I would see the introduction of abortion as something akin to deeming people like my son as unworthy of legal protection before birth - removing his right to life.  I fail to see how that could become a new definition of progress.  Repealing the eighth amendment would amount to that.  My story is not an isolated one.  Every day, new stories about women and families feeling pressure to have abortions emerge.  Some people will find it hard to believe the stories I have mentioned.  However, pressure from hospitals and medical staff to abort babies with special needs does happen.  It is sadly what happens to people; it is their experience.</p><p>I must ask why the medical system seems to want to encourage women to opt for abortion.  If we do not acknowledge this as a reality, it will keep happening and the pressure will grow more intense and direct, particularly if abortion is legalised and takes place in hospitals and clinics here.  This type of pressure must logically account for the current position in England where 90% of babies diagnosed with Down's syndrome are aborted.  The figures for Denmark and Iceland are even worse and would be 100%.  Abortion can happen at any time up to birth at nine months.  I have read that such abortions can even happen during birth, for instance, in cases where the disability or defect has not been picked up antenatally and the woman states she cannot cope. <br/><br/>The provision of abortion is increasingly being questioned in other countries as people see where legalisation leads.  Alternatives to abortion and support for women with difficult or unplanned pregnancies are also offered in these countries.  However, because they do not have anything like the eighth amendment in place and abortion is widely lawful, they face obstacles and difficulties carrying out their work.  Organisations which do life sustaining work are stymied and prevented from reaching out to women in a supportive way to give them the opportunity - not a choice - to keep their baby. <br/><br/>We can see from other countries that abortion is a large and profitable global industry.  Its practice, standards and methods are not always women centred, as is claimed, but may be more about profit.  Just last month, the Care Quality Commission in Britain issued a damning report on the abortion provider, Marie Stopes.  It revealed that staff were being paid bonuses to encourage women to go through with abortions.  The inspectors found evidence of a policy in all 70 Marie Stopes clinics in the country directing staff to contact women who had decided not to go through with an abortion, offering them a new appointment.  This is tantamount to placing pressure on women to opt for abortion and is rightly causing people to rethink their support for abortion and look at alternatives which genuinely care for women and babies.  This is just one of several recent scandals involving the abortion industry in England and elsewhere.<br/><br/>It is extraordinary that we are discussing having a referendum to introduce abortion and no committee is examining what abortion has led to in other countries.  I am not saying this to disparage or offend anyone but because I genuinely find this extraordinary.  A few years ago, a conference attended by a well known abortionist, Dr. John Parsons, was held in Britain under the title, Don't Mention the 'A'-Word.  Britain is a country where abortion is viewed as okay.  The title of the conference betrays that nobody likes to talk about abortion and it was referred to as &quot;the A-word&quot; for this reason.  Dr. Parsons stated the following at the conference:</p><blockquote>When you are doing termination procedures, especially later terminations, you are exposed to a rather gross, destructive process dealing with bits and pieces of fetuses, which are not very nice...  That is why we are not keen on people observing abortions.  I was recently asked if I would have a journalist join me at work, who wanted to write for <i>The Daily Telegraph.</i></blockquote></speech>

These are not the words of a pro-life activist but someone who performed abortions as part of his career.  When I first read Dr. Parsons's words, I could not help thinking about the abortion movement's repeated claim that women must be trusted to decide about abortion.  If the movement really believes women can be trusted with this decision, which ends their baby's life, the abortion debate would and should be more open about telling women what happens to their baby during abortion and how the procedure is carried out.  I reiterate that I am not raising these issues out of any disrespect for the committee but because I respect democracy and want complete fairness and openness in the debate.</p> <p>  Since 2012, there has been a working group on abortion established by the Government, two sets of exhaustive Oireachtas hearings and legislation in 2013.  We had five Private Members' Bills introduced in the D&aacute;il, a Citizens' Assembly and now another Oireachtas committee examining the issue, all of which have focused on broadening the grounds for abortion.  None of these committees or debates focus on alternatives to abortion.  Earlier today, the committee heard from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, England's largest abortion provider.  The Citizens' Assembly also heard from this organisation.  Why has no space been provided to explore positive alternatives to abortion and hear from the many life care groups and service providers here and in other countries?  What about wonderful projects such as Hugh's House, which provides a home from home for families of babies who are in hospital with potentially life-limiting conditions, or A Perfect Gift, a group of dedicated mums who prepare and deliver welcome baskets to families of all newborn babies with Down's syndrome, or Anew, an organisation which works hard to address the scandal and alleviate the problem of up to 20 homeless pregnant women living on our streets on any given night, which is scandalous?  These are just some of the initiatives already taking place to offer support to women and families experiencing challenging pregnancy related circumstances.  They are initiatives that work to unite rather than divide society and they should be front and centre of any debate on the eighth amendment. </p> <p>  Speaking from personal experience, I agree with those who say abortion is an outdated procedure, which is being increasingly undermined by scientific knowledge about life in the womb and the humanity of pre-born babies.  In the 50 years since abortion was legalised in England, nearly 9 million babies have lost their lives in a brutal and sudden way.  This has caused a deep, hidden pain for countless women who were convinced by the sloganeering about choice that denies abortion has any adverse after effects on women.  The experience of many women who have experienced pain and regret for long periods, some of whom eventually seek and receive counselling and help to recover from their trauma, shows that the claim that abortion has no repercussions for women is untrue.</p> <p>  The eighth amendment on the other hand acknowledges the right to life.  It does not claim to be its author - it protects it.  Those campaigning for repeal of the eighth amendment do not seem to regard the right to life as inalienable and innate to every human being.  Instead, they seem to wish to treat it as something granted or limited by the State based on a majority consensus on who falls within the categories of persons who are entitled to have their lives protected against all comers.  If this is true, the State can also remove the right to life, which leaves all of us vulnerable at some stage of life to falling within a category of persons whom the State does not protect. </p> <p>  We must learn again what human rights are and that no one has the authority to grant or remove them from any human being.  On World Prematurity Day last week, members may have heard a consultant paediatric cardiologist, Dr. Paul Oslizlok, explain on RT&Eacute; the reasons there are more cases of complicated heart problems in babies in Ireland than in England, Scotland and Wales.  His response to a question as to why Ireland's rate of operations is so high was revealing.  He stated we do not have termination of pregnancy on the island of Ireland, whereas in England, Scotland and Wales these pregnancies would probably have been terminated.  We can see, therefore, that our doctors have gained world class experience of paediatric heart surgery precisely because of the presence of the eighth amendment and we do not resort to aborting these babies.  This expertise would most definitely be lost if the position were to change. </p> <p>  We have two paths ahead of us.  If the eighth amendment is repealed or amended, we will deny certain unborn babies the legal protection to life.  If we vote to keep the eighth amendment, we can and must commit to making Ireland a society worthy of the most vulnerable and defenceless members of the human family by fully resourcing the provision of high quality support and care for pregnant women during and after pregnancy in order that they will have the opportunity and confidence to keep going and know they will continue to be cared for and helped, irrespective of the challenges they may face.</p><p>That is the end of my submission.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Our hearts go out to anybody in that kind of situation.  On the degree to which non-directive counselling was available to the witness, this is something we have raised in this committee on numerous occasions.  The witness attended an Irish hospital and she referred to directive counselling towards abortion rather than non-directive counselling which sought to help her out in the circumstances in which she found herself.  We note and accept the points the witness makes about that.  How many such instances does the witness know of?  Ms McDermott referred to the fact that there have been countless similar cases with abortion as the solution.  Does she recognise that there may be some women in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, for want of a description, who may not be able to deal with the eventual outcome and trauma?  Some people have the gift of being able to stand up to a situation, as the witness did, even alone, as it were.  Some may not.  How does Ms McDermott see that and how does she feel about the fact that some women who are pregnant and maybe isolated and alone and who might not have any counselling except of a directive nature might fear the outcome?  What advice would Ms McDermott give them?</p></speech>

That was 2002.  I would not describe it as counselling in the sense that there was nobody who stepped in and heard our side of things.  On the day it happened I remember we asked if there was anyone we could talk to and the doctors and the staff looked around generally and eventually somebody went and got a chaplain because there just was not anybody.  The doctor just said there would not be a problem going and he said he was obliged to give me certain information.  He was performing that.  It was not directive or non-directive.  He was just complying with his legal obligations.  When the Deputy talks about fatal foetal abnormalities, again that is a term that does not have a medical meaning and I think it is very important.  It keeps being trotted out but it is medically meaningless.</p></speech>

In so far as abortion being a solution to a life that, again I have tried to say that not being able to deal with the eventual outcome is not something that can be predicted, and any woman in any kind of crisis pregnancy will feel frightened and will feel that she cannot cope.  That is how I felt.  I am not painting myself as any particularly strong member of society.  I felt I could not cope.  I often crumbled and was found in a puddle of tears in the corner of a room.  My daughter was probably largely abandoned during that time.</p> <p>  That is why I think the answer to that dilemma is the provision of proper supports.  At the time a diagnosis is given, right there and then there should be a pathway of care that is immediately activated for women and their families to support them and which does not describe their babies as anomalies or fatally ill.  They are their babies, they have been pregnant, they have carried their babies, they have a bond and a relationship with them already and then suddenly all this information is coming at them kind of to turn away from that.  I can understand why women feel that way and that abortion is the only way out and the only way that they are going to cope. However, that is the challenge for us as a country and I think it is one that people increasingly are coming to recognise, that we have to provide proper, meaningful and sustained antenatal support which women should not have to go looking for.  That is how I would deal with that.  It cannot be predicted in advance that women are going to be able to cope with it or not.</p></speech>

How does Ms McDermott see that other group of women who may not be able to stand up to the potential trauma, who may be frightened, and who may have no counselling of any description either?  What do they do?  How does she think we should treat them?</p></speech>

However, the reality is they are pregnant with a very sick baby.  They have to be supported in some way.  Even if they have an abortion, that is going to be a hugely traumatic experience for them.  They will likely be quite far on in their pregnancies and abortion is an invasive procedure and can be quite a violent procedure for any woman to endure.  She can feel very isolated in any event.  That is the reality.  We cannot take this away, we cannot itemise one experience, and I am particularly strong and I have a strong way of coping with things.  It is instinctive for women to nurture and we do it physiologically.  Our bodies nurture the babies when we are pregnant.  They do not distinguish between the fact that they are sick or they are not going to live for very long.  A woman's body does what it needs to do and a woman lives out of that place, very much on a physiological level, during pregnancy.  That is why abortion is a very destructive and invasive procedure that interrupts entirely what the body and the mind want to do.  Women must be dealt with very compassionately.  I do not judge or criticise.  I fully understand the fear that creeps in.  That is the word that was used and was exactly what I felt at the time: huge fear.  The challenge for the rest of society is to support, in a real and meaningful way, the woman who is feeling that.  Her baby should also be supported in order that the baby's rights are upheld in all of this, and in order that she does not have to walk this walk alone, be it to an abortion clinic or through a natural labour at some point.  Either way that baby is going to have be delivered.  There is a compassionate and humane way to do it, which I would say is the natural way, with all the supports.  Sometimes that is a physical propping up of women and it should be constantly there for them rather than sending them on the lonely journey to an abortion procedure.</p></speech>

It is really important that she has come and she has told us her personal story.  We were all probably horrified at the cold way in which she and her family were treated in the hospital.  That would certainly be a cause of concern to all of us here.  I refer also to the experiences that she described in the beginning of her presentation around women being asked at each appointment to consider abortion and women being contacted after their hospital appointment to change their minds.</p><p>Everyone present would view that as wrong and inappropriate.  As Deputy Durkan stated, all counselling should be non-directive.  There should be no attempt to make a woman make a decision that is not the one that is right for her.</p><p> My question is on this issue.  Ms McDermott described that experience as well as her own, but that practice seems to have been at variance with medical guidelines.  One Day More provided examples, although I only got them shortly before I arrived.  They include the examples of Anna Kate, Grace and Laura.  In each case, there seemed to be a more positive experience of the hospital's treatment.  To what extent does Ms McDermott's group have information on the various ways in which people are treated in Irish maternity hospitals?</p><p> My next question is on perinatal care.  We received a presentation in which that type of care at a particular maternity hospital was described.  Everyone would be supportive of that as well as the case that Ms McDermott makes for high-quality support and pathways of care for pregnant women.  In the experience of Ms McDermott's group, is there much difference in how women are treated by various hospitals?  If so, what recommendations should our committee make in that regard?</p></speech>

We are not in a position, and do not have the resources, to conduct meaningful research in hospitals.  The Deputy is right, in that some people thankfully have a positive experience.  They are given support and are not put under pressure.  Increasingly, however, other people feel like they are being put under pressure.  We do not have answers as to why.  We can only report that it is happening based on what people tell us.  On occasion, people even change hospitals because they cannot withstand the pressure.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about this not being in line with medical guidelines.  It is anecdotal evidence as reported to us, but we have no reason to doubt it.  It should not happen.  No hospital should treat a woman in that way who has stated her intention to continue with her pregnancy.  That should be fully supported.  Perhaps the problem is that there is an additional cost in the provision of perinatal hospice care within the antenatal setting.  Hospitals must manage budgets and so on.  I cannot say, but it is for the Government to inquire as to why women are going through this kind of experience.  I am glad to be able to report that it is what they are going through.  It should not happen.  Where women have declared their intention to proceed, they and their families should be fully supported and their babies' lives, no matter how deformed or short lived, should be honoured and respected fully.</p></speech>

To join with Deputy O'Sullivan, I am disgusted to hear that Ms McDermott was treated that way in a hospital.  It is not okay.  There should be proper care, counselling and support for every family in that situation.  I hope that it is not a regular occurrence.  It is good that we got to hear that side of things.</p> <p>  Could Ms McDermott tell us more about One Day More?  When did she get involved in the organisation and how many others are involved?

When people have a story like this one, they tend to meet eventually.  It came about so as to determine what could be done to reach out to women in pregnancy.  The One Day More name came from one of our members.  She knew that her baby was not going to live for very long and she wanted to have one day more with him.<br/><br/>There are approximately 25 members.  It is small - there is no head office or resources.  We operate locally.  We have managed to reach out to approximately 20 families.  There are leaflets in hospitals as well as an online presence, so people can make contact that way or by phone.  Much of our support is provided over the phone, given the geographical limitations.<br/><br/>We provide care boxes to hospitals containing blankets, hats and memory-making things, for example, footprint and handprint kits, as well as photo frames and baby books to read to a baby.  There is a particular book called <i>A Gift of Time: Continuing Your Pregnancy When Your Baby's Life Is Expected to Be Brief</i>, which is available in a perinatal hospice care setting in America and answers questions that people in this situation have.  People tell us that the care boxes are valuable to them because they have heard a great deal of negative information from doctors and hospitals about the worst case scenario, what will happen and dire predictions.  They love getting something that is a positive, a box that says, &quot;Your baby is your baby&quot;, there is another way to perceive the situation and they can have time with their babies.<br/><br/>That is what we try to do.  It is a grassroots, low-key group, but with will, resources and investment, it could become tremendous.  It tries to feed into Hugh's House and other organisations like Anew to provide care.  Some people who make contact after having abortions might need counselling.  We put them on that road.  We cannot provide it ourselves, but we try to support them at that point in their journey.</p></speech>

That was informative.  It sounds like One Day More is doing fantastic work.</p> <p>  A lady presented to us a number of weeks ago.  She was from a group that was searching for services in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.  I realise that Ms McDermott does not accept that as a medical term but, like her, the lady told her story.  I was moved by it and found her story upsetting.  There were some similarities.  She spoke about how she found people asking when the baby was due and their personal commentary on her bump, her and her baby extremely distressing.  She had all of the guidance and support from her doctors and her family and everyone knew that the baby was not going to survive.  She did not have the means to travel and, even if she had, travel was not an option because she had a young child.  She said that she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder following that experience.  This is an individual who was not pressured and knew all of the facts.  She is saying that the absence of choice has had a severe impact on her mental health.  Does Ms McDermott see people's difficulty when dealing with such a situation?  What would she say to a woman like that?</p></speech>

We share that common ground.  We had the bumps that people commented on and we did not have answers to give.  It was traumatic.  She had supports, but not of the professional kind.  When I talk about support, I mean support in dealing with that kind of experience.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about it being harrowing.  When one has a difficult pregnancy, there is no easy way out.  It is traumatic and painful and there is a great deal of emotion.</p><p>However, in my experience, while after John was born I had moments of extreme sadness when I looked at him and thought of all the things he could not do, I had the consolation of knowing I was doing my best for him.  This was his life and this was how it had to go for him.  I do not like the idea of any woman suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and I think that is avoidable if she is supported properly and fully in the way she endures and suffers that.  Part of this would be just going through one's pregnancy and facing the world and facing people.</p><p> I will tell the committee an awful story.  My baby was nine days old, and I remember going around Superquinn, as it was at the time.  I had him in a flat pram with a blanket, so all that could be seen was the head, and he was asleep.  A woman - I did not know who she was; she was one of those ladies in supermarkets who loves coming up to new babies - came up to me, literally pulled the blanket back and just stood there in shock and said nothing.  I felt so invaded.  My privacy was invaded and I just ran away.  That is people.  We all have these stories and experiences.  I think people like this kind of experience of people coming together to support one another.  There is a kind of emotional propping up of one another that needs to happen, and women who have gone through these kinds of pregnancies can do that.  I do not think abortion takes any of that away, and the trauma and invasiveness of abortion can almost contribute to a worse mental outcome, perhaps.  I do not have medical data to back that up, but sometimes people say they felt stronger because they did the right thing, did right by their baby and kept going with it.  There is a strength to be derived from doing that, and that support is still the answer.</p></speech>

Many people remark to me that there is a real lack of support for parents who find themselves in unplanned and difficult situations in Ireland, and Ms McDermott's experience has proven this to be true.  She spoke about the contrast between the two visions, as she sees it, for these parents.  Will she talk to us about whether she feels we can provide the right support while introducing abortion as well?</p></speech>

I do not think those two care paths sit well together.  The experience in England is that when abortion is an option, it becomes the default option, the expected option, and women can lose their choice and their freedom and can feel almost that people want them to have an abortion because it seems the easiest thing for everyone else and all round.  If abortion is legalised in this country, there will not be the will to invest in anything that will conflict with it.  People will go one direction for the abortion clinic in a hospital and another direction for all the perinatal hospice care.  Those two things seem to me to be mutually exclusive, and it would be very difficult in a concrete, real way for the two to sit together.</p></speech>

There are circumstances in which medical intervention is required to save a woman's life, and we understand that.  We understand that a woman may die in the event of her baby being ill or of her getting sick during pregnancy, but the eighth amendment is a positive, life-saving measure because it says we as a country stand for the rights of all our citizens.  However, we cannot just have the eighth amendment and then leave women without the supports, and this is where we need to go forward.  The eighth amendment has given some women a little time to come to terms with crisis or unintended pregnancies.  It is a valuable tool for us to build on for the future to create a new vision for difficult pregnancies.  Abortion is old.  It is an old procedure and process and has created a lot of wreckage.  We can do better, and the eighth amendment is a good starting point, but we need to provide proper supports.</p></speech>

I know everyone very much appreciates it, and not one of us thinks it was in any way easy for her to attend here and do this.  We are very grateful for the perspective she has given us.</p> <p>  It is true to say, and Ms McDermott echoes this herself, that every pregnancy has its own uniqueness and that every woman who is pregnant is deserving of support.  It is fairly obvious from the picture Ms McDermott paints that that support just is not there.  The word "patchy" probably does a service to access to perinatal hospice services in this country.  It is a very generous description because such services are practically non-existent.  To be able to provide women with a full range of care, such services should be in place.</p> <p>  I would like to try to build a picture in my head.  Ms McDermott provided for us stories of people who are members of her organisation.  Grace and - I will probably mispronounce this - Maite were born in Galway and the Coombe, respectively, but the papers do not say where Anna Kate, John Paul, Laura, Lily or Luke were born.  Were they born in Ireland, as in, the Twenty-six Counties?</p></speech>

I have just two questions for her.  First, will she bring us up to date on the experience her members have had in reporting this and how it was dealt with?  That level of directive counselling is not provided for within the law.  These are very serious matters.  Ms McDermott talks about conversations that have happened within her earshot and she refers to women who felt, or were, compelled to abort babies.  That kind of directive instruction should never happen and is not allowable.</p><p>I imagine it made those women feel extremely angry and upset.</p><p> Would Ms McDermott not agree that any woman who chooses not to go down that road also has the right to feel angry and upset if she is prevented from making the choice that she feels she should?  If a woman in this jurisdiction who simply cannot continue with a pregnancy is compelled to go through with it, would Ms McDermott not accept that those women also have the right to feel angry and upset that they have been forced into that situation?  Two wrongs do not make a right.  It is not right to compel a woman to terminate a pregnancy, but a woman has a right to feel angry if she is compelled to continue with a pregnancy.  We have heard descriptions and personal evidence from women here and from one woman in particular, Claire Cullen-Delsol, and the post traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, experienced, a very serious medical condition that can occur as a direct result of being compelled to continue with a pregnancy.  Would Ms McDermott not agree that those women have the right to feel angry and upset just as other women do who feel they were compelled in any way?</p></speech>

She is in touch with these people as part of her organisation's work.  Will she relate to us their experiences when they reported the directive counselling, which is clearly outside of the legal framework within this jurisdiction?

What was the experience when that was reported and how that was treated?</p></speech>

We do not take this information to construct a dossier to use against hospitals.  If the Deputy is curious to know and investigate the fact that people hear this counselling, that would have to be done as an investigative process.  People make contact with us either online or after they get a leaflet or a care box from the hospital.  They tell us their stories and in the course of their stories, they say what they were told, what they went through and that they do not know what to do.  We are not there to start castigating hospitals.  It is a point we make but we are there to support people going through this traumatic journey.  We are not there to file a dossier but people's experiences suggest that medical guidelines and protocol are not being followed.  While we are told that all supports will be given to pregnant women should they wish to continue with their pregnancy, that is not what women seem to experience, to our understanding, but we are not collecting data on this as such.</p></speech>

I had to step out to speak in the D&aacute;il but I was here when she making her opening statement.  Like others, I know it is difficult to come here and talk about a very personal story.  From the word go, in order that Ms McDermott knows where I am coming from, I believe in the right to choose, including the right to choose to continue with a pregnancy and be supported with that pregnancy.  I have to say that the language and sensitivity Ms McDermott talked about and her experience and the experience of others within the maternity services should be of concern to us all.  It is interesting that when we had people in from the group Terminations for Medical Reasons, they made the point that one cannot change a diagnosis but one can change how people are treated.  They would make different arguments from Ms McDermott but we need to say something with regard to how the experience in maternity hospitals has to change in order that people feel supported in the decisions they make.  It would be very useful for us to hear what those changes would be.  Our report will be intended to respond to a range of different things.  I see this as an issue that should be very much something that is provided within our health system.  What does Ms McDermott have to say about changes she would specifically seek in maternal services?  I take the point about perinatal care.  Most of that is funded by charity rather than the health service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Liz McDermott" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#Z01800"><p>That is a big question.  Changes I would like to see include having a whole system put in place at the point of delivery of bad news to a pregnant woman so as to deal with it and provide support.  That would require a big investment and considerable research.  Consultation with families who have gone through this would be really useful, as would reaching out with an open mind and open views to everybody to contribute truthfully and honestly.  I have tried to outline the negative experiences people have reported to groups like One Day More.  My own experience was that when one is in the medical process and dealing with feelings about one's baby, one is also interacting with doctors.  A person is just another patient number to them, part of a clinical process.  It is not quite a conveyor belt but there is a slight element of that.  One feels like one is in the way and causing trouble.  All of that requires psychological and emotional support and another care pathway in order that one does not sit in waiting rooms with all the healthy pregnant women.  There should be another system that would kick in.</p><p>Considering the American model would be a good starting point for the committee.  It would be great if that could be recommended to the Government and perinatal hospice care highlighted as an urgent requirement in order that women find out at the beginning what is going to happen and what the path ahead for them will look like.  If that does not happen, women do not know what the road ahead will be for them but are looking down a very uncertain and scary path that they have to walk on their own.  Going for an abortion can seem not like a choice but, rather, the only option one can take at that point, which is the point of decision.  If the perinatal hospice and antenatal support care package was put in place, it would hopefully render redundant the situation of having to abort one's baby.  My desire is for women to have an option not to have to abort their babies because the country provides a world-class, very progressive modern and supportive system of care for them.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated by all members and I know how difficult it must be for her.</p> <p>  There has been much discussion of crisis pregnancies at the committee but there is no doubt that a diagnosis in the latter part of a wanted pregnancy that reveals a condition that will limit the life of the baby is utterly devastating.  Ms McDermott presented very well that in those circumstances help and support are absolutely critical and there is no doubt that the State has failed people in that regard.  People who have had such a diagnosis and chosen to continue with the pregnancy, as Ms McDermott did, may have received great solace from that and felt it was the right decision for them.  All members have met such people and it is very useful that they give their testimony.  We have met others who chose a different ending and felt the best solution for them, factoring in all considerations, was to terminate the pregnancy.  Many of them told of getting solace from the experiences they had in Liverpool Women's Hospital or whatever place it may have been.  There is no right answer to the issue but there is a right answer for each individual pregnancy.  Is it not the case that the only way of respecting that is by allowing people to make the latter choice in Ireland, surrounded by supports and family?  A change in the constitutional position will not affect the decision making of those who decide to continue with the pregnancy and will only alter the position for those who decide to end it.</p></speech>

To say that people want to make the right decision for themselves is to completely ignore the baby in all of this.  It is a separate human life and it is very difficult to airbrush that life out of the narrative.  Nobody can say with any real certainty what way things will go for a baby who is sick or results from a crisis pregnancy or whose mother feels very unsupported or cannot face having a baby at that time.  Our legal system cannot provide for every eventuality and individualise our laws for that but it is incumbent upon us to support every woman.  If we affirm the right to life of children in the womb, the pre-born, we are also supporting their mothers, fathers and families and it is incumbent on us to invest in that in a meaningful way.  Ending a pregnancy is ending a life and that is an uncomfortable reality we try to skirt around.  We do not like coming up against it but it is a reality.  Sometimes I think about what would have happened if I had chosen to have an abortion, gone down that road and listened to the advice around me.  A woman at a baptism party asked me had I not had a scan, by which she meant to ask why on earth I had the baby.  A dehumanising language is applied to disabled people.  We uphold equality and welcome disable people and support the Paralympics and Special Olympics but we do not support women who are facing into a lifetime of caring for those children.  I sometimes think about what it would have meant if I had chosen to have an abortion and get rid of John.  I would not have had to move house or look for a special car and it would have made life far easier in many ways but I would have missed out on him rolling over at four months and smiling at me and his getting up at nearly two years of age and starting to walk across the floor, which I never expected.  It was a complete surprise to me that he could do that.  It is not just my family and I who would have missed out but also the wider community.  I have brought with me a poem John's sixth class teacher wrote for him when he was leaving.  It is called "Ode to John".  The teacher is not a man who usually writes poetry.  It is an astonishing testament to the life of John McDermott.  He is not mine to do anything with and I cannot get past that.  Many people in this country think the same way.</p></speech>

Does Ms McDermott not recognise the very tragic testimony of people who made a different decision and felt it was the best decision for them?  Many of the points she is making are about women feeling pressure to abort.  I have been involved in this issue for a long time and have never met anybody who felt pressurised into having an abortion but I have met plenty of people who decided to have an abortion, most of whom were satisfied it was the best decision for them.  Some have regrets.  I have met people who put their children up for adoption and had regrets about that but it was their decision.  The only way of respecting everybody's decision and supporting them is to change the legislative position.</p></speech>

I am trying to say that one cannot make that call at that time.  I could not have known how John would impact on me, my family and many others in many ways.  It is not possible to say it was the best thing because one cannot know that.  One has bracketed out any other outcome.  Having a baby is a good and positive thing.  Women have possibly become a bit afraid of it because it interferes with our careers and there are issues in terms of a lack of supports for women going back to work.  All those things can come crowding into one's mind when one is pregnant.  We have to face up to the fact that people decide to have abortions and there is such a thing as abortion regret and some people have experienced serious amounts of emotional trauma that they did not expect after an abortion.</p></speech>

The situation is bad now, when we do not provide for abortion in Ireland.  Why does the witness think that if we provided for abortion things would get worse or that there is any link between the two things at all?</p><p> The reality is that 170,000 Irish women travelled for abortions, mainly to Britain, since the eighth amendment became law.  If we acknowledge that that reality exists, and those people do not have a right to determine their own pregnancy, what is the solution?  Should we compel them to continue with the pregnancy?  How do we deal with that when many of them say that it was the right decision for them?  If we recognise that that was genuinely their decision, do we say they should be compelled to continue the pregnancy?  I would like to grapple with that question.

Deputy Daly, in principle, supports abortion as a procedure and a solution to a crisis pregnancy or problem pregnancy.  I do not see it as a solution to anything, because when someone is pregnant, she is pregnant.  One cannot turn the clock back.  It does not make her un-pregnant, and it is certainly a harrowing event for her baby, who is still her baby.  I know that there can be all sorts of circumstances and I am not trying to judge anybody in this.</p> <p>  However, I would say that abortion becomes an industry.  There are people who have vested interests in making abortion available.  There is profit in all of this too, and that can lead to a certain amount of pressure on women.  I do not want to get into an ideological debate with members on this, because I am not qualified to answer all of these questions.  We either uphold the right to life and apply it to all our citizens, regardless of whether they are at the beginning of life, at the end of life or sick during life, or we start to qualify it.  We bracket out certain cohorts, or we say that it is not for us to say who has the right to life.  I say this with all sensitivity.  I understand the difficulties women in particular are in. </p></speech>

I know she is not medically or legally qualified, and that is not undermining her.  However, we do have to take evidence into account.  Ms McDermott said that abortion was a violent procedure, that it was a harrowing experience for the baby and that if people knew what it was they would not choose that option.  We must be careful.  The evidence would contradict that view.  The medical evidence is that a foetus does not feel pain until after 24 weeks.  We heard testimony of many instances of fatal foetal diagnosis where people who went to Liverpool had the baby delivered and were able to hold it, and they got solace from that.  Of course, in the early stages, an abortion is just like a heavy period.  That is uncomfortable, but it is not violent.</p></speech>

Has Ms McDermott never dealt with a parent who would make a complaint to the Irish Medical Organisation, the management of the hospital or the Garda about this sort of harassment?  If she has not does she think that encouraging these people to complain, so that this type of treatment is dealt with, would be a good role for her charity?  Everybody would find it quite shocking that any parent would be treated in this manner.  That is one question.</p> <p>  Moreover, Ms McDermott spoke about the abortion industry, and how its for-profit nature puts another pressure on people to have an abortion.  I know she does not want to get into a big philosophical discussion about it, but would that logic not tell her that abortion should therefore be free, safe and legal, so that there is no profit attached to it?  The corollary of what Ms McDermott is arguing is that abortion should become a maternity or reproductive service that women can avail of.  </p> <p>  I would like Ms McDermott to to comment on the fact that her group is angry about the way hospitals have treated these parents, and the discussion about how badly they were treated is what brought them together, yet they do not seem to complain about it.  </p> <p>  I would also imagine that Ms McDermott is very angry that this Government and other Governments have not signed up to the United Nations Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, that they continue to cut special needs services for children in schools, and that we have over 3,000 homeless children.  I wonder if her charity is engaged in fighting those kinds of things, and in trying to improve those aspects of society for the children that are actually born.  I am really interested as to why they do not complain about the treatment that is meted out to them as parents. </p></speech>

Lots of people asked why I did not write a letter to complain about the hospital and the treatment and tell the whole story.  I have to say, whenever it happens to a woman, she just wants to be away fro it.  She just does not want to go back there.  One is too upset at the time to even say the words.  This happened to me in  2002 and 2003, and I am finally able to talk about it without getting upset.  That is a real reason people would not want to jump up and down and make an official complaint about it.  They are very vulnerable.  However, it is important for there to be somewhere for people to go with that experience.  I agree that if it can be collated into some kind of submission to hospitals to clean up their act and desist from this kind of pressure, that would be important.  However, on the Deputy's point that we should make abortion safe, legal and free, it will be very expensive.  In the UK, where abortion is supplied on the National Health Service, over &pound;750 million of taxpayers' money has been paid to private sector abortion clinics since abortion was legalised.  The boss of Marie Stopes received &pound;420,000 as a salary in one recent year alone.  That is four times the UK Prime Minister's salary.</p></speech>

We are two thirds into the process of the committee and today is the first time somebody who is in favour of the eighth amendment had a platform alone, so to speak, with a session devoted to them.  What she has had to say is just so radically different from everything that has gone before.  It is so noteworthy.</p> <p>  To correct one thing, Deputy Daly was picking Ms McDermott up on issues around pain and the question of whether abortion is violence.  Actually, we have had very scant discussion about the question of foetal pain and I think no discussion about the question of the different types of procedures used.  We have certainly had nothing diagrammatic or that would allow us to quiz for ourselves how violent or not abortion is at different stages.  That is one of the many things that this committee has turned a blind eye to so far.  Perhaps before the end there will be some discussion.</p> <p>  The reason I picked up the fact that Ms McDermott was interrupted - and I think that was also a first - is that while it may not have distracted the witness, I find that type of thing extremely disruptive and I lost what she was saying about Dr. John Parsons.  I would be grateful if she would repeat for us what he had to say.</p> <p>  While Ms McDermott is looking for that, I might also ask her another question.  There has been some talk about directive counselling and whether people in One Day More should report it.  I am not so clear, to be honest, about what is illegal in these situations.  For example, a doctor might say, "I feel obliged to tell you that it would be legal if you were to have an abortion in England."  I understand Ms McDermott is a lawyer.  I am not sure there is such a legal obligation but that would be interesting if there was.  We have a Constitution that actually protects the unborn.</p></speech>

I think Deputy O'Sullivan talked about "necessary non-directive".  Even that is very undefined.  I did not succeed in getting the HSE crisis pregnancy programme representatives last week to define directive counselling.  We have a Constitution that protects the unborn.  Ms McDermott has been very eloquent about how she could not have foreseen how she could cope.  That is one big plank of her argument about why abortion should not be provided.  I think I am not misrepresenting her when I say she also believes that John, in her case, had rights irrespective of how she felt.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

If we have a Constitution that protects the unborn, ought doctors not to be encouraging people, instead of leaving a cold choice and saying, "It is up to you; we are going to wash our hands of that particular decision."?  That is not the way doctors act in other areas.  They act to try and protect people's health and promote their wellbeing.  I do not want to lead the witness.  She must tell me if this is not her view.  Is it her view that doctors ought to be suggesting or at least encouraging people to go with the life of the baby, even in very difficult situations?</p></speech>

Phrases like "anomaly" and "fatal foetal abnormality" - to describe human beings in that way is insulting.  I think what the Senator is asking is if there genuinely can be non-directive counselling if we are putting abortion on the table and if we have a Constitution that forbids abortion and upholds the right to life of the unborn, should our counselling therefore be directed towards that.  Yes, I would agree.  I think doctors are in a difficult position.  The provision for the availability of information about abortion is a fine line for them to walk, perhaps.  They would know experientially that women do travel to England and they do not want to appear to be judgmental or, in other words, to tell a woman what to do.  That is the dilemma we are in.</p> <p>  I heard it said that we have an abortion service and we outsource it to the UK.  We do not provide abortions other than on the very limited grounds of the 2013 Act.  I would love for more women not to feel they need to make that choice.  Deputy Daly said that most women are happy to make that choice.  I have to say I have encountered women, and groups that I have worked with have encountered women who say: "I do not want to do this but I have no choice."  That might be because they have no practical supports, they have nothing ahead of them, the boyfriend is not interested or whatever.  There can be myriad things.  In terms of directive counselling I think doctors should be encouraged and they need to be almost given permission to be more definite in the encouragement that they give.</p> <p>  It meant a lot to me to have the scan doctor actually come back from Arklow - I think he was doing a clinic there - to see me in the hospital.  He said he had just been up in the baby unit and had seen John and that John was lovely.  It was a humanising and compassionate interaction and it meant so much to me.  He was the only one in the whole structure of that hospital.  It was like the rest of them just felt they just could not go near this.  I think there is an awkwardness that exists.</p></speech>

Does Ms McDermott think it would impact on the culture?  Does she foresee any other consequences?</p></speech>

If we introduce a flexible or wide-ranging abortion service, in other countries where that is the case I think the abortion rate settles at something like one in five, generally.  That is not just in the UK but in most other countries.  We have about one in 20 currently.  It does not take a mathematical genius to see that one in five is an awful lot more than one in 20.  I think it is inevitable that there would be more abortions and that certainly women would, perhaps as a knee-jerk reaction - I can understand why they make that decision - but they would opt for abortion because the supports are not there to continue on.  It is not just during pregnancy but throughout life.  If a woman has a child with a disability, there must be a proper level of support and care provided.</p><p>However, that is costly.  There must be buy-in from the whole country.  It is not a vote winner.  It is not a politically attractive thing to do.</p></speech>

I think I was halfway through when I was interrupted.</p><blockquote>When you are doing termination procedures... you are exposed to a rather gross, destructive process dealing with bits and pieces of fetuses, which are not very nice...  This is why we are not keen on people observing abortions.  I was recently asked if I would have a journalist join me at work, who wanted to write [about this] for the Daily Telegraph.  After discussing with other people we decided this was probably not a terribly good idea because it does not really help women who have got to make this decision to hear how unpleasant it is.</blockquote> <p>My point is that we are keeping the truth from women.</p></speech>

I have followed the work of the Committee since my appearance on October 11th and wish to thank the members for their continued thoughtful consideration of the issues at hand.<br /><br />A particular result from my research on early medication abortions obtained in Ireland using online telemedicine was discussed again at the Committee meeting on November 8th.  I believe that there was some confusion about how to interpret the results of the bar chart showing the feelings women reported after completing their abortions.  It is very important for your further discussions and deliberations on the mental health implications of abortion and the need for counseling that this chart be interpreted correctly.  I would like to provide some brief further clarification for the Committee.<br /><br />The most important thing to understand is that the chart reflects the number of times each feeling was reported (expressed as a percentage), and not the number of women who reported each feeling in isolation.  It is not accurate to say that &ldquo;46% of women expressed negative feelings&rdquo;.  If you were to read the chart that way, then you would also have to say that 174% of women expressed positive feelings, which clearly makes no numerical sense.  The reason you cannot interpret the chart as though these feelings were expressed in isolation is because most people reported more than one feeling, and thus the percentages sum to well over 100%.<br /><br />To help the Committee make these statements accurately, I have re-run the analyses to express the results as the percentage of women reporting three broad categories of feeling: 1) negative feelings only; 2) positive feelings only; 3) a mix of positive and negative feelings.  The results show that: 7% of women reported only negative feelings, 66% of women reported only positive feelings, 27% of women reported a mix of both positive and negative feelings.<br /><br />It is critical to recognize that negative feelings occurred much less commonly that [sic] positive feelings, and also that the vast majority of negative feelings were accompanied by positive ones, most commonly relief and satisfaction.  I think it would be considered very normal for a woman who feels relieved or satisfied about her abortion to also feel some sadness.  But such feelings cannot be equated with serious mental health concerns, nor can we claim that these women necessarily need counseling.<br /><br />It is also important to understand that we cannot necessarily attribute any of these feelings solely to the abortion itself because for these women, the circumstances under which they obtained and conducted their abortion were often very stressful.  For example, a woman who reports feeling disappointed may be disappointed by the abortion, but equally, she may be disappointed in the way she had to go about obtaining the abortion under Ireland&rsquo;s current laws.<br /><br />Finally, it is also worth considering the feelings of these women prior to their abortions.  Given that 100% of them voluntarily sought early medication abortion, it seems reasonable to conclude that their feelings regarding their unwanted pregnancies were overwhelmingly negative.<br /><br />I thank the Committee for their attention to this matter and hope these additional data provide useful clarification.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Abigail R.A.

I know how hard it is for her to tell her own story.  I completely understand that it is only now - after 2002 - she is able to come here to do so.  I am sure that at times it is very difficult.  How is John now?  I believe that no one has asked this of Ms McDermott today.  In the last session Ms McDermott gave us the poem from the sixth class about John, but I am assuming he is with us still.</p></speech>

There are aspects that have been brought up at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health in respect of the national maternity strategy and the ten-year Sl&aacute;intecare report about the provision of maternity services in Ireland.  The witness may not be aware that new HSE national standards for bereavement care to ensure clinical counselling services are being rolled out to support all women, even in the cases of a miscarriage, an intended termination of a pregnancy or a late-term miscarriage.  This is in the pipeline and there is recognition, on behalf of the Minister for Health, that this is an area we have not looked at before.  I just wanted the witness to know this as a positive out of all this.</p></speech>

I remember getting my own letter for the anomaly scan and genuinely not really knowing what that meant.  When I had a not great experience at that scan, I learned very quickly what it meant.  My experience is at odds with Ms McDermott's experience.  When I had a diagnosis for my first child of complex physical birth defects - not of a fatal foetal abnormality - which was my second pregnancy, no one pressurised me into anything.  Like Ms McDermott telling her story, I distinctly remember such details of that day; I remember what I was wearing, I remember what the doctor was wearing, I remember the weather, I remember the heat, I remember the face of builder I met when I was going out.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#FF01500"><p>Yes.  It was a significant day and I will never forget it.  I remember asking the consultant a very straight and direct question.  I am prone to asking direct questions.</p><p>When I asked if this was grounds for a termination - I had not discussed this with my husband who was sitting beside me - she said &quot;No&quot; but when I asked if I could have an amniocentesis so I might know what I was dealing with her answer was that that was no problem.  My experience was completely different.  At no point of my journey did anyone suggest to me that I would be better off starting again and so on.  That never was the case.  I did not have a fatal foetal diagnosis, rather I had a complex physical defect, possibly combined with genetic defects, that would have lead to a fatal foetal diagnosis.  I am not trying to diminish Ms McDermott's situation.  My situation turned out to be very positive in that my child had no genetic defect and is now alive and seven years old.  Throughout that process, I was assisted by doctors in one of our leading maternity hospitals in keeping my son alive in the best <i>in utero</i>conditions possible.  For example, I ensured I had the best possible healthy lifestyle and that I took adequate rest because as we all know the longer the child remains <i>in utero</i>the better the outcome.  <br/><br/>Ms McDermott mentioned Dr. Oslizlok, the paediatric heart surgeon in Our Lady's Children's Hospital.  In my experience as a pharmacist - as my pharmacy is open late and located near a maternity hospital I tend to have more experience in this area than other pharmacies - the diagnosis of cardiac conditions pre-natal are used to the benefit of the survival of the child.  I am not a cardiologist.  In the case of a diagnosis at 22 weeks of a chamber not forming correctly that information is used by cardiologists to monitor the pregnancy, by scanning every couple of weeks, to see if the situation improves.  Often such problems rectify themselves.  Also, it is possible to treat <i>in utero</i>.  It is often argued that scanning and diagnosis leads to children with abnormalities being discarded.  I would argue that scanning and diagnosis helps children survive because it allows all involved, including parents, to know what they are dealing with.  <br/><br/>Ms McDermott mentioned to Deputy Chambers that they are 25 people in her group.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

To my mind, that is in breach of the law of this land.  If there is repeated pressure being put on people, I have a problem with that.  We heard at length from psychiatrists of how women can be vulnerable owing to hormonal changes that occur in pregnancy.  What Ms McDermott stated is to my mind to take advantage of people.  Perhaps when she next meets the group she would suggest to them that they retrospectively complain.  As a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann I am uncomfortable that people in vulnerable situations are being directed in a particular way by our hospitals.</p></speech>

I understand where Ms McDermott is coming from in that she made her choice and continued with her pregnancy and now has her son, John, who brings her great joy.  I continued on my journey.  Does Ms McDermott believe we should be compassionate to the people who might not be in as fortunate a situation as she and I were?  Where a woman of 52 years of age finds herself pregnant with her fifth child and her husband has a problem with alcohol and her youngest child is in university, the situation is completely different.  Would Ms McDermott agree that there is a spectrum of situations such that what might suit her or me would not suit everybody?</p></speech>

We cannot legislate for all situations.  In legislating for abortion we are making a statement about life, namely, that life is contingent upon what particular people can deal with.  That is a very dangerous line to cross.  I have repeatedly made the point that women need support so that they do not feel that abortion is the only thing they can do to get themselves out of this reality.  We cannot, unfortunately, make women unpregnant but we can put in place measures that will support and help them.  I acknowledge that for a woman who is advanced in years, has put having children behind her and has moved on with her life, the road ahead in terms of pregnancy is not an easy one but it is not impossible either.  That has been my experience and I want to share that with everybody.  We also have to be mindful-----</p></speech>

There are always more compassionate responses.  I take the Deputy's point about needing to be compassionate to women.  I am not seeking to target women.  It is for society to put in place the supports which take women out of that choice situation.  Sometimes, it is not that they do not have a choice.  Deputy O'Connell and I were fortunate.  We had opportunities that others do not have.  We need to rectify that.</p></speech>

I thank the witness for being here.  She has spoken very articulately and it is important that the committee hears her viewpoint.  </p> <p>  Ms McDermott made the point that women need support.  We are all agreed that we need to do more in this country to improve our pathways to care for women when dealing with a crisis pregnancy, be it fatal foetal abnormalities and so on.  In this regard, we need to ensure that they have proper supports, including counselling.  Am I correct that in the case of a woman who obtains a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality, who receives all the counselling that is appropriate and required in that regard, and having the discussed the matter with her partner, opts to not continue the pregnancy, bearing in mind that she planned the pregnancy and wants the baby, Ms McDermott does not believe that she should have that choice?</p></speech>

In that scenario, would Ms McDermott-----</p></speech>

To reiterate a point I made earlier, there are two lives involved.  As a country we have to balance, acknowledge and uphold rights and declare what those rights are.  The eighth amendment refers to the equal right to life of mother and child.</p><p>As for us having that view and acting upon it, I appreciate that many countries do not do that.  They have a different perspective on it and make the rights of the child contingent on a range of other circumstances and people's say-so.  If we support women and say their babies are important to us as a country and not just to them but that we are in this as a collective - there is a tendency to individualise and thereby isolate people, put them into little cells where one persons says one thing and I say something else - how do we legislate or adjudicate the rights and wrongs in that?  This is a collective and the common good must always be legislated for.  When women are in extremely challenging circumstances, as happens, the supports need to be there.  It is how one views abortion as a solution.  Is it a solution?  It is not really a solution for a baby.  I come back to the point of the trauma of it being carried out, particularly if it is a late-term abortion, in the sense that women want these babies.  We want our babies, think our babies are healthy and perfect and then find out they are not.  They are very sick, will not survive or will be very disabled.  We must form a new relationship with that baby.  We cannot just say "well, this is a wanted child" because what is that child now?  Our understanding of what that child is has changed because we now know that child is different from the one we had in our minds.  </p></speech>

Counselling can really bring someone to a point of saying this is the reality of who their child is.  My child and the children of lots of other people with disabled children have revealed to them aspects of their personality and contributed to their lives in a way we cannot foresee.</p></speech>

Ms McDermott has expressed her point.  I do not want to delay it.  I think I have got the answer.</p></speech>

We were complaining earlier about people not coming in.  That is their right but Ms McDermott has certainly brought the other side to the committee today and I am delighted to learn things about Hugh's House and A Perfect Gift.  I was not aware of those organisations and supports.  Some people say it is cruel to ask a woman to go through with a pregnancy if she really believes she cannot face it.  Is that ever true in Ms McDermott's opinion?  Does she think that is cruel?</p></speech>

I felt, as perhaps did others, that when your baby looks different to everybody else's baby or has lots of things wrong with him or her, you feel a bit judged and that you are somehow the parents of a child who is not ideal.  That in itself puts pressure on parents.  As for women who are on their own or who are older, I have heard older mothers say they felt like they were the grandmother in the antenatal class.  There are all sorts of subtle pressures that women must endure during pregnancy.  I do not like to talk about it in terms of it being cruel to force, and I do not even like the word "force", women to continue a pregnancy.  When you are pregnant, you are pregnant and there is a baby there.  As for the idea of forcing that to continue to its natural process, it is not a forcing question.  It is about supporting the woman who has found out something new or has particular challenges to deal with.  It is not about forcing or locking them up and telling them "you are not allowed to leave this room".  It is about being compassionate and humane to both parties - both patients - and encouraging the woman to bond and believe in herself.  Sometimes women say that they just need someone to tell them they can do this.  Lots of people have abortions because nobody really said they would be there for them if they had the child.  Lots of people told them that if they had the abortion, they would be there for them but they did not say that if they had the child, they would be there for them so there is a big burden on women to opt for abortion that is just subliminally in the air we breathe because it is a case of "well, why wouldn't you?".  I am trying to change that perspective, attitude and approach to pregnancy and unborn babies.  I do not think it is cruel.  I do not see it in that paradigm but I think we need to support women.</p></speech>

I said "ask".  Perhaps Ms McDermott can speak a bit about the harm that occurs when we continue to describe very sick unborn babies as having fatal foetal or life-limiting conditions or conditions incompatible with life.  She knows that after a group travelled to Geneva and lobbied, and I introduced a Private Members' Bill, the HSE changed the language it used around this area.  I was surprised that Ms Justice Laffoy allowed the use of the term at the Citizens' Assembly despite the HSE having issued guidelines.  Could Ms McDermott elaborate on that?</p></speech>

It is also disrespectful to the parents of that baby because he or she is their baby.  When I read about the 50 years during which the Abortion Act has been in place in the UK, I discovered that somebody wrote that the kind of language used in the House of Lords debates involved described disabled people as mongols, spastics and monstrous.  Terms like "fatal foetal abnormality", anomaly or "incompatible with life" seem to be a slightly more subtle way of describing those children.  As it is the 21st-century version of that dehumanising language, that should not be allowed in any case.  We have to call things by what they are and according to their nature.  Terms like "baby with a lot of health problems", "baby who is not going to live for very long" or "poor survival" constitute the proper language that respects the mother of that child who is hearing it because it is hurtful.  She is already stressed enough dealing with her pregnancy and its challenges.  She does not need other people to hear her baby being described in a belittling and dehumanising way.</p></speech>

He is very bright and popular and has a very full life.  He is probably the most outgoing of all of my children.  He faces his challenges.  It is hard for me to talk about him because he is my son, but the poem his teacher gave me when he finished primary school taught me what other people, and not just me, get from him.  He would probably cringe now if he knew I was reading this poem out.  It will not win any prizes but it says a lot.  The teacher writes:<br/><br/>John McDermott, what a guy,<br/><br/>Never afraid, not all that shy,<br/><br/>He inspires all around him from day to day,</p><blockquote>Blue Steel surrounds him, come what may.<br /><br />Modesty and brilliance wears well on his shoulders, <br /><br />His friends will testify that he's strong as a boulder,<br /><br />He is friends to all, both young and old,<br /><br />Never a bad word to say, no matter how bold.<br /><br />His work speaks for itself from year to year,<br /><br />No challenge too big, the solution always clear,<br /><br />His wit and humour delight his peers<br /><br />Always there for his friends over the years.<br /><br />John was born to discover and create<br /><br />To feel inspired, never to imitate.<br /><br />So please John, allow us to thank your eight years,<br /><br />It goes without saying your leaving St. Mary's brings us all to tears.</blockquote> <p>Blue Steel is something from a cartoon, I think.  I do not know about the members of the committee but I have never had a poem written for me.  That is what John meant to this school and to other people.</p></speech>

I am very thankful that she came before us and she has certainly given us much to think about.  I hope that her presence here and the reception that she has received from all of the committee members will encourage other witnesses who have declined our invitation to perhaps reconsider and come before us so that we get the broadest possible range of views presented to us.  I am very glad to hear that John is doing so well.  Ms McDermott's story has been both eye-opening and somewhat horrendous to me with regard to the degree of both direct and indirect pressure brought to bear upon her to terminate the pregnancy.  The same would seem to apply to the other families' stories she also circulated here today.  I am somewhat surprised that the One More Day group does not primarily focus on addressing this particular issue because, as previous speakers here have said, it would seem that some of the medical professionals in question were actually in breach of the law.  One More Day has the knowledge and wherewithal to pursue this matter and bring it to the public.  It is a sensitive matter for the mothers involved but I believe that such a move would do the State a great service.  I would in no way, shape or form condone any attempt to coerce a woman into having an abortion; in fact I would condemn it outright.  The only parallel I can think of in our society are the cases where women who wish to terminate in this country, in the case of fatal foetal abnormality for example, are forced to go full term.  I wonder if Ms McDermott might consider that there is quite a strong connection between the pressure that she was put under and the pressure that a great many of women in this country have been put under down through the years and right up to the present.</p> <p>  Moving on to more general matters, I am not sure where Ms McDermott made the leap to reach her conclusion on the eighth amendment.  I am at something of a disadvantage here because she did not include much detail on this leap in the document that was circulated to us.  I tried to see the Blacks of the transcript during the interval but I just did not have time to do so.  I thought that I had perhaps missed a page, which in turn meant that I was not able to really concentrate.</p> <p>  Ms McDermott's main message to us today concerns the eighth amendment.  I can very clearly understand that she made a very strong choice.  I am sure that it was a difficult choice but from what she has said, there was no hesitation there and I do not that think that the word "abortion" featured in her lexicon at all.  She had a choice; she made her choice; it was the right thing for her to do and I support her 100% in that choice.  Does she not think, however, that the same compassion should be shown to women who might make a different choice in equally difficult situations?  </p> <p>  Is it fair of me to ask if the circumstances of John's birth informed Ms McDermott's views on abortion in general or did she have strong convictions about this beforehand?  Has she always been pro-life by conviction or did this result from the unfortunate circumstances of John's birth?  Has she been lobbying for the pro-life movement for the entire interim period?  A previous speaker asked where One More Day stood on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.  I am not sure whether the group adopted a position on that Act and campaigned on it.  I am just trying to see where that particular leap came from so perhaps Ms McDermott might address this.</p></speech>

Like most people, I never thought about abortion very much because I did not need to think about it.  I did not like the idea of it but I was certainly not in any way actively involved in pro-life politics or campaigning.  When I had John and was confronted by abortion as a real option, I realised that I felt very strongly that babies are not choices for anybody else to make.  Babies are separate human beings to whom we owe duties and responsibilities.  We have, not rights over them, but rather duties towards them.  At the time I reacted instinctively as a mother to want to protect my baby, who seemed more vulnerable than other children and perhaps more in need of mothering.  That is why I was upset when he was unexpectedly taken away from me after birth.  No care plan had been put in place for me that was sensitive to my needs and my desire to bond with my child.  I would say then that my conviction that abortion is neither a solution nor a good path to follow stems from my experience of having gone through that journey.</p> <p>  The Senator asked if compassion should be shown to women who make another choice.  I do not see babies as choices for us to make once they exist and once they are living and growing inside us.  The choice over whether they are there or not and whether they live or not is not for us to make.  We have to fall back on the question of what are human rights and who is entitled to them.  We did not know much about life in the womb back when abortion was legalised in the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbours.  We know much more now about the action and development in the womb in the very early stages, right down to the first 24 hours after conception.  Science is catching up with the pro-life conviction when it now says that the human life starts at the beginning and is on a continuum.  Does it have the right to life or does it not?  I do not see that it is up to us to legislate for and qualify that.  I do not have the authority to do this and nor does anybody else.  We have human rights because we are human.  That is it and that, as far as I am concerned, is the qualifier.</p><p>I do not like the fact that women feel they have to make that choice.  I would love to see a more compassionate system in place that says to them, "We value you and your baby too much.  We love you too much to do that and we love your baby too much to do that, and we want to support you."</p></speech>

There was a kind of a lack of care, a lack of concern, a lack of provision for me which is all I was asking for.  I did not need to be supported.  I had already made that decision.  My husband probably had not at that stage but I took the lead on it, I suppose.</p> <p>  There is not really a corollary.  When one is talking about choosing to honour the life of a child and choosing to take it away, I do not see that one can put those two on the weighing scales and say that the two are really the same argument in reverse because I cannot bring myself to look at any child, any baby, as anything other than human potential and a member of our society who needs to be protected.  That is where I stand with it.</p></speech>

I am not in that position so I cannot say.  My problem is that once one starts legislating for particular categories of risk and assessment, one just gets into very grey areas.  In the grey areas, one can reach a situation which we have in the UK where the legislation still calls for there to be a substantial risk to the life or health of the mother but that is not what happens in practice because nobody can really quantify that.  If a woman comes in and says, "my health is at risk", "my life is at risk", or "my mental health is at risk", no doctor will say, "well, I am not sure that it is."</p></speech>

I do not know that many obstetricians have been prosecuted for the judgments that they make, and quite rightly so.  It is a serious issue.  Everybody and the legal system would be sensitive to the circumstances, but it is still important to have.  If there is a flagrant breach of the legal requirements and medical best practice, I suppose the legislation is there for that kind of extreme situation that might kick in.  To answer the Deputy's point, I am not a doctor and I do not have a problem with doctors making the call when they have to take action.</p></speech>

It is appalling that anyone would be treated in such a manner.</p> <p>  I also am one for direct questions.  If it comes across as confrontational, it is not intended to be.  I will say that upfront.</p> <p>  I question some of what Ms McDermott has put on the record of the committee here today.  First, on Ms McDermott's comments in relation to Down's syndrome, Ms McDermott stated that 90% of such pregnancies in the UK are terminated.  She went on to state that in Denmark the corresponding figure is 100%.  Ms McDermott also went on to say that some such abortions happen during birth itself.  I was just wondering if Ms McDermott has any evidence of that and, if she has, what evidence she is relying on in terms of the figure of 100% of pregnancies of children who are diagnosed with Down's syndrome being terminated.</p></speech>

We have all been very impressed by her story and it is great to hear John is doing so well.  In particular, there are some very important messages for the committee to take on board with regard to the level of care and support that should be there for women who choose to continue with their pregnancy in challenging circumstances.  Like my colleague, Deputy O'Brien, I am conscious of the time so I will offer a couple of direct questions to Ms McDermott.  She should know it is not about in any way being confrontational.  I was struck by a comment made by Ms McDermott just a moment ago.  She said nobody is forcing anybody on a boat or a plane.  As we speak, we know that at least 12 women are travelling to Britain for abortions.  Why does Ms McDermott think they are travelling?</p></speech>

Many of them would not be able to see a way of having their child.</p><p>There could be a whole host of reasons why they would travel.  I suppose for them to feel forced to travel means they feel forced to have an abortion.  I think it is just getting into the whole issue of pressure and how we view people in difficult pregnancy situations.</p></speech>

Women have abortions for all kinds of reasons and a lot of those women and girls who travel do not have supports.  That is why they travel.  It would not be any different if they were having the abortion here.  They would still be in that predicament.  Whether she travels down the road or across the sea, it is the act itself, what is being done.  Focusing on the geography of where that happens is missing the point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.669" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EAJ2017112200002#MM01000"><p>To take up the point that Senator O'Sullivan and indeed Deputy O'Brien made, Ms McDermott rightly spoke about compassion.  She should have been shown an awful lot more compassion and support in her situation.  However, there are women who desperately need compassion here at home, who passionately feel that they have to have a termination.  We have had medical evidence, not from cheerleaders for the pro-choice side but from the Master of Holles Street and the Master of the Rotunda.  These are people who look after our mothers and babies and feel just as passionately as Ms McDermott does and more so.  The evidence they have given us is that they honestly believe from their experience that we need to allow for terminations in Ireland.</p> <p>  That does not square with Ms McDermott's point of view, and I get that.  However, this committee has to make its judgments based on evidence.  The evidence has been consistent.  When we hear somebody like Professor Anthony McCarthy from the National Maternity Hospital describe a woman literally beating herself, beating her womb because she is so desperate to have a termination, I cannot understand the lack of compassion in that circumstance.  To me, in that circumstance, I can fully understand why Professor McCarthy is so frustrated at having to say she has to go elsewhere, to England, and that he cannot even direct her to a hospital.</p></speech>

Do we legislate for terminations for babies just based on a woman saying "I do not want this baby"?  That is a cultural shift in this country that I think is massive and we have to acknowledge that.  I do not see it as compassionate treatment for the baby or for the woman, either.  I see it as a violent act that harms a baby and harms the mother.  She cannot know when she is pregnant.  Sometimes - I do not want to diminish - I am not saying that women are not capable of making a proper decision - but our hormones are all over the place.  We are extremely vulnerable to all kinds of things and our feelings can fluctuate from high to low to being all over the shop throughout pregnancy.  I come back to women saying "I had the abortion and I came home and felt awful.  I felt stripped of my child.  I woke up and they were not there".  It is only at that point sometimes that they feel the loss and they regret what they have done.  What does the Senator recommend I do or any of us does to that woman?  Do we say "well, actually, tough, you made your choice"?</p></speech>

Amendment No. 146 provides for applicant institutes rather than a person to appeal a decision by the Minister on an application for technological university designation.  This limits the scope of appeals from staff or third parties.  Amendments Nos. 147 and 148 are consequential amendments which arise from the amendment of section 55(1) which provides for applicant institutes to appeal a decision by the Minister.  Amendment No. 147 deletes the words &quot;from an appellant&quot; with regard to the receipt of a notice of appeal.  Amendment No. 148 is also a technical amendment to replace the word &quot;appellant&quot; with &quot;the parties to the appeal&quot;.  The amendments were recommended in technical drafting terms by the Office of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

The governing body shall establish procedures for the conducting of elections and the appointing of members to enable the full complement of members of the governing body to be completed.  This applies where the technological university in question comprises two or more institutes of technology or four or more institutes of technology, as appropriate.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 161 is a technical amendment to amend an erroneous reference to Schedule 2.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 162 provides that the Minister may designate a person as the first president of a technological university and that the duration of that person's term of office shall not exceed ten years.  It shall include any unserved term of office of a person designated as the first president of a technological university who at the time is a director of an institute of technology or a president of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  A term of office of up to ten years is deemed to be a sufficient period to attract candidates of high calibre through open competition and a period which will afford the new technological university sufficient time to experience a period of stability and implementation of the strategic vision for the technological university and a plan to be developed under the first president.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 163 provides for the insertion of a new section into the Bill to provide for arrangements for a director or president of an applicant institute who does not become the first president of a technological university and who shall instead become a fixed-term employee of the technological university for the duration of his or her contract of employment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 164 deals with circumstances where a single applicant college joins an existing applicant technological university and an order is made under section 40 dissolving the applicant college and where the order, in turn, increases the composition of the technological university from three to four.  The increase in the technological university composition of institutes will necessitate a different larger composition of the governing body such that the relevant provisions of section 12(2) in making regulations establishing procedures for the conduct of elections, seeking nominations for appointments and the appointment of members to a governing body must be complied with.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 165 to 170, inclusive, and 172 to 176, inclusive, are technical drafting amendments which are necessitated following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 177 inserts a new section that provides for the arrangements for the suspension or dismissal of a member of staff before an order is made under section 46 or section 53 establishing a technological university.  The amendment provides that the earlier decision-making procedures commenced initially under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992 or the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992 shall run their due course.  The amendment was agreed to previously on Committee Stage of the Technological Universities Bill 2015.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 178 inserts a new section that provides for the arrangements for an academic council in terms of the continuity of a recommendation made by an academic council under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992 or the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992 before an order is made on an application for technological university designation.  It provides that any such recommendation shall hold forth under the technological universities legislation.  The recommendations in question relate to programmes for the development of research or the awarding of fellowships, scholarships, prizes or other awards.  The amendment was agreed to previously on Committee Stage of the Technological Universities Bill 2015.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 179 inserts a new section on the arrangements for certain procedures where a process has been commenced under the relevant 1992 legislation for the selection, admission, retention or exclusion of students, the conduct of examinations or the evaluation of the academic progress of students, or the awarding of scholarships, prizes or other awards to students or other persons but the process has not been completed before the making of the order establishing a technological university.  In these circumstances, the commenced process shall continue as if an order for the establishment of the technological university had not been made.  The provision also provides that where a recommendation has been made by the academic council under the 1992 legislation on the selection, admission, retention or exclusion of students but a final decision has not been made by the governing body on a student, both the academic council and the recommendation shall continue in being until a final decision of that governing body is so made.  This amendment was also previously agreed to on Committee Stage of the Technological Universities Bill 2015.</p></speech>

In my first review of the Bill I noticed what appeared to be a lacuna whereby the president of a technological university had no term limit and effectively could be president for life.  I was going to query this.  If I understand the Minister of State's amendments correctly, amendment No. 162 to section 82 inserts a maximum period of ten years.  Deputy Thomas Byrne alluded to the Schedule to the Bill.  It seems, therefore, that the matter has been covered.  There is still, however, a little discrepancy because section 81(5)(a) talks about the term of office of an ordinary board member not being the president.  If I read it correctly, it refers to a maximum term of two years.  It is wise to put a cap on the president's term of office, but I wonder whether it is wise to have a term of two years for ordinary members and ten for the president.  I would welcome the Minister of State's views on the matter.</p></speech>

As the designation can only used outside the State, the college has encountered difficulties which the Technological Universities Bill offers us a convenient opportunity to address.  I wish to make the case for a change to allow the college to use the designation.  Strict criteria and a statutory approach are in place to allow it to use it outside the State.  The college is a charitable body.  It is a not-for-profit body, not a private institution.  In fact, it was founded under statute.  It is regulated by various regulatory bodies such as the Charities Regulator; Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI; the HSE and various medical regulatory bodies.  The college's current situation in law is unsustainable and the position needs to be change urgently.  I do not believe the change would have implications for other institutions.  It is a totally separate issue for the college which is already allowed to use the designation of university but only outside the State.  I wish to make a strong case for the proposed change.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  The format of the meeting is that Ms O'Connor will be invited to make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by questions and answers.</p> <p>    Before we begin, I draw the attention of witnesses to the position regarding privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses to turn off mobile telephones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and adversely affect television coverage and web streaming of the proceedings.  I advise witnesses that submissions and opening statements will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  I invite Ms O'Connor to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

Members will have received a separate briefing document which sets out details on mental health finances and governance.</p> <p>  As outlined in the 2017 HSE mental health division operational plan, the mental health division remains focused on providing and developing mental health services across the country.  The overall HSE budget has increased year on year since 2014.  Currently, the mental health budget accounts for 6.2% of the overall HSE budget.  Mental health funding is allocated to the HSE in a context where this is agreed on an annual basis through the national service planning process.  This, in turn, is agreed and approved by the Department of Health and Minister of State with responsibility for mental health.</p> <p>  The mental health division acknowledges that a broad range of services support the mental health and well-being of the population.  Specialist mental health services are provided through child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, general adult mental health teams, psychiatry of old age teams and the national forensic mental health service.  Each of these multidisciplinary services treats moderate to severe mental health disorders.  However, specialist mental health teams are only one part of a larger health system that addresses the mental health and well-being of the population.  This whole system includes services at primary, secondary and tertiary care levels.  Specialist mental health services sit within the secondary and tertiary care levels.  Community teams are supported by day hospitals and inpatient units, where necessary.  Examples of primary care services include general practitioners, clinical psychologists, speech and language therapists, etc.</p> <p>  The HSE also provides counselling in primary care, CIPC, and the national counselling service, NCS, as well as funding a number of agencies to provide psychological supports to the population.  In addition, the National Office for Suicide Prevention is an integral part of the HSE mental health division.</p> <p>  The mental health division is committed to improving specialist mental health services and working with HSE primary and social care and our community partners to develop a comprehensive range of services to support the mental health of the population.  Actions in this regard include increased recovery orientation of all mental health services; a focus on quality and service user safety; developing a range of service improvement initiatives focused on meeting the needs of our most vulnerable, for example, mental health in intellectual disability, homeless populations and dual addiction and mental health needs; and promoting positive mental health via an integrated mass media campaign, Little Things, which had 1.5 million page views in 2016 and is now being developed for priority groups.</p> <p>  The mental health division has a clear focus on best practice and improving outcomes, as set out in our clinical programmes.  In addition, we are focused on youth mental health where, among other initiatives, &euro;5 million has been allocated to primary care to recruit 120 assistant psychologists to develop early intervention services for those aged under 18 years.</p> <p>  Staff recruitment in mental health continues to be a significant challenge, resulting in the underdevelopment of mental health teams in certain areas which then impacts on access, targets and waiting times.  The lack of availability of suitably qualified staff also contributes to inadequate out-of-hours services. </p> <p>  Regionally, the nine community health organisations, CHOs, have responsibility for the delivery of community health care services in their areas of responsibility.  While the chief officer of the CHO has overall responsibility, the head of service for mental health, in conjunction with the executive clinical director, is responsible for the delivery of mental health services in the CHOs.  The forensic mental health service operates on a national basis.  Through monthly performance engagements with the nine CHOs, the mental health division has a clear line of sight on service delivery in each area. </p> <p>  The mental health division remains committed to the development of high quality, integrated mental health services in a spirit of partnership with service users, families and other key stakeholders, as part of a whole system approach to the mental health and well-being of the population.  The recruitment of a sufficient number of skilled staff and development of equitable access to services continue to be key priorities for the mental health division. </p></speech>

As a general practitioner, I will address this issue from a practical point of view and focus on primary care.  The great difficulty faced by general practitioners is that while we can access community health teams, many of these teams are lacking certain professions.  For example, many are experiencing serious difficulty recruiting psychologists and in many other teams psychologists, community health nurses, social workers and occupational therapists are also missing.</p> <p>  As the document submitted by the Health Service Executive states, 90% of mental health issues are dealt with in general practice and primary care.</p><p>For the 10% of people who are referred, there is a problem in accessing services because we do not have a psychologist and not everybody needs to see a psychiatrist.  In fact, few people need to see a psychiatrist.  General practitioners look after many patients themselves but when they refer patients, it is quite often for psychological assessment or else they are referred to CAMHS.  The patients do not need medication.  They need assessment and, probably, talk therapy or occupational therapy.  Those services are not available, perhaps not because there is no funding but because there is a difficulty in recruiting.  Perhaps the witness will address those issues.</p><p> The Sl&aacute;intecare report, which was published last May, includes a reference to mental health reform.  If we are to reform our health service, that would obviously include mental health services.  The difficulty with Sl&aacute;intecare is trying to get legislative backing and political buy-in in order that the HSE and the Department take responsibility and there is accountability and responsibility for delivering or not delivering health services.  We should continue to refer to Sl&aacute;intecare when considering our mental health services because it contains a roadmap for improving such services.</p><p> There are many social determinants for health issues, and particularly mental health issues.  These cut across the Departments with responsibility for housing, education, transport, health and social protection.  We must examine how those Departments are helping to deliver a mental health service to our patients.</p><p> As I said initially, talk therapy is the outstanding deficiency in our community mental health services.  We just cannot get to people for talk therapy.  A great deal of medication is prescribed, almost definitely unnecessarily, because we cannot get access to psychological services, cognitive behaviour therapy and so forth.</p><p> Finally, there are budgetary gymnastics every year whereby the allocation of extra money to mental health services is &euro;35 million.  However, &euro;20 million is not spent either because the HSE cannot recruit people or for other reasons.  It is unclear how that money flows into the following year.  Perhaps Ms O'Connor will address that matter.</p></speech>

We are acutely aware of psychological services and we have been seeking to improve them.  This is our third full year of having a division dedicated to mental health.  We have done a great deal of work on the core infrastructural aspects, looking at what exists for mental health in Ireland and how we can improve our various specialist services.  However, in the past 12 months we have really realised, not that we did not already know, that there is a very significant gap at the early intervention stage for all ages.  We are commencing an initiative with the under 18 year olds, with &euro;5 million, to improve access to counselling for them in primary care.  That relates to the recruitment of 120 assistant psychologists and a number of qualified psychologists.  They will work with those under 18 years of age and keep them away from the mental health services, if I am honest, by providing that first line of defence and early intervention.  This is something for which there is huge demand.  I am not sure how we will get to the stage of meeting all the demand.  We are starting with the under 18 year olds because we believe that is a huge gap and that we have young people bouncing into CAMHS as a result of that lack.</p> <p>  In terms of talk therapy at a broader level, we have the national counselling service and CIPC within that.  This has sat slightly outside the mainstream services and we are now looking at embedding it within each CHO so that we have an approach to adult counselling services within CHO areas that is more integrated with all the other services.  We are also considering bringing in a specialist lead to head up a programme of improvement around psychological interventions.  Part of our difficulty is that there is such a wide range of psychological interventions.  There are different types of service provision in different areas and there are different types of therapies associated with different clinical programmes.  We are looking at what we should be providing for everybody everywhere.  An initiative is starting on that and we will soon try to get a lead for it.</p> <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare promotes a shift to primary care and early intervention.  There is funding within that listed for counselling in primary care, psychology in primary care and a number of specialist mental health services.  The mental health division has a clear focus on embedding recovery in all our services.  The only way we will be able to address the mental health of the population is by ensuring sufficient access at primary care level in order that people can be kept well in their communities and, ideally, not need mental health services and by ensuring that they receive high-quality and efficient interventions when they do need to access those services.  That is what the division is committed to and our work is very much planned in that way.</p> <p>  There is an accountability framework within the HSE whereby there are performance contracts in place.  Every chief officer has a performance contract with me, as the national director for mental health.  In turn, I have one with the deputy director general.  The heads of service for mental health are now also held to account within their areas.  They are the people who are charged with operationally managing mental health services in their geographical patches.</p> <p>  The social determinants for health are acknowledged.  We see that clearly.  All the evidence suggests that we must do more on specific groups.  Within Connecting for Life, a number of vulnerable groups are identified as priority groups, such as those who are homeless, Travellers, LGBTI people and others.  We are focusing on those with the range of interventions listed in the operational plan.  Social protection is an issue and we are already working with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on some of our initiatives.  We have an initiative under way to examine individual placement and support, IPS, and supporting people in employment.  We face a challenge in respect of mental health because people are often penalised in a way for going back to work-----</p></speech>

We have gone over seven minutes.  I remind the members that this meeting is about funding.  We have invited Ms O'Connor to attend next week to discuss implementation of services, so we should keep focused on questions about funding.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  The witnesses have provided with the figures on the allocations for mental health funding.  I live in the CHO 1 region, which includes Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.  The figure for that area is &euro;73.6 million.  Can the witnesses give a breakdown of this per county and per the different services in the region?  Also, is the funding for CHO areas linked to population?  What are the reasons for the CHO 1 region being the lowest funded in the country, considering its size and geographical spread?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1022" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017112200002#C00500"><p>I do not have a county breakdown of the allocation with me but we can get one for the Deputy and send it to him.</p> <p>  We have endeavoured to look at population in terms of how we allocate resources.  Obviously, there is a historical allocation to services across the country.  Since the division was introduced, we have been able to look at funding on a national basis for the first time.  Prior to that, it was done on a geographical basis and we were never in a position to look at how one area compared with another.  We have sought to do that over recent years in terms of matching resources to populations.  There are different reasons for areas having more resources.  For example, an area that had a number of old psychiatric institutions tends to have more resources available historically.</p> <p>  I will have to get the details of the population breakdown for CHO 1 but throughout the last few years we have looked at how we can increase the resources into those areas that are below average.  We have used a deprivation rating scale, the Haase and Pratschke scale, for looking at how we can build population and demographic factors into resource allocation.  That model is used within the HSE.  We are incrementally trying to grow the areas that have been under-resourced, but we have a way to go on that.  Ultimately, we have services that have been well funded historically and we cannot simply turn off services in areas where they exist.  We must try to rebalance over time.</p></speech>

The funding for that area is &euro;73.6 million, but perhaps we can go into that matter later.</p><p>As mentioned, the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, particularly in the CHO 1 region, operate at a critical stage in service delivery.  Children must wait a long time to access the service and many have been turned away.  Why?  I have met many parents of children who have experienced the same, as have I am sure parents in other parts of the country.  Are the delays and lack of service caused by funding constraints or an inability to recruit skilled staff to work in the region?  If so, what efforts has the HSE made to address the problem?  Is addressing the matter a priority for it?  Is the problem being caused because psychologists who have no experience of treating children are not being considered for these positions?  Is the recruitment practice developed centrally or by each CHO unit individually?</p></speech>

That has been a recruitment issue in that we have been unable to recruit a consultant psychiatrist.  Mr. Ryan will update the committee on the matter.  The HSE is committed all of the time to recruiting staff for CAMHS.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, there are ongoing recruitment challenges, particularly in the recruitment of consultants, nurses at certain grades and psychologists in some areas.  At any one time we try to recruit about 1,000 staff for mental health services.  A number of efforts have been made to manage the waiting list in Sligo-Leitrim and we have considered ways to support services in the area by using personnel from other areas.  We have worked very closely with the services in the area to see how we can improve the position.  There is a very good and detailed action plan in place for the region on which Mr. Ryan will comment.</p></speech>

The figures I have received today show that 40 people were waiting at the end of September, while 25 were waiting at the end of October, which represents a significant decrease.  We hope to have eliminated the waiting list by the end of the year.  The improvement is due to the employment of a consultant in the past few months who has focused specifically on the 12-month waiting list.  We have also considered the practices followed by each of the teams to make sure we conduct our business in the most effective way possible.</p> <p>  In respect of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, one of our major objectives is to reduce waiting lists and increase access at inpatient level and the level of CAMHS teams.  We expect to eliminate the 12-months plus waiting list in the CHO 1 area by the end of the year.  We will do so in such a way that the waiting list will be significantly reduced from now onwards.</p></speech>

When we receive approval in a year it is often for the recruitment of staff, but we do not recruit within that timeframe because the process takes longer to complete.

The mental health division now funds undergraduate and postgraduate nurse training.  We have had significant difficulties in nursing particularly in the east coast where we have nurses who train and work in Dublin for a couple of years and then go home, wherever home is.  We have been very challenged on the east coast.  We have been funding a postgraduate nursing course in UCD.  The first year of that is now complete.  We have also completed the first year of an additional undergraduate programme, which is an extra 70 places.  We are into the second year of that and we will have another intake.  The mental health division has invested significantly in nurse education, which is uncommon.  We are also working very closely with the College of Psychiatrists, looking at how we can improve training.  We have invested more in psychology training too.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses let me know how and why these areas were identified for investment?  The 2017 HSE mental health operation plan commits to reviewing existing out-of-hours services, exploring ways to improve 24-7 crisis intervention arrangements and considering pilot sites.  It makes commitments on the development of out-of-hours mental health supports being included in the HSE mental health operation plans since 2014.  In February of this year, the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Helen McEntee, publicly stated that work was under way on a roadmap for the development of out-of-hours access to mental health services.  Has the HSE completed this work?  When did the HSE complete the work?  When will the roadmap be published?  Has a budget been identified for its implementation?</p> <p>  Has any funding been allocated to the exploration and design of evidence-based psychological resilience building programmes in our schools even on a pilot basis?  There is extensive research from other countries showing that certain strategies taught in schools can leave children less vulnerable to mental illness.  This is not to take away from the well-being policy being implemented in the new junior certificate.  Are we being specific about psychological interventions based on psychological research, which indicates that early intervention is key?  Has any consideration been given by the HSE to establishing a team of appropriately trained psychotherapists or psychologists dedicated specifically to schools?  There are some teachers who are trained as psychotherapists.  NEPS is under-resourced and such a team would take the pressure off it.  Has any research been done on this by the division?  Has a budget been identified to implement this?</p></speech>

We do not have a single national financial system so we are limited in terms of the detail.  There is transparency in services at a local level.  We are working towards a community costing model which will allow us to have a national view and a breakdown of the figures.  It will be on CAMHS initially.  There is other work going on in the HSE in respect of a single financial system, which Mr. Mulvany may be able to talk about.</p> <p>  In terms of resilience in schools, work has recently been completed by the youth mental health task force in partnership with the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and many other bodies.  There was also a pathfinder initiative which looked at the need to enhance well-being in schools.  That is seen as a matter for the Department of Education and Skills and the recommendations of the task force will go to Government fairly soon.  The HSE does not provide services in schools in that way. </p></speech>

We need a national view.  What exactly does Ms O'Connor mean when she says the HSE is working towards the national view?  It worries me that the witnesses are saying that services within schools are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills because there is a huge problem with the lack of joined-up thinking.  There is a need for Departments to communicate and link up with each other.  One cannot say that the issue of children suffering with mental health issues belongs in one box, which is the Department of Education and Skills, and that the HSE can take a hands-off approach.  It is not acceptable.  The HSE must take responsibility for it.</p></speech>

I am saying it is part of the youth mental health task force that we all participated in collectively.  There are a number of recommendations and some are assigned to the Department of Education and Skills and some to the Department of Health.  It does not mean we will not be working in partnership, but there is an acknowledgement that the intervention in schools is an issue for the Department.  We do not employ psychologists or provide teams to schools but we have psychologists working in local services that link very closely with schools.  Many members of our CAMHS teams go into schools on a very regular basis but we do not have a dedicated team.</p> <p>  We work very closely in the HSE across the primary care, health and well-being and mental health divisions.  The role of the mental health division is very much around very specialist mental health services.  The health and well-being division has far more engagement in schools intervention.  We are looking at that as the full pathway for mental health for young people.  </p></speech>

I will focus on what we can provide.  By using our system of health accounts, we can say what the total spend is in each given year across the country.  We can also tell the Deputy the total spend by LHO, as they were formerly, and by CHO, as they are now.  The LHOs were smaller divisions.  We can give that information.  We can also identify who all our staff are.  We can tell what the output is, including the clinical membership of each of our community teams, whether they are general adult, psychiatry of old age or child and adolescent teams.  We cannot yet run a report that tells us all of those figures across every CHO on a push-of-a-button basis.</p><p>As the committee probably knows, investment in ICT for community services and mental health services has been significantly lacking in recent years.  The same has been true in terms of financial information systems in the health service.  Thankfully, we are now investing and have been supported to invest in our financial information systems and that will be rolled out over the next three or four years.  My division is not waiting for that so work has been done to map the individuals on those various teams in order that, as part of the community costing project mentioned by Ms O'Connor, we can actually establish sufficient reporting capability.  We are a year or so away from being able to do that readily.  This does not mean that we cannot-----</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending.  I found the opening statement to be very vague.  There is nothing in it to tell us what is happening in mental health services.  It is all very vague and I must say that I am very disappointed with it.  We constantly hear that we need more resources and funding for mental health services yet when someone is asked, they cannot drill down into where the money is going.  Almost &euro;1 billion is provided for mental health every year and yet only &euro;90.2 million has been allocated to my area, CHO 8.  When Deputy McLoughlin asked the witnesses, they could not tell him where the money relating to his area goes, which is really bizarre in this day and age, particularly when the Government is constantly being called upon to provide more money for mental health services.  I would like to know where the money is going.  Does the money that goes in actually get to the service user?  I would really like the witnesses to outline specifics in order that the committee can see how the taxpayer is getting value for money.  Is there data relating to outcomes which indicates whether we need doctors, more psychologists or more nurses?  Is there data which shows that there are certain areas of our mental health services that are underperforming?  If there is, we need to know what they are and what can be done to fix the problem.</p> <p>  Regarding recruitment, I welcome the 120 assistant psychologist posts.  This is very good because it gives young psychologists an opportunity for experience and will also help in primary care.  How many of those posts have been filled?  I was shocked to hear the witnesses say that up to 1,000 needed to be recruited at any one time.  Could the witnesses outline the specific ways in which the HSE is trying to do this?  What is happening such that the HSE cannot recruit psychologists or nurses?  What plans does it have to address this difficulty?  I would like specific answers to those questions instead of the vague answers in the opening statement.</p></speech>

He mentioned work in progress.  What is the spend in that regard?  We can tell him what is the spend.  I want to know where that spend is going in each CHO area, how much is actually being spent on the services for people who need them and how much has been diverted into the maintenance of buildings and so on.  This mental health spend was supposed to be used to supply services to patients.</p> <p>  Has the HSE ever had to use development funding in the past to cover deficits in any of the services, particularly mental health services?  If so, there is obviously a knock-on effect.  Has this delayed the money being used in the places in which it should have been spent?  If so, there must be a huge underlying gap in the services.  If the money is not going into the services and as we are dealing with funding, can we receive a breakdown?  Where is the money going?  There is an officer for financial responsibility in each CHO.  Are there financial officers in each CHO who can be held accountable and who we can bring in and of whom we can ask similar questions?  We need to get to the bottom of this matter.  As one of the Senators said a while ago, almost &euro;1 billion of taxpayers' money is going into a hole and we are not getting straight answers.  If I or anybody else here had spent &euro;1 billion and could not say where we had spent it, I am sure we would suffer the consequences.  As a result, we need those answers.  I appeal to the witnesses.  Can we get them and also a breakdown in respect of each area?</p></speech>

There needs to be transparency in terms of where money is spent.  I would like to get a breakdown of each CHO in terms of the personnel employed in each area and what they do and of the services delivered.  I note that 80% of the money spent in mental health goes on staffing so, obviously, that is where the money is going.  I also note what the Chairman said about recruitment.  I welcome the fact that the HSE is working in conjunction with some colleges trying to support courses but I feel more work should be done in that area.  In terms of trying to produce skilled personnel, do we have enough college places and are there enough people coming out of college who can fit into the system where there are huge gaps?</p> <p>  Deputy McLoughlin referred to Sligo-Leitrim in the context of shortcomings relating to CAMHS.  I am from County Clare, which is in the mid-west.  Are there shortcomings in terms of recruitment there?  What are gaps exist?  What are the HSE's plans to address the recruitment of staff in that area?</p></speech>

The HSE's operational plan for 2017 states that its vision is to support the population to achieve its optimal mental health and that its mission is to promote and protect the mental health of the population, to provide effective services to those who need them, making best use of existing resources, and to seek to continuously improve those services, making best use of the resources available.  The HSE has set five goals, which include reducing loss of life by suicide, integrated services, timely services, the views of the people the HSE is there to serve, mainly those who are seeking support with mental health issues, and trained and engaged staff.  My question is a simple one and it relates to a budget.  How would the witnesses rate the HSE's delivery out of ten against that mission, that vision and those goals to which I have just referred?  In capital terms, what budget does the HSE need in order to get to ten out of ten for people?</p></speech>

There is absolutely an audit of mental health spending.  We have an internal audit, so mental health is just as likely as any other service area to be subject to an internal audit that would yield a report with recommendations, actions and follow-up.  Separately, we are held accountable through external audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and again mental health is as likely as any other spending area to be subject to external audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is audit and accountability around mental health funding.  Our annual financial statements cover the total cost of mental health spending and those statements are audited, with the report coming through the Committee of Public Accounts to this House.  It is part of the accountability line.  We are also accountable to the Department of Health and we publish a financial and activity report every quarter that includes mental health detail, although I accept it is not at the level sought by Deputies.</p> <p>  To answer the question of whether we know where the money goes, we do.  Perhaps I was not articulate enough in demonstrating that we do not yet have a system that allows us to run a routine report and gather separately all the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, or all age costs.  On a monthly basis we produce data that allows us to see outputs.  A Deputy asked that question but I will let colleagues speak about outcomes, as we are a little bit away from reporting outcomes.  We can see outputs in terms of activity that is going through community-based teams.  We can see the number of people being admitted to CAMHS units.  We can see what the money is doing, measured by limited enough ICT data that we have around activity.  We have measures of activity for all our community teams across the different specialties.</p> <p>  We have periodically examined how many clinical staff we have in each clinical team across the various community health care organisations, CHOs.  There is a head of finance in each of the CHOs and it supports the management team, including the head of mental health services and the executive clinical director for mental health.  There is greater visibility at a local level and we can, as required, gather specific data on most of the different ways people might want to examine the mental health spend.  We have not yet got the capacity where that is all sitting in a single system with a single reporting tool in order that we can run routine reports readily.  That is the subject of many discussions in different committees in this House and I am thankful it is being addressed.  There is investment going into financial systems in the HSE.  The HSE is 12 years in existence and still does not have a single integrated financial or human resources system.  It certainly does not have a single integrated mental health system or electronic health record, EHR, for mental health.</p> <p>  We set out each year our requirement for both capital and revenue.  Deputy Harty asked a question at the start that I did not get a chance to answer but I will do it now.  In the A Vision for Change plan, one of the strongest elements was that it sets out a requirement that is population-based.  Regardless of whether people want to update the specifics inside, it sets out a resourcing requirement for both staff and units in terms of physical capacity.  I disagree with one comment that was made in that part of the provision of mental health services goes on in buildings that must be up to standard and safe.  We must house the staff that we are trying to recruit.</p></speech>

I will reiterate this, as more than &euro;1 billion is being spent on mental health services and we cannot get a straight answer for even one CHO or CAMHS element.  The witness cannot say that a certain amount is being spent.</p> <p>  I understand about upkeep and so forth, but we are not looking at that.  We want to know how much was spent in 2016 in CHO area 4, for example.  We want to know what the money was spent on and where it was spent in county areas.  Was it spent on CAMHS, who spent the money and who authorised it?  We need to get to the crux of the matter because we have a job to do.</p></speech>

I am sure the witnesses will accept that part of our role in this committee is to scrutinise accountability in mental health services with respect to delivery.  This refers to funding, staffing and implementation.  I know we will deal with implementation next week.  Funding also relates to staffing and, in considering this, we will look at the gaps in mental health services.  This is about us doing our work in making recommendations.  It is regrettable that the budget could not be broken down into specialties like CAMHS, as has been mentioned.  Mr. Mulvany mentioned that this might be something we could get.  It is not just about being accountable to us as members of a committee but being accountable to the people we represent.  There have been various crises involving mental health, so if we could stand over levels of investment in different areas, it might be easier to ascertain the gaps and what we need to do to be able to help with them.</p> <p>  I note the &euro;35 million in additional funding committed to mental health that was held back by the Department of Health in 2016.  Was that funding released?  It is important to know if money is being held back by the Department, when services could have good use for it.  My colleague, Deputy Martin, has referred to the link with education, and as part of this a report was produced by a committee on mental health in schools.  We made 20 recommendations, one of which was that there should be collaboration between the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health issues and the Minister for Education and Skills.  I would like to know Mr. Mulvany's views on that.  There is another link with education.</p><p>We have had some questions on the planned recruitment and if young people when they are leaving school could look at areas that are available.  That needs to be worked on with the Department of Education and Skills.  I ask the witnesses for their comments on that aspect.</p><p> CHO7 has been allocated &euro;87.5 million.  I appreciate that the allocations to the different CHOs are historical.  Society has changed so much in recent years and we need to be able to stand over it in a far better way because some of the areas have different types of challenges that change from time to time.  Even though that might seem like a significant amount of money for Kildare and Wicklow, I am conscious that towards the end of the old health board system that area had the lowest spend on mental health per person.  I do not know whether the figure tallies with that.</p></speech>

I understand &euro;5.5 billion of that budget goes to section 38 and section 39 agencies.  How much of the mental health budget goes to section 38 and section 39 agencies?  Is that included in the figure for each CHO area?  Does each CHO have a specific budget within its funding amount for the section 38 and section 39 agencies that are relevant to the mental health area?  The total amount allocated to each of the CHO areas is &euro;793.9 million.  The opening budget in the mental health division operational plan is &euro;838.6 million.  What happens to the difference of &euro;44.7 million?  The Revised Estimates allocate &euro;906.6 million for mental health services.  Is the HSE operating on that figure or on the lower figure of &euro;838 million?  What are the plans for the difference?</p></speech>

Why did nobody put a red alert on the lack of speciality financial reporting, in this case obviously mental health and CAMHS?  Do the witnesses not find the lack of financial report accounting for sub-specialities unacceptable?</p> <p>  The biggest problem in the health services is recruitment and retention of staff.  Every year we were told that an extra &euro;35 million was coming to the mental health budget.  There were sighs and disbelief that it would occur and that we would actually see it working on the ground.  Why do we not plan for recruitment and retention?  The HSE has plans but they have not worked.  There was &euro;20 million this year and &euro;20 million last year.  The Roscommon services returned &euro;18 million supposedly because they could not spend it.  They could not recruit the staff, meaning that the HSE spent it in other areas.  Is there no planning for getting a bunch of money together and really going after recruitment and retention?  That is where our services are falling down and it is why the HSE, in particular mental health services, is in such a mess.</p> <p>  The money seems to go into the black hole of agency.  Is there a figure for mental health spending on agency to patch up our inpatient and outpatient services?  While the beds in Linn Dara in my area have reopened, it was closed for a long time, which was unacceptable for our young people.  If another &euro;35 million of &euro;40 million is allocated next year to recruitment and retention, it will not happen because we are not encouraging our nurses who are leaving the country because of the terms and conditions and the chaos in the services they are trying to provide.  Why do we not ring-fence the budget?  Why is it spent elsewhere?  That is the crucial point in understanding why we are failing in the health services.  Do the witnesses not find the lack of financial reporting unacceptable and that nobody said what is going on here because we do not have those figures?</p> <p>  What is the difference between employing the 120 assistant psychologists in the primary care teams and what Jigsaw has offered, which is 90% funded by the HSE?  That also targets those aged under 18 years.</p></speech>

I sat on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and I sit on the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  While I am glad the witnesses from the HSE are here, this document gives us no insights.  It is the kind of answer we get at the start of the reply to an oral parliamentary question.  In future we expect far more detail and much more insight.  The concern is the lack of insight.  Are the witnesses satisfied that an effective accountability system is in place?  Does the HSE have measurements to assess how much is being spent, where it is being spent and what are the outcomes?  How much is being spent on external placements?  From what budget does that come?</p> <p>  Over three years, &euro;17 million was returned from Roscommon.  Cuts were made without any reference to safety or quality assessment.  Has that ended?  The Roscommon report recommended that budgeting would be delegated down to lower levels.  Does the HSE accept that recommendation from the Roscommon report?</p></speech>

It is important to state that we know where money has been spent.  We have access to a whole raft of reports that are produced every month.  It is just not broken down by specialties in the way the Deputy is requesting.  The HSE has a system of financial accounting that is quite extensive.  Any local manager, CHO manager or the division can look into these accounts and see exactly where money has gone.  It is inaccurate to say we cannot see where money has been spent; it is just not categorised by specialty in mental health in the way the Deputy is seeking.</p> <p>  Regarding accountability around reporting, we have monthly performance meetings with every chief officer in the country.  Finance forms part of those discussions.  It is important to balance that with the equally important discussion on quality and safety of services.  Ultimately money is related to service delivery and we need to ensure that services are also safe, etc.  There is accountability within the CHO dealing with monthly performance.  I am also held to account every month in terms of the balanced scorecard in the HSE service plan looking at the metrics that include finance and HR metrics.  There is a clear line of accountability right through the system in terms of governance and as Mr. Mulvany mentioned, we are also accountable on an external basis and appear before this and other Oireachtas committees.</p><p> On external placement, the cost in 2016 was &euro;40 million.  It goes to external placements which are funded from the mental health budget and relate to people who have a specific need that is not met within our own services.  Some of the costs could be nursing homes or they could be in very specialist facilities for people.  Out of area placements were mentioned previously.  They are not all out of area placements, they are just placements that are provided by another provider.  That cost has grown by about &euro;10 million in the last three years.  It is a growing cost and something that we seek to address through a service improvement initiative, looking at how we can provide better services to people with complex mental health difficulties.</p><p> The retraction of funds for Roscommon is a topic that has been well covered previously.  The money that came out of the Roscommon budget was never spent on mental health.  It was money that had been coded to mental health that was going elsewhere in the system.  With the establishment of the mental health division we were able to see that and examine how to use it for mental health.  CHO2, where Roscommon sits, is still one of the more highly funded areas in mental health.  Kildare is the most poorly resourced part of the country, and it has suffered as a result of not having a psychiatric institution.  There is no great legacy value in that area in terms of resources.  </p><p> We mentioned that our budget was 80% plus pay.  There is very little in our core budget that we are able to move around unless we stop employing staff in certain areas.  That would mean ceasing to provide services in certain areas.  </p><p> Our flexibility in recent years comes from our development funding.  That allows us to develop initiatives in areas.  We seek to look at the areas which are most in need of services.  Page 6 of the document on funding which we supplied to members has a list of the types of investments that have been provided in each of those years around our development funding.  We have developed new teams across all specialties, opened new acute units in Cork, Drogheda and other places.</p></speech>

The figure is around &euro;77 million for section 38 and section 39 bodies combined which includes suicide prevention.</p> <p>  The budget for mental health in the 2017 service plan is &euro;867.8 million.  We do not have a final budget for 2018, the service planning process is still underway, the draft figure is about &euro;918 million, but that is subject to the service plan being finalised.</p> <p>  Agency spend is in excess of &euro;30 million, I think it is &euro;35 million.  Typically, though not always, it is on medical agencies.  That is the area where we have the greatest difficulty but there will be some parts in other areas.  We can provide more information on that if required.</p> <p>  On budgeting down to lower levels, the HSE's financial regulations allows and provides for budgets to be delegated to whatever level is deemed most appropriate, there is no principle issue with delegating budget and responsibility further down.  </p> <p>  On whether we feel we have effective responsibility, if the definition of effective responsibility is having that split specifically by all those different specialties, then we do not because we do not have that split.  Given the constraints of the systems we have, we would say that yes we do have effective accountability.  There is nothing to be complacent about, and it can always be improved on.  Do we know and do we agree and have we been saying that the HSE required a single integrated financial system, since before it was even established?  Yes, we absolutely have.  We have also said that it requires a single HR and electronic health records system.  This year we secured funding to sign a contract to actually implement a single national financial integrated system and we expect to get the same in the area of HR.  In the meantime, we are progressing with what we can, which is the community costing exercise, so we can take different views at a CHO level if required.  It is something we wish to do but we have a subspecialty view of what the outputs are per month, per team, for all the clinical community teams and for all the outputs in terms of what is going through our residential units.  That visibility, in terms of the accountability question, is there.  We do not have all the information that we would like to have but we are working to get it.</p></speech>

We know that we lose people in nursing as well.  We have embarked on several initiatives, including overseas recruitment campaigns.  We have had all manner of events in Ireland hosted to try to attract staff.  We have had staff attending international conferences to try to attract new staff.  We have tried just about anything.

Can Mr. Mulvany elaborate on the answer?</p> <p>  We referred to the Jigsaw programme and the plans for the programme to be rolled out nationally.  We can see the benefits.</p> <p>  Earlier, I referred to the waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services.  I am not happy with some of the answers on CAMHS in my area because many people have not been treated or looked after.  I want to get some statistics and facts.  I hope the HSE representatives present will be able to furnish me with the facts and data on the funding spent in each of the regions.  I am concerned about community health care organisation Area 1, where there is a lack of funding.  There is a plan in the coming years for a 25-bed mental health unit at Sligo University Hospital.  What are the HSE plans in the coming three years?  Can the officials give me an indication of where we are going?</p></speech>

They do not report to me but to the chief officer of the community health care organisation.  That is seen as the appropriate accountability line.  The idea is that the man or woman who is responsible for the service has the necessary supports.  The head of mental health services for the locality and the head of finance report to the chief officer for that area.  The name of the individual in the area in question escapes me.</p></speech>

We have undertaken to go away and identify what we can practically provide as quickly as we can provide it with reference to the sub-specialty breakdown by community health care organisation.  In practice, we do that by engaging with the nine heads of finance.  We seek to work with them and their local legacy financial systems to pull together the data as best we can.  My key point was that it is not readily available in a report in a single system.  We are perfectly happy to source the data and provide the committee with it in whatever way is practical.  It might take one or more steps.  We will provide any information that can reasonably be provided.</p></speech>

I am unsure of the answer but perhaps Mr. Mulvany can help.  How can he adjudicate on it?  The HSE gets something close to &euro;1 billion within the mental health service.  How can Mr. Mulvany identify the funding that the services need if those responsible have no breakdown of the various areas or of what money is being spent and where it is being spent?  How many staff are involved?  Will the officials elaborate on the number of staff in the various areas?  Mr. Ryan stated earlier that the HSE does not have permanent staff in these areas.  Some of the officials are saying that the HSE cannot get the staff.  Why are we not getting the staff for these essential services?</p></speech>

They report to people who work for the HSE overall.  The organisation, across all its divisions, has a capacity and process to work out each year what resources are required for the following year and for longer periods.  The process is hampered by the systems we have, but we have to get on with the reality of it.  Each of the divisions will engage with each of those nine community health care organisations to figure out what they require to run the service as it exists today as well as the development funding they will seek for new services or the expansion of existing services.  The process runs every year and, within its limitations, it is reasonable process.  That is how it happens.  The fact that the financial officer does not report to me directly does not interfere in the process in any way, good, bad or indifferent.</p> <p>  I was asked about recruitment and another question.

It is &euro;35 million.  From the systems we have, we can break down the spend by county by total for mental health, by the different categories of non-pay expenditure, such as drugs, cleaning, washing and so on, and by the categories of pay expenditure.  We can also say how many people are employed per county and what the output is against many performance indicators.  We could fill the room with the data we have.  The data which we do not have but we want relates to how to take a service view of that at a sub-specialty level.  We are working on that.  I would not want people to leave the meeting thinking that we do not have a lot of information about where the money goes, that we are not audited or that it is not accounted for because that would be unfair to the staff working in this area.</p></speech>

We do not yet have the exact figure for that.  We have established that there has been no audit of systems to understand to where the money used to plug holes goes annually.  It is done on a priority basis year by year.  Given that A Vision for Change is being implemented and new money is being invested every year, has there been any forward planning as regards recruitment and the recruitment backlogs, the IT system and what it is compromising and whether the difficulties in the IT system and recruitment are related?   If the IT system difficulties relate to recruitment issues, why is the money that is being used to plug holes - which was being used as new money - not used to develop the system?  It seems that staff cannot be found or recruited but a certain amount of money is being handed back every year instead of being used to improve the recruitment process.  I understand the witnesses may not be able to answer my question today but I would like the answers by the next occasion on which they appear before the committee, and, in particular, if recruitment is to be addressed.</p></speech>

Under our recruitment licence, we are tied in to the national recruitment service.  The mental health division is part of the HSE and there is a recruitment licence in play.  We have to follow certain procedures in regard to how we recruit staff and that takes time.  That recruitment process is constantly in being, whether it is to do with new developments in terms of the development funding or just replacement staff.  We have a lot of churn in our service because people move around.  As we develop new services, people move around.</p> <p>  I have mentioned nurse training.  A pipeline for nursing in particular is one initiative.</p> <p>  Our funding is prioritised around key service development.  For example, if we have a series of clinical programmes, we look at our population of vulnerable groups and safety.  Safety is a key guide for us in terms of our services.  The metrics are in our monthly reports.  Our performance report is published every month and is visible to everybody in terms of how we are performing against all the metrics.  It is transparent and available for anybody to look at every month.</p></speech>

The HSE ran a media campaign for the Little Things initiative.  The campaign is being developed for priority groups and its website had 1.5 million page views in 2016.  Those groups are looking for funding.  What level of future funding has been allocated for them?  A lot of the page views were by people looking for services they needed.  There are priority groups.  What is the HSE going to do in this regard?  Many people accessing the website were very concerned by issues.</p> <p>  How many of the 120 assistants for whose recruitment &euro;5 million has been allocated to primary care have been recruited to date?</p> <p>  It is very confusing that there are nine regional CHOs and there does not seem to be a budget for them.  A local authority gets its budget every year and works through it.  I could give many examples of cutbacks in my area of Carlow-Kilkenny.  Who is responsible for the cutbacks?  Who is making those decisions?  If the CHO does not have a budget, who decides to cut the services - such as weekend and overnight services - that I know have been cut?</p></speech>

Development funding is where we have the flexibility to give extra funding to services on an annual basis in line with the initiatives we agree with the Department of Health, whether for a clinical programme, the development of a new unit or whatever.  Organisations can put that into their annual proposal.  The budget is assigned.</p> <p>  The recruitment of assistant psychologists is an initiative driven through primary care and the interviews took place last week.  It is a significant initiative that has not been done before and its lead-in time was quite significant due to agreeing on the job spec etc. and working with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform on that.  We have a couple of other initiatives.  The Senator mentioned the Little Things campaign, and we are now doing tailored campaigns for priority groups.  We are also looking at how we support those priority groups.  For example, we have a significant service improvement initiative in respect of homeless people and new mental health co-ordinators for Travellers that is commencing in each CHO area, so we are promoting and supporting the service delivery for all priority groups at a CHO level.  In terms of our investment, we are gradually covering all of the priority groups as set out in Connecting for Life, which guides the work we do in many mental health services.</p></speech>

Can she distinguish between local and national level?</p><p>Are they in that group of section 38 and section 39?</p></speech>

It is a significant amount, almost three quarters of a billion, that is going out.  If we add in the agency spend, we are up to quite significant money.</p></speech>

That is a new development.  They are not able to get staff in the same way, either.</p></speech>

There are a lot of organisations being funded and, while some of them do very good work, the last thing we want is more and more organisations seeking to start off in an unco-ordinated fashion.  We can talk about what individual organisations are looking for.  I am sure a new organisation could emerge in most counties in most months of the year.  We are looking to develop the services but not necessarily to develop individual organisations, although there is always room for targeted investment.</p></speech>

I am going a little bit off the finance side of it.  We are frustrated at the delays in the recruitment but we can also appreciate the fact that one cannot just magic people up.  I want to acknowledge the pressure existing staff are under.  If we cannot recruit people, those who are there already are under huge pressure.  It is important to acknowledge the great work they are doing.  If we are probing here today, it is out of concern for them as well as everybody else.  We want to be sure that they and the people who need the services get them in as timely a manner as possible.</p></speech>

As a result it was a better process.  I would suggest that the community health organisations consider that approach because it produces better results.</p> <p>  For the myriad section 39 organisations that are out there, does the HSE have a methodology by which it can measure their input, effectiveness, value for money and so on?  Is there some metric by which they can be held accountable for the money they get?  There are various organisations doing wonderful work that could do with much more money.  However, I am also aware that there might be organisations of which we might question where they fit in on the spectrum.  That is something that might be improved upon.</p> <p>  There is an accountable officer for each CHO.  In Cork-Kerry, it is Ger Reaney.  If I understand correctly, Ger is responsible for the delivery of the service.  He is also responsible for disability.  Is there a need for an accountable figure more specific to mental health?  I am casting no aspersions on anybody.  It is just such a huge area.  Trying to cover that plus disability and a few more legs as well might be an impossible task for any individual.</p> <p>  On the drugs spend, some anti-psychotic drugs are very expensive.  They are distributed to the HSE's general pharmacy or medical cards set-up.  Are those figures included in the mental health spend or are they part of the general overall drugs spend?  It is a big figure and a lot of money but I am not sure it is the right place for it to be included.</p></speech>

They have now all got heads of service.  Within Mr. Reaney's area there is a head of service for mental health, another one for primary care and another one for social care.  There is quite a strong management team in each of the nine community health organisations and there is a very senior person there dedicated just to mental health.  They are surrounded in turn by a team that includes the executive clinical director, directors of nursing, etc.  The governance within the CHO has become a lot more robust and there is a dedicated management structure around mental health in each of the nine community health organisations.  That might allay some of that concern.</p> <p>  Mr. Mulvany might wish to address the question about the drugs.</p></speech>

I would imagine that is largely the residential facilities.  The vast bulk of mental health related drugs are prescribed in general practice or at least renewed there, issued in community pharmacies and paid for through the primary care reimbursement service.  That is a further &euro;80 million which is outside of the mental health budget which the members have laid out in front of them.  If we added it to the mental health budget, it would bring it up by a further 9% or 10%.</p></speech>

It is also relevant when we are looking at the percentage spend on mental health.  It should be included in that if that is what it is spent on.</p></speech>

Will we have it for next week?  Will it include mental health and intellectual disability dual diagnosis, homeless and minority groups?  The witness has said that information is not readily available today, which beggars belief.  With respect, when they were coming in to this committee dealing with funding, did the witnesses not foresee that we might want that information?  Surely this is not the first time this information has been sought.  I would say practically every member here has submitted parliamentary questions and written to the HSE.  I really am struggling with how the witnesses were not ready for that today.  Even in this D&aacute;il, have the two Ministers of State who have held responsibility for mental health sought that breakdown from the HSE at any stage?  Have they asked where that money is being spent and how?</p></speech>

We will read the transcript.  A number of Deputies have looked for specific pieces of information.  We will go and engage with the nine CHOs and see what can be provided as quickly as possible.  We will not seek to delay the process.  If necessary, we will give the Deputy something interim within a short period.</p> <p>  In terms of coming here today, we came with the financial information that we have.  Initially, I think I got a couple of days' notice of this meeting, which became a week and a bit.  It would not have been practical to produce that in a general way.  Now at least we have a better sense that there are different flavours of what people are asking for.  One of the Deputies wanted to know who authorised all of the spend, which is a slightly different, totally reasonable question.  We will take this transcript, put it together as best we can, and then we will reply.  It is not that we do not have a lot of information.</p> <p>  Have previous junior Ministers asked the question?  I have no doubt that they have and we will have provided the best information we had at the time.  My main point is that it does not readily exist in a format such that one simply runs a report, which is how we all would agree it should exist.  We will have provided a variety of information to Ministers over the years in terms of either new posts or total posts in these various sub-specialty areas.  Even some of the areas the Deputy mentioned herself, we will just have to dig out and see.  The homeless piece is a further sub-specialisation in terms of the overall answer.  We will provide what can be provided.  We have a lot of information.  There is a lot of audit and accountability.  There are budgets.  We would not want people to think there are not budgets to manage the service, although there might not be available data.</p></speech>

He said he only had a couple of days notice.  I have made four requests over the last year looking for a breakdown of the mental health budget.</p><p>I have in fact received an email from the Minister's assistant, dated 24 October and responding to my request for a breakdown.  I will quote directly from this email: "[U]nfortunately there is no sub-speciality reporting available from the financial systems and therefore I cannot provide this information for any year until such systems are enhanced."  Is Mr. Mulvany telling me that he does not know how each community healthcare organisation, CHO, is spending its money?  Are they not accountable to Mr. Mulvany as chief financial officer?  Do they not provide his office with a breakdown of every single penny that they spend each year?  I think I am reflecting Deputy Catherine Martin here in saying that I find this to be absolutely extraordinary.</p></speech>

The Chairman asked me a question and told me that it was amazing that I did not know something.  I have told her what notice I got for this meeting and I am now telling the committee that we can account for what is spent in the different areas.  That is a fact.  The issue is that we cannot readily account for it in the particular way in which both we and the committee would like to, that is sub-specially.  We comply with the obligatory accounting requirements, including those of the Department of Health, and we are audited every year.  As I stated before, we provide information under 26 headings of non-pay expenditure and 11 main headings of pay expenditure and we can break all of this down by county.  The issue is being able to provide this information in what I would describe as a service-line reporting fashion.  Our systems do not yet allow us to provide us that level of information or that view on the information.  I point out to the Chairman, however, that this is not the same as saying that we cannot account for the money.  That is not a fair reflection of what we are saying.</p></speech>

I have been very clear that we cannot provide the information that has been sought within a week because we will have to take out the transcript and engage with the CHOs in question.  It is much more practical to say that we will give an interim view to the committee within the next three or four weeks.  Until we actually do the exercise we cannot know how long it will take.</p></speech>

Picking up on the Chairman's comments, was no alert sent?  I have a response here to a Parliamentary Question on planning performance and programme management.  Many committee members have asked this question of the HSE, as have NGOs, and I know that Mental Health Reform is here today.  I myself received this response in October.  Surely some alert must have gone out somewhere if the HSE received 30 or 40 communications stating the importance of this matter and how much we need to focus on it.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses comment on whether allocating just over 6% of the overall HSE budget is adequate for our mental health services?  This allocation stood at 14% in the early 1990s and is currently at 13% in Britain and in many other countries in Europe and further afield.  I would also like a comment on the decision to shut down the six-bed high dependency unit in Tallaght Hospital at the end of this month.  This is due to staff shortages but I would also like to know about the implications on the budget.  I worked in high-dependency units for a long time and I know that shifting from such a unit to a general ward requires far more supervision and far more so-called "specials" for very volatile individual patients in the form on one-to-one, two-to-one or three-to-one nursing.  This brings in both the dignity of nursing that patient, as the nurse is with them 24-7, but also extra demands on the budget of that hospital as it has to provide extra special services to ensure risk safety in the aftermath of the decision to shut a custom-built high-dependency unit.  Will Tallaght Hospital be penalised when it goes over its allocated budget, or will the HSE give it extra money because this arises from a HSE decision?</p></speech>

We are part of an environment and part of a wider health system.  With regard to the Tallaght unit, I cannot comment on the actual closure but I would like to clarify for Senator Devine that we do not penalise in such circumstances.  The reality is that bed closures as a result of staffing shortages do not arise because there is no funding.</p> <p>  A reference was made earlier to Linn Dara.  The straw that broke the camel's back in that case, for example, was that even the very specialised agency that sometime supplies us with staff was unable to find any.  We could not get staff; the agency we normally go to for staff could not get staff; and therefore the unit had to close for an interim period.  None of us want people to be nursed in inappropriate settings that do not best meet their needs.  That is not in anybody's interests so we always strive to have the right facilities open for people, particularly those with a higher level of need.  There are times, however, when we just have serious staffing crises around manning a roster on a given day.</p></speech>

With regard to the &euro;35 million of new money for 2016, where was that money, once furnished, used to plug holes and where was it used in new development?  I do not just want a top-line figure here, I would like a breakdown of exactly what holes were plugged with that figure.  I understand that there could be time restrictions here but there will be both short wins and long wins when it comes to getting figures together.  Perhaps some of the figures we requested could be submitted by next week - the top-line figures, perhaps - so I ask that the witnesses keep that in mind.  I understand that some of the other figures may take longer to get, in which case I ask the Chairman that we be facilitated in inviting the stakeholders back if we need clarification on some of the answers.  I would be grateful for that because this is a learning process for all of us, and the answers that may take some time to be supplied to us will obviously lead to follow-on questions.</p> <p>  In anticipation of our discussion next week of the recruitment issue, I ask that the stakeholders furnish us with some extra information around some of the recruitment challenges that were articulated today.  I further ask that this be provided under a number of different heading, including for example, talent pool; systems; location; job description; career progression; working conditions; qualifications; experience; and decision-making timelines and processes.  If the stakeholders could have some information for us on that next week we could then start to tease out the anomalies within those headings rather than scratching at the surface.  This would save time for both us and them as we would not have to invite them back in again to get clarification on answers that might take time to submit.  This might be helpful.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  Mr. Mulvany thinks I have a vendetta against him, but I do not.  The witnesses spoke earlier about the chief financial officer of each individual CHO.  Is there a possibility that if there is harmony within the CHO, the two officers can set their own budgets and request additional development funding?  What I am trying to get at is the following.  If the two officers in a particular CHO decide they need extra funding which they wish to draw down through the development fund to staff a CAMHS unit fully and if they can encourage staff in, can it be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1298" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017112200002#O00300"><p>First, I do not think at all that the Deputy has a vendetta against me.  We are happy to answer questions and to be accountable.  I will refer to how the process works and some of my colleagues may also want to comment.  Each CHO, including the mental health part, can, within reasonable parameters, spend its mental health budget.  I was going to say "as it sees fit" but it is in line with the overall framework that is set down.  As such, we are trying to move more to a recovery oriented model and development funding.  We have to fund the existing base services, but some of those can be described as "legacy" or as "legacy modes of practice".  We are trying to move away from that.  They are part of the overall process.  The CHO officers get an input and engagement from my colleagues here around what is required for the next year and an overall figure is reached.  My colleagues must agree that with the Department.  Within that, they can spend.  They cannot just decide they need more or want more and are, therefore, going to spend more.  That would just be-----</p></speech>

With wages and other costs, they would say they needed X amount.  Can that be done if the will is there within the system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1300" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Yvonne O'Neill" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017112200002#O00500"><p>That is the type of process we are involved in annually to look at how we build our submission for funding to Government under the Estimates process.  As such, we have direct engagement with our CHO mental health colleagues and talk through the specialties.  For example, one might take the relocation and opening of the Linn Dara CAMHS acute unit.  We engaged with our CHO colleagues to look at the cost of that service.  They were able to say they could reasonably bring the beds to X if they could get funding for Y.  We brought that to Government as part of the programme for Government funding process and are now able to allocate the full cost of the operation of the Linn Dara service within the CHO 7 budget.  That is exactly as the Deputy has outlined and it is the process we fulfil each year as part of the annual Estimates and budget allocation process.  As Ms. O'Connor outlined, it is also part of the performance reporting process.  On top of the additional funding we secure for Linn Dara to allow it to be operational, we ask on a monthly basis if it is there yet.  We know by development post, as Deputy Neville asked, what they have been allocated and whether those posts are in place.  Where, for example, it has not been possible to recruit staff to those posts, they may be incurring overtime or special costs, as Senator Devine outlined.  In that case, we will say that the funding can, in the interim, plug holes, to use the member's term.  That is the type of application of funding.  It is for direct mental health service provision and it is working with the CHOs and services to determine their priorities for that.  The exact process Deputy Buckley outlined is the one we are involved in; annually in terms of service planning and budget allocation and monthly in respect of performance management.</p></speech>

Did Mr. Mulvany say that the manager of each CHO had the facility and ability to allocate the budget to whatever it is within the CHO area?  If so, is the manager the person who decides how much is allocated to children's services?  Is that how it works?</p></speech>

As such, we are on a constant journey to try to increase the number of community child and adolescent psychological teams, old-age teams, liaison teams and adult teams.  It is all set out and we are on a particular road map to implement the policy.  We have a view and are able to see within each CHO where it is in terms of what it should have in its area.  We know how far from A Vision for Change norms it might be or even from the national average and we know which areas are worst off and best off, etc.  There is a plan in place for the business we are in and what we have to try to achieve.  They can spend money in line with the operational plans.  We have a national service plan and an annual operational plan and each community health organisation has its own operational plan which is a "drop-down" from the national plan.  There is a very clear map set out.</p></speech>

If they get agreement for that and it is in line with policy, they can make a decision.  As Ms O'Connor is trying to make clear, we are trying to foster local accountability and decision-making but it is within the overall policy framework.  That means they have to meet the major priority needs first.  What they propose must make sense.  I used to be involved directly in this division and I note that my colleagues are trying to encourage local services to make the right decisions and to feel some ownership and empowerment in that regard.  However, it is not <i>laissez-faire</i>.  It is not possible to say it was put into child care and into elderly care if it is not the most obvious priority.</p></speech>

There are areas that we can see are priorities nationally which might not necessarily be identified by a chief officer as a local priority.  Nevertheless, we know we should have MHID services in all areas.  We get into that discussion on a monthly and yearly basis.</p></speech>

The establishment of the committee provided a unique opportunity and space for all parties to put aside political ideologies and policy differences, and to work together in the best interests of the people they serve.  The committee members did not sidestep this important task and lived up to their mandate.  I again take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the committee members and all those who engaged in consultation with them throughout the process.</p><p> This is the first time in our history that we have achieved consensus at a political level on the future direction of our health system.  These opportunities do not come around too often and I am determined to harness this political consensus and to work with colleagues across the political spectrum and with all stakeholders to move forward on a programme of health reform that will ultimately benefit the health of our citizens, those who work in our health service and our society. </p><p> The process of reform will only succeed through the commitment and buy-in of all stakeholders to a shared vision.  We have started on a solid foundation of unprecedented political consensus and must now seek to build consensus across the system, including clinical consensus and buy-in to the necessary reforms. </p><p> We are all aware of the challenges of implementing change in our health system.  Health-care delivery is a complex endeavour and we in Ireland are not unique in encountering a variety of challenges.  We now have an opportunity to learn from our own past experience, as well as international experience, and to design a programme of reform and the necessary supports to engage stakeholders across the system and sustain momentum over the coming decade.  Moving towards a universal health system for all citizens is a transformational change in the Irish context.  Every party in this Oireachtas has now signed up to that.  We want to create a universal health care system and it will take ongoing commitment.  Our continuing motivation will be our shared and agreed ambition to better serve the people of the country and to help shape a healthier future. </p><p> It is important to set out the context for the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The Committee on the Future of Healthcare was established in recognition of the fact that our current health system, despite notable achievements, is not well placed to meet the demands of future generations.  We need to design a system today to meet the many challenges now and into the future. </p><p> These challenges are well cited: our population is rising and the increase in those in older age groups is particularly relevant; there is a growing prevalence of chronic disease; health inequalities and unmet need are increasing; and there is an ongoing challenge to attract and retain the right skills mix and numbers in the workforce.  </p><p> Committee members will have seen the report recently published by the ESRI, Projections of Demand for Healthcare in Ireland, 2015-2030.  The picture painted in this report is stark and highlights the challenges that face our system in the next decade and reinforces the case for change.  The main findings of this report are that over the years 2015 to 2030, the population of Ireland is projected to grow by between 14% and 23%, adding between 640,000 and 1.1 million people to the population.  Furthermore, the share of population aged 65 and over is projected to increase from one in eight to one in five and numbers of people aged 85 and over are projected to almost double.  It is a very welcome development that people are living longer but we need to be cognisant of it.</p><p> Because of these changes in demographics, demand for health and social care is projected to increase across all sectors, with the greatest increases for services for older people.  Demand for home-help care and for residential and intermediate care places in nursing homes and other settings is projected to increase by up to 60%.  Demand for public hospital services is projected to increase by up to 37% for inpatient bed days and up to 30% for inpatient cases.  Demand for GP visits is projected to increase by up to 27%.</p><p> We also know that the nature of the illnesses faced by the Irish population is changing.  Now approximately 60% of Irish people have one chronic disease and around 25% have two or more chronic diseases.  Chronic disease requires a different type of care that is preventive, ongoing - not a once-off treatment - and managed close to home. </p><p> Ireland is not unique in the challenges that face our system.  It is clear that the world around us is also changing rapidly and similar demographic and disease challenges face countries worldwide and particularly in western Europe.  Rapid changes in mobility and technology present new challenges such as the spread of infectious diseases and the risk posed by antimicrobial resistance.  The development of knowledge and technology also presents opportunities to fight diseases that were previously debilitating and to access new therapies and better medicines.  As the world will continue to change in ways we cannot yet imagine, we must have the flexibility, ability and leadership to respond.  We must be innovative in thinking about how to best serve the Irish population into the future.  The work of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare in producing the Sl&aacute;intecare report has provided us with the collective space to reconsider our direction and start to plan for a healthier future. </p><p> I will now turn to the report itself.  The recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report are grounded in eight overarching principles that I fully endorse.  These support a reorientation of the health service towards a high-quality integrated system providing care on the basis of need and not ability to pay; a universal system providing the right care in the right place at the right time, provided by the right people.   The principles describe a system that is modern, responsive and integrated, comparable with other European countries, one that inspires long-term public and political confidence.  In order to achieve this system the report highlights the need to place the patient at the centre of a system that delivers care which is timely, provided free at the point of delivery and provided at the most appropriate, cost effective service level with a welcome emphasis on prevention and public health.  The report also points to the need to create an enabling environment for reform.  This is an environment where the workforce is appropriate, accountable, flexible, well resourced, supported and valued, with accountability, value for money and good governance at the heart of the system.  I believe that this describes a health-care system that will command the support of the people of Ireland and will meet their needs. </p><p> It is also important to highlight that a number of the recommendations in the report are supportive of current policy developed by successive Governments.  A number of initiatives are already in train.  In particular, the report strongly supports a real shift in our model of care, moving away from a hospital-centric approach to one which is focused on providing the majority of care in the community.  Ministers for health have been talking about this back to the days when Dr. Rory O'Hanlon was Minister for Health.  Many of these ideas have been around but perhaps we have not pulled them all together and had a real consistent programme of reform.  That is the major benefit of the Sl&aacute;intecare structure.</p><p> A range of other ongoing initiatives are given strong endorsement in the report including: the Healthy Ireland strategy, the eHealth agenda, integrated workforce planning - I was delighted to launch our new national strategic framework for health and social care workforce planning last week - a robust clinical governance framework, enhanced community nursing, integrated care programmes, and current strategies in the areas of maternity care and mental health.  The report has highlighted that these issues should form the basis of creating the health service we all want to build.  The support for these initiatives is helpful and can add greater impetus to their successful delivery.</p><p> I will now outline decisions taken with Government and work that is under way to develop a programme of reform to take forward the proposals in Sl&aacute;intecare.  When I spoke in the D&aacute;il Chamber in June during the debate on the Sl&aacute;intecare report, I was clear in my conviction that the publication of the report would come to mark a critical milestone in the history of our health service.  I was also clear, as is the report, that we needed to allow time to reflect and deliberate on the findings of the committee and consider how best the vision and spirit of the report can be realised.  This process of consideration is well advanced. </p><p> In July, the Government agreed to move forward with the establishment of a dedicated programme office and specifically the recruitment of a lead executive for that Sl&aacute;intecare reform office.  This marks a critical first step in gearing up for a significant programme of reform and demonstrates our commitment to this process.  Budget 2018 allocated &euro;1 million for the Sl&aacute;intecare office in line with the report&rsquo;s recommendation of &euro;10 million over ten years, &euro;1 million a year.</p><p> The recruitment process for the head of this office is under way and is being managed by the Public Appointments Service.  The Public Appointments Service has actively begun the searches it needs to do to ensure we have the best person to do the job.  It is essential that we are positioned to attract candidates of calibre for what will be a considerable reform programme.  An extensive national and international executive search is being undertaken as a first step in this recruitment process, with the aim of attracting very senior candidates with a strong track record in implementing large-scale programmes of reform.  In following the debates of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare I am very conscious that getting the right person with the right skill set is a key challenge.  It is appropriate the Public Appointments Service is carrying out a national and international executive search to ensure we have the right person in place.</p><p> In parallel with this process, I have also been tasked by Government and the Oireachtas with developing a response to the report and a draft implementation plan for consideration by Government by the end of this year.</p><p>People ask where is the draft implementation plan.  The report tells me to produce it by the end of the year and I will have it by the end of the year.  This process is seeking to translate the Sl&aacute;intecare report into a programme of action for the next ten years.  The report itself recognises there is a need to take the vision and plan and put it into a programmatic series of concrete actions.  This is why it asks me to put in place an implementation plan.  It will also consider issues that arise in designing such a programme, including key actions, deliverables, costings, timelines, and interdependencies.  It is widely acknowledged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report that more detailed consideration of these issues would be required, and this work is under way and it will be delivered on time.</p><p> This process is being led at the most senior levels in the Department and the HSE, and also involves close engagement with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The involvement of these Departments was a key recommendation of the report, as we need strong cross-Government political leadership.  We do not need Sl&aacute;intecare to be just the job of the Department of Health.  We need buy-in and investment from other Departments in terms of a whole of Government approach, and this is what is happening.  In recognition of this, the Cabinet held a special Government meeting in Cork last month, focused specifically on health care reform and the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  This is quite important.  When I was appointed Minister for Health, I read a column which stated those who become the Minister for Health are often treated by the rest of their Cabinet colleagues as though they have Ebola, and that it is that person's job to fix the health service and no one else will go near the Minister in case he or she gets infected by all the challenges of health.  The fact the Government itself held a dedicated meeting on Sl&aacute;intecare and health reform in Cork I hope sends out a very important message on how seriously we are taking this and about the fact the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, wants to see a whole of Government approach on this.  This is a view shared throughout the Government.</p><p> Later this week, there will be further discussion at the Cabinet committee on health, chaired by the Taoiseach, on the development of the implementation plan.  Sl&aacute;intecare and the development of an implementation plan is the specific agenda item at the Cabinet committee on health this week chaired by the Taoiseach.  In fact, it will be held tomorrow.  At the meeting in Cork, I was tasked with continuing the process of developing a response to the report for the Government's consideration.  I was pleased to receive Government approval to move ahead with a number of actions recommended in the report.  These include the initiation of an impact study on the removal of private practice in public hospitals.  One of the transformational recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report is that we would move towards a universal system of health care, which would address the current inherent unfairness in our system when it comes to accessing care.  The report rightly points to the issue of private practice in public hospitals in this regard.  The committee acknowledges that it will take time to change this system, that careful consideration will need to be given to the impact of such a change, and that there will be a considerable price tag attached, but we cannot shy away from the core issue that when the public system is under severe strain, when emergency departments are full and waiting lists are in a challenging position, it is hard to defend an arrangement whereby private practice continues unquestioned in public facilities.</p><p> In its report the committee asked that I carry out an impact study and I am pleased to say this is under way.  I have appointed Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir as chair of an independent expert group to examine the issue.  The review group will be strong and balanced, bringing extensive experience and expertise in health care, including in hospital management, and also in governance, finance, human resources and employment law.  Membership of the group will be finalised in the coming days, when I will publish the names of all of its members.  The group will specifically examine the potential benefits and the potential adverse consequences that may arise in the separation of private practice from public settings.  I will be asking the group to pay particular attention to the existing nature, level and role of private practice in public hospitals; the negative and positive aspects of private practice in public hospitals including access to health care, equity and the operation of public hospitals; what practical approaches might be taken to the removal of private practice from public hospitals, including a timeframe and phasing; possible impacts, both direct and indirect, immediate and over time, of removing private practice from public hospitals, including but not limited to impacts on access; hospital activity, including specialist services, funding, recruitment and the retention of personnel; and any legal or legislative issues that might arise.  The group will conclude its work within nine months of commencing and by the end of next summer.</p><p> I am conscious we are having this meeting this morning in the aftermath of an "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme, and while I have clearly outlined the actions I have taken in relation to implementing the recommendations of Sl&aacute;intecare in this regard, I want to say most consultants and doctors I meet in the Irish health service, and most people I meet in the Irish health service, do not just work the hours they are contracted to work but work well above them.  We all know doctors in the health service about whom we are not worried about underworking but overworking.  Equally, what we saw last night on our television screens in the case of some doctors was immoral, unfair and brazen and it needs to be rectified.  Not just on foot of last night's programme, but for the past number of months, the Department has been engaging with the HSE on the need for a more robust monitoring system.  If a nurse turns up late for work or does not work his or her hours, if a health care assistant does not work his or her hours, and if people in the public sector or private sector do not work their hours, they know all about it.  We cannot have a continuation of a culture of deference to anybody working in our health service.  Immoral, unfair and brazen is how I would describe what I saw last night, but I want to say this in the context of acknowledging it is a minority of people working in our health service.  I expect the HSE as the employer will now formally investigate each of the cases shown on television last night.  I expect this to happen and I am aware it will happen.  We cannot have a situation where people are paid for hours they do not work.  It would not be tolerated in any other workplace and it would not be tolerated in the health service at any other grade.  The culture of deference towards consultants in some hospitals must end.  I say this in acknowledging the fact many of our doctors work well above and beyond their contracted hours and it is important to say this.</p><p> A public consultation on the future alignment of hospitals groups and community health organisations, CHOs, will take place.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report endorses the need to achieve greater alignment between hospital groups and CHOs.  I spoke about this when I appeared before the committee.  We all know that different health service management structures have been put in place over the years, and we all know that while finding the ideal structure will not suddenly solve all our problems, having the wrong structures will certainly undermine our chances of successfully developing a coherent, efficient and integrated system.</p><p> I welcome the emphasis on integrated care that is embedded in the report, and I believe that aligning our delivery systems will ultimately help the system to move towards a population-based approach to service delivery that will help provide a more integrated service for the citizens of this country and help those in the system to better understand and manage health outcomes.  Having hospital groups and CHOs operating on this basis will facilitate collective performance and accountability arrangements based upon pre-arranged and shared goals, budgets and incentives.</p><p> I am conscious that structural reforms can be disruptive and that we need to avoid unintended consequences.  For this reason, I have agreed to undertake a consultation process to hear the views of people working in our health service, of those who represent them, and, most important, of patients.  I will commence this consultation process by the end of the month.</p><p> There are also plans to establish a governing board to oversee HSE performance.  I spoke about this when I appeared before the Sl&aacute;intecare committee.  I am very pleased it appears in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We need to re-establish a board in relation to the HSE.  This will require legislation and I hope to have a board, with very strong competencies across key areas, established in 2018.  Current governance structures in the HSE are not appropriate.  They were only ever to be there as an interim measure.  The director general of the HSE has spoken about this, as have I, and as has the Sl&aacute;intecare committee.  I intend to publish very early in 2018 legislation to establish a board based on competencies that can bring greater accountability and governance structures to our health service.  With the support of the parties in the House we could pass that legislation quite quickly and ensure the board is populated and in place with proper skills and expertise as early as possible in 2018.</p><p> Taken together with the consultation on alignment of hospital groups and CHOs, these are significant foundation steps in moving towards an evolution in our health care system.  I am very aware of the need to bring decision-making closer to the point of care delivery and provide a counterweight to unnecessary over-centralisation, which impedes service responsiveness, but I am equally aware of the need to maintain a national-level focus in certain areas.  It is a balance.  What we can do locally in the region we should do and what we need to do nationally, in terms of standards and performance, we need to do.  These matters are under consideration as part of overall reform proposals.</p><p> It is important to mention that funding for new initiatives in budget 2018 was closely aligned with proposals in Sl&aacute;intecare.  This allocation of funding shows the commitment of the Government to supporting key actions necessary for reform.  These include a new primary care fund of &euro;25 million.  In his speech on budget day, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was very clear that this investment represents the start of a period of multi-annual investment in primary care and a GP contract.  There is additional funding of &euro;25 million for home care and transition beds, which is an important element of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, reductions in medicine and prescription charges costing over &euro;17 million, which will see prescription charges and the monthly drug payment scheme costs fall in January, targeted funding for waiting list reductions and, as has already been mentioned, funding to establish the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office.</p><p> The agreement of capital expenditure allocations over the next four years has also allowed me to increase significantly the financial investment in ICT.  The topic of ehealth was a very important part of the report.  This will increase from &euro;60 million next year to &euro;85 million in 2019, &euro;100 million in 2020 and &euro;120 million in 2021.  Thus, the budget for ehealth will more than double over its current level, allowing for significant expansion in digital health and ICT systems.</p><p> I also announced that in 2018 I will undertake a process of engagement with representative bodies of contracted health professionals, such as GPs, pharmacists, opticians, dentists, aimed at putting in place a new multi-annual approach to fees, commencing in 2019, in return for service improvement and contractual reform and in line with Government priorities and Sl&aacute;intecare priorities for the health service.  This will support the development of a new modern contract with GPs and other primary care providers, and is in line with emphasis on this area in Sl&aacute;intecare and issues raised at this committee over recent meetings.</p><p> I have heard from many understandable frustration with the pace of the response to the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We all want to reform the health service but it is a ten-year plan.  There is a great deal of ground work to do to make sure we can succeed on this.  We can all agree that sometimes the pace of policy making and decision making is not what it should be, but in this case I do not believe that the criticism is fair or realistic.  I am firmly of the view that a careful and proper process of consideration is vital so that this does not all fall over when we hit the ground running in 2018.  The proposals in Sl&aacute;intecare represent one of the largest programmes of reform not just in the health sector, but in the public service more generally.  They reach into the very operation of our health care system, and into our systems of entitlement and access.  Neither the change that is required to deliver on these proposals nor the challenges that will be encountered in making them a reality should be underestimated.</p><p> We need to properly consider these challenges and seek to learn from past reform mistakes - this is not the first time we have tried to reform the health service - and we need to look at past reform in this regard internationally as well.  Our success will very much depend on the formulation of an effective implementation path.  Implementation requires planning and identification of strategic decisions.  It requires putting the right people in place.  This is the process that I am engaged in at present with Government colleagues, my Department and the HSE.  Having read commentary in this regard, I personally attest to the commitment of all those, most particularly, my Department, involved in this work.  In recent days, there have been challenges to the bona fides of this commitment and I want to refute that in the strongest possible terms.</p><p> The Government has charged me and my Department with developing a draft implementation plan by the year end and that is what we will do.  We are deadly serious about it.  I am receiving the wholehearted and enthusiastic commitment of the civil servants in the Department of Health in the detailed implementation planning which is under way.  I thank my staff for that.  We have started extensive staff briefings to inject a degree of excitement and enthusiasm across both the HSE and the Department of Health that, when I am gone, when new Governments come and go, this is the plan that we all signed up to and that we will deliver collectively over the next ten years.</p><p> I look forward to returning to Government with a detailed response and the draft implementation plan.  I very much look forward to coming back here when I have that, perhaps in January or whenever the committee wishes, so that we can discuss the detail of the implementation plan, the timelines and the progress we will make in 2018 and in subsequent years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017112200002#F00200"><p>Before I open the meeting to other members, I myself will comment.</p> <p>  The role of this committee is to hold the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE to account on the urgent need for health reform as laid out in the Sl&aacute;intecare report and this will be the lead committee to oversee that reform programme.</p> <p>  If evidence of the need for reform was needed, it was clearly illustrated on last night's "Prime Time" programme which demonstrated and exposed the damage of mixing public and private care in the public hospitals.  It leads to unfairness and inequality of access.  One must ask why it takes a television programme to illustrate these deficiencies in the health service.  It was a shocking indictment of management and clinical governance and it illustrates the perverse incentives to doctors and hospitals to have private patients treated at the expense of public patients in the hospitals where private patients and public patients compete for the same beds.</p> <p>  It also illustrated the pressure on the public hospitals to treat more private patients as these hospitals depend on their income from private health insurance to fund their public services.  This process is entirely wrong and denies access for public patients to the public hospitals.</p> <p>  The programme itemised the payments to consultants for hours not spent in public hospitals, but a far greater cost is to patients who are denied services because of failures to provide a consultant-led service in the hospitals.  It leads to increasing waiting lists and an unacceptable unmet need.  It means that senior decision makers are not present on the floor to make important clinical decisions and that leads to inefficiencies in the service.</p> <p>  To address this problem, we need to have a cultural change - the Minister himself referred to it - in the way we manage the health services and this involves accountability and sanction.  The public-private mix is one of the greatest barriers to health reform and has to be tackled.  It demonstrates the absolute need for legislation to hold hospital management and clinical management to account.  The Minister, in his statement, states that we need to give "careful consideration" to this issue but he does not state that he is determined to definitively eliminate private practice from public hospitals.  I hope the Minister will not be influenced by the powerful lobbies that will resist that change.</p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report points to reform and gives it a proper direction.  It is ambitious and radical and it has to be in that it has to bring equity of access based on need, not the ability to pay.  It is about fairness and justice for all.  The provision of adequate care is a human right and I believe patients are being denied human rights in the waiting lists that they have to endure, and the denial of treatment and procedures.  We must have a single-tier service provided on the basis of need, not the ability to pay.</p> <p>  A single-tier service, as outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare report, has cross-party consensus and this should not be ignored or easily dismissed in the reform process.  We do not need to have a piecemeal implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report items which are in keeping with existing Government policy while the Minister procrastinates on the difficult but essential elements of reform which will require extraordinary political commitment if we are to develop a health service which we can trust and which can deliver quality care.</p> <p>  Six months have passed since this report's publication yet we still await the appointment of a lead executive and the setting up of an implementation office.  We await legislation to reconstitute the HSE and the setting up of a Cabinet subcommittee in the Department of the Taoiseach to oversee the reform process.  Without these essential components the reform process is not going anywhere.</p> <p>  The Cabinet subcommittee needs to be at a level of the Taoiseach and needs to have the power of the Taoiseach and the inter-connectivity between the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health.  This high-level political commitment will be needed to oversee the implementation office and give it political protection in delivering Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  We must start drawing up legislation which will underpin the statutory basis of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We need legislation on a national health fund; legislation for a new Irish Sl&aacute;intecare Bill and legislation for accountability in the Department of Health and the HSE; and, legislation to set up national standards in clinical governance.  None of these is forthcoming to date.  They are of vital importance if we are to establish a proper functioning health service which can deliver quality care.  It is only then that we can start to effectively invest in health reform.  If we do not have this legislation, investment in health reform will be wasted.</p> <p>  We should not let complacency develop.  Already key deadlines have been missed.  The implementation office, under the auspices of the Taoiseach, has not been set up.  Recruitment of a lead executive at the level of Secretary General has not happended.  Staff with expertise in implementing change have not been recruited.  A detailed implementation plan has not been published six months after the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  We need to combat resistance to change, both in the Department and the HSE and in the wider health service.</p> <p>  Several members of this committee and I, as Chair, were members of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and we know the recommendations of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The reality is that all milestones set out to date in the implementation section have been missed.  This indicates that the reform programme is stalled and has gained no political momentum to date.</p> <p>  The Minister was quite correct in stating that the Committee on the Future of Healthcare did not sidestep its responsibility in this report.  We expect the same commitment from the Minister.  We need commitment at the highest political level to form the Sl&aacute;intecare reform process.</p> <p>  It appears that the Minister was second guessing many of the recommendations of the report.  Deputy Harris was calling for space and time to reflect and deliberate on and consider the report.  The Minister has had six months to do so yet we have had no completion of any action recommended in the report.  The programme office has not been set up, a missed deadline.  A lead executive has not been appointed, a further missed deadline.</p><p>The failure to develop a draft implementation plan is also a missed deadline.  A Cabinet sub-committee chaired by the Taoiseach and consisting of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Health, has not been established to give political power to the implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.</p><p> Apart from the often proposed reorientation of the health service towards primary care, the disentangling of private care from public hospitals is an essential component of Sl&aacute;intecare, as illustrated by the television programme broadcast last night.  While a chairman to oversee the independent review has been appointed, the review group has not yet been populated, which is another missed opportunity. </p><p> The report refers to the realignment of community health organisations and hospital groups.  The decision to put this proposal out for a consultative process will again delay reform.  I referred to the legislation to reconstitute the board of the Health Service Executive, which has not been brought before the D&aacute;il and is unlikely to be presented to the Houses before 2018.  The timeline for this Bill is much too vague. </p><p> The Sl&aacute;intecare report makes extensive reference to ehealth and information and communications technology systems and the Minister spoke of increased investment in ehealth.  The HSE's chief information officer resigned from his post last week and stated the Government's failure to fund the programme was frustrating, noted that funding was in limbo and indicated that there was an absence of funding certainty coming from Government.  These were some of the reasons for his resignation, which hardly engenders confidence in funding the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.</p><p> The unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest for contract holders, including general practitioners, will not take place until 2019 at the earliest.  Coupling the unwinding of FEMPI with contract negotiations will not encourage young graduates to take up general practitioner contracts before 2020, nor will it address the manpower crisis in and crumbling of our general practice network.  These factors are already affecting the delivery of primary care and placing greater strain on hospital services.  This decision will inhibit meaningful reform for several years and delay the transfer and reorientation of our health service towards primary care. </p><p> The pace of response to Sl&aacute;intecare is much too slow.  Implementation milestones and processes to achieve these milestones are nowhere near completion.  Six months after the publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, a draft implementation plan is several months away.  Legislation must be enacted in several areas to give structure, responsibility, accountability, transparency and answerability to the health service.  I expect the Minister to pick up the pace of reform.  The joint committee will invite him back in the new year to give us an update on how he is progressing the Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017112200002#G00200"><p>The Chairman can expect me to pick up the pace, and I certainly will, but I expect to be held to account in respect of timelines to which the Committee on the Future of Healthcare adhered.  The Chairman criticised the lack of an implementation plan for Sl&aacute;intecare but the committee, on which he sat, asked me to produce one by the end of the year.  As I indicated, a plan will be produced by the end of the year.  I ask the Chairman to hold me to deadlines that have been established.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's fear that consultation will delay the process, perhaps the recommendation that we engage in consultation should not have been included in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Generally, it is a good idea to consult people who work in the health service and their representatives.  This is also the finding made by the committee in its report.</p> <p>  Tomorrow evening, the Cabinet committee chaired by the Taoiseach will meet again in Government Buildings to discuss the issue of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  While the joint committee has privilege in this place, it is important that we do not misinterpret the reasons people move to new jobs.  I am aware of the reasons for decisions made by individuals to move from one place to another.  There is a legitimate issue with regard to capital funding.  Mr. Richard Corbridge was an excellent chief information officer for the health service and I am very sorry we lost him.  There are number of reasons for people's decisions to move to new jobs.  As I outlined in my opening statement, we will double the capital budget.</p> <p>  The deadlines for legislation the Chairman stated I missed do not appear in the Sl&aacute;intecare report until years 2 and 3 of the plan.  I share the frustration expressed by the Chairman and, having spent so many hours working on Sl&aacute;intecare, it is appropriate that he is committed to ensuring the report is implemented in full.  I intend to assure him by my actions and through regular appearances before the joint committee to engage on Sl&aacute;intecare.  I welcome his clarification, if it was required, that this committee is the lead committee on the oversight of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  The Chairman will hold me to account on this matter and I expect to be held to account.  We will deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is not a case of procrastination.  The report states we should procrastinate in that we should draw up a draft implementation plan, which I will do. </p> <p>  On the issue of vested interests, when it comes to the public-private mix my view is crystal clear, as is the Taoiseach's view.  He stated the Government does not believe the public private mix is appropriate and that Ireland is an outlier in terms of international norms.  I want to see the public-private mix ended.  It is my view that we should end private practice in public hospitals over the length of the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  That is my genuine belief and it is also my policy.  However, the reports asks that we do an impact study on the matter, which is what we will do.  I take the Chairman's points. </p> <p>  In terms of vested interests and equity of access, we have equity of access issues in secondary care and we have access issues in primary care.  I am determined to address these issues and Sl&aacute;intecare is the best vehicle for doing so.  I assure the committee of my commitment and that of the Government to working with it and delivering the plan. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017112200002#G00400"><p>I welcome the Minister and Mr. Breslin.  The Committee on the Future of Healthcare spent considerable time drafting the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I appreciate the work done by the Chairman and secretariat in providing support to the committee, members of the committee and the witnesses who appeared before it.  The report includes timelines to which we hope the system will adhere, regardless of who is responsible for doing so in the period ahead.  This should not be a matter for individuals as it requires corporate buy-in by the public service administration to ensure reform is seamless, regardless of which party is in government.  This is especially the case given that the agreement on Sl&aacute;intecare was reached by an all-party committee.  The difficulty we have had for many years is that health policy has been jagged, to say the least, in terms of political parties and manifestos.</p> <p>  One could be forgiven for blaming the political side for the direction the health service has taken and the fact that policy was reversed or changed or retrenchment took place.  This is a difficulty for those who are implementing policy.  That being said, we cannot completely exonerate those on the policy side of the Department with regard to the implementation, not only of the Sl&aacute;intecare report but also of previous policies.</p> <p>  The Chairman referred to the "Prime Time Investigates" programme broadcast last night.  The programme showed an abject failure in policy and to ensure contracts were enforced.  The director general of the Health Service Executive, Mr. Tony O'Brien, stated in a confidential email to the then Minister for Health, the current Taoiseach, that large voluntary teaching hospitals were in some instances breaking the rules in how they went about recruiting consultants.  The contract introduced in 2008 set a limit of 20% on the percentage of patients most public hospital consultants could treat privately.  However, in his email, Mr. O'Brien stated the percentage division between public and private was "a farce in practice".  This email was sent to the Minister's predecessor. </p> <p>  None of the members of the joint committee will have been surprised by last night's "Prime Time Investigates" programme.  We were shocked, however, to use the words of the Minister, by how immoral, unfair and brazen some of these individuals were.  While some people may be immoral and brazen and their behaviour will have unfair consequences, the bottom line is that contracts must be enforced and the Department and HSE are failing to do so.  The Department funds the HSE which informed the previous Minister and, I presume, current Minister that it could not enforce consultants' contracts and the position was farcical.</p> <p>  One of the principal problems at the heart of all of this was the decision in 2014 to redesignate all beds in public hospitals for private care.  This resulted in a profound shift and created a perverse incentive at the heart of the public health system to treat private patients in public beds.  We must quickly address the issue of contract enforcement.</p><p>I do not believe the HSE can do this because it is caught with a perverse incentive.  It has to fund the hospitals and it does that by putting public patients on waiting lists and private patients in public beds.  Whoever carried out the review for the Minister did not get to the heart of the problem because public waiting lists are increasing and some consultants do their private work elsewhere while junior doctors oversee their public waiting lists.  The Department of Health seems to be incapable of enforcing it.  What is it doing about it?  The HSE is in a bind with stretched budgets.  The fact that many public hospitals have a huge revenue stream from treating private patients ahead of public patients will not address the issues we are discussing, to ensure people are dealt with on the basis of clinical need. </p><p> "Prime Time" last night showed a Mrs. Comber, a patient in Limerick, trying to get a cataract operation.  I watched the programme a second time because I thought I was seeing things initially.  A Deputy from West Cork is busing people to Belfast because they cannot get into Cork University Hospital for ophthalmic surgery.  At the heart of our public health system is a system that perversely incentivises public hospitals to put public patients on waiting lists and private patients in public beds.  Many consultants are in on the game as well.  I do not believe that either the organisation that Mr. Breslin oversees or the HSE is capable of enforcing these contracts because they are incentivising the public system by doing this.  We need an independent evaluation and enforcement of contracts, separate from the Department of Health and HSE.  The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 allowed for charging in all public beds for private patients.</p><p> At the heart of the Sl&aacute;intecare report is the necessity for an impact study on the removal of private practice from public beds.  I argued for that and I was delighted that it was included in the report because the committee believes that this is creating difficulties in the public health system.  Equally, to strip it out in one fell swoop could have a negative impact, just as the present situation has a negative impact.  We have to tread carefully to ensure we do not undermine services.</p><p> On fiscal smoothing of capital spend to comply with EU budgetary rules, there has been poor capital expenditure over the past ten years in the health service and there will be a huge deficit in the future with demographic changes, aging population, more chronic disease and chronic illness all placing more demands on our public health system.  We will need to spend a lot of money on the capital side.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, said we need at least 2,000 extra beds.  The Minister's capacity review will be coming out soon which will probably seek more than that because we need more than acute beds.  Do we need to renegotiate with the European Union how we account for capital expenditure?  Four years is too short for fiscal smoothing a hospital.  In any other business that would be done over a prolonged period.  The system is front-loaded and that will diminish the capacity of the State to invest in major infrastructural projects that are needed because of the deficit rules.</p><p> Has any thought been given to that issue that is retarding the State's capacity to invest in long-term capital spend?  Have any additional resources been outlined or highlighted in the Department of Health to oversee this?  I know there will be a recruitment process for a lead executive.  There has to be a draft implementation plan.  Have any senior officials been specifically designated to this particular project to make sure it is up and running?  The process is being led at the most senior levels in the Departmentand the  HSE and also involves close engagement with the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The committee was considering this and felt at one point maybe it should be separate from the Department of Health because we can argue that the overseers may have other interests because of budgetary constraints and not wanting to bring political embarrassment to their masters and I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister or to Mr Breslin but I am referring to the system.  Will the system bring forward reports and recommendations that the political masters simply cannot implement and are there difficulties and conflicts of interest there?  What additional resources have been given to the Department of Health by way of personnel to start the process of implementing the reform outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017112200002#H00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and the officials to the meeting.  Before making my remarks I wish to thank the Chairman, the secretariat, witnesses, the Trinity College team and committee members because we did good work.  We put great effort into the report and that is fairly obvious on reading it.  There are those of us who would have liked to see the report go further in some areas but in the interests of consensus everybody was capable of coming together and making the necessary accommodation with each other.</p> <p>  It would be silly for us to sit here and pretend we did not all watch the "Prime Time" report with horror last night.  I raised the issue of stretch targets with the Minister, over a year ago, on 16 November last and it strikes me that what will happen over the next couple of days will be an attempt to somehow shift all of the blame for this onto the shoulders of consultants.  Anyone who knows me knows that I have a history in the health service and would not always have been on the side of consultants but in this regard I think the Department and HSE need to step up and take some responsibility because the perverse incentives came from the political system.  The stretch income targets were a political instruction.  Effectively, the Minister is presiding over a system that not only tolerates the use of public money facilities and public contracts for the provision of private health care but actively encourages it, mandates it and insists upon it.</p> <p>  What I saw on the television last night did not in any way, shape or form surprise me.  Of course I was disappointed, shocked and upset, particularly to see a woman forced to sell some of her belongings to pay for private health care, but I could see very clearly this is a political matter as well as a service matter and it would be unfair to people working in hospitals to attempt to paint this as anything other than what it is.  In fact the incentive and the mandate to carry out this private work come from the political system.  The Minister referred to a culture of deference to consultants.  That may or may not exist but they work in the system that the Minister and the officials have designed.  The contracts were announced by the then Minister in the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrat Government, Mary Harney.  They came from the political system.</p><p>Nobody in the HSE invented this.  It came from the political system and the political system needs to step up and take some responsibility for it as it is continuing.  It has been one year since I raised the issue, on which the Minister has said some work has been done.  He has not been working on it for the past year, but he has certainly been more than well aware of it.  </p><p> The Minister has stated he is worried about staff in the health service over-working.  I hope this will extend to the working time directive.  I have spent a considerable number of hours and days with the working time directive implementation group.  We encountered nothing but resistance, as seen in the political system, in trying to make progress on it.  There are tens of thousands of staff in the health service who are working way beyond their contracted hours.  I am sure they will be very glad to know that the Minister is worried about the matter, but I also think they would probably prefer to know what he is doing about it because there is a recruitment and retention of staff crisis.  That is not the fault of the workers on the front line who are doing their very best.  Rather than express concern, the Minister might outline in concrete terms what he proposes to do.  I sincerely hope it is not more of what he has been doing up to now because, clearly, it is not working.  </p><p> I have gone through the Minister's statement.  He mentioned ehealth.  We all read the newspapers at the weekend.  Mr. Richard Corbridge will be a great loss to the project.  I question the commitment of the Department and the HSE to moving forward in a meaningful way with an ehealth strategy as we are far behind the rest.  I know that members of the Government have got into trouble in comparing us with international standards, but it is true that we are well behind when compared internationally.  Clever and all as the statisticians in the Department are, I do not think they will be able to pull statistics out of the bag that will contradict what I have said.  We live in a state in which patients still bring their files with them.  If one goes to Holles Street hospital, one will see women walking in with their paper files.  It is nonsensical.  Much of what is contained in the Sl&aacute;intecare report is predicated on being able to make progress in that regard.  The fact that we cannot is very disturbing.  </p><p> The Minister has said he wants to translate the Sl&aacute;intecare report into a programme of action for the next ten years, which is very much to be welcomed, and that the process is being led at senior levels in the Department.  Will he indicate the individuals who will be responsible for driving the process?  </p><p> As regards the public consultation on the future alignment of hospitals, I have said previously that sometimes what we say here is directly contradicted by what is done outside.  On the one hand, the Minister says he wants public consultation on the future alignment of hospitals and, on the other, we read that trauma services will be withdrawn from a number of hospitals, which has caused nothing but panic.  People view this as downgrading and services being removed from their communities and it causes a huge amount of worry.  On the one hand, the Minister talks about public consultation and, on the other, about moving ahead in making some serious changes; I will not use the word "reform" in this case.  Will he outline what is supposed to come out of the public consultation process?  It was stated the board would be established in 2018.  Will the Minister give us an indication of the position in quarter one or quarter two-----</p></speech>

The funding targeted for waiting list reduction initiatives is &euro;75 million.  Will the Minister give us a breakdown indicating where that funding will be spent?</p> <p>  On the robust monitoring system that will be put in place, again, I go back to the stretched income targets.  This is something I raised in November and December 2016 and January, February, March, June and September 2017 and I would be forgiven for thinking I was being ignored.  Once again, RT&Eacute; has come to the rescue and will highlight issues that very often are raised here but do not receive much attention.  Will the robust monitoring system include monitoring of consultants who are paid but who not on the specialist register?  Are there proposals in that regard?  There is a serious issue which I raised with Ms Rosarii Mannion when she appeared before the committee.  I asked whether there were people - I do not know if I can use the term "consultant" - who were being paid a consultant's salary and who in the next few weeks or months would find themselves in the legal position of where they would have an entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration.  The fact is that there are such individuals.  One could not dispute that and it is an ongoing problem.  Last night we became aware that in some instances consultants were not where where they were supposed to be.  It involves a minority of them.  Ms Mannion told us that qualified colleagues could oversee the work of those being paid the consultant's rate but that they were not eligible to be entered on the specialist register.  It strikes me that there are several holes in the system.  If people are in work, they should be doing the work they are supposed to be doing.  We see that it happens in a minority of cases.  How are the people who are picking up the slack back at the ranch, some of whom are not eligible for entry to the specialist register but who are being paid at the consultant's rate, to be supervised?  To be fair to Ms Mannion, she seemed to be hanging all of her hopes on that happening.  I would not have any faith in that regard, but it seemed to pass for a strategy in the HSE to deal with what was a very serious issue.  </p> <p>  There are a number of competing issues, all of which will need to be monitored.  Will the Minister outline how that monitoring will take place and who will be involved in it? When we can expect to see the results published?  As someone who represented workers in the health service for many years, I can tell the Minister that if staff in other grades were late for or absent from work, it would not be tolerated.  Even if someone was absent from work for a very good reason, he or she would still have to account for himself or herself.  I will resist any effort to throw a minority under the bus to deflect attention from this issue because what we saw last night had its origins in Government policy.  It is the natural outworking of Government policy.</p></speech>

I commend all those involved in devising the plan.  I know that many hours of work went into it.  It is great that there was cross-party involvement and support.  I hope health will always be above party politics and think this is a great start.  </p> <p>  I am glad that the Minister referenced the meeting in Cork.  As great things happen in Cork, it is a good omen.</p> <p>  The report identifies on page 46 that many people with disabilities are denied access to the opportunity to live independently owing to the lack of services.  The report refers to a statement made by the Disability Federation of Ireland that persons with disabilities are among those at a higher risk of living in poverty.  What plans are in place to curb this?  </p> <p>  As we all know, most people want to reside in their own home.  On page 48 the report deals with the reduction in the number of home help hours and the impact it has having on the elderly and people with disabilities.  All Deputies and Senators are inundated with requests from constituents for more home help hours.  It is in the top three things being done in my office every day.  It is particularly prevalent in west Cork and the issue needs to be addressed.  I have spoken to the Minister about it previously.  How does he see it being achieved?  </p> <p>  I am also concerned about but not surprised by the complexity of the problem in accessing care.  It ultimately creates financial barriers for certain individuals, which makes it all the more necessary to ensure health care is universal and available to all.</p><p>I hope the agreed timeframes will be adhered to and that things will not just be made up as we move forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017112200002#K00200"><p>I thank Deputies Kelleher, O'Reilly and Murphy O'Mahony for their questions.  Deputy Kelleher is correct in that the political system cannot wash its hands and say that all of the challenges relating to the health service have been caused somewhere else.  No party, including Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, or Government can absolve itself from the continuum of change which there has been in terms of policy and which has meant that no project - good, bad or indifferent - as ever been finished.  Lots of reform agendas have been commenced but have never been concluded.  The greatest strength of the Sl&aacute;intecare report is the political consensus such that I, as Minister for Health, and my successors will have a roadmap for this area.  In that context, I acknowledge the presence of Deputy Shortall, Chairman of that Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.</p> <p>  On the enforcement of contracts, I stand over what I said.  What we saw on the national airwaves in regard to a minority of consultants was immoral, brazen and unfair.  Before we move to the issue of the responsibility of managers, we need to pause and consider that of personal responsibility.  We have some very highly-qualified individuals in our health service who did not show up for work or do what they signed up to do.  There is a managerial issue here.  I refer to the need for accountability and management and for improvements in this regard on a regular basis.  However, the managers turned up for work.  It was the doctors who, in some cases, did not do so.  It is the doctors who, in some cases, did not do what we paid them to do.  Deputy Kelleher is correct that it is the job of the HSE to enforce the contracts and the job of the Department to monitor the position and ensure that they are being enforced.  I did not design the contract.  It is a legacy I have inherited.  I do not like the current contract or the current mix of private-public care.  I do not think it serves our patients or our public service well.  I agree with the direction outline in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Deputy Kelleher is correct in his comments about the impact study.  It is important that we check that there are no unintended consequences and that we see it through the prism of ten years.  I want it to be clear that I want to see private practice removed from public hospitals, albeit on a phased basis over a number of years.  That is my policy position.</p> <p>  Nationally, approximately 82% of the work is being done in the public system.  The HSE is reaching or exceeding the 80-20 split nationally in regard to contracts.  Within the statistics, however, are hidden outliers on either end.  It is acknowledged that some consultants are working way more than they should be and that there is a risk of them being overworked.  Equally, there are incidences of people working for only a few hours per week and being paid for hours not worked.  I assure the committee that my Department has been engaging with the HSE for a number of months on the need to have a better monitoring system in place to provide assurances that the contracts are being adhered to.  I want to see that system in place for 2018.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked what the system will look like.  I want the HSE to design but I want it to be a system which provides as much assurance as possible in respect of doctors as is the case with nurses.  For example, we must know if a person has done what he or she was paid to do.  I mentioned that there appeared to be a culture of deference regarding consultants in parts of our health service in that a nurse or health care worker could be asked why he or she was late for work but nobody could actually say whether a consultant had worked his or her required hours.  I do not want to cast a slur on all of our doctors because many of them are doing a fine job.  However, we know that those who were not doing their work were not, perhaps, pulled up in the same way that other grades in the health service would be.</p> <p>  I do not see this as throwing a minority under the bus.  It is appropriate that the HSE would formally investigate each of the cases shown on the national airwaves last night, as would happen in any workplace.  I should make the following point because the context is important.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's 2015 report on the health service highlighted a problem in respect of the collection of private income such that at a committee meeting at that time we might, perhaps, have been asking different questions, including why managers were not collecting money that was duly owed to the State.  It is stated on page 224 of the report that the average delay in collecting moneys due to the State was 186 days.  In some hospitals, the delay was more than 300 days.  When people talk about setting targets for managers regarding income, that is not in any way to be done in the context of ignoring the legal requirements of a contract.  Rather, it is to ensure that moneys owed to the State are collected.  That is the situation, for better or worse.  Members want might to see that system or the legislation changed but managers are required to collect the money that is owed to the public health service.</p></speech>

There is a huge problem in this regard.  The Minister cannot say that anybody here suggested that money due to the State should not be collected.  Of course, it should be collected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017112200002#K00600"><p>I am not saying Deputy O'Reilly or any other member suggested that.  There has been an issue in our health service regarding the non-collection of fees owed to the State.  That is not my view or a political view, it was the view of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2015 report.  It is appropriate, therefore, that, in its service planning every year, the HSE sets out its expectation as to what the revenue level is likely to be and an expectation that managers would bring in that funding.  If we, as an Oireachtas, want to change this, that is fair enough.</p> <p>  On capital spending, Deputy Kelleher is correct in the sense that there is clearly huge pent-up demand for capital investment.  I welcome that the Sl&aacute;intecare report examines not only the revenue side of the health service but also the capacity side in terms of capital.  We can address this issue through the ten-year capital plan.  I say that for a number of reasons.  If we decided to build a number of major new hospitals, ambulatory care centres and so on, there is a significant lead-in time in that regard in the context of planning, tendering, etc.  In this regard, a ten-year plan provides more flexibility and scope to the health service.  I would not like to interfere in any other ministerial area in terms of the conversations which the Deputy suggests should happen with the European Union regarding fiscal rules and how they are applied to capital.  I am satisfied that the ten-year capital plan will provide us with a vehicle for advancement of the bed capacity report, when concluded.  As correctly highlighted by Deputy Kelleher, trying to develop a major project with a two, three or four-year envelope is very difficult and not practical.  These are projects that require a multi-annual approach.  The assurance of funding on an annual basis allows for better planning.</p> <p>  Seven staff in my Department are working on Sl&aacute;intecare under the direction of a deputy secretary general.  The lead executive, when he or she arrives, will head that process.  Deputy Kelleher asked about my involvement in this area versus that of the Taoiseach, an issue on which I have previously engaged with the committee.  In terms of my understanding of the committee report, it provides that the programme reform office should be accountable to the Minister for Health of the day but also that the office should be under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Without getting into a definition of the word "auspices", if this office is to be accountable to me, as Minister, and to whoever comes after me, there is a way that needs to work.  I want to assure the committee that the Department of the Taoiseach is involved in the steering groups and in the Cabinet sub-committee, which is chaired by the Taoiseach.  When the lead executive arrives, we will do all that is required to ensure that the process is robust.  We need a whole-of-Government approach to this.  I do not dispute that.</p> <p>  In regard to the cancer reform programme, which, as a country, we can and do hold up as a really good example of cancer reform, the lead on this programme worked for the HSE and was not based in the Department of the Taoiseach.  We managed to make incredible changes.  We should not get too tied up in the physical location of the office, although I accept that people want to know that Sl&aacute;intecare is supported at a higher level than that of line Minister.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly made the point that we designed the consultants' contract.</p><p>On the issue of who designed it, I want to be clear that neither I nor the Government designed the consultants' contracts position or the public-private mix.  I am determined to help us get to a better place in that regard in accordance with Sl&aacute;intecare.  I would not have designed it like this and I am not happy with the public-private mix.</p></speech>

It is not a policy supported by my Government or my party.  We will have the Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir impact study and I have outlined what I intend to do in the interim.</p> <p>  On the issue of trauma, I cannot get into it too much because I have not yet brought the report to the Government.  I do not see the need to do a consultation.  While I believe it is important, I do not see it in any way stopping or slowing down clinical reforms which are clinician-led.  I hope to bring the trauma report to the Government this year when it is published.  It will involve significant clinical and patient advocacy buy-in to putting in place a trauma network which will save lives.  We will follow the clinical evidence in that regard.  I am happy to have a discussion about that.</p> <p>  On how waiting list funding will be expended, while not wishing to frustrate the process, I will have to refer it to the service planning process in terms of the detail of that which will be due out at the end of the year.  I look forward to discussing that with the committee.</p> <p>  On the specialist register and the comments made by Rosarii Mannion in that regard, it is important that we do not want to normalise the situation, suggesting we are happy to have people who are not consultants paid as consultants and supervised by consultants.  The measure suggested by Ms Mannion was an interim one.  We need people to appear on the specialist register and people need to know the consultant they are seeing is a specialist.  I will send the committee an update on the state of play in this regard.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony for her comments on the work done on getting the report together.  On the issue of independent living, the detail will be seen in the service plan.  The task force on personalised budgeting, overseen by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is due to complete its work this year.  We will be able to have fruitful discussions about this in 2018.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Dolan on this and Deputy Murphy O'Mahony is a strong advocate in this area.  We must examine how we empower people.  For far too long, the State has thought its relationship with the person with a disability begins and ends with the writing a cheque for a service provider.  We cannot tolerate this.  We have many excellent service providers but we need to empower our citizens.  Personalised budgeting will provide this.  We have received more than 2,600 submissions for the statutory home care scheme.  The report on this will be out in early 2018.  It is a large consultation.  This is what happens when the committee invites me in at the end of the year.  This will show the roadmap for a statutory care scheme.  I will raise the Deputy's specific issue concerning the service provider in west Cork with HSE.</p></speech>

Equally, I note the Chairman's opening statement and welcome it.</p> <p>  New wine in old wineskins comes to mind.  Deputy Billy Kelleher talked about perverse incentives.  I am not being prophetic in saying that is what is happening.  It is an absolute risk and danger, however.  This report is wholesome and we are all committed to it.  It is important, however, that it does not catch the old viruses in the system.  That has to be watched morning, noon and night.</p> <p>  If one takes the broad family of people with disabilities and issues such as mental health and chronic conditions when they get to a certain point, it involves a minority of the population.  However, it is the majority of those who face into the health system regularly and need support from it.  We have the recent information from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on the 2016 census.  Compared to the 2011 census, the population of people with disabilities is up from 13% to 13.5%.  The number of young people with disabilities has increased.  Hopefully, they will have many years of life.  However, it is years of living life with a disability.  It is different from becoming disabled when one is 70.  There is the good story there that people are able to survive and get on.  Up to one third of older people have a disability.</p> <p>  I am concerned when I hear those involved in service delivery saying they do not have supports.  Recently, I heard someone say they could not give a person with a disability support because they are waiting for someone who has the support not to need it any more.  That is the case as we go into the fifth year after the recession.  I am not pointing the finger at anyone but we are not able to keep pace with the level of need and expectation.</p> <p>  The Minister stated earlier that the report strongly supports a shift in our model of care, moving away from a hospital-centric approach to one focused on prevention, early intervention and providing the majority of care in the community.  I absolutely agree with this.  There was also reference to the human resources and staff in the system.  Staff are an element of the human resources but not the total, however.  The person with the disability or an illness is a resource.  Their family, as well as the numerous voluntary and local support organisations, are also a resource.  We also have 200,000 carers.  There are more full-time carers than nurses in our system.  These are real facts.  A new approach has to look at the broader human resources issue and how we support those who are disabled and others.</p> <p>  There are outside resources such as the environment and the social determinants of health, as well as the rightfully growing expectations people have.  I first saw that graphic about social determinants of health in the 1994 health strategy.  If it was not in that one, it was in the 2001 strategy.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin must have read that in a history book.</p> <p>  Naming the condition does not cure it and naming the possibilities does not make it necessarily happen.  The Minister's presence was spoken about.  There is also the presence of other members of the Government, whether here or in addressing this issue.</p><p>Poverty is a massive issue.  Unemployment is a massive issue.  There is also poor nutrition, isolation and poor living conditions.  There is a real place in all of this, if one wants to get to prevention and early implementation, for other members who sit around the Cabinet table, which must happen more often.  That is the axis around which the implementation of this report will hinge in the medium and long term.  </p><p> Earlier the Minister mentioned he was frustrated with the pace of the report's implementation and that it was a ten-year report.  The Secretary General mentioned 1987 and I mentioned 1994.  We had the Health Act in 1970 that resulted in eight health boards being created.  There was a change in 2000 that reduced the number of board members to seven plus the Eastern Regional Health Authority that had four subsets.  Four years later we got the Health Service Executive.  I have lost track of all of the reforms and changes of structure in the HSE.  We had a governance structure and we lost a board.  There were supposed to be other changes but they have not happened and now we are going back to a board.  We must move beyond simply changing the governance charter because there is more to reform than that.  Part of it is drawing in other members of the Cabinet.  We must also analyse the things that happen outside of the Department of Health that have a huge impact on people's lives.  As I have said before, children have got through school, graduated from college and face the hurdle of finding employment.  That is a tipping point for them in terms of their health and well-being.  If they can move on their health and well-being will be in a way better space.  If they cannot then they are back in some day place.  What does that do for someone who is in their mid-20s, 30s or, indeed, 40s?</p><p> I wish to refer to three aspects of the implementation mechanism.  One can get the right man or woman but the system that he or she works in will help or hinder.  </p><p> In terms of legislation, the Minister has mentioned putting administrative programmes on a statutory basis and gave a commitment to do so.  However, there is a dysfunction between the fair deal scheme and the plethora of instruments that are required to keep a person in his or her home and community.  The requirements range from personal assistants, home supports and access to other services.  Resources are an issue in the health services and beyond.</p><p> Another aspect is the organisational and cultural change.  Cultural change must include a whole of government approach but it must also be about the public understanding of what our health services are trying to do.  We have a way to go with that because we tend to think of our health services as being there to fix us.  We need the fixing bit but we also need health services and supports to live well.  </p><p> In conclusion, I shall mention the empowerment of people with disabilities.  The mobility allowance was abolished almost five years ago and the anniversary will be at the end of next February.  Ironically, the allowance was abolished due to equality issues and replaced with the motorised transport grant.  The mobility allowance was introduced in 1979.  People now use new language about empowerment and claim money follows the person.  What was the mobility allowance?  It was an outstanding  example of putting a few bob in someone's pocket to help him or her with his or her mobility.  It was money follows person and it was the person maximising his or her choice.  Therefore, we must rethink the current initiative.  Thirty years later people talk about the principle of money follows the person.  The mobility allowance was a simple programme that gave a few bob to people in west Clare, Donegal, Tipperary and wherever.  I am not having a go at the Minister but simply making a point.  As I have pointed out before, young people with disabilities have been put into nursing homes without consideration being given to other options while at the same time we are trying to move disabled people out of institutions.  Having the correct mindset, and dealing with the soft stuff and cultural aspects are very critical to making Sl&aacute;intecare work.  </p><p> Finally, like others, I welcome Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall who is chair of the Sl&aacute;intecare group.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017112200002#M00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  He referred to &euro;25 million for primary care during his presentation.  One of the issues in relation to any health report and change is about focusing on the primary care setting.  At present a huge amount of work is being referred to hospitals and GPs claim, and rightly so, that they do not get enough support.  I am concerned about the ongoing GP contract negotiations because they seem to be lasting a while.  I presume contract negotiations must take into account the recommendations in the Sl&aacute;intecare report on how we should progress.</p><p>I recently travelled to Plymouth with the National Association of General Practitioners and visited a number of GP practices.  One of the practices was very pleased that the time patients had to wait to see a doctor had been reduced from 15 days to eight.  On our visit we also discovered that all of the doctors who worked for a large GP practice of over 20,000 patients handed in their contracts and walked away.  As a result a local hospital had to recruit GPs to fill the void.  I do not want such a scenario to happen here in Ireland.  Therefore, it is extremely important that we progress and develop primary care.  We must ensure we adopt a joint approach rather than being dictated to from the top down.</p><p>I would like the Minister to indicate the current state of the negotiations and the timeframe involved for the GP contract.  Let us remember that the last contract is over 40 years old so there is a need for constant review.  The contract is a fundamental part of our health service.  As the chairperson mentioned in her opening statement, we cannot leave the negotiations to continue <i>ad infinitum</i>.  I had the privilege of serving on a State board for ten years.  I was involved in the contract negotiations for one particular aspect but, unfortunately, it took us 11 years to make progress.  I understand that the negotiations for the last consultant contract between the HSE and the Department took between eight and ten years.  Can the Minister tell us the current status of the GP contracts, the timescale and targets?  I know he cannot be very precise as negotiations are ongoing but we need some indication on that issue. </p><p>I have expressed my personal concerns about the following matter to the Minister over the past six months.  On the one hand, we are talking about a major ten-year plan.  On the other hand, there seems to have been a free for all in terms of hiring staff for the HSE.  More than 2,000 additional people have been hired in administration and management between December 2014 and April 2017.  Over the same period only 39 additional public health nurses were employed.</p><p>In the same time, only 39 additional public health nurses were employed despite over 2,000 being taken on in administration and management.  That leads me to the issue of management, an issue that arose in respect of the RT&Eacute; report last night.  My colleague raised the matter of specialist registrars not having the qualification but being paid as consultants.  Have we clear qualifying criteria for the people we install in management in hospitals?  I am aware of one hospital, and I have raised this with the Minister, that is now on it tenth manager in 18 years.  There appears to be a constant roll over of responsibilities within the HSE whereby one is in a position for two years and then one moves on to another job.  When the new person arrives, he or she can say he or she was not in that position when a decision was taken.  There is a delay in the decision-making process as well because the new person in the position has to familiarise himself or herself with the issue involved and can find that he or she is making no progress.</p><p> I am aware of a case recently where a GP came forward with a comprehensive proposal for cutting the cost of a particular service for the HSE.  However, he threw in the towel after 18 months because every time he went to meet somebody from the HSE to discuss it, a different person arrived and nobody could make up their mind.  This was about a saving whereby GPs would provide an additional service at a far reduced cost compared with the cost of people having to go to hospital.  That is an issue we also must examine when considering reform in the health service.  People are going into positions but the situation does not change after six or 12 months, so when somebody new arrives the person can say he or she was not there when something happened.  That is happening in the health service as well when there is a change in Ministers.  That culture appears to have transferred down the line.  It is a problem we must resolve.  When dealing with the management issue we must have a proper structure for dealing with that aspect as well.</p></speech>

The Sl&aacute;intecare report is an integral part of policy.  It has been adopted by the Department and now must be implemented.  We all accept that.  Anybody who has spent time in a Department will readily acknowledge that timescales are very difficult to fulfil.  If we think that one simply turns over a new page and overnight we will have a new system that will be effective, responsive and accountable, we are kidding ourselves.  It does not work that way and never has.  There are repeated examples of that.</p> <p>  The Secretary General referred to the 1980s but I can refer back to the 1970s when we had a system-----</p></speech>

It has been able to raise a number of issues recently from the outside which should have been readily visible and within the reach of the Minister and the Department at all times.  We should not have to wait for a report from anywhere.  That is my criticism.  Over the past number of years, I have repeatedly pointed to the unworkability of the system we have.  I realise that we are going to change and renew the board, but I will return to that shortly.  The fact is that the system does not work and can never work.  I repeatedly drew attention to that during the discussions on the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  If people think that it will work, they will find out ten years hence that it does not.</p> <p>  I read some of the reports that were produced prior to the abolition of the health boards in 2003 and 2004.  Some of the professionals felt it was necessary to get rid of politicians from the boards because they believed they should not be there at all.  Public representatives were a bad thing and one could not have them there making such decisions.  They were stopping old hospitals in the country being closed and the like.  However, we know now that their removal from the structure did not solve the problem.  There must be accountability and public representation.  On any board there must be the professionals at the centre and public representatives.  The three groups, including the hospitals, are merged and then the services are delivered.  We are kidding ourselves if we think for a moment that we can superimpose the Sl&aacute;intecare report on the existing system and achieve a good system.  Many members do not agree with me but I believe that the board should be broken up into at least four boards, whereby regional views would be heard at the centre.  The people on those boards should also be on a national board.  I have spoken about this previously.</p> <p>  I have also spoken about the snags that trip up the system, why the system does not work and why the river does not flow smoothly.  We have discussed this in the committee repeatedly yet, lo and behold, RT&Eacute; can produce an investigative report that points to some of the snags in the system.  They will remain there for as long as it takes to suffocate the system.  There is an urgent need to find out where those snags and barbs are, why the system does not flow smoothly and why people find themselves waiting forever.  There would be no need for waiting if we identified those issues.  I am aware from my dealings on this in my humble, simple way, because I am not an expert on this business, that countless people on waiting lists are being recirculated again and again within the system.  They are in the system or on a list three or four times.  There is no necessity for that.  They must be dealt with on a once-off basis to eliminate that part of the problem.  That is another issue on which RT&Eacute; or somebody else could conduct an investigation as well, to find out what is happening in that regard.</p> <p>  I have spoken to consultants in the public system who are frustrated.  I have mentioned this previously.  They find that a day in the public system compared with a day in the private system is like comparing chalk with cheese.  The reason is that they can get a full day's work done in the private system, because it is too costly to leave theatres and staff idle when people do not turn up for work or whatever the case may be.  The private system cannot afford that.  However, for some unknown reason that happens in the public system.  There is a budget of over &euro;15 billion.  While it is not the biggest expenditure ever, it is quite formidable given the size of our population and the size of the service.  It is a wake up call to find out whether we target our money to the areas where it should be targeted and whether we get good value for it.  Effectiveness comes with efficiency and good value.  If we are not effective, we are not dealing with the problems and we will have to deal with the same problems in 20 years' time.</p> <p>  I believe we must show progress in this area.  We are all on trial on this issue.  This winter is a litmus test of the system as it stands and the extra money being provided.  If it does not show results there is a far more serious problem, and pouring more money on it will not solve it.  I hope we do not find ourselves three or four months hence looking back and finding that although we spent more money, we did not get a better return.  Take the example of the scoliosis cases.  Why in that situation was there such a severe problem affecting a relatively small group of people in terms of the overall numbers and yet it could not be resolved?  It does not require rocket science to figure it out.  The problem was small but it was huge for the individual patients concerned.  It has a huge impact on their and their families' lives.  We must examine that as well.</p> <p>  I have said enough.  The setting of targets is fine.  We must set targets and they must be ambitious, but we should never attempt to set targets based on insecure, unsafe and unworkable structures.  If we do that, we will only repeat the mistakes of the past.  I read the speeches of the Minister at the time the health boards were abolished with regard to the intent behind abolishing those boards.  Nothing has changed.  During the years that have elapsed since 2003, we had a major recession.</p><p>That was not a help, either.  The fact is that we now have to stand back.</p><p> Incidentally, accountability seems to have been lost.  Between 2004 and 2012, there was no accountability whatsoever as far as public representatives or committees of this House were concerned.  We could not even get answers to parliamentary questions.  That was forbidden and the system was all closed off.  I stand testament to this because I objected strongly at the time.  I did not wait until now to do so.  I was punished severely for it on numerous occasions in the House.  If I get angry when I hear some of these things repeated over and over, it is with just cause.  I hope we have learned some lessons and become realistic in our outlook.  I hope we do not repeat the mistakes of the past by depending on structures that have been shown to have failed.  I also hope that, by identifying those unsound structures, we will build a new health system on a sound basis that is accountable, efficient, cost-effective and as good as any comparable service in Europe or elsewhere.</p></speech>

On Deputy Durkan's comments, I think those of us in the political system may ask if there are people in the Civil Service who are committed to health reform.  However, if we are to be honest, those in the Civil Service might also ask if those politicians are ever committed to health reform.  I do not think Ireland Inc., the political establishment or the Civil Service have covered themselves in glory in terms of starting a reform process.  There has been stopping, starting and changing.  I certainly am aware of the level of confusion there has been in my Department in respect of health policy for a significant period.  None of us can be fully absolved of blame in this regard.  There is a great level of enthusiasm right through the Department now that there is a roadmap and also a plan that is not going to keep changing.  We can actually get on with a body of work now, which is quite encouraging.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about public representation.  It should not be seen as a dirty word.  People are elected to represent the citizens and have a right to stand up for their communities and constituencies.  I think 8,000 parliamentary questions were asked of my Department last year.  Certainly, the volume of issues Deputies are highlighting is quite immense.</p> <p>  I feel strongly about reinstating the board of the HSE.  I spoke very strongly about that matter before the Sl&aacute;intecare committee.  I do not think it is appropriate that a CEO is effectively reporting to himself.  I do not mean that about the individual CEO because I have heard that director general say the same thing publicly as well.  We cannot have a situation whereby people meet and tell each other whether they are doing a good job or a bad one.  In fairness, it was an interim arrangement because it was meant to be about dismantling the HSE.  We now have the Sl&aacute;intecare report and need to embrace the fact that there is going to be a national entity, albeit with much devolved to the regional structure.  It is clearly stated on page 26 of the report that this is a move towards a form of regional health resource allocation with accompanying governance structures.  There are some things that will always be done better on a national level.  We would not have delivered a national cancer strategy that is saving thousands of lives if we had taken a fragmented approach.  We would not have delivered some of the clinical programmes in respect of sepsis.  Lots of progress has been made on the basis of operating at national level.  Nonetheless, far too much has been centralised and is done at that level.  There are often too many layers between the patient and the solution.  The HSE, as currently configured, is not the vehicle of the future.  The Deputy is entirely correct in that if we were to take the policy elements of Sl&aacute;intecare and impose them on the current structures, we would not fix the health service.  In fairness, the report does not propose that we do so but, rather, that we make significant changes.</p> <p>  The point about the budget is accurate.  I can have an old and broken car and even if I spend an awful lot of money on repairs, it will still be old and broken.  It is right and proper that we increase investment in the health service but the car we are driving needs to change.  It is not sustainable to keep pouring money into the current model.  Change and reform are not things that are nice to do for the sake of it, discretionary extras or things that we are all doing because we think we are supposed to.  We actually have to do them.  The system is falling over and we have to put in place a better health service.</p> <p>  In the context of this winter, the HSE publishes trolley figures every day at 8 a.m.  They are there for all to view and show that over 1,300 fewer patients on hospital trolleys this November than last November and, overall, fewer patients on trolleys every day this November than last November.  However, there are still far too many patients on trolleys.  We cannot pretend to be surprised when we have not linked demographics to health services.  I often use the example of education.  One would be envious of being Minister for Education.  That Department does not always get it right but, broadly speaking, every year it knows that there will be X children turning four, five or six and that Y number of schools, teachers, desks and so on will be required as a result.  With, I accept, a few bumps in the road, it generally matches.  We have not done that in the health service.  That is what the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the bed capacity report, the capital plan and the GP contracts are all about.  It has to be demographically linked from now on and I want to assure members that it will be.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke referred to primary care.  There are things we can do quickly to show a shift to primary care and make a real difference.  There is the big stuff and the ten-year plan but there are things we can and should do next year.  I was in Castlebar at the opening of the primary care centre, which Senator Rose Conway-Walsh attended.  There were 517 people in April in Mayo waiting for an X-ray.  They opened a primary care centre and put in an X-ray facility.  There is an ultrasound facility going in now also and there are zero people waiting for an X-ray in Mayo.  We are going to do one in Tuam.  There are straightforward things.  A very good example is the primary care eye review.  Dr. Billy Power as clinical lead and others came together.  Ophthalmologists in the community and acute hospital settings have spoken.  At relatively small cost, they can shift an awful lot of procedures and review appointments out of the hospitals.  We can do that.  We should be able to start that in a real way next year.  There are things we can do quickly.</p> <p>  There are other things that are going to take a little bit longer.  This is where there is friction, which is recognised by the committee and the report, between building capacity and increasing the service.  We have to be sure we get that right.  I take the Senator's point that we do not want to lose what is good about our GP service.  Recently, I launched the report by Professor Tom O'Dowd of Trinity, which showed that about 90% of Irish citizens are very happy with the GP service they get.  They would like more and all that stuff but they are very happy.  That will not come as a surprise or shock to any public representative or citizen.  However, we do not want to end up with a waiting list for GPs.  That is part of the Senator's point.  When I tried to articulate that recently at the launch of the report, it got completely distorted by a GP organisation, which tried to say that I was making an outrageous point.  I will restate the point I made now and on every occasion I am asked.  It is that there are parents who go to bed worried about finding &euro;55 or &euro;60 to go to the doctor the next day. Regardless of whether GP organisations like me saying that, I am going to keep saying it.  It is not acceptable.  There is not just an equity of access issue in secondary care.  There is an equity of access issue in primary care.  Does that mean everything has to be absolutely free?  I do not believe so.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report refers to "no cost or low cost" and there will be different things for different services.  The point I was trying to make was that we need to have that discussion.  It is not about competition authorities or setting fees.  It is interesting that they said the Minster is interfering.  People usually call on me to interfere in absolutely everything but when I dare to say something about &euro;55 or &euro;60 being too much for a lot of working families that do not qualify for a medical card, I am criticised.  That does not mean it has to be entirely free.  We should listen to GP organisations about the lessons from the provision for children under six, which are significant.</p> <p>  The Senator asked where we are with the contract in respect of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act 2015.  We have made good progress with the Government decision of two weeks ago.  The Chairman has rightly raised this matter with me before on behalf of constituents.  The issue has also been highlighted by organisations.  We have a process to unwind FEMPI for public servants.  People working in the health service today will start to get some of their FEMPI money back over a period.  They have agreed to do different things as a result of that and the process is in train and has been accepted by all health unions.  The health contractors had FEMPI and have not had a process of restoration.  Our GPs have taken huge hits.  At the event to which I just referred - although it was not reported - I also said that GPs have been put to the pin of their collar in many cases.  They are under huge financial pressure.  I acknowledge that.  We have a process now whereby we can engage with GPs very early in 2018 in respect of FEMPI.  I describe that process as an enabler for some of the changes we need to make to primary care.  </p> <p>  The Senator asked where exactly we are with the contract discussions now.  He is right that it is a very old document that we are working off and there is a huge amount of work to be done.</p><p>We now have a very clear list of all of the issues and all of the things we could do in primary care services.  There are some things GPs want to do, while there are others we want them to do.  We have that list and are working our way through the issues.  I hope we can make some progress on it in 2018 in order that we can provide some additional services.  The Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, was instructive in its references to the need for a multi-annual approach.  I was pleased when the Minister talked about the need for multi-annual investment in primary care services and the GP contract.  The inclusion of that line in the Budget Statement should be seen as significant.</p><p> On the point made about administrators and managers, while I do not want to go back over conversations we have had previously or repeat information Ms Mannion has provided for the committee, it is important that we make sure everyone is on board for Sl&aacute;intecare.  We cannot have a situation where there is a different reform programme or process in the HSE from that in the Department or across government.  Last week I chaired a meeting of the HSE leadership team and the Department's management team.  We had a very good meeting and I felt there was a buy-in by both organisations.  My aim was to deliver a clear message that there would be one plan and that was it.  Once it is in place at the end of the year, whether someone is in the HSE or the Department, that will be the plan to which he or she will work.  All decisions need to stem from it and not from a different reform agenda.  There is room for only one ten-year plan.  We can address a lot of the issues when we have the plan, but it will be the plan to which the HSE will have to work in the decisions it will make.</p><p> At one level the point about management turnover is valid.  Deputy Louise O'Reilly often reminds me that it is difficult to make international comparisons at times, but I make the point that in the NHS there is probably a greater turnover of managers.  Managers stay for significantly shorter periods in the NHS.  That is what I am being told.</p></speech>

In that context, I make the point that there is a significant turnover of managers in the NHS.  We are in a situation where we need to develop management within the health service and hospitals.  I sometimes get into trouble for saying this, but the truth is that where there are good management structures in place in hospitals, we perform better than where we do not.  I was in one the other day which shall remain nameless.  There had been a change in a number of personnel and there was a lot of new energy in the place and the metrics were very much moving in the right direction.  We need to support good management.  We also need to recruit good managers.  We need to consider holdindg more international competitions.  We recently hired two deputy director generals for the HSE through an open international competition.</p> <p>  I thank Senator John Dolan for his comments on other members of the Government having a role in this regard, which they do.  A lot of what is contained in the Sl&aacute;intecare report and what the Senator talked about is preventative.  It is concerned with having a healthy society and people not getting sick in the first place.  I have a role to play in that regard but so too does education, as well as a lot of elements of the health service.  Issues such as poverty are also relevant.  The Senator's advice is wise in avoiding what he described as old viruses in the system.  This is not the first time people have tried to reform the health service, but this time there are differences.  The all-party approach is a big one.  I also take the Senator's point about going beyond structural change, which is also a risk.  If in a year's time the public sees that all we are doing is talking about structural change, the view will be "here they go again."  I believe structures need to be changed for all of the reasons outlined by the Sl&aacute;intecare committee.  There is too much centralisation; there is no proper governance and there are lots of changes we have to make.  However, in doing so we also have to try to have tangible wins for the people in order that they can see the benefits.</p></speech>

The NHS in Britain was set up by Aneurin Bevan and there was a structure to which everybody worked.  In Ireland the system was developed in a completely different way.  We have section 38 and section 39 organisations, the involvement of the religious in health care, private GP services and so forth.  The Sl&aacute;intecare plan is very significant because, as the Minister has pointed out, it provides a roadmap for us.  Everything one discusses, no matter where someone is in the health system, will be guided by the plan.  It is radical and one that I support because it will move us towards a single-tier, universal health service paid for from general taxation.  However, I am concerned because the report was laid before the D&aacute;il on 21 May and we were supposed to have quarterly reports on the implementation of the plan, which means that we should have received such a report in September.  We had a debate on the report which began in the D&aacute;il on 22 June and only finished last week.  We have had a very poor response from the main political parties.  There has been only one speaker from Fine Gael and two from Fianna F&aacute;il.  That is an indicator of a lack of interest, which gives cause for concern.</p> <p>  The real driver of the programme is the setting up of the implementation office and the appointment of an implementation officer at Secretary General level.  That should have been done by July.  While I accept that delays can happen, progress is very slow.  The Minister has said that in July the Government agreed to move forward with the establishment of a dedicated programme office and to recruit a lead executive, but we are still waiting for that to happen.  We recommended that the office be located within the Taoiseach's Department.  The Minister made reference to the technicalities involved and said it would be located within the HSE.  However, if there is resistance, that is from where it will come.  Locating the office in the Department of the Taoiseach was recommended in order that it could be kept separate.  The idea was that the lead executive would have authority to implement the plan.</p> <p>  The Minister has said he has also been tasked with developing a response and a draft implementation plan for consideration by the Government by the end of the year.  The committee did not ask the Minister to do this.  We asked that the implementation office do so, in co-operation with the Department.  That is why it was so important that the implementation office would be in place as quickly as possible in order to direct progress.  The issue of private practice in public hospitals, for example, should have been dealt with by the implementation office, in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Finance.  The implementation office will be the driving force and unless it is put in place, implementation of the plan will be left up to the Minister, which should not be the case.  </p> <p>  The Minister has said &euro;1 million has been set aside for the implementation office, but we wanted much more to drive it forward.  We wanted someone to take the Sl&aacute;intecare report and figure out how to get a buy-in by staff, the general public and all of the political parties.  There have been countless reports produced on the health service.  It has been pointed out that 2,000 administrative and managerial staff were recruited between 2014 and 2017, but only 39 public health nurses were recruited in the same period.  That is what the implementation office is supposed to address.  If there are proposals to recruit new public health nurses, we must go into the schools to encourage young people to consider working in the health service.  We need to tell them that it will be vibrant, not the service that is in place, that in the future those who will work in it will enjoy their work.  We need to improve communications between staff - nurses, doctors, GPs, psychiatrists and so forth.  Unless there is a vision driven by an implementation office that will be absolutely determined to achieve the Sl&aacute;intecare reports goals and that will work with all groups of stakeholders, we will not succeed.  The implementation office will not be able to cover every dot and comma, but it can work with the groups affected and convince them that if they work with it, there will be change.  However, it must be funded properly to enable that to happen.  Allocation of the &euro;600 million required for the Sl&aacute;intecare plan has not been committed to in the 2018 budget.  </p> <p>  There are many things about which I am concerned and unhappy.</p><p>Unless there is urgency in addressing these concerns, the people in the background who do not want them to be addressed will just keep picking away and undermining the process and we will not have a health service of which the people can be proud and in which they can proudly work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017112200002#Q00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  I commend the great work done in bringing to fruition the new primary care centre in Castlebar.  It is fantastic.  However, it is 17 years late.  One of the pilot projects under the original primary care strategy was in County Mayo.  However, the projects were never invested in or developed in the way envisaged.  Seventeen years later we have the centre in Castlebar which we do welcome.</p> <p>  What worries me a little is that when the Minister goes to some of the primary care centres, he gets all of the good news and hears examples of good practice, rightly so.  That is appropriate as it is important to mainstream good practice mentioned to the Minister in all of his visits, but he is not necessarily told that there are hundreds of children in County Mayo, for example, waiting for physiotherapy.  People wait for physiotherapy throughout life because we do not have nearly enough physiotherapists or occupational therapists.  Bearing in mind the needs associated with long-term illness and maternity care, for example, this issue is not being addressed in a proper way.  Sometimes it can be covered up.  This speaks to the number of parliamentary questions the Minister is being asked.  That they have to be asked in the first place is a waste of resources.  There are many things being covered up that should be transparent.</p> <p>  I wish to concentrate a little on the programme on the HSE shown last night.  It begs the question as to whether RT&Eacute; is responsible for running the health service.  We owe a debt to people such as Ms Oonagh Smyth and others who bring these concerns to the fore.  It is extremely worrying that 43,500 public patients have been displaced because of what is happening within the system.  Private patients are receiving preference over them and those affected have lost out in the past two years.</p> <p>  What has been lost as a result of the 2008 contracts not being fulfilled?  Has the Department estimated the cost to the public system?  Are there sanctions to be implemented?  Have they ever been implemented against the consultants who clearly broke their contracts?  If we do not have sanctions, we will not produce the behaviour required.  Was the Minister surprised by last night's programme or did he have all of the information already?  Why did the HSE stop compiling the compliance data for private practice limits within public hospitals?  Did it ask the Minister for permission to do this?  Sometimes it is very difficult for people to know what the relationship is between the HSE, the Minister and the Department and where responsibility lies.  It seems that the Minister has all of the responsibility and that the HSE has all of the authority in terms of implementation.  Did the Minister stop the compilation of data in 2014?</p> <p>  The strategy is very good.  The Minister's way of encompassing all political parties, albeit with limitations, is good.  It gives me some confidence.  I must, however, look back to 2002 when Fianna F&aacute;il was following its ten-year strategy, the aim of which was to deliver high quality health care for all.  The distinction between the public and private systems, however, was still to remain under its strategy, but it stated there would be greater equity for public patients and that this would be sought in the revised contract to come about in 2008.  The current strategy, like the Fianna F&aacute;il strategy which was an absolute failure, no more than A Vision for Change which was never supported or implemented in the way it should have been, will be judged by the hundreds of thousands waiting for appointments, those waiting for physiotherapy and occupational therapy in County Mayo and those waiting months for counselling, the waiting period for which is very worrying.  If a young person in County Mayo presents for counselling today through the primary care counselling system, he or she may have to wait for many months.  I have experience of working with it all the time on the ground.</p> <p>  I welcome the allocation in the budget for extra home help hours.  However, the Minister will know that it was only to address part of the existing waiting list.  It is not a matter of home help care hours anymore but home health care minutes, which is wrong.  If the Minister was to underpin the strategy and take immediate action, even by addressing the issue of home health care minutes by offering a minimum period of one hour, it would solve many of the problems.  People could be assured of having one hour rather than minutes.  There are other practical steps that could be taken in the meantime.</p> <p>  I wonder how much it cost to devise the Saolta system, even in terms of branding and logos.  Does the Minister have a figure for it?</p> <p>  Education and training are key to tackling these issues in the longer term.  There are models of good practice elsewhere.  What relationship does the Minister have with the Department of Education and Skills?  There are young people I know who would make fantastic doctors but who cannot obtain the points required or get through the quagmire of barriers they face in the education system.  I would like to see some movement in that regard.  We absolutely need to see it.  There could be a relationship whereby, even through funding models, a young person would be compelled to work within the Irish system for a certain number of years.  Until we tackle this issue, we will continue to have problems.  In all of this, I am conscious of the challenges that arise in the recruitment of clinicians across the board.  </p> <p>  I would appreciate it if the Minister answered those few questions.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's presentation and his very positive comments on Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  I agree wholeheartedly with all of the Chairman's comments on concerns we all have about the slippage of the plan in its timescale.  The starting point is the implementation plan.  We have all been of the view that this is key.  The lead was supposed to have been recruited in July.  While there was slippage because of the change of personnel in government, I was very hopeful when I spoke to the Taoiseach in August because he said he was in engaging in the recruitment process that month.  Unfortunately, four months later, we are still being told that the recruitment process is about to start shortly.  I would like the Minister to clarify whether there is to be a public recruitment process or whether he is headhunting.  Where exactly are we in the process?</p> <p>  I endorse the comments made by Deputy Joan Collins on what the Sl&aacute;intecare report set out regarding implementation.  On page 135 it outlines the steps that needs to be taken.  It states: "These provide the big-picture blueprint for a project plan to be developed by the Programme Implementation Office as one of its first actions and against which the implementation effort will be measured."  With all due respect to the very fine people in the Department of Health, there is institutional resistance to change in any major organisation.</p><p>This was supposed to be a detailed plan devised by the implementation office, not devised by the Department of Health.  If the Department or the HSE were committed to change, we would have seen it long ago.  We have not seen that kind of change, however.  I do not discount the key role the political system plays in this either.  It is a very important point that we should be recruiting an experienced person to lead and allow him or her to recruit a team and devise the detailed implementation plan.  It is regrettable that it has not happened.  The absolute urgency is to recruit that lead person.  I hope there will be no further delay.  I have received the same reply every month for the last four months on this and we would like clarification and action at this stage.</p><p> There is no doubt that there is a price tag attached to the health programme.  The timescale of 15 years which had been proposed was completely unrealistic.  The committee took the view that we should be spending to save.  There is no doubt that ehealth would achieve considerable efficiencies and safety within the system and we reckon it should be implemented over a five-year period.  While it is welcome that funding has doubled, the roll-out is not being accelerated sufficiently and certainly not in line with what has been recommended.</p><p> The Minister referred to progress on the impact study in respect of one of the key recommendations, which was to disentangle public and private medicine.  This goes to the very heart of the problems within our health system.  Coming to the end of the process, a number of members of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare came under severe pressure from outside to try to water this down or scrap the idea.  There was a push to qualify it to some extent in calling for an impact assessment to be carried out.  The final agreement on the wording was that there would be an impact assessment to assess the impact on public patients.  That is because we do not want this process used as an excuse to hold up the disentangling of public and private medicine.  That is what it looks like at the moment and I have a serious concern about it.  We need to move swiftly to start that disentanglement.  The vested interests that have maintained this very odd hybrid, which is unheard of anywhere else, are those people who are benefiting from the system as it operates at the moment.  They are not acting in patients' interests.</p><p> This brings us to the revelations in last night's RTE "Prime Time Investigates" programme.  There is a 2008 contract covering all consultants.  Last night's programme found that a significant minority of consultants are not adhering to it.  That is for two reasons.  A number of consultants are going off site to spend more time doing private work than public work and they are not meeting their public hours commitments.  Others are doing an undue amount of private work in public hospitals.  The contract provides for 39 hours of public work.  It is an extraordinary indictment of the system that no one knows whether consultants are doing 39 hours.  We know plenty of consultants exceed those hours but those committed people are being very seriously traduced by the behaviour of those colleagues who are engaging in the gaming of the system which we saw last night.  The fundamental issue is that the Department of Health and the HSE have no idea whether the contract is being complied with.  This affects nearly 2,500 consultants, all of whom are handsomely paid by the public purse, but we have no idea whether they are doing their work.  It takes "Prime Time" to put a number of those consultants under surveillance to find out what the truth of what is happening is.  That is a serious indictment of the system.</p><p> We need the urgent implementation of the contract.  A number of issues arise in that regard.  The new contract provided for the appointment of a large number of clinical directors.  These are consultants who were given the task of supervising their colleagues, for which they are paid an additional &euro;46,000.  What on earth are those people doing?  Clearly, they are not doing their jobs.  Is it time to sack some of those clinical directors or, at minimum, withdraw the huge &euro;46,000 allowance they receive for work they are clearly not doing?  What about the common waiting list?  That is part of the contract.  Is there a common waiting list in operation in any public hospital?  These are the clear legal terms of the contract but they are not being enforced.  What about penalties for consultants who breach the 20% limit?  The arrangement was that they would repay the income they received from private practice.  In the early days of the contract, we got some figures on the extent of the breaching of the limit and what those consultants owed.  I am not sure any of that money was collected.  Certainly, the Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to the problem.  That is part of the legal contract.  Why are the Department and the HSE not enforcing it?  Senator Conway-Walsh asked why the Department stopped collecting data which would have let us know what was actually happening.  Why is that?</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to the following a couple of years ago.  In 2015, Mr. Tony O'Brien stated in a confidential email to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, that the 80%:20% split was a farce in practice.  What did the then Minister do about that?  Before the Committee of Public Accounts in 2015, Mr. Tony O'Brien referred to the private sector as having a parasitic relationship with the public sector.  He said the information he had was that approximately 56% of admitting consultants in St. Vincent's private hospital were consultants whose contracts did not permit them to work there.  We were to get an audit of all of that but we have not seen the results.  Why has there been a two year delay in getting to the bottom of that when the evidence shows widespread breaches of the contract?  We have a vastly expensive contract with approximately 2,500 consultants which is clearly being breached all over the place.  That needs to be pursued rigorously.  What exactly is the Minister going to do about that?  The responsibility lies with the Department and the Minister to ensure we get value for money, which, clearly, we are not.  The people paying the price for this are the 685,000 people on hospital waiting lists.</p><p> The NTPF was asked to carry out an audit two weeks ago of waiting lists in five hospitals.  It found that the current waiting list situation was shambolic with widespread queue jumping and a failure to follow any of the protocols.  The current waiting lists have no integrity.  However, there was a big gap in the information provided, although I am sure the NTPF has it.  We need to see it published.  I refer to the profile of those people who are skipping the queue.  The suspicion is that a large number of the people the NTPF found going directly onto waiting lists for procedures were not coming through outpatient departments.  There is a suspicion that people are forking out &euro;220 to see a consultant and then finding their way onto a list within the hospital and receiving their treatment earlier.  We need to carry out that profiling of those people who are skipping the queue.  Many of us have suspicions about it.</p><p> I refer to the NTPF and the initiative taken this year and last year which Fianna F&aacute;il supports very strongly.</p><p>It is great to see people moving off the waiting list but if the Government takes an approach of incentivising a slowing down of work progressing through the public lists, it would create yet another perverse incentive for consultants to go slow when they could then be paid on the double if people access treatment by way of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That is a knee-jerk reaction and response to a problem; it is not a sustainable position.</p><p> This is not the Minister's policy with respect to the 2008 contract, but it is the previous Government's policy of allowing public hospitals to breach the 20% limit of work.  I recall that situation arising where a decision was taken at ministerial level to lift the cap on the amount of private work that could be done in public hospitals.  That immediately created a perverse incentive for hospitals which are already strapped for cash to increase the number of private patients.  As other speakers have said, the fact that hospitals were given stretched targets only exacerbated that.  Hospitals were incentivised to take more and more private patients at the expense of public patients.  That is a policy for which Fine Gael, under the previous Government, is responsible, and it must be tackled.  </p><p> Ultimately, we need a new consultant contract that will be a meaningful one and that will give us value for money and treatment for public patients.  All people should have the right to access treatment as public patients.  That is what a good quality universal public health service is about but in the meantime the Minister needs to give us an assurance and set out a clear plan of action to rigorously enforce the existing contracts that are in place, and where people have been found to fail in that regard, action should be taken.  They need to be made accountable.</p></speech>

I want to be honest about this.  I do not criticise anybody for being ambitious but some of the timeframes were somewhat unworkable, and I do not say that to be critical.  We had a plan in May, it was debated in the D&aacute;il in June - in fairness, Deputy Shortall noted the changes in Government - and the idea that we would have a lead executive, which the members and I would want us to have, in position in July was always going to be a bit of a stretch.  We can probably accept that much.  It is now November and I accept we do not have a lead executive.  I take the point made by Deputy Shortall, as chair of that committee, of the need for urgency to be applied to this.  I assure her that urgency is being applied to this.  It is with the Public Appointments Service.  There is an executive search currently under way nationally and internationally.  The Deputy asked about head-hunting and if anybody can be directed through that process.  Everyone needs to go through the process of the executive search.  It is appropriate that there is one because we need to get the right person to do this job.  That is where it is at.  It will be done as quickly as possible.  The process is under way through the executive search with the Public Appointments Service.</p> <p>  I take the point that colleagues made that they would have liked and expected that the lead executive would be putting in place the implementation plan.  I also have to accept the reality that the Taoiseach, on his first day in the D&aacute;il when he appointed his Cabinet, listed three things for me to do, one of which was to make sure we had a draft implementation plan ready for the end of the year, so I did not wish to stall on the issue.  It is a draft implementation plan with the wording used in the Sl&aacute;intecare documentation.  There will be an opportunity for the lead executive to finesse that and to have an important input into its own team as well.  We have brought in consultants to help formulate that in a quick timeframe, and that is a matter of public record.  I hope to be in a position to share that once I go to Government with it very early in the new year.  This committee is probably the appropriate body to consider that and I will be happy to debate and talk it through with colleagues.</p> <p>  On the ehealth programme, I take the point that we have to spend to save.  We rolled out the ehealth records in the Rotunda Hospital the other day where we now have digital recordings with regard to babies, similar to the records of other babies but with an electronic health record.  It is the third maternity hospital in which we have rolled out the programme.  We have to do much more of this and to do it much quicker.  I hope that will be reflected in the ten-year capital plan.  Clearly that does not mean that we will not be doing it for ten years.  It should enable us to speed up on some of that.</p> <p>  I note the context in which Deputy Shortall said the impact study was to be done.  I would point out that Sl&aacute;intecare says that this would be disentangled over a five-year period and it refers to commencing that in the second year.  The study will be completed within nine months, so by the end of next summer we will talking about the outcome, which will provide us with a good basis.  For the record of this committee, my view on that is clear in that I support the disentanglement of public and private practice.  I said it at the Irish Hospital Consultants Association conference in Limerick but the impact study is a prudent way to go as well.  I am clear about what I would like to see happen in that regard.  </p> <p>  On the issue of the consultant contract, there is a need for a new contract.  The programme for Government commits to it.  It will probably be possible to implement Sl&aacute;intecare without a new consultant contract but, nevertheless it is something we need to address.  </p> <p>  I thank Deputy Shortall for acknowledging last night's television programme it.  It was fair but what we do not want to do is to group everybody together and with respect to the good elements that are happening to have those people discouraged or demotivated.  It is fair to say that a significant minority have brought the system into disrepute and have let down many of their colleagues.  At a hospital group level, people are meant to be ensuring these contracts are fulfilled.  I cannot be satisfied that is happening now on the basis of what we saw last night.  Senator Conway-Walsh asked did I know about it or was I surprised.  I think everybody in this room has heard an anecdote or a concern about whether doctor X or doctor Y is doing  too much private practice.  Through its excellent surveillance work, RT&Eacute; "Prime Time" programme has given concrete evidence on that.</p> <p>  As to what I am going to do about it, I spoke to the HSE again this morning on the issue.  I have been informed, as I would expect to have been the case, that there will now be formal investigations into each of the cases highlighted in the programme last night.  I do not want to say anything to interfere with that due process.  Due process is important but the Deputy is correct in terms of what is meant to happen when somebody is in breach of their contract in terms of the fees being paid back when those fees are meant to go into a research and study fund.  I expect those formal investigations to proceed and I have been made aware this morning that they will.  I have also made it very clear, and the Deputy can believe me or not on this, but long before last night's programme we were discussing in the Department the need for having a more robust mechanism in place.  I want an absolute assurance that in 2018 there will be robust mechanism in place, like there would be for any other health care professional, to make sure that people are fulfilling their contractual duties.</p> <p>  I would also make the point that there is a legal dispute ongoing with the consultants on the non-implementation of pay increases under the contract.  It is likely that poor contract compliance will be argued strongly as part of the State's discussion.  We cannot have a situation where some cohort is arguing in regard to the non-implementation of the contract where we now see significant concerns about the implementation of aspects of a contract that the contractor has an obligation to fulfil.  I do not wish to say too much more than that other than I have been very clear here.  I expect the HSE to provide robust mechanisms that will satisfy me and that, in turn, I can try to satisfy the Oireachtas that there is proper monitoring in regard to the contract.  I thank the Deputy for acknowledging that it is not my contract, it is one we have inherited and about which I have significant concerns.</p></speech>

That is my point.  I take the point the Deputy makes.  I do not, nor will I, accept as an excuse from anyone working in the health service at any level that asking the HSE to adhere to two separate legal requirements is something beyond its capabilities.</p> <p>  The HSE is an implementer of law, not a maker of law.  If the Oireachtas wants to change the law, it can change the law.  The law at the moment in respect of collecting private income is such as it is and the legal situation with the contracts is such as it is.  I do not believe it is unreasonable for me as Minister to expect, pending any changes these Houses may wish to introduce in line with Sl&aacute;intecare or anything else, that the HSE can get on with it and satisfy both.</p></speech>

We have the ability to carry out an audit function.  The process I have articulated is effectively the utilisation of that function.

The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was the Minister for Health in 2014.  I asked the Minister whether he authorised the non-compliance matter.  He was Minister at the time.

I was merely dealing with the questions of Deputies Shortall and Joan Collins.  I was not in position.  The question was whether the Taoiseach knew.

I did not say that the current Taoiseach, the former Minister for Health, had or had not been informed, because I am not that person.  What I have said is that it would not have been a decision made by the Minister of the day.  It was an operational decision made by the HSE.  That is all the information I have to hand.  I have confirmed that information with my Secretary General.  In terms of what people knew and did not know at a given time, I can only answer in respect of myself, but that is my understanding of it.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about Saolta costs.  We will find out.  The group structures are delivering benefits.  Let us consider the RCSI hospital group, for example.  The hospitals, including those in Beaumont, Drogheda and Cavan, are working together and pooling their patients to work on waiting lists and drive down waiting times.  Synergies are being created between the hospitals in Roscommon and Galway.  I will arrange for the information in respect of the costs to be provided to the Senator by the HSE.  I do not have it to hand.</p></speech>

The idea was that that responsibility, rather than staying at national level, would be delegated to the group chief executives.  It was an operational decision made in the HSE.  There was no legislative or policy decision made in the Department on that.  I do not have any more information on who knew what at the time.</p></speech>

The HSE informed me today that it will meet my expectation of a formal investigation into each of these.  I think we need to let that take place.  It is important that these issues are formally investigated.</p></speech>

That is obvious to anyone who watched the programme.  I want to formally investigate it.  It is a jump to suggest that no hospital group chief executive, hospital manager or clinical director is managing this.  We need to identify where it is not happening and why not and we need to ensure it does not happen again.  The point about data is important.  It is part of the reason I want to talk about robust monitoring being provided.  We need to have exact data on what is actually happening.  I do not believe we have had adequate data to date.</p></speech>

I welcome that in respect of the people who were highlighted in last night's programme.  Clearly, this is a systemic problem that must be dealt with.  We need to change the systems in place that allow abuse of the public purse at present.  I am repeating my request.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, audit was carried out and published two weeks ago.  Can the Minister ask the NTPF to provide the data in respect of the status, public or private, of the patients concerned?  That would be interesting.</p> <p>  Another question I asked relates to Sl&aacute;intecare and was dealt with in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It relates to the setting of targets for public hospitals to increase the number of private patients they are taking.</p><p>Can the Minister end that practice as a matter of urgency, stop the stretch targets and let us see how we can get from 20% down to 0% over the next five years as recommended in the report?</p></speech>

I do not honestly know but I will have the question asked.</p> <p>  In regard to the reference to the problem being systemic, I assure the Deputy that I would not be taking the steps I had already commenced and will now intensify further if I believed it was simply a case of one or two or half a dozen doctors not fulfilling their contract.  I believe there is a missing piece here in terms of being able to accurately monitor compliance with a contract in which the taxpayers invested a significant amount and depend on to deliver for patients.  That is why I want a more robust monitoring mechanism.</p></speech>

No, we did not.  Obviously, we had to operate within the resources available.</p> <p>  Regarding the legislation, most of it is being considered in the context of the implementation plan.  That is the current status of it, with the exception that I am at an advanced stage with the Health Service Executive, HSE, board legislation, which is quite straightforward legislation.  I expect and hope to be able to bring that to Cabinet around the same time as the implementation plan, with the agreement of Members of the House.  It is a matter for the House but if we could take that swiftly, I would like to see a priority attached to it in terms of getting it passed as quickly as possible in 2018 in order that we can have the board in place in 2018.  I will return to the other legislation in the context of the implementation plan.</p></speech>

That is not the idea.  We will have a draft implementation plan.  Ultimately, the lead executive will have the job of finalising the plan.  The plan can be scrutinised here and it will go to Cabinet but I have been charged by the Government, and by the Taoiseach specifically, to bring forward a draft implementation plan by the end of the year.  That is what I am duty bound to do.  I will share it with the committee.  The dates of when it can go to Cabinet are above my pay grade.  I cannot be overly prescriptive but the commitment I and the Taoiseach have given is that it will be by the end of the year and that will be honoured.</p></speech>

The Sl&aacute;intecare report also states that it wants the implementation office to report and be accountable to me.  The idea that the Minister for Health has no role in health reform and that my Department would not have an interest in health reform would be a stretch.  I agree that there need to be outside external voices.  I cannot make the lead executive arrive any quicker.  I do not wish to stall the progress on the draft implementation plan.  I do not think patients can wait for it and I am proceeding on that basis.  I am the Minister for Health.  I hold the seal of office.  I take my job very seriously.  I am responsible for health reform.  I would welcome a lead executive.  It has a future role to play.  We have seen excellent examples with people coming in and reforming cancer services and the likes in this country with huge clinical expertise, communicable abilities and abilities to bring stakeholders with them but I cannot sit idle while we are waiting for this and that is what I am trying to do.  We have brought in consultants to help bring an external perspective.  We have seven people in the Department of Health working on this issue so I am doing the very best I can to prepare a draft implementation plan, with the emphasis on the word "draft".  Obviously, it will be the lead executive's plan and he or she will be responsible for delivering the plan.</p></speech>

It is a technical point.  The further Revised Estimate of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation's Vote arises due to the recent transfer of employment rights functions to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The functional changes came into effect at the beginning of September.  I understand that my officials have provided the committee with a short briefing note that sets out what is involved.  I will list the main points.</p> <p>  Fourteen staff have moved from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with the functions moving to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  With regard to the financial consequences, the transfer of the functions sees full-time pay and non-pay costs totalling just over &euro;1.5 million gross moving from my Department's Vote to that of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Essentially, the &euro;1.5 million is broken down into pay of &euro;1.05 million for the 14 staff transferring and fees associated with the low pay commissioners, and &euro;496,000 for non-pay.  These moneys, through the further Revised Estimates, are reduced from the 2017 Revised Estimates allocation for the Vote of my Department.  Obviously, there is a consequential increase in the Vote for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which also requires a further Revised Estimate to be considered and approved by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The subheads affected in the Vote of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation all pertain to expenditure under subhead C relating to regulation.  The relevant subheads are C1, the pay budget, C2, the non-pay budget, C13, the Low Pay Commission, and C16, legal costs.  With regard to the functions that have transferred, there is a suite of employment rights legislation - 12 Acts in all - in respect of which responsibility now rests with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty.  The committee has been provided with a list of the 12 Acts.  I will not list them all here but members will be most familiar with the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2005, the Protection of Employment Acts 1977 to 2014, the Payment of Wages Act 1991, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Act 2007.  The legislative base also includes responsibility for the Low Pay Commission and its secretariat.  Any operational or policy matters that fall under any of the listed items of legislation are now the direct responsibility of the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty.</p> <p>  With regard to EU and international arrangements, a small number of employment policy functions have moved, and these include the lead role in the EU ESCO Council, lead responsibility for the treaty-based employment committee, EMCO, and for Ireland's response input on the EU pillar of social rights.  While these policy responsibilities have moved to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, responsibility for the employment rights enforcement element and related funding still lies with my Department, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  This is in respect of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  I just had a meeting with Ms Oonagh Buckley from the Workplace Relations Commission and Mr. Kevin Duffy, former chairman of the Labour Court.  The Workplace Relations Commission is 50 years in existence, for which I congratulate it.  It is just one year since it moved to its new offices at Lansdowne House.  It was wonderful to meet the staff there.  We also have a small number of legacy cases - 80 or so - which are with the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which no longer accepts claims.</p> <p>  I will be happy to take questions from any member or the Chairman.  The further Revised Estimate is fairly straightforward.  It is technical.</p></speech>

The moneys were allocated already this year.  They were allocated to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation but, because of the changeover, 14 members of staff are transferring to the new Department, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It is not new money that had to be found.</p></speech>

There was a partial transfer of responsibilities when the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, set up his new Government.  Some responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  As I stated, 14 members of staff were transferred there.  That is why the pay costs and non-pay costs have come into play.  The &euro;1.5 million has been transferred to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, obviously to make that Department more effective.  As I stated, it has responsibility for policy.  We have responsibility for enforcement, the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission.  The 14 staff who were transferred included principal officers, assistant principal officers, higher executive officers, administrative officers, an executive officer and clerical officers.</p> <p>  The full schedule of employment rights Acts has been transferred also.  That is in the committee&rsquo;s schedule.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, having been present last Thursday, will note that our committee dealt with zero-hour contracts, banded-hour contracts and the if-and-when arrangements.  We produced quite a body of work on these issues.  I now understand responsibility has transferred to the other committee, under Deputy John Curran.  We wish that committee all the best with this area.  I thank the Minister of State for the considerable respect he showed to the committee last Thursday.  We did a lot of work on this and made 21 recommendations.  The Minister of State was open to considering them.  On behalf of the committee, I thank him very much for that.</p></speech>

I thank him for his involvement.  He has a particular interest in the area of employment and well-being in this area.</p> <p>  I welcome the work being done by the committee not just on legislation, but in respect of various other areas it covers.  The committee members visited Waterford last week.  It is good that committees travel to see exactly what is happening on the ground in respect of the workings of my Department.  We value the work the committee does, particularly the work on the legislation in question.  As I stated before, the legislation was flawed but we will have our legislation ready before Christmas.  I will welcome the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of that and its work thereon.  The legislation will be fair and balanced and it will take on board the needs of the employers but also the employees, who are important also.  One has to have balance to ensure we can sustain jobs in this country.</p> <p>  We connect with and work a lot with both employers' and employees' groups to make sure we can put good legislation in place.  Good legislation takes time.  The idea for this came from the University of Limerick study.  The group in question was independent.  Obviously, we have to take on board the concerns of both employers and employees.  This is why we want to come up with balanced legislation that suits both.  This includes prohibiting zero-hour contracts in most circumstances, ensuring employees are better informed of the nature of employment arrangements, and ensuring that workers on low-hour contracts who constantly work more hours each week than are provided for in their contracts are placed in a band that better reflects the reality of the hours they work.</p><p>We will also strengthen the anti-victimisation provisions for workers.  All of these measures will be included in the Bill which I look forward to debating when it is brought before the House and the committee.</p></speech>

We look forward to seeing and debating the legislation.  I do not think the committee will be engaged in the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I think the Bill will be dealt with by the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome from Right to Die Ireland Mr. Tom Curran and Mr. Michael Nugent and from the Irish Association for Palliative Care Dr. Regina McQuillan, consultant physician in palliative medicine.  I thank all of them for their attendance and furnishing members with their respective contributions.  Both groups will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by a question and answer session with members.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  Members of the committee should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Curran to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

To me, it sums up what the right to die is all about - it is about choice.  It is about the ability to make decisions about one's own end-of-life situation to avoid a prolonged, painful and distressing death.  It is commonly accepted that people have the right to live their life as they choose, provided they do not do anyone else harm; why, therefore, should a person not have the right to make decisions about the manner of their own death?<br/><br/>Most people I know who are involved in the right to die movement around the world are involved from personal experience.  They have either witnessed someone they loved go through a bad death, or else they or someone they love are facing the prospect of a bad death.  I am no exception to this rule.  The person I loved, Marie, suffered from multiple sclerosis.  Many years ago, when it moved from relapsing-remitting to progressive and she saw that it was taking more and more control of her life and her ability to live, she decided that it was not going to take control of her death.  She knew that she faced the likelihood of a prolonged and, possibly, painful death and, being the strong willed person she was, was not prepared to let that happen.  She did not want to die.  Far from it, she wanted to live.  She was never suicidal, but she did not want a bad death.  When she explained to me what her wish was, it seemed like the most natural thing to want.  It was only then that we discovered what she wanted would by no means be easy to achieve.<br/><br/>As I had done voluntary work in the area of suicide prevention for many years, I was aware that suicide had been decriminalised in Ireland in the early 1990s.  This meant that taking her own life was not an issue.  The problem was how to provide for a peaceful and painless death for oneself.  Most of the irrational suicides that take place are performed in some horrific manner, but that would have completely defeated the purpose of what Marie wanted to achieve.  That brings up the question of if it is legal for a rational person to take his or her own life, why is assisting a person to do something that is legal a crime and why is assistance necessary?  I cannot answer the first question of why assisting someone to do something that is legal is a crime, but the second question of why assistance is required can be answered.<br/><br/>There are two basic reasons assistance is necessary.  The first has to do with the method of providing a peaceful, painless death for oneself.  That is not as easy as it may seem.  There is almost nothing sold anywhere, either by prescription or over the counter, that will achieve that aim.  Of course, there are many substances that will kill but not peacefully and painlessly.  Any substance that will provide a peaceful and painless death is almost exclusively in the hands of those in the medical profession, but providing such a substance would be classified as assisting a suicide and, therefore, against the law.<br/><br/>The second reason is that in most cases the reason for making the decision to die is that the person is suffering from a progressive and, possibly, incurable disease which will eventually make it physical impossible for him or her to end his or her own life.  In these circumstances denying a person access to something that is legal and available to any able-bodied person must amount to discrimination.<br/><br/>Let me try to explain why the right to die has recently become an issue around the world.  The first reason is the advancement of medical science which has meant that in most parts of the world people are living to a much greater age than they could have imagined many years ago, but this brings its own problems.  With living longer comes the likelihood that we will spend the final years of our lives suffering from a disabling illness which will usually mean that the final years of life will be far from comfortable.  In addition, in the early to mid-20th century people started to think for themselves; the civil rights movement sprang up around the world and in many areas people were looking for personal freedoms, of which the right to die was one.  People decided that death which used to be very much a family affair had become a medical procedure.  This is borne out in Ireland where over 80% of people wish to die at home but less than 20% do.  In fact, over 50% die in acute hospitals, in many cases in multiple-bed wards.  This has made the process of dying clinical, not the celebration of life it used to be.  This made people question why they had very little say in the way they would die and the right to die movement was born.  It has resulted in a slow but progressive acceptance that rational people should have the decision-making power when it comes to deciding how they will die.  <br/><br/>There have been the usual arguments against allowing a person to decide for himself or herself.  They include religion, the danger posed to vulnerable persons and the co-operation of the medical profession.</p><p>These arguments are easily countered and this has been done in several parts of the world.</p><p> Getting back to the position in Ireland, the committee is probably aware that Ms Marie Fleming and I took a constitutional challenge to the law on assisted suicide.  Some very interesting points were made in the summing up in the High Court.  Let me outline a few of them here.  Apart from stating that Marie was one on the most remarkable witnesses to ever come before the court, it upheld the fact that Marie was being discriminated against by her multiple sclerosis preventing her having access to something that any rational able-bodied person has.  To right this wrong, the only option that the High Court has is to declare the law which allows this discrimination is unconstitutional and the law must be struck out.  It is not in its powers to amend a law.  The court stated that on a proportionality basis, it was not prepared to strike out the law, as without any law, vulnerable people would be open to abuse.  I agree completely with this decision but it followed up by stating there is nothing preventing the Oireachtas from enacting a law that would allow for assisted dying for people like Marie and at the same time protect the vulnerable.  None of the parties has had the courage to tackle this and the closest we have got is the presentation of a Private Members' Bill, drafted by me with the help of four barristers, and put before Parliament by Deputy John Halligan.  This Bill has since been withdrawn so we are no closer to providing this civil right to people than we were then.</p><p> The other interesting point of come out of the High Court was the statement in the summing up that if the court could provide a law specifically for Marie, it would do so.  This was an extraordinary statement.  It felt that Marie satisfied whatever criteria seen as necessary to be allowed an assisted death.  Marie was an exceptional person but there was nothing exceptional in what she was asking, and certainly nothing that would suggest that other people would not satisfy the same criteria.  Why, therefore, have we still got the situation that if Marie can satisfy the highest court in Ireland that she should qualify for an assisted death, this right is still denied to others?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1465" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Regina McQuillan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017112200002#B00200"><p>My opening statement has already been distributed to members so I will just go through some of the highlights because I probably cannot read as clearly as Mr. Curran.  Palliative care is care for people with progressive fatal illnesses, or life-limiting illnesses.  Palliative care is involved with trying to improve the quality of life of people living with life-limiting illnesses.  Since 2002 the World Health Organization has recognised that early palliative care is beneficial to patients and a recent research study done on lung cancer indicates that people with early palliative care not only had better pain control and symptom management but they had less chemotherapy and lived longer with such early palliative care.  There is much to be said in favour of early palliative care for people with life-limiting illness.<br/><br/>The IAPC is a membership organisation working to support people working in palliative care in Ireland.  We work very closely with the All-Ireland Institute for Hospice and Palliative Care and with the national clinical programme for palliative care.  We support the work of that programme.  We welcome the recent launch by the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, of the palliative care three-year development framework.  As we are involved with the care of people with life-limiting illness, we are very much aware of the need to see where are the patient wishes and we very much respect the right of a patient to choose treatment.  We respect that people may choose to have particular types of treatment or refuse particular treatment.  One area of concern is that patients might think they would be forced to have treatment that is inappropriate, against their wishes or, ultimately, futile.  The IAPC very much recognises the right of people to refuse treatment and it also recognises the right of people to have an advance care plan and state in advance what treatment they want when they are no longer competent.  As the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is commenced in full, the IAPC will support its members in having the right to appropriate education and training so we can assist patients in this respect.<br/><br/>The IAPC also recognises that people may consider where they want to die.  Currently, 43% of people die in acute hospitals but there are interesting statistics concerning where people wish to die; as they become less well, people are more likely not to want to die at home but in hospices.  Currently there is insufficient hospice care to provide that type of support.  Recent research with which I was involved has indicated that for people with serious illness, 17% would have seen home as their least favourite place to die as they felt they would not be able to get appropriate care, causing more stress for families.<br/><br/>A big part of palliative care is the treatment of symptoms such as pain.  In the palliative care specialty we recognise it is always possible to treat symptoms and we hope to either reduce or eliminate those symptoms.  Palliative care requires input from different disciplines within the regular multidisciplinary team, and it also requires input from other specialists, such as radiotherapists or intervention pain specialists.  Patients may have intractable symptoms, such as agitated delirium where there is difficulty in thinking clearly, or have poor concentration and cannot make sense of the world.  Delirium is a very common complication of serious illness.  When patients have delirium, we hope to be able to reverse it by reversing the cause.  Sometimes in such cases, or in other cases where patients may have intractable distress, it may be necessary to give medication that would cause sedation.  The idea is to relieve the distress of the patient by causing sedation; the end point is not sedation or the death of the patient.  We are very much aware that both the Irish Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland would state that health care professionals have a right when patients are dying to ensure they die with dignity.<br/><br/>We are aware there are some symptoms where we must make further progress in development.  This includes symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness, anorexia and weight loss.  These are important areas for patients and we should be making further progress in this respect.  The IAPC recognises very much the patient idea of personal autonomy but we are aware that autonomy, as such, is qualified as we are all members of a society.  We are aware patients have their own self-worth and palliative care is very much focused on patient-centred care and what is important for the patient.  Individual autonomy is not absolute and our concern is that if assisted suicide or euthanasia is legalised, it will put pressure on vulnerable people.  In Marie Fleming's High Court case, the court mentioned the aged, the disabled, the poor, the unwanted, the rejected, the lonely, the impulsive, the financially compromised and emotionally vulnerable, who may elect to hasten death rather than avoid a sense of being a burden to a family or society.<br/><br/>There are many vulnerable people in our society and although there are safeguards in place, they do not work.  The National Safeguarding Committee last year indicated that 8,000 cases of abuse are reported to the Health Service Executive, HSE, across all ages and types of disability.  Research has also been done indicating that half the population witnessed the abuse of an adult, either themselves or somebody else.  There is much abuse in Ireland against people who are vulnerable and our concern is that it is not possible to protect vulnerable people.  Recent research and studies have indicated that in countries with assisted suicide or euthanasia, the protections are not as secure as may be portrayed.  The <i>British Medical Journal</i>recently demonstrated some failures in the Dutch regulatory system and concerns have been expressed by the Swiss Medical Association about the extension of euthanasia in Switzerland to people with depression.  In Belgium there is conflict between some of those in favour of euthanasia and a particular psychiatrist about how she assesses patients and encourages them to have euthanasia while undermining the second opinion system.  A recent study from Australia considered gender matters relating to assisted suicide and euthanasia.  Women are much more likely to have assisted suicide and euthanasia because they live longer but are less likely to have social supports.  It is interesting that where there are mercy killings outside the judicial regulation, it is much more likely to be male family members killing women in their own family.<br/><br/>I recognise Mr. Curran's comments on the change in legislation as it relates to suicide.  Suicide was decriminalised not because this society believes suicide is a good idea but rather because society recognises that people who survive a suicide attempt need treatment and support rather than prosecution.  Suicide is still considered to be a blight on society.  We represent health care professionals with daily experience of caring for people with life-limiting illness and we recognise some of these people are vulnerable, either as a result of their illness or other factors.  There should not be a change in the law as a change would put vulnerable people at risk.  It is not possible to put adequate safeguards in place.  The drive to improve care for people with life-limiting illness by education, service development and research may be compromised because we are all part of society and personal autonomy is not absolute.</p><p>We feel that allowing assisted suicide would devalue the lives of those who are open to this against those who are targeting suicide prevention campaigns.  We very much believe that part of palliative care is helping people live and die with dignity.</p></speech>

I understand we are being joined by other members of the group who have just arrived.  They are very welcome.  Heavy traffic and all that goes with it is the cause of the delay.  I will open up the meeting to members.  The first speaker who has indicated she would like to engage with our guests is Deputy Clare Daly.</p></speech>

I apologise as these are challenging times for the Department of Justice and Equality so I will have to pop out but I will come back in.  I mean no disrespect to the witnesses.  I will follow the proceedings in the Official Report if I am not able to remain for all the responses.</p> <p>  I found all of the presentations incredibly useful.  I acknowledge the role of Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, who is not a committee member any more, who strongly pushed that this would be a project that the committee would take on board.  The contributions of the witnesses have strengthened and validated the reasons why we need to do this.  The case of Marie Fleming in particular touched people the length and breadth of the country.  From a personal point of view the right to die at a time or in a manner of one's own choosing is something I found to be an incredibly compelling argument.  The challenge for us is to balance that with any unintended consequences from legislation.  That is one of the issues I wish to explore.  One argument against assisted dying is that if we legislate, then the right to die could turn into an obligation to die in particular in this neoliberal climate where we do not always take the best care of people and when we talk about cost effectiveness when we should be talking about human beings and their right to live, and die, with dignity.</p> <p>  The issue is that people might feel a pressure to choose to die.  The Irish Association for Palliative Care has stated it is a cultural acceptance whereby people feel they are a burden on a family or their care is costing too much or health insurance costs too much.  How could we avoid that coming to pass?  What rules could we put in place?  What kind of system would be best to overcome that unintended consequence?  Another issue is the objections of some of the disability groups globally arguing that it devalues the lives of people who have disabilities.  How do other jurisdictions deal with that issue?  Perhaps it is something people cannot address.</p> <p>  Dr. McQuillan referred to the safeguards in other jurisdiction as not being sufficient.  In terms of elder abuse, is it not the case that people are helped to die against their will at present, when we do not have legislation to allow people to die with dignity?  The problem is not really whether we legislate or not because that is poor behaviour and should never be tolerated but it is different to a rational adult making a decision about his or her own future and having the right to die.  I do not know whether I explained that well.  The problem is not legislation.  I do not think there is any argument against legislation.  The arguments are overwhelming as to why somebody should be allowed to decide if he or she wants to die.  The only problem is an unintended consequence.  I think we could overcome that.</p></speech>

They related to protecting vulnerable people, being a burden, devaluing life and what other countries have done.  Unfortunately, what other countries have done has not been effective.  That is very clear.  Oregon is the US state which has had assisted suicide for the longest period and there is a gradual increase in the number of people who are dying by assisted suicide there.  Interestingly, there is also an increased rate of suicide among the regular population.  There is an argument as to whether allowing assisted suicide then means that suicide is more culturally acceptable.  In Oregon the percentage of people who look for assisted suicide on the grounds of not wanting to be a burden has gradually increased over the years.  One of the factors in assisted suicide there is fear of being a burden.  Initially the legislation there was for people who had a prognosis of less than six months.  It is clear that sometimes people get such prognoses but may live for many months if not years afterwards.  There is a difficulty about the prognostication and how one knows how long somebody is going to live.  In Oregon there was a call to extend the period of time from six to 12 months.</p> <p>  In the Netherlands, there probably are greater concerns because there is a long practice of allowing assisted suicide and euthanasia involving decriminalisation rather than legislation.  There is an incidence of non-voluntary euthanasia in the Netherlands, as well as voluntary euthanasia, and there is also euthanasia of people with dementia who have not made advanced care plans.  Those case reports exist in the Netherlands.  It is clear that it is not possible to protect people there.  Similarly in Belgium where there is legislation in respect of euthanasia, but again, that is extending so there is euthanasia for people with particular illnesses, but also people who are deaf or going blind have euthanasia, as well as those who are tired of life.  Although many of those jurisdictions require that people are assessed and treated for depression, that does not always happen or does not always happen effectively.  I do not think it is possible to protect people and that one will change society by introducing such legislation.  One would change society in a number of ways.  First, by saying that suicide is not such a concern to society as it currently is.  We can campaign against suicide but if we say some suicides should be allowed then we are saying that suicide is not as much of a concern to society as it should be.</p> <p>  People who are living with disability live in very difficult times and in very difficult situations.  In some situations assisted suicide or dying is promoted with regard to people who are terminally ill and people who have disability.  This is a severe threat to people who are living with disability.  Those can be people who have physical disability but it is more of a threat to those who do not have physical disability.  I think allowing assisted suicide changes society.</p> <p>  Another way that allowing assisted suicide brings about a change is that it changes the idea of what health care is.  Mr. Curran mentioned that doctors are the only people with access to medication.  A very interesting paper was published about 20 years ago by an ethicist in the UK entitled Two lawyers and a technician.  Her view was that assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be part of health care because it is not about care.  It is something entirely different.  Her argument was that there should be two lawyers looking at competency and a technician who is vocationally trained for this purpose.  That was a different way to remove the idea of assisted suicide and euthanasia from health care.  I do think this should never be part of health care.  It is an undermining of what health care should be and is all about.  I am not too sure whether I have covered all of Deputy Daly&rsquo;s points.</p></speech>

To me, it is probably one of the best disciplines in medicine that exists.  It is the only discipline as far as I know in medicine that accepts a person is going to die.  Unfortunately, we do not put enough effort into palliative care in Ireland.  I am part of the All Ireland Institute of Hospice and Palliative Care and I work a lot within palliative care.  I fully accept the need for it and the fact that it is far from ideal.  Palliative care is for people who want to eke out every second of life.  However, there are people who want to have palliative care but still want to have a choice at the end of their life.  Palliative care is wonderful.  Marie had palliative care for many years and there is no doubt that it made her life far better than it would have been if she did not have access to it.  I have, however, come across hundreds of people who, like Marie, had a particular concept.</p><p>They have the same idea that at a particular point, their lives are not worth living.  Anybody should have the right to say that.  It is only the individual who can make that decision.  While one can say a toothache is very difficult, it is only the individual who can decide, not what he or she is capable of, but what he or she is prepared to tolerate.  What right have we to say to them that they should continue to live in that discomfort and pain past the point where they find it unacceptable?</p><p> Dr. McQuillan referred to doctors and the medical side.  I agree completely that it should not be part of health care.  It should be taken away from doctors.  Currently, doctors have exclusive access to providing a peaceful death.  I did not say that was right or that I agreed with it.  In fact, I said I thought it was wrong.  In Switzerland, lay people are involved in providing peaceful deaths.  Dignitas is run by two barristers who are not medical people.  Rather, they get medical people to provide the prescriptions.  On the idea of safeguards, we can certainly point to places like Holland where the position is certainly not ideal.  Certainly, I have no interest in bringing in a regime like the one that exists in Holland into Ireland.  It is far too liberal.  I am not saying I am not liberal in my thoughts, but as far as assisted dying and voluntary euthanasia are concerned, Holland and Belgium go way beyond what I would like to see.  It is very likely with their regimes that it will be very difficult to control access to it.</p><p> In places like Oregon it is of course the case that more people are availing of it.  If one starts from a position where it does not exist, there will be a phenomenal increase.  One thing that is very clear and that people opposed to assisted dying never say is that the death rate has never gone up.  The same number of people are dying.  What is different is that people are not suffering.  People may be dying a bit earlier than they would have otherwise, but they are not suffering when they are dying.  The same number of people are dying and the same people are dying but they are just dying in a different way and when they decide to.  The same applies in Canada.  One of the advantages of being able to look at other places and to find out what is wrong with them is that we are not pioneering this.  We will not be the first to do it if we ever get around to doing it.  We can learn from the mistakes that other people have made.  It is not even necessarily that there are mistakes, but it may be that we do not agree with the way they do it.  Oregon is one of the best examples.</p><p> Canada has just recently introduced assisted dying.  Canada is regarded around the world as one of the safest countries as far as legislation is concerned.  In fact, the Canadian courts ruled that Canada's assisted dying law was unconstitutional.  If that decision had been made before Marie and I went to court, we would have had a different outcome in the High Court here.  That would have been the example for us because the Canadian constitution is very similar to ours in respect of individual rights.  Our courts would have gone along with the idea.  In fact, the Canadian courts were going through the same process when Marie went to court, but Marie did not have the time to wait around, as is obvious now that it is coming up to four years since she died.  Safeguards can be put in place.  Of course, no system is going to be foolproof.  Abuse goes on all the time.  Dr. McQuillan referred to the abuse of the elderly.  That is against the law but it does not stop it from happening.  There will be people who take advantage of others.  However, it should not mean we deny access to a civil right to everyone else.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Nugent" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017112200002#D00200"><p>I wish to address two aspects of this issue which are not often addressed, one of which is unintended consequences.  There is an unintended consequence of the current situation which is that it brings the law into disrepute.  That is because rational, terminally-ill people who fully support the law have their own ethical priorities when they are dying.  They will simply not comply with a law which causes them to undergo unnecessary suffering.  My late wife, Anne Holliday, died of cancer a few years ago.  Some of the members might know her as she used to work in Leinster House.  She also worked in the office of the T&aacute;naiste.  Certainly, some of the members' longer serving colleagues will have known her.  Anne supported the law completely and she dedicated her life to campaigning for democracy and respect for the law.  When she was dying, however, she understood that she did not want to experience unnecessary suffering.  In her mind, her right to avoid that was more important than respecting an unjust law which was causing people to suffer unnecessarily.</p> <p>  The second point of which most people are unaware is that many people - in some cases and places, it is most people - decide not only that they want to avail of the right to assisted dying, they actually make the preparations and put in place the ability to do it.  Anne did that and I was prepared to assist her even though it would have been breaking the law and even though I strongly support the law in principle.  Anne died naturally, as do most people who make these preparations.  It is not about the act of dying, it is about the peace of mind one has while one is still alive of knowing one can avoid unnecessary suffering at the end if one has to.  Once we had made those preparations, Anne's quality of life soared for its remainder.  She had a quality of life that she would not have had if she had not made those preparations.  We should not have had to try to find the information on our own; it is a process which should be regulated by law in a proper democratic society.  In Marie's case, the courts have said that it is possible for the Oireachtas to find a balance that would put the necessary safeguards in place.  The courts have told the Oireachtas that they cannot do it; it is up to the Legislature.</p></speech>

We appreciate witnesses' replies.  I call Deputy Colm Brophy.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the opinions they have provided are held very strongly and that the witnesses believe firmly in what they are advocating.  I want to come to something Dr. McQuillan said and tease it out with her.  Is it the view of the Irish Association for Palliative Care that in no circumstances should there be a right to die?  Is there not a conflict in that with Dr. McQuillan's stated position on the right of a patient to refuse medical treatment?  If one endorses the right of a patient to refuse medical treatment, is one not, in effect, endorsing the right of that patient to choose to die?  The process by which one is endorsing that right is a very painful one for that patient.  I am not trying to trip anyone up on this.  I respect everyone's views.  However, I am wondering how Dr. McQuillan reconciles those two points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1477" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Regina McQuillan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017112200002#D00500"><p>Deputy Brophy said that if a person refuses medical treatment, he or she will have a very painful death.  That is not true.  There is a great deal of mythology around how people would die.  Most people I care for have a peaceful death.  What most people want is not to die now.  They want to live longer and better.  Refusing medical treatment or life prolonging treatment does not mean one will have a painful death.  I want to reassure those present about that.</p> <p>  There is a difference between the two positions referred to.  People are not obliged to keep living as long as possible or to take treatment.  Patients who are rational and can make up their own minds can decide what they want or do not want.  That can be something as simple as not taking an antibiotic where it is recommended by a GP or it can be something much more complex such as deciding not to go to an intensive care unit for ventilation.  People can refuse this.  If a person knows the consequences of treatment and they make a clear decision, he or she is entitled to do that.  People are also entitled to make an advance care plan about what treatment they want into the future.  Advance care plans will be more regulated with the implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.</p><p>Making a decision that would lead to death is not the same as requiring other people to provide assistance in dying either through assisted suicide or euthanasia.  There is a difference between people being able to make a choice about what they want to do for themselves and making choices and engaging other people in things.  The autonomy of the person is involved and also the autonomy of family members and health care staff.  It is a debate that comes up at different points.  It is very well recognised in health care that patients have a right to refuse treatment.  We support the right of patients to refuse treatment and we will continue to support that right.  I do not think there is any contradiction in the fact we would not support a change in the law to allow for assisted suicide or euthanasia.</p></speech>

Everybody has personal experiences and knowledge of such things.  Medication for pain is a key part of palliative care for many people.  The removal of that particular aspect would cause a person more pain and distress.  If we respect the right to refuse treatment as an absolute, how is there not an automatic right to choice in such circumstances?  Is that a unanimous view of people involved in palliative care?  A number of professionals in the palliative care area who I have known over many years indicate a different view from the one Dr. McQuillan is advocating.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1480" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Regina McQuillan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017112200002#E00300"><p>When people refuse medical care, they are refusing aspects of medical care.  Patients might decide to refuse antibiotics or ventilation but that does not mean they will refuse all medical care.  Patients can pick and choose which bits of medical care they want.  Patients may refuse medical care but opt to have pain relief, management of breathlessness or management of nausea.  It is not a case that because they refuse, they are abandoned with no care.  There are some patients who will refuse pain relief.  Sometimes that is driven by different beliefs.  It can be very difficult for me, as a palliative care doctor, if I am looking after somebody who refuses pain relief.  Sometimes the refusal is on interesting religious or cultural grounds.  I would never not treat somebody who is not taking the treatment I am offering.  I would continue to support them.</p> <p>  I am here on behalf of the Irish Association for Palliative Care, IAPC, which a number of years ago produced a statement on voluntary euthanasia.  As an organisation, the IAPC is opposed to voluntary euthanasia.  It is involved in a consultation process about assisted suicide but our members are opposed to assisted suicide.  I am also a member of the Irish Palliative Medicine Consultants' Association, which is the association of all the consultants in palliative medicine, and we are opposed to assisted suicide and have issued a statement on it.  I am speaking as a spokesperson of the organisation; I am not saying I am speaking for absolutely everybody who works in palliative care.  If one does a survey around the world, one will find that health care professionals in general are opposed to assisted suicide and euthanasia, whether that is medical or nursing professionals.  In some countries, some organisations may be in favour or they may have no statement.  Most health care organisations are opposed to assisted suicide and euthanasia.</p></speech>

I know Dr. McQuillan from north Dublin and the great work she and the organisation do in palliative care medicine.  I acknowledge that before I ask questions.</p> <p>  What struck me about some of the evidence and research I am aware of is the regimes that exist elsewhere.  The Netherlands has been mentioned.  I was quite shocked by the rocketing rise in the number of cases and the expansion of that regime.  In a particular year, 141 people with dementia were involved in the regime, 16 for psychiatric reasons and 244 because of advanced age.  In Belgium, it has been extended to children.  In Oregon, it has moved towards psychological considerations over medical ones.  I want to ask Mr. Michael Nugent and Mr. Tom Curran about the expansion of such regimes and the issue of it going from being not a choice but a duty to die.  Is there evidence that such regimes show the same caution as the Irish court system and palliative care organisations do?  Is there evidence that vulnerable people in other countries have died as a result of the regimes that exist in those countries?  What regime do the witnesses advocate for in an Irish context considering the regimes that exist elsewhere in which there has been quite extensive expansion?  Mr. Curran mentioned he does not advocate the same system as the Netherlands.  If he was to propose a model, what would it be considering the expansive regimes in other countries?</p></speech>

The Deputy said it has been extended to psychiatric illnesses.  It is recognised by the medical profession that having a psychiatric illness does not necessarily mean a person is incapable of making a rational decision.  Is psychological pain any less difficult to tolerate than physical pain?  To me, it is not.  Once a person can make a rational decision and wants to end his or her pain, why can he or she not have that choice?  The vulnerability comes in when a person is incapable of making a rational decision and that is what we need to protect.  That is not happening in Oregon.  It is rational people with psychological problems who are making these decisions.  They are assessed very carefully.  Canada brought in a very similar regime.  It is a little bit tighter than the Oregon model so maybe we should base it on the Canadian rule.  Psychological pain is no less tolerable.</p></speech>

We have submitted a Bill that I worked on with four barristers.  It took nearly two years to put it together.  Under a month was spent preparing the bit that dealt with assisted dying and the rest of the time was spent looking at safeguards around the world, improving on some that were there already and adding to them.  The majority of that time spent meeting four barristers regularly was based on putting safeguards in to prevent the vulnerable from being abused.  We have a model there already that would work perfectly for Ireland.</p></speech>

What I would give consideration to, particularly in an Irish context, is the fact that people are waiting perhaps a year for a psychiatric assessment.  In that case, the focus should be on triaging people quickly and giving them the best medical care, which is evidence based, so that their psychological or psychiatric problem can be helped rather than normalising another assessment process that could undermine their evidence-based medical treatment.</p> <p>  I want to move to the issue of medical ethics and the ethical considerations.  Doctors try to act in the best interest of the patient.  They practise beneficence, not maleficence, and should do no harm.  The principle of double effect has been mentioned in much of the research on this issue.  How does Mr. Curran square the duty of the doctor, when he or she is training and working to act in the patient's best interest, to do no harm with ending a patient's life?  How does Mr. Curran square that contradiction in terms of medical ethics?  Is there an ethical principle that Mr. Curran upholds that supersedes the well-researched and published medical ethics that most doctors subscribe to?</p></speech>

Some doctors believe that the harm caused by assisted dying is worse than the alternative while others believe the opposite.  The initial point made by Deputy Chambers in terms of focusing on safeguards is the key issue because we completely agree that those who want palliative care should have the best available.  That is not in dispute.</p> <p>  As regards the ethical issue of people potentially being pressurised, even those opposed to assisted dying do not argue that we should ban people from refusing care and thus hastening their death on the basis that vulnerable people might be pressurised into so doing.  The courts have indicated that the Oireachtas can come up with safeguards.  We should not focus on palliative care, which we all agree should be available for everybody who wants it, nor models that are extremely vulnerable to abuse and which we do not support but, rather, the issue of appropriate safeguards.</p></speech>

They feel it is unethical to be involved in assisted suicide or euthanasia.<br/><br/>I do not remember the exact details but I understand the High Court looked at the Carter <i>v. </i>Canada case and commented that although the Canadian High Court thought it could put in safeguards, courts in the United Kingdom and Ireland looked at the same evidence and came to the conclusion that it would not be possible to do so.  The issue of safeguards is very important.  <br/><br/>Justice is another area of medical ethics of which doctors are very much aware.  This is about fairness.  Part of that fairness is to ensure one does not do things which would unintentionally harm people.  Equitable access to resources is another part of justice in health care.  We do not currently have equitable access to palliative care, disability services, psychiatric or psychological support services and my concern and that of many working in health care is that to move in the direction of euthanasia would be to move away from investment in the appropriate services.  In Canada, the health care savings from assisted suicide have been published and it is very worrying to think that this is a money-saving exercise.  We have changing demographics and an older population.  Colm McCarthy made the point some time ago that we have a policy problem, not a demographic problem.  We need to change the policies to recognise our population and how we are.  We may have policy problems in respect of the older population but we also have resource and research problems in respect of providing the right type of support for people.  This will not meet everybody's needs but we need to be prudent and aware of the risks to the vulnerable in society and of the opportunity cost and the things that would not be developed if assisted suicide and euthanasia were permitted.</p></speech>

That is a much more fundamental and worrying way in which doctors are involved.  One could argue that in the case of a judicial execution the person who prescribes the drugs is not the executioner.  However, in centres such as those run by Dignitas in Switzerland, health care involvement is required in respect of a diagnosis being made.  It is a very serious risk to health care that one is required to make diagnoses to facilitate assisted suicide or euthanasia.</p></speech>

Even if the rights of only one person are being infringed, those rights should be vindicated.  The issue of the number of people involved is a distraction.</p></speech>

As issue raised on which I would like clarification is that my understanding of the situation in Oregon and other places, from the limited reading and research I have done in advance of this sequence of meetings, is that a second medical practitioner must confirm the validity of the wishes of the individual patient and if there is any doubt as to the mental capacity of the individual, the case is then referred to a psychiatrist for confirmation.</p><p>Accordingly, not one or two but three consultant-grade doctors are involved.  That is the case in Oregon, the regime which I read most about.  How does that fit with Mr. Tom Curran's earlier expressed view that Oregon's regime was a possible model or template that could be looked at?</p></speech>

The safeguards it has put in are as foolproof as one will get.  The argument put forward earlier against Oregon is that it is widening it.  That is its choice, however.  The safeguards are still in place and still work.  It has decided to widen it to people with psychiatric illnesses.  That is Oregon's choice.  However, the safeguards still hold.</p> <p>  Whether we widen it to that extent is entirely up to ourselves.  As my mother used to say, if Johnny puts his finger in the fire, do you have to do it as well?  We can tailor our particular situation to suit our ethics and our set of morals.  Just because Holland does it in a particular way, which I do not necessarily agree with, does not mean we have to do it that way as well.  It is taking the best part of some of regimes like Oregon's.  We picked Oregon because the safeguards it put in are as foolproof as one will get.</p></speech>

They are to be commended on being able to have a rational and civilised discussion on this very emotive issue.</p> <p>  I note Mr. Tom Curran stated he is aware that if a law is brought in, it must be in such a way that it cannot affect the vulnerable.  He said that he wants a law brought in that would apply to people such as his late wife, Marie.  How can this be done in practical terms?  We are legislators and we are discussing section 2 of the Criminal Law (Suicide) Act 1993.  Presumably, one would leave the prohibition there but would set out exceptions where somebody would not be subject to prosecution or guilty of an offence.  Would a person have to be suffering from a terminal illness?</p></speech>

For instance, going back to Marie's case, I wanted this for people like her.  However, she did not have a terminal illness as MS is not regarded as one.  It is continually disabling but not terminal.  As was proved when we went to the courts, it is not possible to predict how long a person with MS will live.</p></speech>

They made a typical Irish solution to an Irish problem, suggesting that, in Marie's case, they assumed the DPP would act compassionately.</p></speech>

It is a fascinating debate.  This issue is more about living than dying in some ways.  I read Marie's book several months ago and it was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  What I got from Marie's words was that she did not want to die but wanted to live.  However, because of circumstances not of her choosing, she wanted to end her life in dignity.  That is a fundamental question to ask oneself.</p> <p>  Are there any circumstances where somebody in a medical professional's care or another health care surrounding has the fundamental right to end their life in the way they want?  I believe somebody should have the right to die the way they want.  Are there any circumstances where somebody who is in pain and suffering can end their life by means of their choosing, rather than nature taking its course?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Regina McQuillan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017112200002#G02500"><p>I presume the Deputy is talking about assisted suicide rather than people committing suicide who have illnesses.  People may die of suicide.  That is a tragedy.  I do not think there should be any assistance in suicide or any euthanasia in any circumstances.  Once one starts making exceptions, it is normalised and then things get expanded.  That is when the challenges arise.  I do not believe there should be assisted suicide or euthanasia in any circumstances.</p> <p>  In circumstances where people are suffering a great deal, as a palliative care doctor, I work very hard to reduce their suffering.  Sometimes, when dealing with people in the last hours or days of life, reducing suffering may be by sedation to reduce their awareness of it.</p> <p>  We are leading to potential harm in a wider area.  When I am looking after a particular person, I have to look after the person but I also have to think about the impact of my actions in the wider area and wider society.  I have a responsibility for my patients but I also have the wider responsibility.  Some people are concerned about the idea of palliative care because they believe it is only about death and dying.  I am very much trying to move people away from that idea and understanding it is about helping people to live well with a serious illness.  If there is a situation where people feel palliative care is about bringing about a person's death, with their agreement or not, that is harmful to palliative care and to society.</p><p>I do not believe that there are any circumstances in which there should be assisted suicide or euthanasia.  We need to treat people and their symptoms and to look for a balance there because occasionally one is aware when treating symptoms that there is a risk of harm.  One has to balance that risk against potential benefit.  Members may be aware of the medication known as Brufen or Neurofen.  This is a pain-killer but can cause kidney disease.  If I am looking after a patient who has both kidney disease and the kind of pain that responds very well to Brufen, I would weigh up the risks of harm of using Brufen for that pain rather than something else.  One has to ask: what are the risks <i>versus </i>the benefits?  If a younger person develops kidney disease from Brufen then there is the risk of harm that he or she might lose 30, 40 or 50 years of life.  Someone with a much shorter life left to live, however, might accept the risk of kidney disease because the medication will be beneficial to them.  In weighing up the risks of benefit or harm, I would actually think that, whatever the individual might want, the risk of harm from assisted suicide or euthanasia to the wider society is too great.</p></speech>

It is a film from the 1980s called &quot;Whose Life is It Anyway?&quot; and it is quite amazing.  It changed my perspective on this issue.  Is there not a kind of <i>de facto</i>dignity in dying where somebody approaching the end of his or her life in a general hospital is prescribed morphine?  Doctors know in such a case that somebody is coming to the end and will administer an amount of morphine that will, if not quite kill the patient, then certainly lead them to die in a certain way.</p></speech>

If I am looking after somebody whose death is very close then I am aware that no matter what drugs I give that patient, he or she will die very soon.  One of the great advances in palliative medicine since I started 30 years is the fact that we now have a range of different strong pain-killers.  A patient who does not do well with morphine can thus be given different pain-killers, which help.  I am very clear, however, that I never have and never will give a patient morphine with the intention of ending his or her life.</p> <p>  If somebody is very ill then I will also try to weigh up the balance, just as I do in the case where I might give a patient Brufen despite knowing of the risk to the kidneys.  Having weighed up that balance I might give morphine, but I am very clear that while I will not leave people to suffer, nor will I be careless with the medication I give.  I will never give medication with the intention of ending a patient's life.  I will never do that.</p></speech>

I really wanted to be here for the witnesses' presentations but there was an accident on the roads which delayed everything.  I thank all the witnesses for being here today.  This is a very emotive issue and there is huge feeling around the question of dignity for those with illnesses they know they will not survive.  It is vitally important that these people have dignity in dying and I consider this to be a human rights issue.</p> <p>  I have some concerns, however, particularly with regard to safeguarding.  I apologise for having not yet read the legislation on this, although I intend to go back and read and investigate everything and to look at the different models offered in places like Oregon and Canada.  There is a fear surrounding just how far Holland has gone with its very liberal approach to this; there is always that fear.  We need to investigate this and I would definitely look at the Oregon model to see what kind of safeguarding is in place there.  </p> <p>  One thing jumped out at me as I listened to the witnesses this morning.  I was very glad that Mr. Nugent talked about his wife and about how he put a system in place for her.  I understand the fear of pain, and knowing that she had something in place must have released her from that fear in some way.  It was brilliant that Mr. Nugent was able to explain that to the committee because it is important.  Mr. Curran spoke about the Oregon model and about its psychological aspect, something that falls under the area in which I do some work.  I have no problem in saying that I have suffered from severe depression in my own lifetime and there have been times when I might have questioned what was the point of it all.  I am bringing this back to my personal story and I do not know how I would have acted had assisted dying been available.  I do not know now if I was thinking rationally then, even though I generally consider myself a very rational person.  I now work with the family members who suffer from severe anxiety and depression.  People cannot think rationally because they are living with relatives with addiction problems and so forth.  They cannot think straight.  The impact that their family situation has on them is soul-destroying and they sometimes feel like giving up.  This is the area from which I am coming to this issue.  I came through this and I know many people who did the same.  Getting through something like this is empowering: one is left stronger and more resilient.  All I am doing here is throwing out my own experience and that of the field in which I work.  As a result, I have huge reservations about the psychological model in the whole area of assisted dying.  No matter how rational one might be, depression is a kind of self-destruction.  This aspect of the issue worries me.</p> <p>  I was glad to hear Mr. Curran say that we do not necessarily have to do the same as in Oregon.  This was good to hear but I still have concerns about assisted dying and about how it might be abused.  As my colleagues mentioned, we have to acknowledge the realities of the system we are in.  It is a human right to have a home but those who are homeless do not have this right.  It is a human right to get access to mental health care or indeed general health care, but many do not even get that.  This is the basis of my concern.  Could there be abuse in all this?  I apologise again for not having yet read the legislation but I will do so.  Could any of the witnesses give us some examples of what safeguarding measures could be put in place around this issue?  How can we stop assisted dying being in any way abused?  How can we ensure that vulnerable adults with psychological issues or disabilities do not fall victim to this in order to in some way get rid of the problem?</p></speech>

While the members do not have to agree with all our potential safeguards, however, we hope that the very minimum starting point here would be that rational, terminally ill people should have the right to assisted dying.  Safeguards may then follow from this, with regard to abuse, for example.  We have already decriminalised suicide but this has not led to a broad belief in society that suicide is a good idea or something to be encouraged.  We are not insisting that our proposed safeguards be implemented and we are in fact specifically saying here that we do not agree with some of the more liberal regimes that might prove easier to abuse.</p><p>Our minimum is rational terminally ill people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1550" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Curran" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017112200002#J00200"><p>The concern many people would have is on the psychiatric illness side of things.  I share that concern and that is one of the reasons it is not included in the Bill.  It is quite controversial.  I do not have all the answers to anything but this is something I do not have enough answers to want it included.  We may get around to that some other time but certainly it is not included in this situation.  There cannot be any greater safeguard than excluding it completely.  What we want, as Mr. Nugent said, is the simple situation where people like Marie or Anne, who do not want to die, can avoid a bad death.  That is what this all about.  It is avoiding a painful death.  As Mr. Nugent said about Anne, in our situation it was five years before Marie died.  We imported her euthanasia drugs illegally.  We imported them from Mexico using the Internet of known sources.  It is a product called Nembutal.  We got two bottles of Nembutal from a supplier in Mexico and they arrived by courier.  Once they arrived in the house Marie started living.  Her whole demeanour brightened.  I have often said, and it is a strange thing to have to say, but there were two drugs that kept Ms Fleming alive and both of them were illegal.  One of them was Nembutal and the other was cannabis.  They kept Marie alive for years and years of her later life.  Cannabis controlled her spasms and her pain like none of the pharmaceutical medications could and that is what kept her going.</p> <p>  However, on the question of whether I was ever suicidal, I do not think there are many people of my age who have never contemplated suicide.  Ridiculously, when I was a teenager and my first relationship broke up I wanted to kill myself.  I am still here.  We all go through that.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who do not.  We have a huge volume of suicides and particularly with the situation that exists at the moment and the financial situation that existed in the last while.  We have a huge volume of suicides among young to middle-aged men.  We are doing very little to prevent that.  We put a hell of a lot more effort into road safety and a lot more money into road safety that we do into suicide prevention.  However, that is not what we are here to discuss.  We should be putting more into that.</p> <p>  On the safeguards, it is very difficult for me because the Bill was drafted so long ago.  However, one of the safeguards refers to two doctors and if there is any doubt about the mental capacity of the person to make rational decisions that he or she would have to be cleared by a psychiatrist.  There are lots of safeguards like that built in.  There are conversations and there are cooling off periods where a person says he or she wants to go now.  That is not allowed because of the situation a member just spoke about, of a person changing his or her mind.  There also have to be safeguards to try to determine that it is a decision that a person is making himself or herself.  No safeguards that we bring in are going to be perfect.  There is no such thing as a perfect society, unfortunately.  There will always be people who will try to abuse any situation that is brought in.  Murder is a crime but we read about murders every day of the week.  Just because something is illegal does not prevent people from doing it, just as making assisted dying illegal is not preventing people from doing it.  People are doing it all the time.  We need a more regulated basis on which they do it.  There is more likely to be abuse in an unregulated situation than there will is in a regulated situation.  We will probably prevent abuse.</p> <p>  The other thing that is well known and has been established in other jurisdictions is that it is preventing suicides because when people realise there is an option, they go looking for that option and are identified as irrational.  They get help that they would not have got otherwise because it takes so long to get psychiatric assessments.  There is advantage to it from that point of view as well.</p> <p>  However, as I said, there will not be a situation which is a 100% foolproof.  What we need to do is come as close as we can to that but just because it is not 100% foolproof does not we should deny what is basically a fundamental human right to a person to die with dignity.</p></speech>

I will be brief as most of my questions have been asked in the course of the exchange.  This has been a very worthwhile exchange and sharing of views on, as everyone acknowledges, a very important and emotive issue.  It is one that everyone has probably been impacted by in terms of the loss of a loved one, particularly one who suffered pain and discomfort in his or her last days.  A couple of points that struck me during the exchange was around the definition of "harm".  I refer to Mr. Curran's exchange with Deputy Jack Chambers, asking if it is doing harm to allow someone to continue living in such pain and discomfort.  I believe that it is a form of doing the person harm.  What Deputy Gino Kenny said struck me too.  This is actually an issue of life as opposed to an issue of death, and the kind of life that we want to give people.  I want to make those points because they really resonated with me.</p> <p>  I have two brief questions.  I hope they do not appear facetious but I presume not everyone in Oregon avails of assisted dying.  I presume that there are still people who go through palliative care and die the way that they would have died and that this is an issue of choice for people and an issue of people planning for their deaths and ensuring that they have a passing that is dignified.  With the greatest respect to Dr. McQuillan, because I have nothing but admiration for what she and other carers do at the end of people's lives, but just hearing about the cocktail of drugs and talking about the balance of Brufen and morphine and all of that strikes me, and I am sure will strike a lot of people, as a reminder of the months and months of prolonged periods people have to have a cocktail of certain pain relief while they were in great pain.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  Deputy Jack Chambers raises very valid questions in terms of disability action.  Deputy O'Callaghan also makes the valid point that we do have to tease all of this out because we are legislators.  I refer to Senator Black's point about the procedures and the steps to access this stuff.  No one is going to go out and actively seek people with disabilities for them to avail of assisted dying.  Regardless of what the steps are, whether someone may have a disability that is life-limiting or debilitating, he or she would have to instigate and initiate this process.  There are those two questions.  Regardless of the model, whether is Oregon, Belgium, Holland or wherever, I presume that there are still people who avail of palliative care and die in the manner that they would have died and the manner people here, North and South, are still dying.  I hope that is clear.</p></speech>

We have 100% mortality in case the committee is wondering.</p><p>We are all going to die; nobody is going to get out of this alive.  </p><p> An important point in the context of these discussions is how people make choices.  Senator Black made reference to the question of clear thinking.  We can talk about the theoretical, rational adult who can make a very clear choice but very few people live independently and are able to make exactly the choices they want.  Their choices are limited by the fact that they are part of a social network or a family and have other responsibilities.  Choice may also be limited by the type of the health care to which they have access.  If they cannot access health care easily, that might limit their choices.  Their choices are also limited by how much they know or understand about the options or choices they have now and into the future.  A cornerstone of health care is to respect peoples' right to make decisions.  However, we must also respect the reality of the difficulties people may have in making decisions at times and of how decisions can be limited by the circumstances in which people find themselves.  When we have a less than perfect health service and less than perfect disability services, that can also limit peoples' choices.  Their choices will be limited by those sorts of factors.  </p></speech>

The format of the meeting is that Professor Lewis will be invited to make an opening statement, to be followed by a questions and answers session with committee members.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I am obliged to provide Professor Lewis with the privilege reminder or caution.   Professor Lewis should note that she is protected by absolute privilege in respect of her evidence to the committee.  If, however, she is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to do so, she is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of her evidence.  She is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I have already reminded the members of their obligations.  I now invite Professor Lewis to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am only going to make a very brief statement because my participation will be most helpful if I answer the questions of committee members.  I will just tell the committee a little bit about myself.  I am an academic medical lawyer based in London.  I write and research on end of life decision making and in particular, on assisted dying.  I have published a number of articles and a book on that topic and have given evidence orally, in writing or both, to a number of different legislatures considering legalisation, including the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and some Australian jurisdictions.  I was an expert witness for plaintiffs or applicants in the Canadian case of Carter.  I provided expert evidence on the way in which assisted dying regimes work, including how the law was changed in various countries or jurisdictions to permit either euthanasia, assisted suicide or both; how those regimes regulate assisted dying, namely, the criteria and safeguards employed; and what the empirical evidence tells us about how those criteria are applied, how the safeguards work in practice and what evidence we have of assisted dying in jurisdictions where it is not legally permissible.  I am currently an expert witness for the claimants in two cases that are going through the English courts.  One is the Noel Conway case which involves a patient who is terminally ill.  The other case, which was in court yesterday, is the case of Omid T who is incurably and severely ill but not likely to die in the near future.  He has a life limiting condition but not one with an immediate end in sight.</p> <p>  I want to highlight the fact that I do not think that anyone who works in this area is completely neutral.  I do not think that is possible.  Having said that, I try to evaluate the evidence as rigorously as I can.  I do not have a principled opposition to legalisation but that does not that mean that I am in favour of legalisation in all jurisdictions.  I would not presume, not being an expert on the provision of health care in Ireland or how the legal system here functions, to tell this committee that Ireland should legalise or not.  However, I can help the committee, I hope, by providing information about how regimes in other jurisdictions work and what the evidence tells us about the practice of assisted dying, both in jurisdictions where it is legal and where it is not.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions following on from our interaction with the previous witnesses.  We discussed many of the regimes that exist elsewhere.  How would someone with dementia be triaged in the Netherlands?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Penney Lewis" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017112200002#L00500"><p>There are two different ways by which a patient might access euthanasia in the Netherlands.  By far the most common is where a patient in relatively early stages of dementia makes a contemporaneous request, and I distinguish that from someone who makes a request in advance of losing capacity.  This is someone who would be assessed by the doctor performing euthanasia and the independent consulting doctor who, in the vast majority of cases, will be a doctor who has been specifically trained to perform that consulting function in euthanasia cases as having capacity to make decisions.  It would be at a relatively early stage in the disease progression.  The vast majority of cases involving dementia patients involve those kinds of patients.  They also have to meet the other criteria, of which the most important to flag is unbearable and hopeless suffering with no prospect of improvement.  They would have to convince the doctor that they were suffering unbearably as a result of their condition.  The Dutch statute does permit advanced requests for euthanasia, that is, a request made in advance of the loss of capacity.  The evidence appears to be that Dutch doctors do not like to perform euthanasia in those circumstances and the number of advance requests is tiny.  The vast majority of dementia cases where the patient has received euthanasia have been contemporaneous requests.  In theory, it is possible to make an advanced request.  There are two reasons those cases are vanishingly small.  One reason is that doctors like to be able to speak to the patient about his or her request at the end and be sure that it is what the patient still wants.  The medical association advises that one must still be able to do that so if one cannot then, one should not perform euthanasia.  The other is that the unbearable suffering criterion still exists so the doctor would still have to be convinced at the time of the euthanasia that the patient was suffering unbearably and it can be quite difficult to be convinced of that if the patient no longer has capacity to express to the doctor his or her suffering.</p></speech>

That was the case for many years prior to the statute.  There was a court case called Chabot where it was permitted.  The number of cases is small and the criteria are similar.  One must have a request that is valid, so it must be made by someone with capacity, it has to be voluntary, well considered, which includes a requirement that it be well informed, and the patient also has to be suffering unbearably with no prospect of improvement.  It is possible to fulfil that criterion but not if the patient refuses realistic treatment possibility.  If the doctor believes there may be a treatment that might work for the patient, and it is a realistic possibility, then euthanasia would not be available.  The consulting physician or an additional consulting physician has to be a psychiatrist.  There will be psychiatric input and in most cases with mental disorders in the Netherlands, the physician providing what is usually physician-assisted suicide in psychiatric cases rather than euthanasia will be a psychiatrist.  There will definitely be psychiatric input looking at capacity and the unbearable suffering and treatment possibilities.</p></speech>

The way the Belgian law works in relation to adolescents is that, again, there is a capacity assessment and the child must have what the Belgian law calls the capacity of discernment.  The Belgian law is interesting because unlike for the rest of the cases eligible in Belgium, children can only access euthanasia if they are terminally ill.  The Belgian law is modelled on the Dutch law which means the main criterion in regard to the patient's condition is that they be suffering unbearably.  It is more restrictive in regard to children.  They must be suffering unbearably from a terminal illness.  Looking at the data, we know that somewhere between 60% and 80% of all cases of euthanasia or assisted suicide in permissive regimes are a patient suffering from advanced cancer.  The most likely scenario would be an adolescent with the capacity to make decisions who is terminally ill from advanced cancer.  There must be an assessment by the physician providing euthanasia as well as a consulting physician.  For children, there is an additional third assessment by a child psychiatrist or child psychologist, the parents have to consent.  If all that is satisfied, and all the procedural requirements such as the number of conversations with doctors, and the request, then euthanasia can be provided.  As I say, there has only been one case since it was legalised in 2014.</p></speech>

They tend not to go down that road because their main concern is what will happen to their parents after they die?  Will they be very sad?  Will they be able to cope?  Explanations such as that help to explain the very small number of cases.</p></speech>

I am not aware of a regime where there is no medical involvement.  I wish to make a tiny comment that does not contradict the point.  In the Canadian system it is possible that one could be provided with euthanasia by a nurse practitioner and that the consulting health care professional could also be a nurse practitioner.  In Canada it is possible that one could have euthanasia solely provided by nurse practitioners.  I do not think that is where the Deputy was going.  I think he talked about no health care professional involvement.</p></speech>

Whilst we believe that people should have a right to control in their lives, we believe that changing the law to benefit a small number of people would have a much wider repercussion on how that society values people with disabilities.</blockquote> <p>Does the professor believe there is a potential conflict between trying to uphold a particular standard in a health care setting and, as Dr. McQuillan mentioned, a potential diversion or dilution of a person's right to health care as most people would see it?  Does that diversion undermine what some of the disability groups have mentioned?</p></speech>

There is not a greater prevalence of disabled people accessing assisted dying in regimes that have been studied as in Oregon in the United States and the Netherlands.  The most famous study has been carried out by Professor Margaret Battin, which I mentioned in my briefing paper.</p> <p>  Having said that, I recognise that our health care systems, and my only experience has been of those in the UK and Canada, are not perfect when it comes to providing health care overall but, in particular, for people with severe disabilities.  It is important, if one is contemplating legalising, to think about what else one needs to put in place to ensure that any choice that is provided is a real choice.  A couple of jurisdictions that have legalised have done so in conjunction with Bills that provide rights to palliative care provision, for example.  Belgium and Luxembourg are the ones to which I refer.  If someone is contemplating the end of his or her life he or she can make a real choice between palliative care and euthanasia.  In Belgium, euthanasia is often embedded in palliative care practice so it is not necessarily a choice.  One might well have quite a lot of palliative care and then eventually reach a point where one decides to avail of euthanasia and one's palliative care provider might be the one who provides one with euthanasia.  One must think about legalisation within the context that one lives.  It is up to the members to decide whether more needs to be done in order to ensure that disabled people have a real choice.  Similarly, one must ensure that people who are terminally ill can make the choices they want about how they want to end their life and are not making that choice because palliative care is not available to them. </p></speech>

While she is a professor of law, there is no reason that she should have any knowledge of Irish law.  Under our Constitution, the courts have established there is no right to suicide in this country using the principle of unenumerated personal rights.  An argument has been advanced that there is an issue of equality between individuals who are able bodied who could commit suicide and people who are disabled but cannot commit suicide.  That argument was rejected as well.</p> <p>  The statutory provision is contained in a 1993 Act.  It states that it is a criminal offence for anyone to assist and there is a penalty of 14 years' imprisonment.  What is the interpretation of the European Court of Human Rights in this regard?  Obviously we want to know what our obligations are under that convention.  Am I right in saying that under Article 2, the court has established that there is no right to die? </p></speech>

Article 8 is engaged in this context so that the patient's right to bodily integrity and self-determination would be engaged in the context of a law that prohibits access to assisted dying or assisted suicide.  In the cases that have gone to the Strasbourg court, the governments have been successful in justifying that engagement under Article 8.2 in order to protect the rights and freedoms of others.</p></speech>

It may be the case under the rights of private life under Article 8, as the professor has said, that states may be allowed to introduce laws in order to prevent an individual being distressed at the end of his or her life.  Is that a general correct assessment of the situation?</p></speech>

As that is not the way in which Dutch or Belgium law changed on assisted dying, we do not have that kind of a background of a rights-based form of legal change.  The question is whether a state could legalise assisted dying and whether that would be compatible with both Articles 2 and 8.  The answer would appear to be &quot;yes&quot;.  Certainly, the dissenters in the most recent UK Supreme Court case of Nicklinson <i>v</i>. Ministry of Justice thought that it was possible to have such a regime and have that be consistent with the European convention.  Ireland has the responsibility to reach that decision.  The European convention, at least as it has been interpreted, does not mandate that Irish law be changed but neither does it prevent Ireland from so doing in a safe and well-regulated manner.</p></speech>

It is possible in the future that there could be a legal challenge, not necessarily to the Irish criminal prohibition but possibly to the English one, in which the European Court of Human Rights could consider, for example, the evidence that was presented in the Carter <i>v</i>. Canada case that took place in the Canadian courts.  The evidence persuaded the Supreme Court of Canada to change its mind about whether it was possible to regulate safely and protect vulnerable people from abuses.  The court could look at that evidence and think this criminal prohibition does not minimally impair the right that is engaged under Article 8.1 - the right to respect for private and family life.  I could imagine a future successful challenge but at the moment I think the Deputy is correct.</p></speech>

We have a criminal offence of assisting or encouraging suicide, which is punishable by a term of 14 years in jail.  We also have the common law offence of murder, which would be applied in cases of active euthanasia.</p><p>In addition, because there had been an unofficial policy of not prosecuting people who assisted their loved ones to travel to Switzerland for an assisted suicide, the House of Lords forced the Director of Public Prosecutions to publish a policy on how decisions regarding prosecutions would be reached in order that people who were contemplating helping a loved one in this way or any other way that would help them to have a suicide could know whether they were likely to be prosecuted.  To comply with their Article 8 rights, the court held that any limits on those rights had to be prescribed by law or in accordance with the law and there needed to be a written policy.  There is now a written policy in place which is factor based.  As such, there are factors in favour of prosecution and factors against and while it is not possible to know exactly whether one will be prosecuted, no one who has ever taken a loved one to Switzerland for an assisted suicide has been prosecuted.  </p></speech>

It sounds like an Irish solution to an Irish problem, even though it is an English solution to an English problem.</p></speech>

It is still difficult for people to know what will happen and they still face the prospect of being investigated by the police on their return from Switzerland.  Exporting suicide to Switzerland is not fair, as it results in people either travelling earlier than they would have wished or being prevented from travelling because they are too unwell or do not have money to travel.  It is expensive to have an assisted suicide at Dignitas.  The figure that is most often circulated is approximately &euro;10,000 which is a significant burden for people approaching the end of life who may well have other financial difficulties.</p> <p>  My concerns about the specifics of the policy are that there are no requirements or even factors related to the patient's condition.  This means one does not have to be terminally ill and there is no requirement that one be suffering unbearably.  In many ways, this regime is more liberal than the Dutch or Belgian regimes.  I would not be in favour of simply transplanting this model into any other jurisdiction. </p></speech>

That we have such high-level presentations from all of our guests today is a reflection of the seriousness with which the joint committee views this issue.  The level at which we are discussing it is reflective of the desire of members to address the matter as one of the key equality agenda issues for our term of office.  In that sense, Professor Lewis's contribution will be incredibly useful because we are discussing the most recent international evidence and legal examples from other jurisdictions.  It has given members a very good perspective on the complexity of an issue with which other jurisdictions have had to grapple and which this committee is also trying to do address.</p> <p>  I want to have the right to make a decision on this issue if I ever come to believe I cannot go on due to an illness that is having an impact on my quality of life.  I would like to think I would take the same view in respect of any of my loved ones.  I am in favour of anything that assists this process and I believe most people take the same view.  We are in favour of having an ability to control our lives and deciding the circumstances in which it be best for us to die.  I do not believe these circumstances are restricted to terminal conditions, for example, I am in favour of applying them to cases involving degenerative conditions.  That is my personal view, although I believe most people agree with me.</p> <p>  The objections that have been made in this exchange and earlier discussions appear to be twofold.  The first is that assisted suicide will be exploited and people will have loved ones murdered and so on.  While this is a real concern, killing someone against their will and when he or she has not taken a decision to die is, I presume, manslaughter or murder and regulations are in place to deal with such circumstances.  The issue, therefore, is not whether the law allows somebody to make a rational decision to end his or her life as there should be other ways to deal with that argument.  I ask Professor Lewis to explore this issue.</p> <p>  The second argument made against assisted suicide is that it assists in a cultural change and devalues certain groups of citizens.  I also ask Professor Lewis to comment on this view.  We cannot view these matters in isolation.  If I am being honest, the message sent out to old people in Ireland is that they are a burden.  We need only consider the state of our health service and the way we treat older people, which is incredibly disrespectful and much worse than in Mediterranean countries such as Italy where they are revered and valued.  If I was an older person with a serious illness who was worried about my family, I would make my decision within the current societal norms.  If we are truly concerned about valuing the lives of older people, we would argue for investment in the health service, respect for older people, the provision of better pensions and so forth.  It would mean addressing these cultural issues because we send a message that older people are less valued.  Is it surprising then that in such circumstances people will decide they may as well depart the scene because they are a burden?  We tell them all the time they are a burden.  What I am trying to get at are cultural issues and choice.  I firmly believe that most people share my view that individuals have a right to make this decision but they would be worried about unintended consequences.  I ask Professor Lewis to address the cultural issues, after which I will ask some questions on legislation. </p></speech>

I included a second table in my briefing note, which shows the results of a survey across multiple jurisdictions which do not, unfortunately, include Ireland on the proportion of end-of-life decisions that are to withhold or withdraw treatment compared with, for example, the proportion of cases of euthanasia, assisted suicide and termination of life without request.  What the table shows is that, irrespective of whether the jurisdiction is permissive or prohibitive, the numbers of assisted dying cases are tiny compared with the number of cases which involve a decision to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment.  If we are worried about sending people messages about their life not being worth living or pressuring people to die before they want to or both, we should be worried about those messages and that kind of pressure with regard to all end-of-life decisions.  In fact, we should be much more worried about them in respect of the much more prevalent end-of-life decision, which I am sure is being taken in Irish intensive care units, and which takes place in intensive care units in all of the jurisdictions surveyed.</p> <p>  While I agree that the problems the Deputy raises are real, they are not isolated or confined to assisted dying.  Most regimes scrutinise assisted dying cases in incredible detail.  To take the example of the Netherlands, the Dutch regional committees read a judgment about each case.  Decisions to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment, which could be the result of societal pressure or messages that society is sending and pressure by loved ones or people who are less than loved ones, are not scrutinised in the same depth.  We need to worry about all of that but we need to worry about it more generally in relation to end-of-life decision making.  </p> <p>  On another point, it appears from the evidence available to us that the types of people who request assisted dying tend to be less susceptible than others to pressure from their loved ones.</p><p>The stereotypical patient who avails himself or herself of physician-assisted suicide in Oregon is someone who is very independent, has always taken care of himself or herself, does not want to be dependent on others and wants to live life and experience his or her death on his or her terms, not on someone else's.  According to the data for Oregon, in every single year the most frequent reasons for requesting assistance are loss of autonomy, loss of dignity and a loss of ability to participate in the activities that made life worth living for that person.  It is not about not receiving enough pain control, symptom alleviation or feeling like a burden on others.  It tends to be about control, autonomy and dignity.  The stereotypical patient is not the person described by these concerns about pressure and the messages that society sends.  That does not mean I do not think those are real concerns; I do.  However, they are concerns for end-of-life decision-making more generally. </p></speech>

It is a view that I share.  I do not think the evidence should give us anything to fear from bringing in such legislation, but we hope to learn from the best.  If we were to legislate for assisted dying here, another question would arise.  How do other jurisdictions deal with clinicians who might feel uncomfortable with assisted dying, or who might not be able to do it; conscientious objectors, as they are known in Ireland?</p> <p>  Another question is how we can avoid a situation where somebody who is very ill is dragged through a protracted process of examination beforehand, waiting for second opinions or even legal cases.  How is that best balanced?  In Ireland there is a similar discussion on our abortion legislation or rather lack of it, and reasons-based legislation does not work.  Can Professor Lewis help us explore those issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1617" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Penney Lewis" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017112200002#O00300"><p>In regard to doctors who do not want to participate, all of the regimes that I have explored either have an explicit or implicit conscientious objection provision.  I am not aware of any regime where there is an obligation on a doctor to provide assisted dying.  Indeed, there is quite a lot of empirical evidence that in most jurisdictions there is a group of doctors who refuse to participate; a group that participate, but only in certain circumstances; and a group who are willing to do it, but that does not mean they accede to every request.  There is quite a good body of evidence about requests that are granted versus requests that are not granted and the reasons doctors refuse to grant requests.  Some refusals are because the individual doctors never grant requests, or for example because they do not agree with euthanasia in psychiatric cases.  Doctors can object to certain kinds of euthanasia as well.  It is possible to create a regime where doctors are making their own choice about whether to participate.</p> <p>  In that regard, it is interesting to look at the Canadian experience, because assisted dying is very new in Canada.  There was some concern, in part because access to health care in Canada is sometimes very difficult in regions of the country that are very sparsely populated and have a huge land area.  We still need more data, but it seems that there are enough doctors who are willing to provide assisted dying.  There may be areas of the country where it is more challenging but the initial forecast that no or hardly any doctors would want to do this does not seem to be borne out in the Canadian experience.</p> <p>  The question of a protracted process was raised.  The balance has to be struck between what the literature calls "prospective scrutiny", that is, scrutiny in advance of the provision of assisted dying, and "retrospective scrutiny".  The Dutch have struck that balance quite well.  They have trained a cohort of doctors to provide specialised advice and consultation in euthanasia cases.  These doctors are very familiar with the legal criteria and with how to assess capacity, suffering, voluntariness etc.  They also have a lot of experience in providing euthanasia, in consulting on it and in its alternatives.  That provides a kind of prospective scrutiny.  It is perfectly common in the Netherlands for a doctor to call in a consulting doctor who then says that the patient does not meet a certain criterion.  That is the end of the case, although obviously the patient still receives care.  There is then a process of reporting to the regional review committees, which review every single case.  They publish a very detailed annual report and individual judgments in many of the cases.  </p> <p>  It is certainly possible to shift that balance.  The English debate at the moment is very fixated on the consent of a High Court judge.  My feeling is that this is an extremely burdensome thing to expect a very ill patient to go through.  The vast majority of euthanasia or assisted dying cases involve patients who are in their last weeks or months of life.  That does not mean it should be restricted to those patients, but nonetheless that is the reality.  They are mainly end-of-life cancer patients and that consent is a significant burden.  Yes, by all means, some kind of prospective scrutiny is appropriate.  Peer review, through involving another doctor, is desirable.</p> <p>  There are other models.  The Colombians are trying a model of hospital review committees.  It does not seem to be working in Colombia but that is probably because there is a lot of opposition to the legalisation, which was imposed by the courts.  However, that is another possibility.  That can also be quite a burden to a very unwell patient but it depends on how it is implemented.  I am in favour of some kind of prospective review but also a reporting obligation and a rigorous assessment of the cases, with doctors being aware that if they do not comply with the criteria, legal and professional consequences are perfectly possible.</p></speech>

I think the answer is that we do not know.  I do not think there is any rigorous empirical evidence about the prevalence of obtaining that kind of drug.  Having said that, there is anecdotal evidence concerning places where patients have imported drugs.  There are quite a lot of cases in Australia that have been discussed in the media, with prosecutions either mooted or actually started, involving patients that have imported drugs.</p><p>I am certainly aware, anecdotally, of cases in other jurisdictions where patients have imported drugs over the Internet.  The places where those drugs come from has also been discussed in the literature.  There was reference to Mexico - that seems to be one of the jurisdictions.  At one point, there was discussion in the literature of people going to Mexico to obtain veterinary drugs which they could apparently buy over the counter and that has moved on to people ordering drugs online from Mexico.  I have also seen anecdotal evidence of ordering drugs online from China.  All of the evidence is anecdotal.  There certainly are cases.  There is not any rigorous evidence of prevalence.  We just do not know.</p><p> What we know, also anecdotally - but this is evidence that has been accepted by a number of legislatures and in a number of judicial decisions made across the world, including in the highest courts in Canada and the UK - is that people commit suicide earlier than they would have wanted to had assisted dying been available to them.  The most recent evidence I have seen on this is from the Australian state of Victoria, which is probably about to legalise assisted dying.  During the legislative process there, evidence was provided by a representative of the Coroners Court of Victoria who described the number of cases it sees of patients with terminal diagnoses or diagnoses of serious progressive neurological conditions whereby the patients have killed themselves earlier than they would have wanted - and sometimes in quite disturbing ways - in order to avoid being unable to do so later.  There is evidence of individual cases of this kind in the literature that is being published.  There is also evidence in court cases whereby patients have said, "This is what I will do," "This is what I would do," or "I know this person has done this."  There is quite a lot of anecdotal evidence.</p></speech>

Dr. McQuillan made a number of points, including in her opening address.  In the statement she submitted to the committee, she stated, "The acceptance of assisted suicide and euthanasia could lead to an under investment in palliative care research and service delivery, as assisted suicide and euthanasia may be promoted as cheaper options than appropriate health care provision."  In Professor Lewis's knowledge of the global situation, is there any evidence that there was a reduction in investment in any of the other jurisdictions with the introduction of the right or choice to die with dignity.</p> <p>  Dr. McQuillan added a further point.  I cannot remember the jurisdiction but it could have been Switzerland.  Dr. McQuillan was making a point that-----</p></speech>

Dr. McQuillan was making a point that there had been statistics released that &euro;X had been saved as a consequence of the introduction, which, in my view, would be tasteless.

I am sure, if one wanted, a person could be found who would tell the committee the opposite of what I am going to say.  Having said that, what I am going to say is evidence-based.  In fact, I will tell the committee about one recent Belgian study in a moment.<br/><br/>Generally, there is no evidence that palliative care suffers as a result of legalisation.  That does not mean it is not theoretically possible.  If a jurisdiction decides to disinvest in palliative care in favour of euthanasia or assisted suicide, then I suppose it could be possible but that is not what has happened in the jurisdictions that have legalised.  One of the reasons the evidence in the Netherlands is contested is because it has a different model of providing palliative care to other jurisdictions.  It is much more embedded in general practice.  General practitioners tend to have long-term relationships with their patients.  They tend to provide palliative care and they also are the most frequent providers of euthanasia.  There may be less involvement with the hospice model but that does not mean that palliative care is not being provided.  It is often being provided at home.  Indeed, that is a model that is being rolled out in many jurisdictions.  I am involved with the clinical ethics committee of St. Christopher's Hospice, the birthplace of the modern hospice movement.  We do a lot of work providing palliative care to patients in their homes.  That is a substantial part of St. Christopher's practice of palliative care.  The Dutch evidence does not suggest that.<br/><br/>The Belgian evidence certainly does not suggest it.  As I mentioned earlier, in Belgium, at the same time as euthanasia was legalised, a statute that created a right to access palliative care was also put in place.  The evidence is that euthanasia is becoming embedded in palliative care.  There is a recent study, published in the journal <i>Palliative Medicine</i>this year, in which the authors looked at almost 7,000 deaths in Flanders.  They found that those requesting euthanasia were more likely to have received palliative care - 70% of them had been in receipt of palliative care - than others who, according to the literature,  were dying &quot;non-suddenly&quot;, that is, those not dropping dead from heart attacks but who had conditions causing deterioration over a period.  Euthanasia seems to have been embedded in palliative care in a way that it is another treatment possibility that one can access as part of one's so-called end-of-life care package.<br/><br/>The other question is whether lives would be at risk as a result of legalisation.  The evidence does not bear this out.  The reason I included the first comparison table is to show that termination of life without request is a small practice.  Members will notice that the scale on that chart goes from 0% to 7%.  Indeed, I had to increase the size in order that the committee would be able to see the detail.  It is a practice that happens in permissive and prohibitive jurisdictions.  Australia, for example, had a very high rate of termination of life without request.  The Belgian rate has gone down following legalisation.  The Dutch rate is also going down and is very low now.  The evidence does not bear out that there is more termination of life without request in jurisdictions that legalise.<br/><br/>The evidence does not show that euthanasia is only practised in jurisdictions that have legalised it.  This practice exists.  The question is whether one wants to regulate it.  The answer to that must be  that it is certainly better to regulate it.  That would be the way to avoid having people pressured or killed without valid requests.</p><p>If we do that, at least then we bring the practice into the open, we will know what is happening and if there are people behaving outside the legal regime, we can deal with them appropriately.</p></speech>

Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

The only reason for the further Revised Estimate is to reflect the transfer of the responsibility of the Charities Regulatory Authority to the newly established Department of Rural and Community Development following a transfer of functions effective from 26 July 2017.  The proposed change to Vote 24 is of a technical nature and Exchequer neutral.  Gross funding of &euro;4.453 million, which is 1% of the original allocation, and net &euro;4.358 million is being transferred to the newly established Department of Rural and Community Development.  The committee completed its consideration of the Estimates for 2017 in respect of the eight Votes in the justice group, including Vote 24 - Justice and Equality, last April.</p>  <p>  I do not have anything further to add other than to inform members of the technical change in the Vote arising from the transfer of functions in respect of the Charities Regulatory Authority to the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p></speech>

What was the rationale for the transfer?  Surely the oversight function of the Charities Regulatory Authority is better placed in the Department of Justice and Equality.  I find it hard to understand the logic apart from giving a Minister who has little funding in his own Department something to do.</p></speech>

This was the decision of Government following due and careful consideration.  The key rationale for the transfer is that the Department of Rural and Community Development has specific responsibility, as stated in the title, for community development.  I felt, as did ministerial colleagues, that it would be appropriate to vest policy responsibility for the community and voluntary sector as a whole in that Department.  It is clear that many community and voluntary sector organisations are registered charities.  It was considered that there would be certain synergies in transferring responsibility for the charities sector and its regulation to that Department.  The Chairman and members of the committee will be aware that the Department of Justice and Equality has almost 30 agencies attached to it.  I recommended, and Government agreed, that the functions of the Charities Regulatory Authority and the Charity Appeals Tribunal would be a better fit in that new Department.</p></speech>

I think references to these changes are included in the programme for Government.  If they are not already aware of them, I would be happy to provide the committee members with the details.  It would be appropriate that such issues would be placed before the committee.  It is intended that these agencies would be the subject matter of a transfer to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p></speech>

In respect of the other agencies, I should have referred to the Property Registration Authority rather than the Property Services Regulatory Authority, which regulates auctioneers.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1661" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Gallagher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017112200002#C00500"><p>I thank the committee for facilitating our appearance before it this morning to discuss the proposed draft Bill.  The Minister has asked me to convey his apologies for not being here this morning as he is required in the D&aacute;il Chamber to answer parliamentary questions.</p> <p>  Before addressing the more detailed aspects of the proposed legislative amendments contained in this relatively short draft Bill, I would like to set out the broader policy and operational context and also explain what, in essence, the draft Bill seeks to do.  Civil aviation security, which includes security arrangements at our airports and security practices and procedures amongst companies operating at our airports, including airlines, cargo companies, is a highly regulated area.  In this regard, there are extensive and detailed rules and obligations set out in international agreements, specifically the Chicago convention, and also in EU law.  There is regular and high level engagement on aviation security issues at the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation, which manages the Chicago convention and, similarly, at EU level among member states.  There is also high level regular engagement between the EU and the US on a bilateral basis.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware that airports and aircraft for a long time now have been a particular focus for terrorist attacks and over time, and especially since the 9/11 attacks, a huge amount of work has been put into counteracting this threat.  In Ireland, the National Civil Aviation Security Committee, which is chaired by my Department, brings together all relevant State agencies and industry stakeholders to ensure that Ireland keeps pace with developments in this area.  The committee will appreciate that there are constant developments in this area, new intelligence of new threats, changes to threat levels, changes to the source of threats and, therefore, it is a constantly evolving picture.  The National Civil Aviation Security Committee plays a hugely important role in making sure that Ireland does what it needs to do, developing strategies and co-ordinating responses across the sector.</p> <p>  The other key component of Ireland&rsquo;s civil aviation security regime is the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, which since 2013 has been the principal body in Ireland responsible for the oversight and inspection of civil aviation security.  At the heart of this proposed legislative amendment is a provision that will allow the Irish Aviation Authority to invest in more resources to allow it to bulk up its oversight and inspection capabilities with regard to civil aviation security as demand increases from increased activity and volumes linked to economic growth.  As mentioned, since 2013, the IAA has been the principal body responsible in Ireland for the oversight and inspection of civil aviation security but at that time no arrangements were made to provide it with a revenue stream to support these additional functions.  It is proposed to address this now.  The Minister is of the view that we need a sustainable funding model that is fair and transparent.  Ireland is currently an outlier in the EU as it is the only member state with no formal mechanism for funding this activity.  All other EU member states have a mechanism in place to cover the cost associated with the oversight of aviation security, for example, through central Exchequer funds, some form of aviation security taxation on airspace users or through the levying of direct fees on regulated entities.  The Government has decided that the regime in Ireland should be funded by way of a new industry levy in the form of fees payable by regulated companies.  Up to now, the IAA has drawn on income from other sources.</p> <p>  What is proposed is the same charging model applied in other areas of aviation regulation by the IAA and by regulators in other sectors in Ireland.  The Minister considers the provision of this levy and the additional resources it will provide to be a matter of utmost national interest on a number of fronts.  As we develop increased connectivity through our State airports, as part of the Government's broader economic development policy, the State needs to ensure that it has an aviation security regime that is able to meet the future demands of that increased connectivity; Ireland needs to continue to keep pace with international developments and ensure that it meets the ever-increasing demands coming from the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, and from the EU in the area of civil aviation security; and, as an exporting economy, one that relies heavily on Dublin Airport in particular for access to international markets, the State needs to make sure that this key component of our international supply chain is highly secure.</p> <p>  The aviation security approval of Irish air carriers and certification of known consigners operating within the international supply chain provided by the IAA is recognised throughout Europe and internationally and allows our companies and airlines to trade across Europe.  For example, there are approximately 200 Irish based manufacturing companies exporting through our airports, many of them multinationals.  The status they are awarded by the IAA, which is known-consigner status, which is given on the basis of the IAA being satisfied as to the security arrangements applied by the companies when goods are packaged for export, means there is no need for re-screening at the airports.  This is hugely beneficial in terms of reducing the cost of the supply chain and avoiding delays and it is highly valued by the companies.</p><p>There is a considerable workload associated with this function.  More than 500 relevant entities operate in the Irish aviation market, including companies that operate or provide services at Irish airports, which the IAA has to regulate for the purposes of civil aviation security.  The largest, unsurprisingly, is Dublin Airport, but the list also includes non-aviation companies that move and export cargo through the airports, which also have security obligations under the regulations.  As mentioned, our airlines depend on it, as their ability to provide services throughout Europe depends on the IAA validating their security programmes.</p><p> The IAA envisages that its new charges for civil aviation security, which will follow the user pays principle, will be applied proportionately, depending on the scale of the operations of the regulated entity.  These charges will be directly associated with the level of inspection and oversight provided by the IAA to ensure that the entities comply with EU security requirements and those of ICAO.</p><p> The other element of the draft Bill involves technical provisions to formally align the existing system of regulatory oversight provided by the IAA with ICAO Annex 17, which sets out standards and recommended procedures in the area of civil aviation security.  As mentioned earlier, in 2013 responsibility for civil aviation security, as set out under EU law, was transferred from the Department to the IAA.  This was done through secondary legislation.  Primary legislation is required to do the same for the largely overlapping ICAO provisions, and so this Bill also provides an opportunity to do so.  In practice, since 2013, the IAA has maintained regulatory oversight against the national civil aviation security programme, which includes all national and international civil aviation security requirements, including EU and ICAO requirements.</p><p> I will now turn to the specific draft heads of the Bill, as presented to the committee, of which there are three.  The proposed amendments are interlinked, and I hope they are satisfactorily explained in the explanatory note included in the general scheme circulated to the committee.  </p><p> The purpose of head 1 is to formally designate the IAA as the appropriate authority for the purpose of ICAO Annexe 17 and, therefore, to allow it to make orders and charge fees in relation to civil aviation security oversight and inspection.  Head 2 is related to head 1, in so far as it provides an amendment to section 14(1) of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 to include within the objects of the company activities related to civil aviation security.  Again, this serves to provide a legal basis for charging on a cost recovery basis.</p><p> Head 3 is required to ensure that the Act reflects current policy regarding the role of the IAA in the area of civil aviation security oversight and inspection.  It provides for the deletion of section 5 (10) of the Act.  This overall approach follows the policy principle that underpins cost recovery for civil aviation regulation in other areas.  Under the revised Act, the IAA will be required to consult regarding the manner and level of the new fees, and these fees will be required to be proportionate.  For the benefit of the committee's consideration of this aspect, it is important to note that the fees currently charged by the IAA with respect to its other regulatory functions are very competitively priced within a European context.</p><p> The broader context for our ongoing work in this area is that airports and aviation have traditionally, and continue to be, a focus for terrorist attacks.  As we have unfortunately seen too much of in recent times, such terrorist attacks can strike at any time in any place without warning.  Quietly, in the background, as part of a wider counter terrorism strategy, all States are making efforts to reinforce existing controls at airports and within the aviation environment.  These legislative amendments are part of the process to ensure Ireland continues to have a robust civil aviation security oversight regime, and is seen by the international community as having such a regime.  It is also hugely important for the aviation industry in Ireland that it can rely on a robust aviation security regime.  This is also the case for our exporting companies, which depend on the airports to get their goods to overseas markets.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the views of the committee this morning, and I hope we will be able to provide the members with as much information as is required to satisfy them as to the merits of this proposed legislative amendment.  If the Chairman and the members are agreeable, I may from time to time defer to my colleague from the Irish Aviation Authority on specific matters relating to operations, as opposed to policy.  In that respect, however, it is also necessary to point out that some operational matters are of a highly confidential nature and, therefore, there may be certain instances where we will be unable to comment in any great detail, certainly on specific operational practices, which might risk compromising the security regime.  I hope this will not prove to be too much of an issue during the course of the committee's deliberations this morning.</p></speech>

We asked the clerk to have this meeting as soon as we could.  It so happens, very unfortunately, that the Minister and committee members who are Members of the D&aacute;il are in the D&aacute;il at Question Time at present.  I was not aware of it until it was pointed out to me in a letter yesterday, so I apologise.  Nevertheless, we intend to ensure we will have adequate scrutiny today.  We will have an opportunity later, on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, and on Committee Stage, to raise all of the issues.</p> <p>  I have several questions before we start.  We must support in every possible way any level of security that professionals deem necessary and we must fund this.  I have no issue with this.  The regulatory impact statement does not include the impact the &euro;1 million may have on the increased costs to consumers or people who use the airport.  I am speaking about the ordinary customer.  Why was it necessary to bring forward legislation instead of the alternative, which was by way of ministerial order? I would appreciate the witnesses coming back on these points later.</p></speech>

I concur with the Chairman's opening remarks regarding the important function carried out by the Irish Aviation Authority.  I want to follow on from the Chairman's question on the practical implications.  Mr. Gallagher has explained why it is necessary, but what are the practical implications of what this will mean with regard to increased fees?  Will the airlines or the consumers pay?  What will this mean for the people looking in today, who will want to know what implications it will have for the cost of their flights?</p> <p>  I fully understand the point made that the witnesses cannot answer on certain policy issues.  I raised with the Minister the issue of maps and charts used in the aviation industry, and he told me the authority had advised him there is no reason whatsoever for the Irish aviation community or emergency services to have any concerns about the aeronautical maps or charts.  I watched the "Prime Time" programme a few weeks ago on which these issues were raised.  They seemed to be from an amateur and were with regard to mountains or obstacles not being noted on the maps and the height of certain obstacles being incorrect on the maps.  What implications does this have?  Is it an issue?  I would like the witnesses' comments on this.</p></speech>

I may touch on it in so far as I can give some extra information, and if there is an opportunity to come back with follow-up information I will agree to do so.  With regard to the impact on consumers using Dublin Airport and other airports, the Government considered a number of options with regard to how this important service would be funded.  There is always the option that the Exchequer and the taxpayer fund it directly.</p><p>What has become common in regulation in Ireland is the application of an industry levy.  In many respects, the largest regulated entity envisaged under this would be DAA, primarily because of the extent of the activity.</p><p> Probably three quarters of the estimated cost of providing this security regime, &euro;1 million, will fall to the DAA.  That means &euro;700,000 from a company that has an annual turnover of &euro;700 million and after-tax profits of &euro;100 million.  It is a regulated entity.  The Commission for Aviation Regulation, the economic regulator, will take all its costs into account in terms of the fees.  In principle, if one charges a company an extra fee, whatever it might be, there is always the possibility that it will feed through to the consumer.  On a relative scale, that will be pretty minimal.  In the context of competition at the airport and the deals the airlines do with the DAA, I would not expect any material impact on the cost to the consumer using Dublin Airport.  Against that, there is always an open question as to who should pay.  At present, since the IAA absorbs the cost, the costs fall disproportionately on the airlines.  Much of the security activity happens at the airports so it is probably spreading in a more fair way the cost of providing the security regime.</p></speech>

It was an arrangement that was never intended to be long-standing.  When the function was transferred in 2013, it was always the intention that the Department would regularise the funding stream in legislation.  That is what we are now doing.  It was really an interim arrangement.  It is not satisfactory.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  In principle, I support the draft Bill.  There was good clarity regarding my colleagues' questions on who will pay.  It is the airport authority that will be liable in the first instance.  Do the delegates envisage a difference in regard to the collection models of different airports?  There is quite a substantial difference between 29 million or 30 million passengers going in and out of Dublin Airport and the numbers going through Shannon, Cork, Knock and other airports.  The smaller airports, the regional airports, may well be more challenged than the larger ones.</p> <p>  Let me refer to the total amount collected, &euro;1 million, in addition to the turnover of Dublin Airport, as mentioned by Mr. Gallagher, and the turnover in respect of the IAA.  The latter is an incredible organisation.  I support it 100%.  It is making a reasonably good profit.  I do not have the figures in front of me but I remember reading the authority's annual accounts recently.  A sum of &euro;1 million is being sought.  To me, &euro;1 million is not a lot if one wants to ramp up security to the level I understood was intended.  I have a couple questions on that.  How do the witnesses envisage strengthening the security?  Is there a strategy, game plan or cost-benefit analysis in this regard? </p> <p>  The perspective of the passenger is very important.  Sometimes it takes an hour or more to come through passport control in Dublin Airport after an inbound flight.  I refer to the flow of passengers through Dublin Airport, primarily from the passengers' perspective but also from that of the airlines.  The focus is totally on the passenger and the safe and efficient passage of the passenger.  If the delegates have any thoughts on that, I would certainly appreciate them.  Is the fee or levy that was mentioned considered in the regulator's assessment of costs in Dublin Airport and the other airports?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1682" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Gallagher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017112200002#E01500"><p>I will address first the issue of profitability and the IAA.  The Senator is correct to state the airport authority is a highly profitable organisation.  I draw a distinction, of course, between its regulatory and commercial sides.  On the regulatory side, work operates on a cost-recovery basis only.  Importantly, there is no crossover between the commercial and regulatory sides.  It is an important point of principle that there be no funding flow crossover.  While both functions are under the IAA, they are very much separated on a corporate level.  Commercial activities are regulated at European level and are highly profitable because of the extent of our <i>en route</i>charges.  The IAA retains a cash amount that it uses to invest in technology for traffic control.  The State benefits from the payment of an annual shareholder dividend.  On the regulatory side, the system operates on a cost-recovery basis.  As a matter of public policy, we do not mix the regulatory and commercial sides.<br/><br/>On the issue of strengthening and ramping up, it is important to clarify that the provision is allowing the IAA to fund existing levels of security.  It has a comprehensive programme in place.  The point was on going further as our connectivity and the through-flow of passengers at airports increase.  As the volume of goods exported from our economy increases, we need to have a much more secure funding regime.  The IAA needs certainty as an organisation that it will be able to draw fees.<br/><br/>With regard to distribution, because it is the largest customer and will be subject to the highest level of inspection and oversight, DAA will pay the highest fees in relative terms.  The details of that still have to be worked out.  The IAA will do so in consultation with the industry and there will be transparency.  It is not just to fall on the airports; it will fall on multinationals also.  Exporting multinationals highly value it.  It essentially allows them to package their goods on site of manufacture.  They may be sent straight to the airport, put straight onto the aeroplane and flown straight out of the country.  It really shortens the process.  It is a relatively small price for those concerned to pay for the speed at which the supply chain operates for them.  The arrangement is a factor in the IDA's ability to attract foreign direct investment.<br/><br/>There was a question on passengers queuing and so on.  There are two high-level committees that the Department chairs.  One is on aviation security and the other is on facilitation at the airports.  The latter has representatives from each of the airports and airlines.  That committee has a rolling programme of actions to try to ensure steps are taken at each airport by the airlines, immigration control, the Garda or whoever the relevant party is on the committee to work constantly towards increasing the flow of passengers from landside to airside and airside to landside.</p></speech>

This has to do with strengthening security oversight in the State.  The IAA has a national quality control programme that it reviews annually.

It contains all the requirements from EU requirements to international requirements to national requirements for aviation security.  The IAA then has the role of regulating compliance against that programme.  I will hand over to Mr. Gavin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1689" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Gavin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017112200002#F00600"><p>I will deal with the regulatory perspective.  The European regulation for the common rules and basic standards of civil aviation exists to protect persons or goods from acts of unlawful interference within civil aircraft.  This regulation, Regulation (EC) No. 300/2008, was established as a result of the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US.  It is clear from the global and interconnective nature of civil aviation that it has been targeted by terrorist groups.  What does the IAA do?  By its nature, aviation security is a set of measures to ensure that no unauthorised persons or items go on board an aircraft or go through the secure part of an airport.  It is a global requirement and that is the part that Ireland plays with regard to it.  For the passengers, that means that the IAA has an oversight function on regulated entities such as airports, air carriers and air components.  It is the IAA's job to ensure that no explosives are on someone such as a passenger, in a bag in the cabin, cargo hold or the cargo bay under the aircraft, in the pack of newspapers that arrive on an aircraft, or in the meal a passenger gets.  From that, there is an inspection and audit cycle that takes place under this programme.</p></speech>

It seems that the cost recovery is from regulated entities only.  Will Mr. Gavin tell me who they are?  The regulatory impact statement says that a small number of respondents - I do not know who they were, obviously, as these are the regulated entities - suggested that excessive cost charging would be prevented should that happen.  We are talking about financial oversight.  How would this be invigilated?  If this proposal is to go from &euro;1 million to &euro;2 million, how does one ensure that this is proportionate?  I do not doubt that it is always right when it is coming from the security people, but how is it regulated and how does one ensure it is fair?</p></speech>

In principle, it is always a concern of regulated entities that the regulator builds in a huge amount of fat for expensive offices and pay rates.  It is on a strictly cost recovery basis.  The charging regime will be transparent.  The IAA produces an annual report and is then accountable to the Oireachtas for that cost.  Regulators will come in in terms of their accounts and the Department has a relationship as well, so it is dealt with administratively.  It is a constant piece and happens in all areas of regulations such as the banking sector and other areas of transport.  It involves this tension between regulated entities and the fees they pay.  I would say in defence that in comparison with EU regulators, the fees and charges are generally highly competitive.  We do not have a list of the actual individuals but we can give the committee a flavour apart from airports of the type of companies that would be subjected to the regime.</p></speech>

With regard to anybody who gets an approval, certification or licence, the fees would be associated with that service.  The types of entities include airports, cargo entities, regulated agents and known consigners.  Known consigners will particularly benefit from this.  They are producers who want to transport consignments by air.  We work on the basis of a secure supply chain from source.  Therefore they do not have screen the goods at the airport.  There is a huge cost associated with screening goods at an airport apart from the facilitation issues for the airport.  If that can be avoided, that is what companies want.  The benefit to these entities is that they get certification which is recognised across the EU and internationally.</p> <p>  In terms of proportionality, in the EU regulations they can recover no more than the cost of the service that is provided so that will limit what can be charged.  Again, in terms of proportionality, it would be very much dependent on the level of activity, that is, the level of certification or approvals required.  Perhaps Mr. Gavin might add to that.</p></speech>

That is led by the Commission and all the member states.  We are constantly adjusting our mitigating measures to achieve the highest level of security while minimising adverse effects on operations.  Regulated entities and categories of entities include airport operators, which include passenger and cabin screening, and air carriers, which include the actual aircraft searches and protection.  This involves not only Irish air carriers but every air carrier that depart from the State.  Others include regulated agents, which involves screening of cargo that may have been transported by air, known consigners, which were mentioned by Ms Lennon and which secure cargo consignments at the source of production, regulated suppliers, and in-flight suppliers such as those supplying coffee, tea and blankets on board aircraft.  At State level, one finds An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The aviation security regime is part of a wider State security programme that is co-ordinated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but in terms of aviation security, it comes under our regulation as well and indeed the air navigation service providers within the State, including our counterparts in the IAA.</p></speech>

I had an important role as we need a certain number of people on quorum duty for the Seanad to start.  When witnesses see Deputies and Senators leaving, it is not a snub.  I am delighted the witnesses can appear before us today.  We are talking about oversight and inspection capabilities with regard to aviation security.  I was interested to see that income has been drawn from other sources.  This has effectively regularised the way the authority gets its funding.</p> <p>  We are very proud of Dublin Airport, including the new Terminal 2, about which there was huge hoo-ha over the years because it was so expensive.  It is now an international hub and it is great to see that it is a regional airport and is bringing people from across the island.  There is, effectively, a captive audience.  Security must be paramount, but what is being done to drive down costs?  Garda&iacute; used to perform passport checks but now civilians do so, which is very welcome.  It releases garda&iacute; across the State.  I have noticed that in respect of security checks, instead of one person queuing, five people queue at a time.  I think it might have started in Stansted.  Perhaps Dublin was the first to introduce it.</p><p>Certainly it has helped save time but has it made any savings?</p><p> I will be parochial.  We are very proud of Knock Airport in my region.  However, before one goes through security at Knock there is a &euro;10 departure fee, which effectively goes to the airport.  It is something a lot of people do not realise.  We are happy to pay it.  Does the Department have any role regarding funding for Knock Airport?</p></speech>

The airport is regulated by the Commission for Aviation Regulation, which is an economic regulator separate from the IAA.  It makes determinations on a five-year basis.  It takes into account the capital investment plans of the airport, including projections for future passenger levels.  It is an open process.  The airlines and airports make submissions.  The economic regulator takes on expertise to provide independent overview of that process.  They arrive at a per passenger, regulated price which sets on an average basis what passengers using Dublin Airport pay for the privilege.  That is the cost containment model.  There is an economic regulator that makes sure that Dublin Airport, given its strong market position, cannot just make up prices and take advantage of a kind of de facto monopoly position on the island in terms of the scale of its operations.  It is the only airport in the State that is regulated by virtue of its size.  That is how the State ensures that there is a lid kept on costs.</p> <p>  Some of the initiatives the Senator mentioned result in part from the cross-Departmental, cross-agency engagement of the facilitation committee I mentioned earlier.  The Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and immigration services joined with the airport and airlines.  There has been a process over the past three or four years to replace garda&iacute; with civilian staff.  That frees up garda&iacute; and reduces the costs because there is a ceiling in pay level terms.  There are also flexibilities within that service.  Those initiatives have been driven by the Department of Justice in co-operation with the airport under this facilitation committee.  It is an example of how the committee smooths the relationship between various actors at the airport.  </p> <p>  On Knock, I must confess I do not have specific knowledge.  Knock is not a regulated airport.  None of the other airports is.  All of them set some per passenger charge, which is used to support the company and facilities and to keep the airport open.  That is what it goes towards.  I would have to defer on the funding for Knock, it is in another area of the Department.  If the Senator has some specific questions, I would be happy to get more information for him.</p></speech>

When people land at an airport and present their passports, that is an immigration booth.  It is nothing to do with aviation security.  Aviation security is about preventing unlawful acts of interference.  From the IAA's perspective, we want people to fly and goods to be transported by air in a safe manner so that the travelling public can have confidence that when they board the aircraft there is not an explosive device on board, or that there is nobody on board who wants to hijack the aircraft.  It is completely separate from immigration.</p></speech>

Our responsibility in the Irish Aviation Authority is to ensure that the airport employs with the common basic standards under Regulation 300 of 2008.  If it wants to have two or ten check-in desks, that is a matter for itself.  There are some related delays which are covered by the Commission of Aviation Regulation, CAR, but that is outside our responsibility.  It is just to ensure that the airport or regulated entity complies with the common basic standards for aviation security.</p></speech>

The dog did not eat my homework; I just got stuck in the traffic.  It happens with the transport committee from time to time because we normally meet early in the day.</p> <p>  We would all want to save money on everything in aviation except security.  It is a given that security needs to be absolutely top notch.  In many cases, we have regulation in theory but not in practice.  We constantly ask what the cost of it is but in fact, we pay for it one way or the other.  If there is a failure we pay for it.  We need to look at it in the context of making sure there is not a failure.  Are there sufficient resources in what is being proposed?  There is no point in having it in theory but not in practice.</p></speech>

The Department did not set any parameters for that costing and therefore it is based on an IAA assessment of what it needs for the moment.  In the future, I suppose that will be a matter for review as the demand either from new security threats or from the volume of traffic and passengers expands.  I would anticipate that the need for additional funding would increase but not in any material sense.</p> <p>  What is important is that everything that the IAA does in this context is set at EU and international level.  There is a kind of drip-down from those regulations.  Therefore, as there are changes at that level, the IAA may need to introduce new pieces.  As we go through this, as new threats arise, different, new procedures are brought into place and the point about having a separate income stream is to make sure there is a secure, long-term, knowable income stream for the organisation to plan into the future.  That is part of the purpose of this legislation.</p></speech>

If we find a deficiency, we expect to see immediate corrective action.  Depending on the severity of the deficiency, we would expect appropriate mitigation to take place at the airport.  We would want to see root cause analysis being conducted by the regulated entity and the airport in this example.  At that stage, we would revisit and ensure that the deficiency is closed and new procedures or processes are in place to ensure it does not happen again.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, the threat vector is shifting all the time and there are emerging threats.  In 2014, explosives trace detection was introduced by the Commission and it might be necessary to detect emerging threats and new technologies.  It could possibly place greater expense on the regulated entity to ensure it complies with whatever regulation is deemed necessary by the European Commission.</p></speech>

The IAA operates a scale system of enforcement actions.  It can range from what Mr. Gavin described, where it is discussed with the entity and a rectification is sought but there can also be suspension or revocation of an entitlement such as a licence or certificate.  There can also be summary prosecution.  These are set out in the IAA state safety programme, which is on the website.  It applies to safety regulation, as well as aviation security regulation.  The proposal in front of us today will not change anything in that enforcement regime, it merely deals with the fees aspect.</p></speech>

On reflection, between the Department and the IAA I suppose there was a sense that the power was something to have but the authority did not envisage it coming to a point where it would be used.  The approach was more to work with companies for solutions rather than getting to a point where there was a withdrawal of certification and fines.</p></speech>

We have seen recent examples of known consigners that can secure their own goods at source.  If their security programmes are not in compliance with the regulation, they cannot supply their goods.  A razor shellfish producer could not put his goods on the supply chain for the Far East, and this had an immediate regulatory impact on that entity.</p></speech>

The security programme of the entity would need to be seen and there must be a security manager for the entity.  There are various elements to be considered, including how goods are packaged and sealed, as well as how they are transported and the various aspects of the supply chain.  The question of whether they are secure all along the supply chain to the aircraft would be considered.  This happens as a one-off at the start but it is repeated for renewals of the approval.</p></speech>

For example, there may have been 20 visits to Weston in a year, with 16 being notified visits and the other four being on spec.  The on-spec visits are incredibly important because it is like an inspector coming to the classroom, with things being polished.  What number of these takes place?  Does the authority have the capacity to carry those out on spec rather than making notified visits?  Is that part of the regime?</p></speech>

The rate of inspections relates to an ongoing assessment by the IAA under the national quality control programme I mentioned.  This is reviewed continuously.  It is decided on a risk basis, perhaps depending on how compliant the entity has been in the past, whether it needs repeat visits and how frequently these should be repeated.</p><p>This is something that is changing all the time and is being assessed all the time by the Irish Aviation Authority.</p></speech>

It is the entity that is going to carry it out.  It is a case of being satisfied that the system is sufficiently robust and resourced to do that.  Is Ms Lennon satisfied that that is the case?</p></speech>

The European Commission will make its assessment as to whether the level of inspections and audits meet its standard for what it considers is required.  Thus far we have done quite well in the review by the Commission.  We take on board any comments it makes but currently we have no infringement proceedings in terms of the appropriate authorities' compliance with the European regulations.</p></speech>

We are part of a global aviation industry and there is really no opportunity to slack off.  Even in respect of the pre-clearance facilities we have in Dublin and Shannon airports the US government as well has a whole other suite of requirements.  The fact that we have pre-clearance is testament to how we are viewed in the United States in terms of our security apparatus.  There will always be a need to be constantly vigilant of any risk.  That is why we would never say to the committee that we are absolutely satisfied the system is 100% foolproof.  There are always areas of change and part of the challenge to make sure that we are in touch with international developments, including security developments, and that they are reflected on and actions are taken as quickly as possible.  That is the system we have in place.  As far as we are concerned the system works and is subject to international audit.  Clearly, it is a moving target.</p></speech>

The other function is keeping things separated in the air, which we would like to think happens in a very professional way.  Following the awful crash in Blacksod Bay, does the IAA have further work to do in relation to mapping hazards?  What is the status of the work in that regard?  I know it does not come within the scope of the Bill but it relates to safety in the air and comes under the remit of the IAA.</p></speech>

The issue was raised earlier by Senator O'Mahony but I did not get back to him because the conversation moved on.  It is a separate issue concerning search and rescue operations while what we are dealing with here, apart from security, is civil aviation.  The events in Blacksod fall outside the remit of that.  It is a safety matter that falls to another side of the IAA.  I understand it will be before the committee in a few weeks.</p></speech>

I welcome the work of the IAA.  It is hugely important and keeps us all safe and secure.  I have one question about due diligence on the charges, notwithstanding the codes and the appropriate reasons for imposing them.  In other words, there is no regulation on what the IAA charges, notwithstanding that the underlying reason is right and I fully support what the IAA has to do.  Is there anyone to carry out due diligence on the charges, notwithstanding the fact that they are essential?  I do not query the reason for them or the need for them, but how do we know if it is the right charge?  Is that a fair question?</p></speech>

Under the code of governance for State bodies the Department has obligations to hold its agencies to account and in that respect we have financial information and the annual accounts are subject to a memo for Government and are laid before the Houses so in that sense the Oireachtas has sight of it.  In addition, the principle of cost recovery is quite a discipline within EU regulations.  It means that the IAA has to demonstrate that the resources it has, the people it recruits and the activities it carries out are in direction relationship to its regulatory functions.</p></speech>

My question is that there are 600 regulated entities.  If, for example, I am Johnny Murphy and I am a regulated entity how do I make sure that the IAA does not profiteer on the fact that I may have to pay an extra charge?  How does the IAA control other costs?  How does it make sure that the consumer is not going to be ripped off somewhere along the line?  I say that respectfully.</p></speech>

The IAA is always obliged to go before the committee if issues arise.  I am not aware of that being a huge point of issue.  It is not something that features or follows through, albeit that nobody wants to pay something that up to now was free.  If the Exchequer can pay for it that is attractive too.</p></speech>

While a small number might be only two or three, was it the DAA or who were the people who did that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-22a.1766" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Gallagher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017112200002#J02000"><p>I do not think I am breaching confidentiality as it was a public consultation.  The DAA was certainly of the view that the charge should be set against the passengers using the airport rather than the company.  By virtue of administrative ease of collecting fees it seems to me that the regulated entity is the most appropriate.  It is after all the organisation that can respond to whatever the security finding might be.  There are inbuilt incentives in the system in a way that the IAA inspects the associated charges.  If one is a highly performing regulated entity in terms of aviation security the IAA's requirement to constantly visit will reduce and therefore one imagines that the fee is payable.  There is an inbuilt incentive to be a good client.  If one was to directly charge passengers who use the airport once a year or once every two years it is not clear to me that it would be a benefit as they have no relationship with the regulated entity in terms of changing behaviour.  Part of the approach is to try to incentivise behavioural responses to security breaches.  I will ask Mr. Gavin if he thinks that is fair.</p></speech>

This additional cost on Dublin, and it is not just on Dublin, is so small in relative terms that I cannot see in any material way how it would filter down in any noticeable way to the customer.</p></speech>

When a person books a flight will it be a hidden charge, an increase or will it be added to the cost of the flight?  The cost will be minimal in Dublin Airport, which has 30 million passengers, but is there a bigger implication for regional airports?

The DAA is holding the bulk of it because of the level of activity at the airport.

That &euro;10 per passenger charge pays for new terminals, new runways and additional services.  That is in place and is regulated by the economic regulator.  The additional charge that will fall on the DAA &ndash; I use that as an example because it has the greatest number of passengers &ndash; will fall into that regulatory assessment, which happens on a five year basis.  In the context of all the other costs associated with Dublin Airport this would be extremely marginal and therefore I would speculate that it will not have any material cost in the regulated economic decision but that is a matter for the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR.</p></speech>

The largest client or payer is likely to be the DAA, by virtue of it being the biggest aviation company in the State, and then it quickly drops off.  There are over 500 regulated entities.  We were just talking about their distribution.  Essentially, it is associated with what level of activity the IAA must carry out to ensure they comply with security regulations.</p> <p>  The other point ties in with what the Chairman asked about the view of some of the regulated entities on the charges.  The DAA and Aer Lingus had suggested that another layer of oversight by another regulator, an economic regulator, would apply.  That is an idea.  The Department's policy perspective is that the IAA is a stand alone, independent aviation regulator under EU law and we do not see the logic of a separate economic regulator overseeing that role.</p></speech>
