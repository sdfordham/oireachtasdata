He is accompanied by Ms Mary Henry.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Josepha Madigan and Alan Farrell.  Deputy Madigan has written to the committee to state she will not be continuing as a member of the committee and will be replaced by the D&aacute;il in due course.  Deputy Farrell has indicated that he expects to continue on the committee.  Until such time as they are replaced, both members will still be members of the committee.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meetings of 4, 5 and 6 July 2017.  They have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item are matters arising from the minutes.  There is nothing specific that is not on the agenda in front of us.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence.  Category A refers to correspondence for today's meeting.  Nos. 670 (i) and 670 (ii) are a briefing paper from Brendan Ryan, chief executive of the Courts Service and a briefing paper in respect of prosecutions for fixed charge notice motoring offences by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will be returning to that matter in the autumn.  We have indicated that as the complete report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not available at present, we are deferring detailed examination of that topic.  We have received an interim report that we can discuss.  We can discuss anything in front of us but as the final report has not been finalised, we will come back to it in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00300"><p>Very good.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00400"><p>The next items of correspondence are Nos. 671A (i) to 671A (iii), inclusive.  No. 671A is a covering email from the Garda Commissioner enclosing the interim report and the second interim report into the examination of the recording of breath tests.  That is the matter to which I have just referred and we will await the final report and will deal with the issue then.  In the meantime we can discuss the interim reports we have received.  We will note and publish them.</p><p>Category B correspondence refers to correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-ups to previous meetings.  Nos. 681B (i) to 681B (vi), inclusive, are items of correspondence  received on 10 July from Joe Nugent, chief administrative officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It includes a briefing note on Garda College income and expenditure, a Garda College restaurant profit-and-loss analytical review for 2009 to 2016, an analysis of expenditure for the Garda College division 2009 to 2016, a note in respect of Garda College restaurant funds transfers from 2010 to 2016, a note on correspondence relating to a previous voluntary disclosure settled with the Revenue Commissioners in 2010 and a note on an audit of EU-funded projects.  We will note those documents and they will be considered as part of our report, which we will launch next Tuesday.</p><p>The next items are Nos. 686 B, 690 B (i) and 690B (ii), correspondence from the HSE dated 11 July with follow-up information requested following the meeting of 15 June including further information requested by the committee in respect of the Grace case and data for 2017 in respect of patient referrals to hospital emergency departments by GPs.  </p><p>In respect of that letter from the HSE, all I can say is &quot;here we go again&quot;.  We were promised the Deloitte report time and time again and now we have been told it will be provided at some point after the summer break.  The letter goes on to say that the State Claims Agency: </p><blockquote>has confirmed that the final bill of costs relating to this specific case has not reached a final conclusion.  However, the [State Claims Agency] has clarified that interim payments totalling &euro;185,984.20 (which excludes settlement costs as per the High Court agreement) have been made.  </blockquote> <p>That is the only figure we have actually received and it excludes the High Court settlement costs.  We still have not seen the Deloitte report.  Mr. Tony O'Brien says that he will seek the permission of the commission of investigation to give us a copy when he receives it.  We will not get into a big debate.  We will send this letter to the commission but we are still gravely disappointed at this delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00500"><p>We have all followed up on this and it is extremely difficult to keep track of it.  We are now dealing with it under correspondence and trying to keep track.  We were clearly led to believe that this report would be published sooner than it was.  We still have no date in that regard.  It is totally unacceptable.  This was commissioned approximately a year ago.  This was a simple report on what money was given or not given.  This is adding insult to injury with regard to what has happened in the Grace case.  This is why we end up having inquiries.  This is honestly appalling.  It is a bit early in the morning to be so outraged.  We are having a tribunal because of the Grace case.  It would be easier to extract teeth without anaesthetic than to get this report.  I do not wish to personalise this, but we have asked repeatedly whether the staff were in the employ of the HSE and whether they had been promoted.  We have now found out that four of the five have been promoted.  It is extraordinary that, if not for the two whistleblowers whose lives have been seriously impacted upon, we would not even have an inquiry, not to mention that we would have not have questions here.  Mr. O'Brien should be brought back before this committee.  The man is on a very good salary, he is in charge of a huge body and he should be setting an example with candour.  This whole process from the HSE does not show candour.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00600"><p>We have to be conscious that there is a commission of investigation under way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00700"><p>I am more than conscious of that.  Sometimes I am too conscious of it and too cautious but this has nothing to do with the inquiry.  This is to do with Mr. O'Brien's role in giving open information.  He said the report was about to be published but it has not been.  It is simply not acceptable that a report of this nature is now taking even longer.  It is adding insult to injury.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00800"><p>The costs of the Deloitte report were mentioned in the High Court settlement.  We all understand that the lack of adequate payment for Grace's service provider financially compromised the organisation for a considerable period.  There is no mention here of whether the organisation has received any interim payment or how much that might be.  Even that information should have been included.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00900"><p>Not to mention that sufficient funding was not provided to the service provider into whose care Grace was put.  She had already suffered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01000"><p>I endorse everything Deputy Connolly has said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01100"><p>I wish to add that we need this report for all sorts of reasons but the director general failed to give a full apology to the service provider pending its outcome.  While it is very important that we get the report as soon as possible, he could have given an apology anyway.  It deserved an apology.  My understanding is that he gave a partial apology on foot of the High Court settlement but was waiting to decide whether he would give a full apology pending the outcome of this report.  He said categorically that it would be published very soon.  He led us to believe it would be released almost immediately.  Here we are, almost a month later, and there is still no report.  We have written over and back to him.  This is not the first time we have raised this.  We have raised it every week since he was before the committee.  How many times have we written to him?  Is this the only response we have received?  Is this the one and only piece of correspondence we have received?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01200"><p>We have followed up on this on several occasions.  At the end of this letter he does not even give an expected timeline as to when we might receive the report.  It has actually gone in reverse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01300"><p>That is not good enough.  It is treating the committee with contempt.  There is no doubt about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01400"><p>It is treating Grace with contempt in the first place, and the public after that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01500"><p>A potential cost of &euro;185,000 has been revealed and it could increase from there.</p><p>That was not even a High Court case.  It was a case that was settled, but it did not go into the courts.  It shows the type of money involved in the mismanagement of the whole Grace debacle.  Whatever is added on for a tribunal, when we think of the money that could be spent on services for people such as Grace it brings home that there are consequences to this, which are lost services for those who actually need them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#C00200"><p>We will write a stern letter to Mr. O'Brien, expressing the gross dissatisfaction of the committee at the reply and lack of timeline, and insisting he does whatever is necessary with Deloitte and his own organisation to ensure it is brought to an urgent conclusion.  We are going into recess.  We will note that unless we have it we will expect him before the committee in September.  If it is all concluded satisfactorily that will be fine, but if it is not we will put him on notice that commission or no commission this is a financial matter.  We are putting him on notice that if it is not fully resolved he will be here in September.  We will forward this to the commission also.</p> <p>  The next items are Nos. 692B and 693B, correspondence received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both letters are from Niall Kelly, head of internal audit, in which he is keeping the committee up to date on his audit work.  It states that two audits, on EU funded projects and on cash and general management in the Garda College restaurant and shop, have been sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General and that two further audits are in planning.  No. 695C is an explanation to the committee for the delay in getting the original letter of 5 July to us.  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot comment, but will he confirm he has received these two reports?</p></speech>

We will ask for a more up to date position.</p> <p>  No. 660C is a briefing paper prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which provides an overview of the current funding model for Irish Water.  It provides information on the role of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Commission for Energy Regulation on Irish Water.  On the same issue, No. 679C is from the managing director of Irish Water to advise that the information requested will be provided by 13 July 2017.  If that letter comes tomorrow, because it is from a public body I ask members to review it themselves.  The briefing note was from the Oireachtas library service and I am sure it has been widely circulated in the Oireachtas already.  People can comment on and use it.  The issue will come back on the agenda.  We will move on.</p> <p>  No. 666C, dated 6 June 2017, is from Michael Lyons, chief executive officer of Towards Healing, an external group which provides non-judgmental counselling to survivors of clerical, religious and institutional abuse, on Special Report No 69 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the child abuse inquiry.  The correspondence states information supplied by Caranua and statements made on 13 April 2017 are factually incorrect.  I propose we write to Caranua for a formal response.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

It is referring to a letter of 7 May that I could not find.  I am subject to being corrected.  I see a letter of 9 May 2017 with enclosures.  Here we are again.

Each and every one of us asked precise questions on rent and the cap on counselling as best we could.  Now we find the very organisation referred to by Caranua, namely, Towards Healing, is coming back to correct Caranua.  Imagine how difficult it is for the survivors using the services.

I propose to reply to Mr. Justice Cooke stating that we will ask the secretariat to review all material held by the committee and make any information not listed in the report available to the Commission.  I read that letter in detail.  It is from the Commission of Investigation into the National Asset Management Agency.  Mr. Justice Cooke is the judge who is conducting the investigation.  He has written a nice letter to the committee thanking it for its work and its willingness to co-operate and assist him in every way  possible.  He has indicated that he is obtaining all necessary information he can from NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General and that he is coming to the committee requesting to see if we have information that we received from bodies, other than those two sources, to identify and produce a list and forward it to the commission, which can then decide if it wants the information.  The commission has been very good in that it is not asking us to provide information that it can obtain from other sources.  Mr. Justice Cooke is going about the task in a very efficient manner.  We will co-operate fully.</p> <p>  No. 683C is correspondence, dated 6 July 201,7 from Dr. Michael Crowley alleging malfeasance and corruption in the health service.

I will write formally to the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Deering.  The issue is that a levy is payable to Horse Racing Ireland on the basis of the published fee that the owner of a mare pays for the services of a stallion.  The actual fee charged can regularly be significantly less than the published fee.  Should the levy be based on the published fee or the actual fee paid?  It is similar to asking a person who is buying a house to pay stamp duty on the listed price as opposed to the actual price.  If that is what the statutory instrument states, it makes no sense.  There are vested interests in the industry that are quite satisfied with the regime, but others are very dissatisfied.  It is strictly based on a statutory instrument introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the matter is 100% within the remit of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Due to the fact that it was done by statutory instrument and the public is paying fees based on this, however, I, as Chairman, was contacted.  I am sure other members of the committee have also been contacted.  We will write to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I had told the correspondent that we will do what we can at our committee.  We will not ignore the very valid point he makes.  If the statutory instrument does not stack up-----</p></speech>

It previously provided shared IT services for all the institutes of technology.  The functions of An Ch&eacute;im Computer Services Limited transferred to HEAnet, a HEA subsidiary, on 1 October 2015.  An Ch&eacute;im Computer Services Limited is in the process of being wound up.

The trust had accumulated reserves of &euro;16.1 million by the end of 2015.  We only touched on a sample of these the last day that we were here.

We do not want to launch it before lunch because the secretariat will be under a lot of pressure to get it done.  I will just explain this.  If we finish our wording today, the secretariat will have quite a lot of tidying up to do on it on Friday.  Final and legal proofreading will be completed over the weekend.

Very substantial issues have already emerged since we last had the HSE in to discuss Console, some that we have not even had a chance to look at.  At least three further issues have been raised in the meantime.  With so much public money going into these organisations, this is a massive issue that warrants a full examination by this committee.</p></speech>

We need not only to do an examination but to try to get to the root of this.  We need to establish what is necessary when it comes to oversight, good governance, tracking and so on.  We can go from one case to another lamenting their various failures but having already done a lot of high-profile, sometimes controversial, work, our job at this stage is to assist in the process of finding as adequate a solution as we can.</p> <p>  I want to raise the issue of nursing homes, something I have raised here before.  In fits and starts there have been question marks and controversies around various provisions and the fair deal scheme and so on.  We recently had a controversy over people being charged extras, sometimes in quite dubious situations, or so it would seem from the coverage.  This is an area we need to examine. It is a matter of public concern, not just because of the considerable sums of public money that are invested in these kinds of services, and rightly so, but also because we could be looking at a near parallel to the pay top-up business operating within the sector.  I suggest that we strongly consider addressing these issues in the autumn.</p></speech>

We are working on a number of items and it may be moot as to whether a report will issue.  There are some that I have already signalled to the committee.  The report on school transport is very near completion.  We are actually doing a piece of work on the fair deal scheme and its associated issues.  It may not touch on everything because some issues might not come within my scope.</p><p>Those would be ones that I would hope we will have in the autumn.  We will have a follow on report from the one on the timeliness of financial reporting.  I think that needs routine analysis and reporting to the committee so that we can give a push to get financial reporting done earlier.  I would expect that we will have that done for the autumn.

It was not listed on the correspondence because it was received only this morning.  The letter is from Mr. Joseph Nugent.  I will read it out because it has not been published.  It states:</p><blockquote>I know from coverage in the media in recent days and from information from the committee secretariat that the Public Accounts Committee may intend over the coming days to publish its report in relation to the examination of matters arising from the interim report of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na internal audit unit on financial procedures at the Garda college, Templemore.<br /><br />It would be appreciated if you confirm whether or not this is the case.  I note to date that no draft report has been received by the Commissioner from the committee in this regard.  I would be grateful for your confirmation that the committee intends to furnish the draft of its report in advance of publication in order that the Commissioner and other staff members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who may have an interest in the report be afforded the opportunity to address the draft report's findings.<br /><br />The recent media coverage also refers to additional material received by the committee, extracts of which have been published.  The Commissioner would be grateful if the committee would provide a copy of all such material received by it in order that it may be appropriately considered by the Commissioner and other Garda colleagues in conjunction with the committee's draft report.<br /><br />I look forward to an early response. </blockquote> <p>I will respond in public.  We will not discuss it in any detail.  We will not be supplying a copy of the draft interim report.  We issued a report just two days ago on third level education.  We did not supply it to the Department of Education and Skills, the HEA or any of the colleges concerned.  The reports are not about personal findings and the parliamentary legal adviser will make sure it is within the proper procedure from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would not be normal to issue it for discussion.  We will give them a draft report just immediately before the launch.</p><p>Second, I will ask the secretariat if we have received additional material that is being referred to in the letter, that did not come through the Commissioner's office.  It is surprising the Commissioner has not got it if it has come from senior officers, but in the event she has not, I think we will forward it to the Commissioner in any event.</p></speech>

I agree with the ruling of the Chair.  It is extraordinary to be handed this letter with this request.  It is no secret that this report will be published in the coming days or week.</p> <p>  Second, the letter makes reference to the media.  I have not seen anything in the media relating to any extracts from this report.  We have been very clear in how we have done our work on it.</p> <p>  Third, the letter is bizarre.  If one reads the letter, it is more or less requesting that we send to the Commissioner a copy of the documentation that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through their CEO have already sent us.  That is bizarre.  We can provide the documentation just to be sure but it seems strange that the Garda is sending us information that we requested and now we have to send it back out to it again.</p></speech>

We have said that will be the case.</p> <p>  My view of the letter is that it is a very defensive, in that I hope this will not be an excuse that there was unfair process.  We need to make it very clear that the process was fair.  It was the same process that we followed with the NAMA report, the Project Eagle report and subsequent reports.  I make this point in case it is put forward as a defence that there was an unfair process and that they were not given an opportunity to comment.</p></speech>

It does not say anything about content.  To be fair, the letter writer states that he notes from coverage that the report will be made.  On a general level, perhaps on the question of issuing the report, NAMA asked for a report and various other groups have asked for a report.  What needs to be clarified by the Chair is the procedure in regard to when we produce a report.  Any organisation is entitled to clarification on that issue.</p></speech>

I am sure there is a standard Oireachtas protocol on this.  I will ask that the standard protocol be circulated to members and we can include it in our press statement so that people will be aware.  There is an agreed protocol in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

The intention had been that we would have had a joint discussion with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service to discuss the collection of fines for the penalty points, but I have been informed that the report is not ready.  I understand there was no separate report on the breath tests.  There is a draft report in the system, which we may discuss, but it is not the final report.</p></speech>

Essentially, I want to agree a timetable from now, 10 a.m. until 1.30 p.m.  We have three and a half hours.  Should we allocate two hours for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, leave the interim report as there is an overlap with both organisations, and when the Garda are finished they are free to leave and we then move on to the Courts Service.  To summarise, we will allocate two hours to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and then we will decide how much time we are allocating to the interim report, so we will hold that off until the Courts Service come in and we will do 30 minutes or 40 minutes as the case may be.  We will then complete the meeting with the Courts Service, with a view to completing our work at approximately 1.30 p.m.</p></speech>

The breath tests affects the Courts Service.  We are dealing with two separate Votes today, first the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote, which we will deal with in the normal course of events in the first two hours.  We have a separate Courts Service Vote being dealt with by the Courts Service which we will deal with separately, but there is an item affecting both of them, which is the interim reports.  We will have a middle session where both organisation will be present.</p></speech>

This morning we will examine the 2015 appropriation accounts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I welcome back the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, who is accompanied today by some familiar faces, Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer, Mr. Michael Culhane, executive director of finance and services, Deputy Commissioner D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, governance and strategy, and Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn, roads policy and major events-emergency management.  We are also joined by Ken Ruane, Inspector Netta Browne and Superintendent Marie Broderick, and by John Burke from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to switch off their mobile phones completely.  Putting them on silent is not adequate.  They have to be on airplane mode as otherwise it will interfere with the recording system.  </p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, I will refer briefly to something.  This morning, we received a letter from Mr. Joseph Nugent to the committee dated 13 July inquiring about the publication of the report.  The arrangements are that we will finish our discussion here with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service before the voting block in the afternoon.  For the rest of the evening, the committee, in private session, will finalise our report on Templemore training college with a view to the report being launched next Tuesday at 2 o'clock.  As is normal in the Oireachtas, draft reports are not circulated.  It will go through the normal Oireachtas procedure.  That procedure does not involve issuing a draft report for comment.  The report will be issued in the same way as the education report two days ago.  We did not send a copy to the Higher Education Authority or the colleges concerned.  We issued the report on the day.  That is the normal procedure.  </p><p>There is a reference in the letter this morning which states: &quot;The recent media coverage also refers to additional material received by the Committee, extracts of which appear to have been published.&quot;  It may not have been by us.  We do not know the source of the publication.  It continues: &quot;The Commissioner would be grateful if the Committee would provide a copy of all such material received by it in order that it may be appropriately considered by the Commissioner and any other Garda colleagues in conjunction with the Committee's [draft] report.&quot;  If there is something we have received that has not come directly through Joseph Nugent or the Commissioner's office, we will of course arrange to send a copy of it in the event she does not have it already.  We will do that straight away.  I am just putting that on the record.  The report is expected to be launched next Tuesday at 2 o'clock.</p><p>I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

Approximately 300 members retire from the organisation each year.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has received Government approval to increase the overall strength to 21,000 personnel by 2021.  This will include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilian members.  At present, approximately 2,000 civilians in the organisation carry out senior management, administrative and technical roles.  The figure of 4,000 civilian members represents a target of 20% civilians over the next five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently has approximately 14% civilian staff members.  The increase will bring us into line with international norms and ensure that sworn policemen and women are available for and utilised in all operational areas, a commitment we are determined to achieve.  The Government approved an increase in civilian numbers by 500 in 2017 and recruitment for the first batch of this number has commenced.  We are determined to ensure that happens by the end of this year.</p> <p>  A new Garda recruitment competition was announced on 11 May 2017 with a closing date of 1 June 2017.  The competition had three streams: a main stream; a fluency-in-Irish stream; and a Garda Reserve stream.  The total of 5,300 applicants compares to 5,600 for the previous competition.  A new Garda Reserve recruitment competition was also announced on 23 March 2017.  A total of 2,394 applications were received with 1,593 applicants successfully passing the initial stage.  Interviews for this competition are ongoing and 600 have been held to date.</p> <p>  Pursuant to section 19(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in October 2006 the Garda Commissioner became the appropriate authority for civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Simultaneously, a dedicated civilian human resources directorate was established to support the office of the Commissioner in discharging this new statutory responsibility and to drive forward the implementation of the civilianisation programme.  Civilian members are employed in a wide range of management, administrative and technical duties.  Administrative support duties in Garda stations and offices has enabled the establishment of the expansion of some vital services that are wholly or largely provided by civilian members, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Garda information service centre in Castlebar, the Garda central vetting unit in Thurles, the fixed charge processing office and the call-taking function in the command and control centre along with immigration control officers in Dublin Airport.  As part of the engagement of additional civilian members it is proposed that a considerable number will be deployed to release Garda members to operational policing roles.  In 2017, it is expected that more than 100 Garda members will return to operational roles through this process.</p> <p>  The 2015 budget for the Garda Vote amounts to &euro;1.35 billion.  The original budget was increased by &euro;35.2 million and a surplus of &euro;1.85 million is liable for surrender to the Exchequer.  The original budget was increased in the Supplementary Estimate due to the payment of allowances and overtime for an extra roster period that fell due in 2015, in addition to the policing of the visit of the Prince of Wales and the implementation of Operation Thor that commenced on 2 November 2015.</p> <p>  In addition, funding requirements in a number of subheads increased.  The information and communications technology subhead increased for the maintenance and implementation of critical IT systems and for capital funding for the major investigations management system, known as MIMS.</p> <p>  The modernisation and renewal programme was launched on 9 June 2016, incorporating a range of initiatives to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet present and future challenges.  The programme has been formed based on recommendations made in 44 reports into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including all 11 reports of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.</p> <p>  Internal and external reports developed over the preceding ten years were taken into consideration as well as extended periods of consultation, workshops and focus groups with senior management within the organisation and with communities throughout the country.  To deliver on this programme I have established a strategic transformation office that is responsible for implementing these recommendations and working closely with the Policing Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to ensure key recommendations are addressed.  The new commission on policing will play a role in this as well.  We have recently recruited a civilian executive director for strategic transformation with the assistance of the Policing Authority.</p> <p>  An under-spend of &euro;32.2 million in 2015 arose in the capital building programme for three new divisional headquarters due to the timing of contracts and payments.  The under-spend resulted in a decrease in the original budget by &euro;25.4 million in the Supplementary Estimate.  This was utilised to fund additional capital requirements for ICT, Garda vehicles and aircraft.  The remaining &euro;6.644 million was carried forward to 2016 under the capital carry-forward provisions.</p> <p>  The issue of accommodation presents a risk to the organisation's ability to effectively assimilate the increased Garda and civilian resources approved by Government.  We are working closely with colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Public Works to address these matters.</p> <p>  The programme for a partnership Government recognises that garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary: to prevent, detect and investigate crimes; to provide a security service to the State; and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24-7 basis.  Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.  My team and I are available to take whatever questions committee members might wish to raise.</p></speech>

B'fh&eacute;idir go dtiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais go dt&iacute; an ceist seo.</p> <p>  In regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na report for 2015, a number of matters were identified.  One matter related to procurement, to which I will return later, and two significant financial risks were identified.  The audit of the Garda College is a matter for another day and I will leave it; all I will say on it is that a caution was put in and we have dealt with it.  It is stated that there were a number of issues associated as set out.  The Commissioner said they were not in compliance with current public standard corporate governance procedures.  I have asked her previously and I ask her again if she would accept, on reflection, that they were not in compliance with the standards at the time with all of the information that we have now?</p></speech>

Obviously, what we have said is that they are not in compliance with standards.  There is no issue that we accept that they were not in compliance with standards back then, but we have dealt with that in detail at previous committee meetings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#J00400"><p>These are the official accounts and this is the caveat that was put in.  It was put in with respect to the current financial matters, which always concerned me.  If the Commissioner is accepting that they are certainly not in compliance with current standards, then they also were not in compliance with the standards that were there previously.</p></speech>

The Commissioner has identified that as a significant financial risk.  I read the O'Higgins report of last year in detail.  One of the items that jumped out of it, to cite one example, was the computer that went missing in the Fr. Molloy case.  There are serious issues involved.  That is one example that sticks in my mind.  Can the Commissioner take me through this?  Was there an audit in regard to these matters?</p></speech>

There have been several audits and part of the internal audit process conducted by Mr. Kelly identified - on a recurring basis, and that is why we identified it as a key risk - ongoing and continued weaknesses with property and exhibit management storage.  However, we have implemented a number of measures to address those issues, particularly around the property and exhibit management stores.  From an accommodation point of view, we have a programme of work to make sure that there are stores in every Garda division.  They are being implemented and rolled out across-----</p></speech>

That can come from a number of different categories.  We would have property, for example, that is found or retrieved during searches.  We would also have property which becomes evidence in prosecutions and property that has been found and handed in by a passer-by.</p></speech>

What has happened?  The Commissioner has said there were inadequate premises and inadequate storage facilities.  Are there other problems?</p></speech>

There are two aspects that we are addressing.  Again, historically, what has happened is that the activities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have increased significantly over the years.  Our successes speak for themselves in terms of seizure of property during searches and during specific policing and security operations.  That property comes into the possession of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Likewise, much more property is being retrieved.  For example, the Deputy will have seen over the years that we have conducted a number of events where a good deal of effort has been put into trying to reunite property that has come into our possession, whether by searches or otherwise, with its owners..  For example, around the country particularly-----</p></speech>

What I am more interested in, and the more serious issue, is evidence that is taken and held in regard to court cases.  I notice that this has been prioritised in the strategic transformation programme.</p></speech>

We now have in almost every division in the country a dedicated property and exhibit management PEM, store.  Because they were built in recent years we have been able to build them to a much higher specification, for example, in regard to the storage temperature and all of that.  This is available in all but three divisions but all divisions have dedicated storage facilities.  A dedicated store manager is assigned to them, which means there is one way in and one way out for property.  A dedicated IT solution has been put in place to support the tracking of that property once it comes into the possession of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The next phase of the development will mean that at the end of next month a state-of-the-art custom built IT solution will be put in around that for all divisions.  A few parallel developments are happening.  There is ICT, the physical infrastructure and the policy around that, and the resourcing from the point of view of having dedicated staff dealing with property coming in and out.</p></speech>

There were 73 contracts.  In terms of the high level of non-compliance with procurement regulations, which the witnesses have noted, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na complied with the guidelines with the exception of 73 contracts to the value of over &euro;11 million.

For the maintenance of those systems, obviously we have to use those companies to maintain those systems.  In that case, we would not necessarily undertake a procurement procedure because there is only one supplier for the system.  There is a large range of other services, for example, the towing of cars involved in road traffic accidents.  I mentioned medical services, which is an expenditure of over &euro;2 million.  That is now in place.  We have worked with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and the Health Services Executive.  It has put a contract in place, so that will address that in its entirety.  There is an active programme to address these issues.  It is in terms of resources, but also it is the nature of the items included.  Some are proprietary, and they will continue to be priority.  While we will address as many of the gaps as possible, there will continue to be proprietary items which will continue to feature in 40/02.</p></speech>

We get information from the witnesses and from the Comptroller and Auditor General telling us about non-procurement.  It is a duty, an obligation and a regulation, and then I get a general answer.  I would like to know the steps involved.  Has it been reduced?  What is the target for next year?  That is all the members of this committee want to know because there are huge implications for non-compliance.  It does not instill confidence in local businesses that the procurement rules can be relied on.  There are huge implications in terms of trust, particularly from the Garda again, but it is not just the Garda; it is every organisation.  I would expect that if we are all here next year, or whoever is here, this would have reduced significantly and that Mr. Culhane would be saying: "This is totally unacceptable.  We cannot have this level of non-compliance and we will reduce it to the bare necessities in an emergency".  That is the answer I would expect.</p></speech>

I mentioned the medical services contract, for example.  That is &euro;2 million.  That will disappear from the 40/02 list.  The Deputy can see that there is an active programme.  In terms of the towing contracts, we have contracts in most divisions and we expect that we will have that completed this year.  We will remove substantial items from that list.  There is an active programme in place and there is a dedicated procurement section in Garda headquarters which is addressing this matter.</p></speech>

At the end of 2016, we got a Supplementary Estimate which included &euro;4 million for the Schengen system.  That allowed us to sign the contract and then make an additional payment of &euro;4 million.  As part of the funding for the Schengen system, that is included in the mid-term capital review.  We are seeking the balance in terms of the funding required to complete the system.</p></speech>

Obviously, there are a number of demands on the organisation, not least - as we mentioned in the opening statement -  of which is the implementation of Operation Thor, which was a response to a surge in property crime throughout the country.  It has led to or the return on investment demonstrates an over 35% decrease in property crime, in particular, and burglaries.  That is a very significant decrease.  Also, in terms of the gangland feud, one would have seen right around the country a number of hybrid patrols where we have both armed and unarmed members patrolling together.  All of those operational demands are very resource intensive.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will have seen, one of the criticisms we have received is that we are insular and defensive.  Some of the inspectorate reports quite rightly raised the fact we need to speak more openly to the media.

This week, Michael O'Sullivan and I met the company.  It will have 22 people looking at this.  It will do it over a number of weeks.  That will be a continuation of the work undertaken by Michael O'Sullivan.  We are looking at a system that goes back.  I can have my colleague, Michael Finn, who is in charge of roads policing, explain in detail what we are looking at and the number of records.  The records go way back over a number of years - all the way back to 2005.  It is hugely time consuming to examine all the records and collate all the information that is available.  I think Michael O'Sullivan in his updated position report outlines that he will be finished by the end of July.</p></speech>

That was all I needed to know.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na first became aware in late 2015.

We have two interim reports that do not reveal much.</p><p>All they say is that certain areas need to be examined and information needs to be gathered and so on, but we have no concrete answers yet.  We were hoping we would be able to discuss this today but we are not in a position to do so.  I find it unacceptable that it is the case.  We should have had that report for this meeting.  Would the Commissioner forgive us for being cynical about that and for thinking there are potentially other motives for why that report was not completed?  Surely it is the Commissioner's job to make sure appropriate resources are given to any examination of this nature.  It is something that is very serious for her organisation.  I would have imagined she would have made sure they have all the resources they need to do their work and to conclude it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The work is continuing by Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan.  He was given six months in which to complete the work.  As the committee will see, he has indicated in his updated position report that his work will be completed by the end of July which is ahead of schedule.  As I have said, the Policing Authority has also taken an interest in this and quite rightly so.  It has appointed an external company and of course we will be assisting it fully.  This is happening in full openness and full transparency.  The resources that are required to be given to it are being given to it.

When the Commissioner is correcting the record, she should at least listen to what people say because I never used the word "sinister".  I think it is reasonable for me to put to the Commissioner that she and her organisation found out about this in late-2015.  We are in the middle of 2017 and she is still not in a position, as the head of the organisation and its Accounting Officer, to tell us what happened.  That is the point I am making.  I will give an example of why I am frustrated.</p> <p>  I am looking at the two interim reports.  There is an issue which - pardon the pun - is breathtaking for me.  I cannot understand how the information on the Dr&auml;ger equipment and specifically procurement is still not available to us.  Information on the number purchased and the number distributed to the various divisions compared with the number of breath tests recorded on PULSE is not available.  The same issue is referenced in the interim report of 26 June 2017.  It lists under the heading of issues to be dealt with and information sought the national Dr&auml;ger audit to acquire the most accurate figure for the number of breath tests recorded on the Dr&auml;ger machines and also the number that were procured.  How is it not possible to provide us with that information?  It seems to me to concern basic purchasing of equipment.  The Garda purchases and pays for a set number of mouthpieces and equipment and then a set number is used.  Perhaps the Commissioner is in a position today to give us that information but up to now she has not been.  Questions were asked about procurement earlier.  Does the Commissioner have that information to hand today?</p></speech>

My understanding is that on the PULSE system the number of recorded tests from October 2011 to December 2016 was 1,996,365.  On the Medical Bureau of Road Safety's figures, it was 1,058,157.  Mr. Finn should be in a position to tell me today in that period from October 2011 to December 2016, were there 1,996,365 mouthpieces?</p></speech>

There is basic purchasing involved here.  Either there were 1,996,365 mouthpieces or not.  It is incredible we still do not have that information.  I find it incredible.  I want the Commissioner or Mr. Finn, if he is more aware, to talk me through how this works.  How does the mandatory breath testing work from when the vehicle leaves the station?  Before it leaves the station, what does it do?  Does a garda have to go and get a set number of these mouthpieces?  How are they signed for?  How are they recorded?  Will the Commissioner or Mr. Finn talk me through that process so I have a better understanding?</p></speech>

Let us consider the ongoing review.  Let us imagine that Mr. McCarthy here, for example, were to hypothetically be caught speeding and get a fixed notice.  I am taking him as an example here because he is our independent witness.  He would fill out the form and put down his credit card details.  Let us say, however, that he makes a genuine error and puts his name or credit card number in the wrong place.  Everything on the form is accurate but on the wrong line.  What would happen after something like that?   I assume that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would send him another notice telling him that he has made an error and has to fix it.

I know of a number of people concerned who claim that they did not get such a letter.  I would like to know that this is being reviewed as part of the current process, that such cases do not go straight to court, and that the second notices were indeed issued.  Anyone could make a genuine error, I do it myself.  A person is rushing and makes a mistake in filling out a form.  People deserve the chance to fix such errors but I am concerned that some people are saying they never had such a chance.  I do not think it is the fault of the office in Thurles, as it is possible that some forms never reached them.  Is Mr. Finn certain that every form definitely did?  As part of the ongoing process, can he please make sure that there are checks and balances in place to make sure that the forms get back to Thurles and that the scenarios I mention do not happen.</p></speech>

There is a certain timing involved in this.  We would normally pay over the money at the end of a month.  It is a question of how much money is in the account at the time.  The Deputy mentioned that there was &euro;217,000 which then rose to &euro;1 million.  That merely reflects the timing of the payment to the central Exchequer.  Given the timing, at the end of the financial year, it seems that the amount had accumulated.  It would have been paid over in January.</p></speech>

I presume that properties were not put on the market if there was any prospect of their being re-opened.  What dialogue took place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality regarding the Garda stations to be sold?  Some of the stations were sold for very little because at the time of sale the property market was at its lowest.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now has to purchase new accommodation to meet additional intake.  I would have expected there to have been an element of future-proofing on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of the sale of Garda stations.

The challenge I referred to in my opening statement relates to what the Deputy is talking about, namely, future-proofing.  The Government has committed to increasing the strength of the organisation to 21,000, which we very much welcome and I believe will benefit the citizens of the State hugely, but this poses challenges in terms of future-proofing the accommodation requirements.  The building programme under way provides for the opening this year of three significant headquarters in Galway, Wexford and Kevin Street in Dublin.  These will be prototypes for future Garda stations.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the current estate, which we inherited, is old and archaic.

Fines paid through An Post are paid to the office in Thurles and the money is then transferred to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  In regard to warrants, where a person is due in court in respect of non-payment of a fine and he or she does not turn up a warrant is issued.  The warrant is issued through a local Garda division and district and it is tracked in terms of payment or otherwise.  The court will have a record of what occurred.  If the money is paid through the court it can then verify which warrants came back to it unpaid, paid, non-executed or cancelled.

This is a familiar scenario for all of us now.  Like other speakers, I have a number of questions for the witnesses and so I would appreciate brevity in their responses.  Some of the questions can be answered with a "Yes" or "No".  I want to cover a range of topics.</p> <p>  I share the frustration of colleagues, in particular Deputy Cullinane, that as of yet we are awaiting the data and information we could rightfully expect an organisation such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to produce very quickly.  I am alarmed to note from the interim reports that in terms of the continuous professional development of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it appears there was, and perhaps is, no specific training for officers in respect of manning these stations and taking these tests.  I find that extraordinary.  I think it is extraordinary from the point of view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and extraordinary that its parent Department would not ask questions and demand evidence that such basic professional formation is in place.  I am not asking for a response in this regard because these matters I am assuming will be matters for another day.  I say that only for the purpose of putting it on the record.</p> <p>  Did the Commissioner recommend the re-opening of Stepaside Garda station to the Government?</p></speech>

If I take, for example, my colleagues and I appearing as witnesses at the Committee of Public Accounts, I am not suggesting that I want to separate the two issues entirely but obviously there are witnesses who appear before, for example, committees or courts and different witnesses have different accounts of matters.  Some people have a direct evidence account of matters and some have a hearsay account of matters.  It is important that the court, the Committee of Public Accounts or any other committee hears all of the evidence in a fair and balanced way.  I am not going to second guess here the conduct of the court.  What I am saying is that from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's perspective, to bring it back to the Jobstown issue, it is important that, as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we are always told professionally to treat witnesses in a fair and reasonable manner-----</p></speech>

I will put it in context.  The force has a spend of &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;1 billion of that is on wages, so the focus is on the human element or human capital of where those garda&iacute; will be deployed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned this earlier.  Is the focus specifically on urban areas or is there a focus on rural areas as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Nugent" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#T01000"><p>It is urban and rural areas.  I will give a practical example.  We have a pilot process in four divisions around the country where we are looking at the manner in which those administrative services are being provided with a view to lifting them from district to divisional level.  The divisions are in Mayo, Galway and Cork, as well as in Dublin.  Our focus is countrywide to examine what is the right deployment model for civilian members in administrative roles in the different types of divisional structures.</p></speech>

There has been much discussion this morning on ICT and the divisional headquarters being built.  I pass Kevin Street every morning and it is quite an impressive building.  However, the issue is what people do in that building.  People listening to this discussion are interested in the Garda's style of policing and what that means.  I have attended all the JPC meetings in my home county for over a decade both as a councillor and as a Deputy.  There is a fear among the community.  The Garda Commissioner might think it is only a perceived fear but it is a real fear.  If there was not a fear about policing and crime, the 2,000 people who went to the meeting of the Paul Williams roadshow in Thurles and the 2,000 people who attended the meeting in Trim, in my home county, would not have gone to those meetings.  My question is about the style of policing.  Is it one in which the Garda Commissioner wishes to see the deployment of garda&iacute; on the street?  There is a big fear of anti-social behaviour and attacks on people.</p></speech>

Earlier, I spoke about our communications strategy and making sure we get messages across.  However, the important issue is having people on the street.</p></speech>

That is to ensure that sworn garda&iacute; are out engaging with the community and providing that level of reassurance.  In terms of the additional recruitment of members, as I said earlier 198 new members last week went to stations all over the country.  By the end of this year we will have 400 additional new members going to the stations.  The reassurance of having boots on the street, so to speak, and having garda&iacute; out engaging with the community is palpable and is having an effect.  That is something we will have to continue-----</p></speech>

It is the biggest issue in my county at present.  One could see that from the front pages of the tabloid newspapers last week and from the Joe Duffy show.  Following a very serious incident the front cover of my local newspaper referred to crime in Meath being out of control.  A shopkeeper was beaten around the head with a glass vase by thugs.  The Mayor of Navan, Councillor Tommy Reilly, who is 73 years of age, had to intervene to save his son in that incident.  What is shocking is that a Garda car arrived at the scene, spoke to the thugs and then drove off.  It sparked a national debate on the front covers of all the national newspapers and on the Joe Duffy show.  It is a sad state of affairs for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it takes the Joe Duffy show, apparently, to solve matters.  The Garda Commissioner says there is a palpable sense of people feeling confident but not in my county or my town.  A 73 year old man, the Mayor of Navan, had to intervene to save his son.  The garda&iacute; are not there.  There are no boots on the ground.  We do not see it.  The context of me putting this question is that the Garda has a spend of &euro;1.5 billion, of which &euro;1 billion goes on wages.  The people listening to this want to hear if the garda&iacute; are on the ground doing their job.</p></speech>

I extend my sympathies to the individuals the Deputy referred to and obviously it is a matter we are examining.  Since recruitment commenced, 36 new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have gone to the Meath division.  That does not take account of the consequential transfers.  As the Deputy knows, there are always people looking go to Meath division-----</p></speech>

That is the reason we welcome the Government's commitment to increasing the overall strength of the garda members of the organisation to 15,000.  Allowing for an average of 300 retirements per year, that will take time.  We very much welcome that by the end of this year we will have 800 new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we welcome the commitment to that.  We cannot distribute everybody at the same time.  We have a plan or distribution model where we try to factor in retirements, and I realise it has become an issue in Deputy Catherine Murphy's constituency, crime demands and population demands.</p></speech>

That incident proves it is not the reality.  Garda&iacute; are on my local radio station every week detailing the crime.  There is little point in only telling the people about the crime that has occurred when there is no follow-up.  Has the Garda Commissioner got a plan whereby she instructs her chief superintendents with regard to how many people are getting back to that basic element of policing?  My question is about the style of policing.  I acknowledge that policing has changed and that intricate work has to be done with regard to drugs and so forth.  However, people are afraid about that basic element of policing, namely, people staving off these thugs who appear to control towns such as Navan, Mullingar and Thurles.  They are allowed to wander the streets and not be challenged by the force that is supposed to be protecting people.  Why is it that a mother who walks down the streets of my home town of Navan is afraid?  These thugs seem to think that they own the streets.  They can beat a guy around the head with a glass vase and when the garda&iacute; arrive they have a chat with them and then drive off.  It took the Joe Duffy show to implement the arrests.  That is crazy.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the style of policing.  There is an assistant commissioner in charge of the eastern region, a chief superintendent in charge of the Meath division and a local superintendent in the various districts in the Meath division, including in Trim.  They are responsible for delivering local, responsive policing.  When issues such as the one the Deputy identified arise, they are the people with responsibility and accountability for ensuring that the measures are in place.  Our responsibility is to ensure that we equip them.  On top of that-----</p></speech>

That is the point of my question.</p></speech>

The Garda Commissioner spoke to Deputies Kelly and MacSharry about the money being spent on PR and making sure that the Garda is not insular.  However, the journalists in these counties are capturing the public attitude.  Paul Williams is doing so on his roadshow.  Is the Garda gathering that information and directing the type of policing that assuages that and gets these guys so they do not feel they control our streets, given the spend of &euro;1 billion on wages?</p></speech>

More importantly, part of it is a number of the initiatives we have in place, particularly public safety initiatives such as Operation Thor.</p><p>We can provide for the committee, if the Chairman wishes, details of the successes of Operation Thor since it was implemented and the high visibility for which it provides to make sure we provide that reassurance for the community.  One crime is one too many, but, unfortunately, as I said, we live in a society in which crime is a reality, as it is in all societies.  However, we strive to reduce it as much as we possibly can.</p></speech>

Again, in my area members of the traffic corps were taken from north Meath and redeployed in south Meath, which means that one part of the county has been left without an available traffic corps.  I do not want the witnesses to focus on County Meath, but is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na trying to increase services nationwide or just strip an already stretched service?</p></speech>

It was scattered all over the place and for the moment we have brought it back into one centre.  We are putting extra people into traffic policing there, but we need a level of supervision and having the traffic corps scattered all over the place was probably not the most effective way to achieve this.  I am aware, from talking to the chief superintendent in County Meath, that he has consolidated the traffic corps in one location.  However, as we are providing for more supervision and more people there, he will have a bigger traffic corps by the end of the year.</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to take away from the meeting the fact that journalists in my county are capturing the attitude of the public.

I have a time limit.  Most members took perhaps 12 minutes instead of the ten allocated to them.  In one session members took up to 20 minutes instead of ten.  That was because of the debate on what had happened at Jobstown.  Because the event happened in 2015, was relevant to the deployment of Garda resources and staffing and directly related to the vote today, I let the debate continue.  Others might question why we had a debate on what had happened at Jobstown, but it was an event in 2015 and we are here to examine the level of Garda resources in that year.  That is why I allowed the debate to continue.  We will proceed with five-minute slots.  Deputies Catherine Connolly, David Cullinane-----</p></speech>

I wish to go back to the matter with Mr. Culhane and the Commissioner.  I would prefer if, say, in Galway local suppliers could be favoured, but, obviously, they have to comply with the procurement rules.  However, what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seems to be doing, inadvertently or otherwise, is allowing some suppliers to get contracts because of non-compliance with the procurement rules.  Is that not right?  I see the supply of vegetables and so on listed: "Peters Fruit &amp;amp; Veg - Catering [...] Tender in progress."</p></speech>

I am inexperienced in this area, but when I look at the list, I see there are procurement rules.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's procurement non-compliance rate is approximately 10%, for which the witnesses have given us the reasons of security and sometimes urgency, but there is no such evidence for a lot of the items.  While I accept that sometimes it has to be done, why would it have to be done in the supply of fruit and vegetables?</p></speech>

On the Deputy's point about local catering, if there is an event - for example, Prince Charles visited in 2015 - there will be a requirement for catering to support that activity.  That could have been the source of the particular item.</p></speech>

The witnesses have given me a list.  Non-compliance in the case of 73 items is unacceptable.  This has been the case previously and I would have expected the level of non-compliance to decrease to a small number of items and cases of non-compliance to be accounted for in emergency conditions.</p></speech>

Mr. Culhane has said that.  Something in which I am particularly interested is the victim service offices.  There is a victims directive; a Bill is in progress in that regard and the Commissioner mentioned the provision of specific offices.  Will she update me on the position throughout the country?</p></speech>

We have 28 divisions throughout the country.  In every division we have set up a victim service office which is staffed - this speaks to Deputy Shane Cassells' question about the roles of civilians - by both a garda and a civilian member who are trained.  We have had a lot of input from victims' advocacy groups and support services in terms of the training provided, which we very much welcome.  We have also set up a national protective services bureau and are in the process of rolling out the implementation of divisional protective services bureaux to support more vulnerable victims.  This means that a victim can come into a Garda station, to the victims service office, which provides a link.  One of the pieces of feedback we have received from victims during the years is that, because of the roster system under which garda&iacute; are employed, a victim may not always be able to obtain an update on his or her case or may not always be able to get in touch with the local garda.  The victim service office has all of the details and, particularly in the light of the victims directive and the right of a victim to be kept updated, will provide them constantly.</p></speech>

It may very well be  1 million is incorrect and that the discrepancy is not as significant as we thought at the time, but the information that we revealed to the public at the press conference was that we had discovered this and have a big hole here, and while we do not know why there is a big hole, we are not happy with it and we are taking our figures-----</p></speech>

They reference errors, inconsistences and so on, and they look at systems failures, data gathering and such.  There is very little reference to the failure of management or oversight.  Somebody is responsible for making sure that something as serious as a mandatory alcohol-testing initiative is done right.  Somebody has to be held accountable for that.  Mr. Finn and the Commissioner will be aware that if it is the case that the inconsistences are as great as has been reported, that has huge implications with regard to policy.  As they know, policy is set based on data given to the Government and to the Department.  If the data is massively incorrect, it has serious implications for policy responses.  I am trying to understand why very little attention is given in any of the interim reports that I have read to management culpability or examination of management - including Mr. Finn's predecessors.</p></speech>

There are management responsibilities here.  When this matter came to light, we brought together all of the assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents from all over the country to emphasise and re-emphasise to them their responsibility and accountability on these matters.  That has been made very clear.</p></speech>

That has to be done, because Mr. Finn is right that, if there is a problem, it has to be corrected.  I do not see the same level of urgency or attention being given to management failures, and people being held to account for what happened.  It does not scream from the pages from what I have seen and that concerns me.  What level of scrutiny, examination and investigation is there ongoing with regard to potential management failures?  Things do not always happen by accident.  It may well be an accident but I would surmise that, in this case, it is possibly not.  If it was not an accident, somebody is responsible for the system failure and people have to be held to account.  Is that part of that ongoing work?</p></speech>

Deputy McDonald asked them to provide us with the interim report up to now.  The witnesses spoke about the CSO and making a decision about where stations will be opened and deployment of staff.  I looked at the census from 1996 to 2006 to see where the big changes occurred.  Dublin city grew by 13%, D&uacute;n Laoghaire grew by 13%, south Dublin grew by 22%, Fingal by 43%, Meath by 44% and Kildare by 39%.  Kildare, Meath and Fingal make up the area that has seen huge growth.  There has not been a parallel increase.  I know that is not the only measurement because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na looks at crime statistics and a range of other things.  On a <i>per capita</i>basis, the lowest rate of garda&iacute; to population is found in Kildare followed by Meath and places like Wexford.  If there are to be deployment and transfers, will they be on the basis of matching the population growth and crime statistics?  What metrics will An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na use?  It has never been the case that this has played a whole part in this up to now.  For the past ten or 12 years, I have engaged with various assistant commissioners about the deployment of resources because they have never matched population growth.  It is part of the reason Deputy Cassells is so frustrated because the same pattern occurs in areas with very high growth.  I would have thought that the full opening of Celbridge Garda Station, which opens on a part-time basis, would have come in ahead of Stepaside Garda Station given the population increase.</p></speech>

I will happily share this information with the committee so members can see where people have been deployed.  That only relates to new trainees.</p></speech>

I have provided a chart which gives a high level breakdown of the expenditure.  As indicated in the chart, expenditure on pay was around &euro;49 million.  At year end 2015, a total of 948 full-time equivalent staff were employed in the Courts Service.  Members should note this pay figure does not include the salaries or pensions of judges.  Those are paid directly from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, and are estimated at around &euro;32 million for 2015.</p> <p>  The Courts Service incurred expenditure of &euro;20 million in 2015 in costs associated with the Criminal Courts of Justice building, which came into use in 2009 under a 25 year public private partnership arrangement.  The annual outlay includes elements of both acquisition costs and premises running costs, which over the life of the PPP are projected to be of the order of &euro;600 million.</p> <p>  The service has also been engaged for a number of years in progressing other PPP projects for the construction or refurbishment of courthouses.  Costs of &euro;1.9 million in 2015 associated with developing those projects are included in the spending of &euro;4.6 million incurred on courthouse capital works.</p><p>Appropriation-in-aid of the Vote expenditure totalled &euro;48 million, of which &euro;44 million was court fees revenue.  In addition, court-imposed fines totalling &euro;11 million were received and paid over to the Exchequer and around &euro;6.6 million in fines and excise fees was collected by the Courts Service and paid over to the Revenue Commissioners.  At the end of 2015, an unspent amount of &euro;1.14 million was liable for surrender from Vote 22 back to the Exchequer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.899" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#Y00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee in my capacity as Accounting Officer for the Courts Service, Vote 22, and I look forward to discussing any aspect of the Vote with him and the members of the committee.  I am pleased to report that a clean audit report has been provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 2015 appropriation account.  Overall, the Vote was managed successfully and within budget at year end.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, a surrender balance of &euro;1,135,706 was recorded on the Vote.</p> <p>  The Courts Service is responsible for the management and administration of the courts.  As the committee is aware, the administration of justice is a matter for the Judiciary and, in accordance with the constitutional independence of the Judiciary and the provisions of the Courts Service Act, is outside the scope of the functions of the Courts Service.  The committee will appreciate, therefore, that in my discussions with it today I am precluded from commenting on any matter relating to the exercise by a judge of his or her judicial functions or on any matter relating to the exercise of quasi-judicial functions by an officer of the court.  I am also, of course, precluded from commenting on matters of Government policy.</p> <p>  Since establishment, the Courts Service has worked to ensure the courts operate effectively and efficiently, that the use of available resources is optimised, that value for money is achieved, and the best possible service is provided to court users.  Since the Vote was last considered by the committee in 2014, the Courts Service, in common with other Departments and agencies, has seen a very welcome easing in the severe reduction in funding and staff numbers of previous years.  Using the resources available to us, the Courts Service continues to work with the Judiciary to introduce a broad range of changes and reforms, which yield significant savings for the Exchequer while maintaining access to justice and services for the public.  The service has diligently cut expenditure and has robust financial measures in place across the organisation to ensure expenditure is kept to a minimum and is incurred only where it is necessary and unavoidable, and that value for money is achieved.  We have also, through proactive management, increased court fees, thus reducing significantly the cost to the Exchequer of running the courts.</p> <p>  The Courts Service was established to support the courts in the administration of justice.  This is a unique role supporting the third branch of Government.  An effective courts system is critical to a functioning modern society.  As our society continues to evolve, it places many demands on our institutions, including the courts, and we operate in an increasingly complex environment that has seen considerable change and diversity in the economic, social, demographic and cultural landscape.  There are increasing levels of litigation, increased complexity in legislation, greater court user expectations and ongoing technological advances which pose challenges and opportunities.  To ensure it continues to fulfil its remit, the Courts Service must continue to adapt and evolve, responding proactively to promote access to justice and provide the necessary support for the Judiciary and the administration of justice generally.</p> <p>  The Courts Service has had a modernising agenda since its establishment in 1999.  In recent years, we have been successful in introducing a range of transformational changes which have delivered significant savings and benefits to court users.  The programme of structural, organisational and procedural reform, which continued during the economic downturn, introduced a range of efficiency and productivity measures across all aspects of the Court Service.  This programme of reform ensured that despite the severe reductions in staff numbers and funding, the Courts Service was able to continue to support the courts in a challenging operating environment, which included year-on-year increases in court sittings, increased judicial numbers and a programme of legislative reform, much of which impacted directly on the work of the Courts Service.</p> <p>  Significant performance and efficiency improvements have been achieved over the past five years as a result of a wide range of change projects implemented.  Increased productivity is highlighted by the 25% increase in the ratio of court sittings to staff and a 20% increase in ratio of judges to staff which has been achieved during this period.  The measures implemented included reform of the court regional and office structures, with the introduction of cross-jurisdictional combined court offices and the closure of smaller offices.  This initiative has reduced the number of provincial offices from 65 to 32.  This was the most radical reform in the courts administrative structures since the foundation of the State.  It introduced an effective single management structure for court offices, maximised the resources available and released county registrars from management functions to enable them use their professional and legal skills to focus on quasi-judicial work to the benefit of the administration of justice.  A review of the combined court office project is being carried out to review and assess the benefits realised and identify opportunities for further efficiencies and reform.  A programme of rationalisation of court venues was also undertaken, and overall the number of venues outside Dublin is now down to 85 from 267.  This has concentrated business in fewer venues of a standard more suitable for the administration of justice.  These measures have successfully maximised the use of resources and freed up judicial and staff time to support the hearing of cases.</p> <p>  We have also worked to introduce a substantial programme of legislative and process reform.  An ongoing programme to streamline court procedures is under way.  We have also, in collaboration with the courts rules committees, sought to address key obstacles to access to justice, including reducing delays and the cost and complexity of proceedings while at the same time promoting and facilitating recourse to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.  For example, the facilitation of mediation initiatives in the area of family law in Dublin and at a number of venues throughout the country offers very effective alternatives to court determined outcomes, resulting in real and significant ongoing benefits for the parties involved.  It also provides savings in judicial and staff time.  We work on an ongoing basis with the Department of Justice and Equality in proposing areas of legislative reform and supporting the implementation of the legislative reform programme.  This focus on procedural and legislative reform has resulted in improved operation of the courts and efficiency in the use not only of Court Service resources but also, and importantly, those of other justice agencies.  There has been increased staff flexibility in a number of areas, such as logging of digital audio recording by court registrars and increased in-house ICT and legal support, all of which have yielded significant savings.</p> <p>  The Courts Service has also made considerable progress on the information and statistics provided on the operation of the courts.  These are published in the annual report and available on the Courts Service website.  Recognising one of the pillars of the public service reform programme, which deals with greater openness and transparency, the Courts Service continues to progress improved reporting on a range of matters linked to the operation of the courts and intends, through the development of integrated case management systems, as soon as resources allow, to continue to extend the range of data which can be provided.</p> <p>  The Courts Service recognises that technology is a key enabler in delivering improved services to court users and achieving improved efficiencies.  Significant benefits have already been achieved through the ICT projects already in place for a range of stakeholders, including savings for the Exchequer and better service to court users.  The implementation of our ICT programme has resulted in the optimisation of courtroom and court support technology, including the roll-out of digital audio recording to all court jurisdictions and venues; extended use of video link and videoconferencing, which has resulted in significant cross-justice sector efficiencies, particularly in the Irish Prison Service; facilitating data exchange between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service through the criminal justice interoperability project, which has generated savings for both organisations; court-generated financial transactions, valued at &euro;1.8 billion, have been transformed and centralised in a shared service centre utilising modern financial accounting technology; and the development of case management and e-filing projects, including the case management systems for small claims, the personal insolvency service, the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, ICT support for the new fines legislation, and e-filing projects, such as the debt claims online project and e-licensing, which are still under way.</p> <p>  The very welcome additional funding provided in 2016 and again in 2017 for investment in ICT has allowed the Courts Service to commence a programme of maintenance and development of our ICT infrastructure, equipment and systems, including a comprehensive cybersecurity programme, which is critical to maintaining the integrity of ICT support for the courts.  An ICT strategy has been put in place to ensure ICT development in the next three years is focused on achieving the maximum benefit for the court user and the State.</p> <p>  The Courts Service has also continued its capital building programme with the development of seven public private partnership, PPP, courthouse projects around the country.  The first of these projects, the courthouse in Drogheda, was completed in June and was officially opened on Monday.</p><p>The remaining six projects which will provide state of the art court accommodation and facilities are on target for completion this year.</p><p> When these projects are completed only five major will remain to be addressed and we are progressing the acquisition of sites where appropriate and necessary to ensure that we are in a position to undertake those projects as soon as funding becomes available.  We are also progressing development of a family law and children's court complex and the Hammond Lane site by the Four Courts.  This project presents a once in a lifetime opportunity to provide much needed accommodation and facilities for vulnerable people coming before the courts.  The accommodation and facilities in Dublin are not adequate and this project will ensure that current and future needs for the hearing of children and family law cases can be met.  It is also proposed to provide accommodation for the Supreme Court which publicly acknowledges and recognised its position as the highest court in our justice system.  Significant progress has been made on this project and the business case for funding is with the Department of Justice and Equality for consideration.  </p><p> In addition to the provision of new and refurbished court buildings, the Courts Service is also responsible for ensuring that court accommodation is maintained to an appropriate standard which meets the needs of court users and protects the architectural integrity of our historic courthouses.  The additional capital funding provided in 2016 and 2017 will allow a planned maintenance programme to be put in place to address the deficiencies in court accommodation around the country on an ongoing planned basis. </p><p> The Courts Service launched a three year learning and development strategy in 2016 to ensure the service has the skilled competent and engaged staff needed to support the administration of justice now and in the future.  Between 2008 and 2015, as a result of cuts in staffing and funding, there was a significant erosion of resources allocated to training and this was exacerbated by the impact on our corporate knowledge and expertise with the loss of many experienced staff.  The learning and development strategy is designed to address these deficiencies and through staff training and skill development play important part in building organisational capability and capacity.  The strategy is delivered using a blended learning approach, using in house experts and on line facilities where possible to maximise the resources available.  Additional staff and funding have been provided to support the implementation of the strategy in developing a learning culture throughout the organisation and developing technical and management capacity. </p><p> It is critical that the Courts Service has the capabilities and operating model to continue our reform agenda, meet the challenges we are facing and capitalise on opportunities as they arise.  In keeping with the renewed focus at government level on key reforms in the civil and wider public sectors, the Courts Service is committed to putting in place a co-ordinated and focused approach to the implementation of change in the organisation.  To this end a change management office was established in 2016 to clearly define, prioritise and drive change and reform in a co-ordinated manner and to ensure that the full potential benefits of change projects are captured and realised.  A three year high level change programme has also been put in place with a strong customer focus and based on delivering improved outcomes with measurable benefits for court users and other stakeholders. </p><p> The Courts Service priority always has been and will continue to be the provision of front line core court services to support the judiciary and court users.  This can only be achieved through the ongoing review of the organisation and the delivery of services and the continued implementation of our change modernisation programme.</p><p> The Courts Service strategic plan for the period 2014-17 set out the key priorities for the service over the last three years and in the lifetime of that plan considerable progress was achieved in the review and reform of our structures and service delivery with a focus on maximising the use of technology; developing our staff and rationalising processes.  The next strategic plan, currently being worked on, will build on these achievements and, informed by the strategies and change programme already in place, will define how the Courts Service can continue to play a key role in delivering improved access to justice, better support for the administration of justice and delivery of improved value for money for tax payers.</p></speech>

The moneys are not in a bank account, they are in a fund and we can track the value of funds at any one time based on the number of units held, and the price of that unit.</p></speech>

The strategies are changed from time to time based on the  advice of our investment advisers.  Wards of court have day-to-day needs also.  A portion of the growth fund is retained in a cash fund, which is a cash strategy relating to the Euribor plus fund.  The equivalent of three years' cash flow is retained in the short-term fund and the other portion is invested in the growth fund for the longer term in order that the short-term money is not exposed to fluctuations in value.</p></speech>

Since the financial crisis, the Courts Service has put two significant risk management strategies in place.  Does this suggest that those strategies should have been in place before the economic crash because there was a fall in the return on investments at that stage?</p></speech>

The Courts Service has an investment committee and independent investment advisers.  We regularly review what is happening in the financial markets and what the requirements are for investment.  We considered what happened during the financial crisis to see if anything was required.  Fundamental strategies did not change.  However, the measure brought in was the separate cash holding to ensure we do not sell equities when their value is down.  That was the main area.  I am not sure what the second risk measure the Deputy mentioned was.  We are aware that claims have been made that funds were lost during the financial crisis.  There is no evidence to support that.  One must consider the performance of the funds.  In spite of the financial crisis, which was the worst in living memory, our funds have averaged returns, net of fees, of 6% per annum and are currently yielding approximately 8.5% per annum net of fees.</p></speech>

The argument made by some is that that is what impacted on some funds.  One set of figures I received shows where the dip occurred.  Their ability to recover when it is sold off is negatively affected because there is nothing to recover as money was taken out of the system when it was at its lowest.  Does the witness accept that corrective action has been taken as a consequence of a learning exercise in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.932" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Quigley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#AA01200"><p>We are always learning and considering areas where improvement can be made.  The implication in the question is that people lost money because of it being in the growth fund and there being no cash holding.  There is no evidence to support that.  Even if all investment was in the growth fund, there was no separate cash holding and we were selling units out of the growth fund, those funds are above the level at which they were originally purchased and thus no realised cash has been  lost.  If the Deputy has evidence to the contrary, we would be happy to investigate the issue but we have investigated several cases in that regard and such a situation did not pertain.  It was a pragmatic solution to ensure that that risk was taken off the table.</p></speech>

Very often, they are wholly dependent on the Courts Service to properly manage the funds for their care.  It is, therefore, an extremely important group of people who must be protected as well as possible.  The witness has indicated he expects there will be another review.  When will that take place and will it be independent?</p></speech>

It will be put out to tender.  We fully appreciate the importance of managing these funds effectively and our track record over the 15 years since the Courts Service was established has been very good in terms of what has been achieved.  If the Deputy has examples of specific cases which involve a suggestion that funds have been lost, we will investigate that but we have no evidence thereof.</p></speech>

There is much material in the statement concerning savings, efficiencies, modernisation and so on.  Some of the difficulties in regard to the Courts Service relate to the time that people have to wait, particularly at District Court level where it can taken an inordinate length of time for cases to be heard.  Does the modernisation programme include timescales for dealing with cases because some escalate to higher courts due to delays at District Court level.</p></speech>

Some 21 offices deal with cases before the end of three months and a further seven do so with a six month period.  The committee will appreciate that the Judiciary tends to give priority initially to criminal law and then to family law.  Civil law is afforded the least priority.</p></speech>

That is a suggestion that Mr. Quigley might look at.

As part of the consideration of an application for repossession the court should undertake an assessment of the fairness, if one likes, of the arrangement with the borrower in the context of the EU directive.  As I understand it - I may be wrong - the issue was raised in a case.  A comment was made, but it was subsequently to be part of a further hearing in the High Court, if my recollection serves me right.  As far as I am aware, that has not yet taken place, but I may be wrong.  The issue concerned the proficiency of county registrars to adjudicate on repossessions.  As the chief executive said, the county registrar can only grant a repossession order with consent or by agreement.</p></speech>

Do people see the way I am treated?  What system is in place for Oireachtas Members to ask genuine questions about court awards?  If there is no formal system in place, will the witnesses consider putting one in place?  That might ease everyone's lives a little as such issues arise frequently.</p> <p>  On asset disposal, for instance, I have been asked about the courthouse in Borrisokane.  Obviously, there are valuations, but is there a process in place whereby such buildings are offered to local authorities?  Has that happened in the case of the courthouse in Borrisokane?</p></speech>

The county council has been very helpful in suggesting potential sites.  Most recently, a site was identified reasonably close to the county council offices, which we visited.  Our colleagues in the OPW have made an assessment of it.  From an architectural point of view, we are getting the valuation side of the OPW to examine the site and discuss matters with the local authority.</p></speech>

There are a number of issues with the site, the first of which is access to it because the road has not yet been built.  Second, there are electricity wires running across the site which would need to be rerouted.  Obviously, the cost of the site is another issue.</p></speech>

I cannot sign off on the Vote for the Courts Service because we were caught for time.  Officially, we will adjourn the disposal of the Vote until we meet again some time after the summer recess.  From a practical point of view, it will be in the context of the audit report that will be issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General in September.  When we come back to look at the Courts Service in the next Oireachtas term, we will wrap up anything that was not wrapped up today as part of our consideration of the 2015 Vote.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
