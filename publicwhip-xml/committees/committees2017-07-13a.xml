He is accompanied by Ms Mary Henry.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Josepha Madigan and Alan Farrell.  Deputy Madigan has written to the committee to state she will not be continuing as a member of the committee and will be replaced by the D&aacute;il in due course.  Deputy Farrell has indicated that he expects to continue on the committee.  Until such time as they are replaced, both members will still be members of the committee.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meetings of 4, 5 and 6 July 2017.  They have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item are matters arising from the minutes.  There is nothing specific that is not on the agenda in front of us.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence.  Category A refers to correspondence for today's meeting.  Nos. 670 (i) and 670 (ii) are a briefing paper from Brendan Ryan, chief executive of the Courts Service and a briefing paper in respect of prosecutions for fixed charge notice motoring offences by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will be returning to that matter in the autumn.  We have indicated that as the complete report from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not available at present, we are deferring detailed examination of that topic.  We have received an interim report that we can discuss.  We can discuss anything in front of us but as the final report has not been finalised, we will come back to it in due course.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00300"><p>Very good.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00400"><p>The next items of correspondence are Nos. 671A (i) to 671A (iii), inclusive.  No. 671A is a covering email from the Garda Commissioner enclosing the interim report and the second interim report into the examination of the recording of breath tests.  That is the matter to which I have just referred and we will await the final report and will deal with the issue then.  In the meantime we can discuss the interim reports we have received.  We will note and publish them.</p><p>Category B correspondence refers to correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers and follow-ups to previous meetings.  Nos. 681B (i) to 681B (vi), inclusive, are items of correspondence  received on 10 July from Joe Nugent, chief administrative officer in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It includes a briefing note on Garda College income and expenditure, a Garda College restaurant profit-and-loss analytical review for 2009 to 2016, an analysis of expenditure for the Garda College division 2009 to 2016, a note in respect of Garda College restaurant funds transfers from 2010 to 2016, a note on correspondence relating to a previous voluntary disclosure settled with the Revenue Commissioners in 2010 and a note on an audit of EU-funded projects.  We will note those documents and they will be considered as part of our report, which we will launch next Tuesday.</p><p>The next items are Nos. 686 B, 690 B (i) and 690B (ii), correspondence from the HSE dated 11 July with follow-up information requested following the meeting of 15 June including further information requested by the committee in respect of the Grace case and data for 2017 in respect of patient referrals to hospital emergency departments by GPs.  </p><p>In respect of that letter from the HSE, all I can say is &quot;here we go again&quot;.  We were promised the Deloitte report time and time again and now we have been told it will be provided at some point after the summer break.  The letter goes on to say that the State Claims Agency: </p><blockquote>has confirmed that the final bill of costs relating to this specific case has not reached a final conclusion.  However, the [State Claims Agency] has clarified that interim payments totalling &euro;185,984.20 (which excludes settlement costs as per the High Court agreement) have been made.  </blockquote> <p>That is the only figure we have actually received and it excludes the High Court settlement costs.  We still have not seen the Deloitte report.  Mr. Tony O'Brien says that he will seek the permission of the commission of investigation to give us a copy when he receives it.  We will not get into a big debate.  We will send this letter to the commission but we are still gravely disappointed at this delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00500"><p>We have all followed up on this and it is extremely difficult to keep track of it.  We are now dealing with it under correspondence and trying to keep track.  We were clearly led to believe that this report would be published sooner than it was.  We still have no date in that regard.  It is totally unacceptable.  This was commissioned approximately a year ago.  This was a simple report on what money was given or not given.  This is adding insult to injury with regard to what has happened in the Grace case.  This is why we end up having inquiries.  This is honestly appalling.  It is a bit early in the morning to be so outraged.  We are having a tribunal because of the Grace case.  It would be easier to extract teeth without anaesthetic than to get this report.  I do not wish to personalise this, but we have asked repeatedly whether the staff were in the employ of the HSE and whether they had been promoted.  We have now found out that four of the five have been promoted.  It is extraordinary that, if not for the two whistleblowers whose lives have been seriously impacted upon, we would not even have an inquiry, not to mention that we would have not have questions here.  Mr. O'Brien should be brought back before this committee.  The man is on a very good salary, he is in charge of a huge body and he should be setting an example with candour.  This whole process from the HSE does not show candour.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00600"><p>We have to be conscious that there is a commission of investigation under way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00700"><p>I am more than conscious of that.  Sometimes I am too conscious of it and too cautious but this has nothing to do with the inquiry.  This is to do with Mr. O'Brien's role in giving open information.  He said the report was about to be published but it has not been.  It is simply not acceptable that a report of this nature is now taking even longer.  It is adding insult to injury.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00800"><p>The costs of the Deloitte report were mentioned in the High Court settlement.  We all understand that the lack of adequate payment for Grace's service provider financially compromised the organisation for a considerable period.  There is no mention here of whether the organisation has received any interim payment or how much that might be.  Even that information should have been included.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B00900"><p>Not to mention that sufficient funding was not provided to the service provider into whose care Grace was put.  She had already suffered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01000"><p>I endorse everything Deputy Connolly has said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01100"><p>I wish to add that we need this report for all sorts of reasons but the director general failed to give a full apology to the service provider pending its outcome.  While it is very important that we get the report as soon as possible, he could have given an apology anyway.  It deserved an apology.  My understanding is that he gave a partial apology on foot of the High Court settlement but was waiting to decide whether he would give a full apology pending the outcome of this report.  He said categorically that it would be published very soon.  He led us to believe it would be released almost immediately.  Here we are, almost a month later, and there is still no report.  We have written over and back to him.  This is not the first time we have raised this.  We have raised it every week since he was before the committee.  How many times have we written to him?  Is this the only response we have received?  Is this the one and only piece of correspondence we have received?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01200"><p>We have followed up on this on several occasions.  At the end of this letter he does not even give an expected timeline as to when we might receive the report.  It has actually gone in reverse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01300"><p>That is not good enough.  It is treating the committee with contempt.  There is no doubt about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01400"><p>It is treating Grace with contempt in the first place, and the public after that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#B01500"><p>A potential cost of &euro;185,000 has been revealed and it could increase from there.</p><p>That was not even a High Court case.  It was a case that was settled, but it did not go into the courts.  It shows the type of money involved in the mismanagement of the whole Grace debacle.  Whatever is added on for a tribunal, when we think of the money that could be spent on services for people such as Grace it brings home that there are consequences to this, which are lost services for those who actually need them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#C00200"><p>We will write a stern letter to Mr. O'Brien, expressing the gross dissatisfaction of the committee at the reply and lack of timeline, and insisting he does whatever is necessary with Deloitte and his own organisation to ensure it is brought to an urgent conclusion.  We are going into recess.  We will note that unless we have it we will expect him before the committee in September.  If it is all concluded satisfactorily that will be fine, but if it is not we will put him on notice that commission or no commission this is a financial matter.  We are putting him on notice that if it is not fully resolved he will be here in September.  We will forward this to the commission also.</p> <p>  The next items are Nos. 692B and 693B, correspondence received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both letters are from Niall Kelly, head of internal audit, in which he is keeping the committee up to date on his audit work.  It states that two audits, on EU funded projects and on cash and general management in the Garda College restaurant and shop, have been sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General and that two further audits are in planning.  No. 695C is an explanation to the committee for the delay in getting the original letter of 5 July to us.  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot comment, but will he confirm he has received these two reports?</p></speech>

We will ask for a more up to date position.</p> <p>  No. 660C is a briefing paper prepared by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which provides an overview of the current funding model for Irish Water.  It provides information on the role of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Commission for Energy Regulation on Irish Water.  On the same issue, No. 679C is from the managing director of Irish Water to advise that the information requested will be provided by 13 July 2017.  If that letter comes tomorrow, because it is from a public body I ask members to review it themselves.  The briefing note was from the Oireachtas library service and I am sure it has been widely circulated in the Oireachtas already.  People can comment on and use it.  The issue will come back on the agenda.  We will move on.</p> <p>  No. 666C, dated 6 June 2017, is from Michael Lyons, chief executive officer of Towards Healing, an external group which provides non-judgmental counselling to survivors of clerical, religious and institutional abuse, on Special Report No 69 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the child abuse inquiry.  The correspondence states information supplied by Caranua and statements made on 13 April 2017 are factually incorrect.  I propose we write to Caranua for a formal response.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

It is referring to a letter of 7 May that I could not find.  I am subject to being corrected.  I see a letter of 9 May 2017 with enclosures.  Here we are again.

Each and every one of us asked precise questions on rent and the cap on counselling as best we could.  Now we find the very organisation referred to by Caranua, namely, Towards Healing, is coming back to correct Caranua.  Imagine how difficult it is for the survivors using the services.

I propose to reply to Mr. Justice Cooke stating that we will ask the secretariat to review all material held by the committee and make any information not listed in the report available to the Commission.  I read that letter in detail.  It is from the Commission of Investigation into the National Asset Management Agency.  Mr. Justice Cooke is the judge who is conducting the investigation.  He has written a nice letter to the committee thanking it for its work and its willingness to co-operate and assist him in every way  possible.  He has indicated that he is obtaining all necessary information he can from NAMA and the Comptroller and Auditor General and that he is coming to the committee requesting to see if we have information that we received from bodies, other than those two sources, to identify and produce a list and forward it to the commission, which can then decide if it wants the information.  The commission has been very good in that it is not asking us to provide information that it can obtain from other sources.  Mr. Justice Cooke is going about the task in a very efficient manner.  We will co-operate fully.</p> <p>  No. 683C is correspondence, dated 6 July 201,7 from Dr. Michael Crowley alleging malfeasance and corruption in the health service.

I will write formally to the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Deering.  The issue is that a levy is payable to Horse Racing Ireland on the basis of the published fee that the owner of a mare pays for the services of a stallion.  The actual fee charged can regularly be significantly less than the published fee.  Should the levy be based on the published fee or the actual fee paid?  It is similar to asking a person who is buying a house to pay stamp duty on the listed price as opposed to the actual price.  If that is what the statutory instrument states, it makes no sense.  There are vested interests in the industry that are quite satisfied with the regime, but others are very dissatisfied.  It is strictly based on a statutory instrument introduced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the matter is 100% within the remit of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Due to the fact that it was done by statutory instrument and the public is paying fees based on this, however, I, as Chairman, was contacted.  I am sure other members of the committee have also been contacted.  We will write to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I had told the correspondent that we will do what we can at our committee.  We will not ignore the very valid point he makes.  If the statutory instrument does not stack up-----</p></speech>

It previously provided shared IT services for all the institutes of technology.  The functions of An Ch&eacute;im Computer Services Limited transferred to HEAnet, a HEA subsidiary, on 1 October 2015.  An Ch&eacute;im Computer Services Limited is in the process of being wound up.

The trust had accumulated reserves of &euro;16.1 million by the end of 2015.  We only touched on a sample of these the last day that we were here.

We do not want to launch it before lunch because the secretariat will be under a lot of pressure to get it done.  I will just explain this.  If we finish our wording today, the secretariat will have quite a lot of tidying up to do on it on Friday.  Final and legal proofreading will be completed over the weekend.

Very substantial issues have already emerged since we last had the HSE in to discuss Console, some that we have not even had a chance to look at.  At least three further issues have been raised in the meantime.  With so much public money going into these organisations, this is a massive issue that warrants a full examination by this committee.</p></speech>

We need not only to do an examination but to try to get to the root of this.  We need to establish what is necessary when it comes to oversight, good governance, tracking and so on.  We can go from one case to another lamenting their various failures but having already done a lot of high-profile, sometimes controversial, work, our job at this stage is to assist in the process of finding as adequate a solution as we can.</p> <p>  I want to raise the issue of nursing homes, something I have raised here before.  In fits and starts there have been question marks and controversies around various provisions and the fair deal scheme and so on.  We recently had a controversy over people being charged extras, sometimes in quite dubious situations, or so it would seem from the coverage.  This is an area we need to examine. It is a matter of public concern, not just because of the considerable sums of public money that are invested in these kinds of services, and rightly so, but also because we could be looking at a near parallel to the pay top-up business operating within the sector.  I suggest that we strongly consider addressing these issues in the autumn.</p></speech>

We are working on a number of items and it may be moot as to whether a report will issue.  There are some that I have already signalled to the committee.  The report on school transport is very near completion.  We are actually doing a piece of work on the fair deal scheme and its associated issues.  It may not touch on everything because some issues might not come within my scope.</p><p>Those would be ones that I would hope we will have in the autumn.  We will have a follow on report from the one on the timeliness of financial reporting.  I think that needs routine analysis and reporting to the committee so that we can give a push to get financial reporting done earlier.  I would expect that we will have that done for the autumn.

It was not listed on the correspondence because it was received only this morning.  The letter is from Mr. Joseph Nugent.  I will read it out because it has not been published.  It states:</p><blockquote>I know from coverage in the media in recent days and from information from the committee secretariat that the Public Accounts Committee may intend over the coming days to publish its report in relation to the examination of matters arising from the interim report of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na internal audit unit on financial procedures at the Garda college, Templemore.<br /><br />It would be appreciated if you confirm whether or not this is the case.  I note to date that no draft report has been received by the Commissioner from the committee in this regard.  I would be grateful for your confirmation that the committee intends to furnish the draft of its report in advance of publication in order that the Commissioner and other staff members in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who may have an interest in the report be afforded the opportunity to address the draft report's findings.<br /><br />The recent media coverage also refers to additional material received by the committee, extracts of which have been published.  The Commissioner would be grateful if the committee would provide a copy of all such material received by it in order that it may be appropriately considered by the Commissioner and other Garda colleagues in conjunction with the committee's draft report.<br /><br />I look forward to an early response. </blockquote> <p>I will respond in public.  We will not discuss it in any detail.  We will not be supplying a copy of the draft interim report.  We issued a report just two days ago on third level education.  We did not supply it to the Department of Education and Skills, the HEA or any of the colleges concerned.  The reports are not about personal findings and the parliamentary legal adviser will make sure it is within the proper procedure from the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would not be normal to issue it for discussion.  We will give them a draft report just immediately before the launch.</p><p>Second, I will ask the secretariat if we have received additional material that is being referred to in the letter, that did not come through the Commissioner's office.  It is surprising the Commissioner has not got it if it has come from senior officers, but in the event she has not, I think we will forward it to the Commissioner in any event.</p></speech>

I agree with the ruling of the Chair.  It is extraordinary to be handed this letter with this request.  It is no secret that this report will be published in the coming days or week.</p> <p>  Second, the letter makes reference to the media.  I have not seen anything in the media relating to any extracts from this report.  We have been very clear in how we have done our work on it.</p> <p>  Third, the letter is bizarre.  If one reads the letter, it is more or less requesting that we send to the Commissioner a copy of the documentation that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through their CEO have already sent us.  That is bizarre.  We can provide the documentation just to be sure but it seems strange that the Garda is sending us information that we requested and now we have to send it back out to it again.</p></speech>

We have said that will be the case.</p> <p>  My view of the letter is that it is a very defensive, in that I hope this will not be an excuse that there was unfair process.  We need to make it very clear that the process was fair.  It was the same process that we followed with the NAMA report, the Project Eagle report and subsequent reports.  I make this point in case it is put forward as a defence that there was an unfair process and that they were not given an opportunity to comment.</p></speech>

It does not say anything about content.  To be fair, the letter writer states that he notes from coverage that the report will be made.  On a general level, perhaps on the question of issuing the report, NAMA asked for a report and various other groups have asked for a report.  What needs to be clarified by the Chair is the procedure in regard to when we produce a report.  Any organisation is entitled to clarification on that issue.</p></speech>

I am sure there is a standard Oireachtas protocol on this.  I will ask that the standard protocol be circulated to members and we can include it in our press statement so that people will be aware.  There is an agreed protocol in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

The intention had been that we would have had a joint discussion with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service to discuss the collection of fines for the penalty points, but I have been informed that the report is not ready.  I understand there was no separate report on the breath tests.  There is a draft report in the system, which we may discuss, but it is not the final report.</p></speech>

Essentially, I want to agree a timetable from now, 10 a.m. until 1.30 p.m.  We have three and a half hours.  Should we allocate two hours for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, leave the interim report as there is an overlap with both organisations, and when the Garda are finished they are free to leave and we then move on to the Courts Service.  To summarise, we will allocate two hours to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and then we will decide how much time we are allocating to the interim report, so we will hold that off until the Courts Service come in and we will do 30 minutes or 40 minutes as the case may be.  We will then complete the meeting with the Courts Service, with a view to completing our work at approximately 1.30 p.m.</p></speech>

The breath tests affects the Courts Service.  We are dealing with two separate Votes today, first the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Vote, which we will deal with in the normal course of events in the first two hours.  We have a separate Courts Service Vote being dealt with by the Courts Service which we will deal with separately, but there is an item affecting both of them, which is the interim reports.  We will have a middle session where both organisation will be present.</p></speech>

This morning we will examine the 2015 appropriation accounts of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I welcome back the Garda Commissioner, Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan, who is accompanied today by some familiar faces, Mr. Joseph Nugent, chief administrative officer, Mr. Michael Culhane, executive director of finance and services, Deputy Commissioner D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, governance and strategy, and Assistant Commissioner Michael Finn, roads policy and major events-emergency management.  We are also joined by Ken Ruane, Inspector Netta Browne and Superintendent Marie Broderick, and by John Burke from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to switch off their mobile phones completely.  Putting them on silent is not adequate.  They have to be on airplane mode as otherwise it will interfere with the recording system.  </p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, I will refer briefly to something.  This morning, we received a letter from Mr. Joseph Nugent to the committee dated 13 July inquiring about the publication of the report.  The arrangements are that we will finish our discussion here with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service before the voting block in the afternoon.  For the rest of the evening, the committee, in private session, will finalise our report on Templemore training college with a view to the report being launched next Tuesday at 2 o'clock.  As is normal in the Oireachtas, draft reports are not circulated.  It will go through the normal Oireachtas procedure.  That procedure does not involve issuing a draft report for comment.  The report will be issued in the same way as the education report two days ago.  We did not send a copy to the Higher Education Authority or the colleges concerned.  We issued the report on the day.  That is the normal procedure.  </p><p>There is a reference in the letter this morning which states: &quot;The recent media coverage also refers to additional material received by the Committee, extracts of which appear to have been published.&quot;  It may not have been by us.  We do not know the source of the publication.  It continues: &quot;The Commissioner would be grateful if the Committee would provide a copy of all such material received by it in order that it may be appropriately considered by the Commissioner and any other Garda colleagues in conjunction with the Committee's [draft] report.&quot;  If there is something we have received that has not come directly through Joseph Nugent or the Commissioner's office, we will of course arrange to send a copy of it in the event she does not have it already.  We will do that straight away.  I am just putting that on the record.  The report is expected to be launched next Tuesday at 2 o'clock.</p><p>I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make an opening statement.</p></speech>

Approximately 300 members retire from the organisation each year.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has received Government approval to increase the overall strength to 21,000 personnel by 2021.  This will include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilian members.  At present, approximately 2,000 civilians in the organisation carry out senior management, administrative and technical roles.  The figure of 4,000 civilian members represents a target of 20% civilians over the next five years.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na currently has approximately 14% civilian staff members.  The increase will bring us into line with international norms and ensure that sworn policemen and women are available for and utilised in all operational areas, a commitment we are determined to achieve.  The Government approved an increase in civilian numbers by 500 in 2017 and recruitment for the first batch of this number has commenced.  We are determined to ensure that happens by the end of this year.</p> <p>  A new Garda recruitment competition was announced on 11 May 2017 with a closing date of 1 June 2017.  The competition had three streams: a main stream; a fluency-in-Irish stream; and a Garda Reserve stream.  The total of 5,300 applicants compares to 5,600 for the previous competition.  A new Garda Reserve recruitment competition was also announced on 23 March 2017.  A total of 2,394 applications were received with 1,593 applicants successfully passing the initial stage.  Interviews for this competition are ongoing and 600 have been held to date.</p> <p>  Pursuant to section 19(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 in October 2006 the Garda Commissioner became the appropriate authority for civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Simultaneously, a dedicated civilian human resources directorate was established to support the office of the Commissioner in discharging this new statutory responsibility and to drive forward the implementation of the civilianisation programme.  Civilian members are employed in a wide range of management, administrative and technical duties.  Administrative support duties in Garda stations and offices has enabled the establishment of the expansion of some vital services that are wholly or largely provided by civilian members, including the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Garda information service centre in Castlebar, the Garda central vetting unit in Thurles, the fixed charge processing office and the call-taking function in the command and control centre along with immigration control officers in Dublin Airport.  As part of the engagement of additional civilian members it is proposed that a considerable number will be deployed to release Garda members to operational policing roles.  In 2017, it is expected that more than 100 Garda members will return to operational roles through this process.</p> <p>  The 2015 budget for the Garda Vote amounts to &euro;1.35 billion.  The original budget was increased by &euro;35.2 million and a surplus of &euro;1.85 million is liable for surrender to the Exchequer.  The original budget was increased in the Supplementary Estimate due to the payment of allowances and overtime for an extra roster period that fell due in 2015, in addition to the policing of the visit of the Prince of Wales and the implementation of Operation Thor that commenced on 2 November 2015.</p> <p>  In addition, funding requirements in a number of subheads increased.  The information and communications technology subhead increased for the maintenance and implementation of critical IT systems and for capital funding for the major investigations management system, known as MIMS.</p> <p>  The modernisation and renewal programme was launched on 9 June 2016, incorporating a range of initiatives to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to meet present and future challenges.  The programme has been formed based on recommendations made in 44 reports into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including all 11 reports of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate.</p> <p>  Internal and external reports developed over the preceding ten years were taken into consideration as well as extended periods of consultation, workshops and focus groups with senior management within the organisation and with communities throughout the country.  To deliver on this programme I have established a strategic transformation office that is responsible for implementing these recommendations and working closely with the Policing Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to ensure key recommendations are addressed.  The new commission on policing will play a role in this as well.  We have recently recruited a civilian executive director for strategic transformation with the assistance of the Policing Authority.</p> <p>  An under-spend of &euro;32.2 million in 2015 arose in the capital building programme for three new divisional headquarters due to the timing of contracts and payments.  The under-spend resulted in a decrease in the original budget by &euro;25.4 million in the Supplementary Estimate.  This was utilised to fund additional capital requirements for ICT, Garda vehicles and aircraft.  The remaining &euro;6.644 million was carried forward to 2016 under the capital carry-forward provisions.</p> <p>  The issue of accommodation presents a risk to the organisation's ability to effectively assimilate the increased Garda and civilian resources approved by Government.  We are working closely with colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Office of Public Works to address these matters.</p> <p>  The programme for a partnership Government recognises that garda&iacute; must have the modern technology and resources necessary: to prevent, detect and investigate crimes; to provide a security service to the State; and to prevent loss and harm to citizens and their property on a 24-7 basis.  Some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the capital plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime.  My team and I are available to take whatever questions committee members might wish to raise.</p></speech>

B'fh&eacute;idir go dtiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais go dt&iacute; an ceist seo.</p> <p>  In regard to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na report for 2015, a number of matters were identified.  One matter related to procurement, to which I will return later, and two significant financial risks were identified.  The audit of the Garda College is a matter for another day and I will leave it; all I will say on it is that a caution was put in and we have dealt with it.  It is stated that there were a number of issues associated as set out.  The Commissioner said they were not in compliance with current public standard corporate governance procedures.  I have asked her previously and I ask her again if she would accept, on reflection, that they were not in compliance with the standards at the time with all of the information that we have now?</p></speech>

Obviously, what we have said is that they are not in compliance with standards.  There is no issue that we accept that they were not in compliance with standards back then, but we have dealt with that in detail at previous committee meetings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#J00400"><p>These are the official accounts and this is the caveat that was put in.  It was put in with respect to the current financial matters, which always concerned me.  If the Commissioner is accepting that they are certainly not in compliance with current standards, then they also were not in compliance with the standards that were there previously.</p></speech>

The Commissioner has identified that as a significant financial risk.  I read the O'Higgins report of last year in detail.  One of the items that jumped out of it, to cite one example, was the computer that went missing in the Fr. Molloy case.  There are serious issues involved.  That is one example that sticks in my mind.  Can the Commissioner take me through this?  Was there an audit in regard to these matters?</p></speech>

There have been several audits and part of the internal audit process conducted by Mr. Kelly identified - on a recurring basis, and that is why we identified it as a key risk - ongoing and continued weaknesses with property and exhibit management storage.  However, we have implemented a number of measures to address those issues, particularly around the property and exhibit management stores.  From an accommodation point of view, we have a programme of work to make sure that there are stores in every Garda division.  They are being implemented and rolled out across-----</p></speech>

That can come from a number of different categories.  We would have property, for example, that is found or retrieved during searches.  We would also have property which becomes evidence in prosecutions and property that has been found and handed in by a passer-by.</p></speech>

What has happened?  The Commissioner has said there were inadequate premises and inadequate storage facilities.  Are there other problems?</p></speech>

There are two aspects that we are addressing.  Again, historically, what has happened is that the activities of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have increased significantly over the years.  Our successes speak for themselves in terms of seizure of property during searches and during specific policing and security operations.  That property comes into the possession of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Likewise, much more property is being retrieved.  For example, the Deputy will have seen over the years that we have conducted a number of events where a good deal of effort has been put into trying to reunite property that has come into our possession, whether by searches or otherwise, with its owners..  For example, around the country particularly-----</p></speech>

What I am more interested in, and the more serious issue, is evidence that is taken and held in regard to court cases.  I notice that this has been prioritised in the strategic transformation programme.</p></speech>

We now have in almost every division in the country a dedicated property and exhibit management PEM, store.  Because they were built in recent years we have been able to build them to a much higher specification, for example, in regard to the storage temperature and all of that.  This is available in all but three divisions but all divisions have dedicated storage facilities.  A dedicated store manager is assigned to them, which means there is one way in and one way out for property.  A dedicated IT solution has been put in place to support the tracking of that property once it comes into the possession of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The next phase of the development will mean that at the end of next month a state-of-the-art custom built IT solution will be put in around that for all divisions.  A few parallel developments are happening.  There is ICT, the physical infrastructure and the policy around that, and the resourcing from the point of view of having dedicated staff dealing with property coming in and out.</p></speech>

There were 73 contracts.  In terms of the high level of non-compliance with procurement regulations, which the witnesses have noted, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na complied with the guidelines with the exception of 73 contracts to the value of over &euro;11 million.

For the maintenance of those systems, obviously we have to use those companies to maintain those systems.  In that case, we would not necessarily undertake a procurement procedure because there is only one supplier for the system.  There is a large range of other services, for example, the towing of cars involved in road traffic accidents.  I mentioned medical services, which is an expenditure of over &euro;2 million.  That is now in place.  We have worked with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and the Health Services Executive.  It has put a contract in place, so that will address that in its entirety.  There is an active programme to address these issues.  It is in terms of resources, but also it is the nature of the items included.  Some are proprietary, and they will continue to be priority.  While we will address as many of the gaps as possible, there will continue to be proprietary items which will continue to feature in 40/02.</p></speech>

We get information from the witnesses and from the Comptroller and Auditor General telling us about non-procurement.  It is a duty, an obligation and a regulation, and then I get a general answer.  I would like to know the steps involved.  Has it been reduced?  What is the target for next year?  That is all the members of this committee want to know because there are huge implications for non-compliance.  It does not instill confidence in local businesses that the procurement rules can be relied on.  There are huge implications in terms of trust, particularly from the Garda again, but it is not just the Garda; it is every organisation.  I would expect that if we are all here next year, or whoever is here, this would have reduced significantly and that Mr. Culhane would be saying: "This is totally unacceptable.  We cannot have this level of non-compliance and we will reduce it to the bare necessities in an emergency".  That is the answer I would expect.</p></speech>

I mentioned the medical services contract, for example.  That is &euro;2 million.  That will disappear from the 40/02 list.  The Deputy can see that there is an active programme.  In terms of the towing contracts, we have contracts in most divisions and we expect that we will have that completed this year.  We will remove substantial items from that list.  There is an active programme in place and there is a dedicated procurement section in Garda headquarters which is addressing this matter.</p></speech>

At the end of 2016, we got a Supplementary Estimate which included &euro;4 million for the Schengen system.  That allowed us to sign the contract and then make an additional payment of &euro;4 million.  As part of the funding for the Schengen system, that is included in the mid-term capital review.  We are seeking the balance in terms of the funding required to complete the system.</p></speech>

Obviously, there are a number of demands on the organisation, not least - as we mentioned in the opening statement -  of which is the implementation of Operation Thor, which was a response to a surge in property crime throughout the country.  It has led to or the return on investment demonstrates an over 35% decrease in property crime, in particular, and burglaries.  That is a very significant decrease.  Also, in terms of the gangland feud, one would have seen right around the country a number of hybrid patrols where we have both armed and unarmed members patrolling together.  All of those operational demands are very resource intensive.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will have seen, one of the criticisms we have received is that we are insular and defensive.  Some of the inspectorate reports quite rightly raised the fact we need to speak more openly to the media.

This week, Michael O'Sullivan and I met the company.  It will have 22 people looking at this.  It will do it over a number of weeks.  That will be a continuation of the work undertaken by Michael O'Sullivan.  We are looking at a system that goes back.  I can have my colleague, Michael Finn, who is in charge of roads policing, explain in detail what we are looking at and the number of records.  The records go way back over a number of years - all the way back to 2005.  It is hugely time consuming to examine all the records and collate all the information that is available.  I think Michael O'Sullivan in his updated position report outlines that he will be finished by the end of July.</p></speech>

That was all I needed to know.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na first became aware in late 2015.

We have two interim reports that do not reveal much.</p><p>All they say is that certain areas need to be examined and information needs to be gathered and so on, but we have no concrete answers yet.  We were hoping we would be able to discuss this today but we are not in a position to do so.  I find it unacceptable that it is the case.  We should have had that report for this meeting.  Would the Commissioner forgive us for being cynical about that and for thinking there are potentially other motives for why that report was not completed?  Surely it is the Commissioner's job to make sure appropriate resources are given to any examination of this nature.  It is something that is very serious for her organisation.  I would have imagined she would have made sure they have all the resources they need to do their work and to conclude it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The work is continuing by Assistant Commissioner O'Sullivan.  He was given six months in which to complete the work.  As the committee will see, he has indicated in his updated position report that his work will be completed by the end of July which is ahead of schedule.  As I have said, the Policing Authority has also taken an interest in this and quite rightly so.  It has appointed an external company and of course we will be assisting it fully.  This is happening in full openness and full transparency.  The resources that are required to be given to it are being given to it.

When the Commissioner is correcting the record, she should at least listen to what people say because I never used the word "sinister".  I think it is reasonable for me to put to the Commissioner that she and her organisation found out about this in late-2015.  We are in the middle of 2017 and she is still not in a position, as the head of the organisation and its Accounting Officer, to tell us what happened.  That is the point I am making.  I will give an example of why I am frustrated.</p> <p>  I am looking at the two interim reports.  There is an issue which - pardon the pun - is breathtaking for me.  I cannot understand how the information on the Dr&auml;ger equipment and specifically procurement is still not available to us.  Information on the number purchased and the number distributed to the various divisions compared with the number of breath tests recorded on PULSE is not available.  The same issue is referenced in the interim report of 26 June 2017.  It lists under the heading of issues to be dealt with and information sought the national Dr&auml;ger audit to acquire the most accurate figure for the number of breath tests recorded on the Dr&auml;ger machines and also the number that were procured.  How is it not possible to provide us with that information?  It seems to me to concern basic purchasing of equipment.  The Garda purchases and pays for a set number of mouthpieces and equipment and then a set number is used.  Perhaps the Commissioner is in a position today to give us that information but up to now she has not been.  Questions were asked about procurement earlier.  Does the Commissioner have that information to hand today?</p></speech>

My understanding is that on the PULSE system the number of recorded tests from October 2011 to December 2016 was 1,996,365.  On the Medical Bureau of Road Safety's figures, it was 1,058,157.  Mr. Finn should be in a position to tell me today in that period from October 2011 to December 2016, were there 1,996,365 mouthpieces?</p></speech>

There is basic purchasing involved here.  Either there were 1,996,365 mouthpieces or not.  It is incredible we still do not have that information.  I find it incredible.  I want the Commissioner or Mr. Finn, if he is more aware, to talk me through how this works.  How does the mandatory breath testing work from when the vehicle leaves the station?  Before it leaves the station, what does it do?  Does a garda have to go and get a set number of these mouthpieces?  How are they signed for?  How are they recorded?  Will the Commissioner or Mr. Finn talk me through that process so I have a better understanding?</p></speech>

Let us consider the ongoing review.  Let us imagine that Mr. McCarthy here, for example, were to hypothetically be caught speeding and get a fixed notice.  I am taking him as an example here because he is our independent witness.  He would fill out the form and put down his credit card details.  Let us say, however, that he makes a genuine error and puts his name or credit card number in the wrong place.  Everything on the form is accurate but on the wrong line.  What would happen after something like that?   I assume that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would send him another notice telling him that he has made an error and has to fix it.

I know of a number of people concerned who claim that they did not get such a letter.  I would like to know that this is being reviewed as part of the current process, that such cases do not go straight to court, and that the second notices were indeed issued.  Anyone could make a genuine error, I do it myself.  A person is rushing and makes a mistake in filling out a form.  People deserve the chance to fix such errors but I am concerned that some people are saying they never had such a chance.  I do not think it is the fault of the office in Thurles, as it is possible that some forms never reached them.  Is Mr. Finn certain that every form definitely did?  As part of the ongoing process, can he please make sure that there are checks and balances in place to make sure that the forms get back to Thurles and that the scenarios I mention do not happen.</p></speech>

There is a certain timing involved in this.  We would normally pay over the money at the end of a month.  It is a question of how much money is in the account at the time.  The Deputy mentioned that there was &euro;217,000 which then rose to &euro;1 million.  That merely reflects the timing of the payment to the central Exchequer.  Given the timing, at the end of the financial year, it seems that the amount had accumulated.  It would have been paid over in January.</p></speech>

I presume that properties were not put on the market if there was any prospect of their being re-opened.  What dialogue took place between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality regarding the Garda stations to be sold?  Some of the stations were sold for very little because at the time of sale the property market was at its lowest.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na now has to purchase new accommodation to meet additional intake.  I would have expected there to have been an element of future-proofing on the part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of the sale of Garda stations.

The challenge I referred to in my opening statement relates to what the Deputy is talking about, namely, future-proofing.  The Government has committed to increasing the strength of the organisation to 21,000, which we very much welcome and I believe will benefit the citizens of the State hugely, but this poses challenges in terms of future-proofing the accommodation requirements.  The building programme under way provides for the opening this year of three significant headquarters in Galway, Wexford and Kevin Street in Dublin.  These will be prototypes for future Garda stations.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the current estate, which we inherited, is old and archaic.

Fines paid through An Post are paid to the office in Thurles and the money is then transferred to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  In regard to warrants, where a person is due in court in respect of non-payment of a fine and he or she does not turn up a warrant is issued.  The warrant is issued through a local Garda division and district and it is tracked in terms of payment or otherwise.  The court will have a record of what occurred.  If the money is paid through the court it can then verify which warrants came back to it unpaid, paid, non-executed or cancelled.

This is a familiar scenario for all of us now.  Like other speakers, I have a number of questions for the witnesses and so I would appreciate brevity in their responses.  Some of the questions can be answered with a "Yes" or "No".  I want to cover a range of topics.</p> <p>  I share the frustration of colleagues, in particular Deputy Cullinane, that as of yet we are awaiting the data and information we could rightfully expect an organisation such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to produce very quickly.  I am alarmed to note from the interim reports that in terms of the continuous professional development of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it appears there was, and perhaps is, no specific training for officers in respect of manning these stations and taking these tests.  I find that extraordinary.  I think it is extraordinary from the point of view of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and extraordinary that its parent Department would not ask questions and demand evidence that such basic professional formation is in place.  I am not asking for a response in this regard because these matters I am assuming will be matters for another day.  I say that only for the purpose of putting it on the record.</p> <p>  Did the Commissioner recommend the re-opening of Stepaside Garda station to the Government?</p></speech>

If I take, for example, my colleagues and I appearing as witnesses at the Committee of Public Accounts, I am not suggesting that I want to separate the two issues entirely but obviously there are witnesses who appear before, for example, committees or courts and different witnesses have different accounts of matters.  Some people have a direct evidence account of matters and some have a hearsay account of matters.  It is important that the court, the Committee of Public Accounts or any other committee hears all of the evidence in a fair and balanced way.  I am not going to second guess here the conduct of the court.  What I am saying is that from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's perspective, to bring it back to the Jobstown issue, it is important that, as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we are always told professionally to treat witnesses in a fair and reasonable manner-----</p></speech>

I will put it in context.  The force has a spend of &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;1 billion of that is on wages, so the focus is on the human element or human capital of where those garda&iacute; will be deployed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned this earlier.  Is the focus specifically on urban areas or is there a focus on rural areas as well?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Nugent" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#T01000"><p>It is urban and rural areas.  I will give a practical example.  We have a pilot process in four divisions around the country where we are looking at the manner in which those administrative services are being provided with a view to lifting them from district to divisional level.  The divisions are in Mayo, Galway and Cork, as well as in Dublin.  Our focus is countrywide to examine what is the right deployment model for civilian members in administrative roles in the different types of divisional structures.</p></speech>

There has been much discussion this morning on ICT and the divisional headquarters being built.  I pass Kevin Street every morning and it is quite an impressive building.  However, the issue is what people do in that building.  People listening to this discussion are interested in the Garda's style of policing and what that means.  I have attended all the JPC meetings in my home county for over a decade both as a councillor and as a Deputy.  There is a fear among the community.  The Garda Commissioner might think it is only a perceived fear but it is a real fear.  If there was not a fear about policing and crime, the 2,000 people who went to the meeting of the Paul Williams roadshow in Thurles and the 2,000 people who attended the meeting in Trim, in my home county, would not have gone to those meetings.  My question is about the style of policing.  Is it one in which the Garda Commissioner wishes to see the deployment of garda&iacute; on the street?  There is a big fear of anti-social behaviour and attacks on people.</p></speech>

Earlier, I spoke about our communications strategy and making sure we get messages across.  However, the important issue is having people on the street.</p></speech>

That is to ensure that sworn garda&iacute; are out engaging with the community and providing that level of reassurance.  In terms of the additional recruitment of members, as I said earlier 198 new members last week went to stations all over the country.  By the end of this year we will have 400 additional new members going to the stations.  The reassurance of having boots on the street, so to speak, and having garda&iacute; out engaging with the community is palpable and is having an effect.  That is something we will have to continue-----</p></speech>

It is the biggest issue in my county at present.  One could see that from the front pages of the tabloid newspapers last week and from the Joe Duffy show.  Following a very serious incident the front cover of my local newspaper referred to crime in Meath being out of control.  A shopkeeper was beaten around the head with a glass vase by thugs.  The Mayor of Navan, Councillor Tommy Reilly, who is 73 years of age, had to intervene to save his son in that incident.  What is shocking is that a Garda car arrived at the scene, spoke to the thugs and then drove off.  It sparked a national debate on the front covers of all the national newspapers and on the Joe Duffy show.  It is a sad state of affairs for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it takes the Joe Duffy show, apparently, to solve matters.  The Garda Commissioner says there is a palpable sense of people feeling confident but not in my county or my town.  A 73 year old man, the Mayor of Navan, had to intervene to save his son.  The garda&iacute; are not there.  There are no boots on the ground.  We do not see it.  The context of me putting this question is that the Garda has a spend of &euro;1.5 billion, of which &euro;1 billion goes on wages.  The people listening to this want to hear if the garda&iacute; are on the ground doing their job.</p></speech>

I extend my sympathies to the individuals the Deputy referred to and obviously it is a matter we are examining.  Since recruitment commenced, 36 new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have gone to the Meath division.  That does not take account of the consequential transfers.  As the Deputy knows, there are always people looking go to Meath division-----</p></speech>

That is the reason we welcome the Government's commitment to increasing the overall strength of the garda members of the organisation to 15,000.  Allowing for an average of 300 retirements per year, that will take time.  We very much welcome that by the end of this year we will have 800 new members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we welcome the commitment to that.  We cannot distribute everybody at the same time.  We have a plan or distribution model where we try to factor in retirements, and I realise it has become an issue in Deputy Catherine Murphy's constituency, crime demands and population demands.</p></speech>

That incident proves it is not the reality.  Garda&iacute; are on my local radio station every week detailing the crime.  There is little point in only telling the people about the crime that has occurred when there is no follow-up.  Has the Garda Commissioner got a plan whereby she instructs her chief superintendents with regard to how many people are getting back to that basic element of policing?  My question is about the style of policing.  I acknowledge that policing has changed and that intricate work has to be done with regard to drugs and so forth.  However, people are afraid about that basic element of policing, namely, people staving off these thugs who appear to control towns such as Navan, Mullingar and Thurles.  They are allowed to wander the streets and not be challenged by the force that is supposed to be protecting people.  Why is it that a mother who walks down the streets of my home town of Navan is afraid?  These thugs seem to think that they own the streets.  They can beat a guy around the head with a glass vase and when the garda&iacute; arrive they have a chat with them and then drive off.  It took the Joe Duffy show to implement the arrests.  That is crazy.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the style of policing.  There is an assistant commissioner in charge of the eastern region, a chief superintendent in charge of the Meath division and a local superintendent in the various districts in the Meath division, including in Trim.  They are responsible for delivering local, responsive policing.  When issues such as the one the Deputy identified arise, they are the people with responsibility and accountability for ensuring that the measures are in place.  Our responsibility is to ensure that we equip them.  On top of that-----</p></speech>

That is the point of my question.</p></speech>

The Garda Commissioner spoke to Deputies Kelly and MacSharry about the money being spent on PR and making sure that the Garda is not insular.  However, the journalists in these counties are capturing the public attitude.  Paul Williams is doing so on his roadshow.  Is the Garda gathering that information and directing the type of policing that assuages that and gets these guys so they do not feel they control our streets, given the spend of &euro;1 billion on wages?</p></speech>

More importantly, part of it is a number of the initiatives we have in place, particularly public safety initiatives such as Operation Thor.</p><p>We can provide for the committee, if the Chairman wishes, details of the successes of Operation Thor since it was implemented and the high visibility for which it provides to make sure we provide that reassurance for the community.  One crime is one too many, but, unfortunately, as I said, we live in a society in which crime is a reality, as it is in all societies.  However, we strive to reduce it as much as we possibly can.</p></speech>

Again, in my area members of the traffic corps were taken from north Meath and redeployed in south Meath, which means that one part of the county has been left without an available traffic corps.  I do not want the witnesses to focus on County Meath, but is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na trying to increase services nationwide or just strip an already stretched service?</p></speech>

It was scattered all over the place and for the moment we have brought it back into one centre.  We are putting extra people into traffic policing there, but we need a level of supervision and having the traffic corps scattered all over the place was probably not the most effective way to achieve this.  I am aware, from talking to the chief superintendent in County Meath, that he has consolidated the traffic corps in one location.  However, as we are providing for more supervision and more people there, he will have a bigger traffic corps by the end of the year.</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to take away from the meeting the fact that journalists in my county are capturing the attitude of the public.

I have a time limit.  Most members took perhaps 12 minutes instead of the ten allocated to them.  In one session members took up to 20 minutes instead of ten.  That was because of the debate on what had happened at Jobstown.  Because the event happened in 2015, was relevant to the deployment of Garda resources and staffing and directly related to the vote today, I let the debate continue.  Others might question why we had a debate on what had happened at Jobstown, but it was an event in 2015 and we are here to examine the level of Garda resources in that year.  That is why I allowed the debate to continue.  We will proceed with five-minute slots.  Deputies Catherine Connolly, David Cullinane-----</p></speech>

I wish to go back to the matter with Mr. Culhane and the Commissioner.  I would prefer if, say, in Galway local suppliers could be favoured, but, obviously, they have to comply with the procurement rules.  However, what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seems to be doing, inadvertently or otherwise, is allowing some suppliers to get contracts because of non-compliance with the procurement rules.  Is that not right?  I see the supply of vegetables and so on listed: "Peters Fruit &amp;amp; Veg - Catering [...] Tender in progress."</p></speech>

I am inexperienced in this area, but when I look at the list, I see there are procurement rules.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's procurement non-compliance rate is approximately 10%, for which the witnesses have given us the reasons of security and sometimes urgency, but there is no such evidence for a lot of the items.  While I accept that sometimes it has to be done, why would it have to be done in the supply of fruit and vegetables?</p></speech>

On the Deputy's point about local catering, if there is an event - for example, Prince Charles visited in 2015 - there will be a requirement for catering to support that activity.  That could have been the source of the particular item.</p></speech>

The witnesses have given me a list.  Non-compliance in the case of 73 items is unacceptable.  This has been the case previously and I would have expected the level of non-compliance to decrease to a small number of items and cases of non-compliance to be accounted for in emergency conditions.</p></speech>

Mr. Culhane has said that.  Something in which I am particularly interested is the victim service offices.  There is a victims directive; a Bill is in progress in that regard and the Commissioner mentioned the provision of specific offices.  Will she update me on the position throughout the country?</p></speech>

We have 28 divisions throughout the country.  In every division we have set up a victim service office which is staffed - this speaks to Deputy Shane Cassells' question about the roles of civilians - by both a garda and a civilian member who are trained.  We have had a lot of input from victims' advocacy groups and support services in terms of the training provided, which we very much welcome.  We have also set up a national protective services bureau and are in the process of rolling out the implementation of divisional protective services bureaux to support more vulnerable victims.  This means that a victim can come into a Garda station, to the victims service office, which provides a link.  One of the pieces of feedback we have received from victims during the years is that, because of the roster system under which garda&iacute; are employed, a victim may not always be able to obtain an update on his or her case or may not always be able to get in touch with the local garda.  The victim service office has all of the details and, particularly in the light of the victims directive and the right of a victim to be kept updated, will provide them constantly.</p></speech>

It may very well be  1 million is incorrect and that the discrepancy is not as significant as we thought at the time, but the information that we revealed to the public at the press conference was that we had discovered this and have a big hole here, and while we do not know why there is a big hole, we are not happy with it and we are taking our figures-----</p></speech>

They reference errors, inconsistences and so on, and they look at systems failures, data gathering and such.  There is very little reference to the failure of management or oversight.  Somebody is responsible for making sure that something as serious as a mandatory alcohol-testing initiative is done right.  Somebody has to be held accountable for that.  Mr. Finn and the Commissioner will be aware that if it is the case that the inconsistences are as great as has been reported, that has huge implications with regard to policy.  As they know, policy is set based on data given to the Government and to the Department.  If the data is massively incorrect, it has serious implications for policy responses.  I am trying to understand why very little attention is given in any of the interim reports that I have read to management culpability or examination of management - including Mr. Finn's predecessors.</p></speech>

There are management responsibilities here.  When this matter came to light, we brought together all of the assistant commissioners, chief superintendents and superintendents from all over the country to emphasise and re-emphasise to them their responsibility and accountability on these matters.  That has been made very clear.</p></speech>

That has to be done, because Mr. Finn is right that, if there is a problem, it has to be corrected.  I do not see the same level of urgency or attention being given to management failures, and people being held to account for what happened.  It does not scream from the pages from what I have seen and that concerns me.  What level of scrutiny, examination and investigation is there ongoing with regard to potential management failures?  Things do not always happen by accident.  It may well be an accident but I would surmise that, in this case, it is possibly not.  If it was not an accident, somebody is responsible for the system failure and people have to be held to account.  Is that part of that ongoing work?</p></speech>

Deputy McDonald asked them to provide us with the interim report up to now.  The witnesses spoke about the CSO and making a decision about where stations will be opened and deployment of staff.  I looked at the census from 1996 to 2006 to see where the big changes occurred.  Dublin city grew by 13%, D&uacute;n Laoghaire grew by 13%, south Dublin grew by 22%, Fingal by 43%, Meath by 44% and Kildare by 39%.  Kildare, Meath and Fingal make up the area that has seen huge growth.  There has not been a parallel increase.  I know that is not the only measurement because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na looks at crime statistics and a range of other things.  On a <i>per capita</i>basis, the lowest rate of garda&iacute; to population is found in Kildare followed by Meath and places like Wexford.  If there are to be deployment and transfers, will they be on the basis of matching the population growth and crime statistics?  What metrics will An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na use?  It has never been the case that this has played a whole part in this up to now.  For the past ten or 12 years, I have engaged with various assistant commissioners about the deployment of resources because they have never matched population growth.  It is part of the reason Deputy Cassells is so frustrated because the same pattern occurs in areas with very high growth.  I would have thought that the full opening of Celbridge Garda Station, which opens on a part-time basis, would have come in ahead of Stepaside Garda Station given the population increase.</p></speech>

I will happily share this information with the committee so members can see where people have been deployed.  That only relates to new trainees.</p></speech>

I have provided a chart which gives a high level breakdown of the expenditure.  As indicated in the chart, expenditure on pay was around &euro;49 million.  At year end 2015, a total of 948 full-time equivalent staff were employed in the Courts Service.  Members should note this pay figure does not include the salaries or pensions of judges.  Those are paid directly from the Central Fund of the Exchequer, and are estimated at around &euro;32 million for 2015.</p> <p>  The Courts Service incurred expenditure of &euro;20 million in 2015 in costs associated with the Criminal Courts of Justice building, which came into use in 2009 under a 25 year public private partnership arrangement.  The annual outlay includes elements of both acquisition costs and premises running costs, which over the life of the PPP are projected to be of the order of &euro;600 million.</p> <p>  The service has also been engaged for a number of years in progressing other PPP projects for the construction or refurbishment of courthouses.  Costs of &euro;1.9 million in 2015 associated with developing those projects are included in the spending of &euro;4.6 million incurred on courthouse capital works.</p><p>Appropriation-in-aid of the Vote expenditure totalled &euro;48 million, of which &euro;44 million was court fees revenue.  In addition, court-imposed fines totalling &euro;11 million were received and paid over to the Exchequer and around &euro;6.6 million in fines and excise fees was collected by the Courts Service and paid over to the Revenue Commissioners.  At the end of 2015, an unspent amount of &euro;1.14 million was liable for surrender from Vote 22 back to the Exchequer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.899" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#Y00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to appear before the committee in my capacity as Accounting Officer for the Courts Service, Vote 22, and I look forward to discussing any aspect of the Vote with him and the members of the committee.  I am pleased to report that a clean audit report has been provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the 2015 appropriation account.  Overall, the Vote was managed successfully and within budget at year end.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General stated, a surrender balance of &euro;1,135,706 was recorded on the Vote.</p> <p>  The Courts Service is responsible for the management and administration of the courts.  As the committee is aware, the administration of justice is a matter for the Judiciary and, in accordance with the constitutional independence of the Judiciary and the provisions of the Courts Service Act, is outside the scope of the functions of the Courts Service.  The committee will appreciate, therefore, that in my discussions with it today I am precluded from commenting on any matter relating to the exercise by a judge of his or her judicial functions or on any matter relating to the exercise of quasi-judicial functions by an officer of the court.  I am also, of course, precluded from commenting on matters of Government policy.</p> <p>  Since establishment, the Courts Service has worked to ensure the courts operate effectively and efficiently, that the use of available resources is optimised, that value for money is achieved, and the best possible service is provided to court users.  Since the Vote was last considered by the committee in 2014, the Courts Service, in common with other Departments and agencies, has seen a very welcome easing in the severe reduction in funding and staff numbers of previous years.  Using the resources available to us, the Courts Service continues to work with the Judiciary to introduce a broad range of changes and reforms, which yield significant savings for the Exchequer while maintaining access to justice and services for the public.  The service has diligently cut expenditure and has robust financial measures in place across the organisation to ensure expenditure is kept to a minimum and is incurred only where it is necessary and unavoidable, and that value for money is achieved.  We have also, through proactive management, increased court fees, thus reducing significantly the cost to the Exchequer of running the courts.</p> <p>  The Courts Service was established to support the courts in the administration of justice.  This is a unique role supporting the third branch of Government.  An effective courts system is critical to a functioning modern society.  As our society continues to evolve, it places many demands on our institutions, including the courts, and we operate in an increasingly complex environment that has seen considerable change and diversity in the economic, social, demographic and cultural landscape.  There are increasing levels of litigation, increased complexity in legislation, greater court user expectations and ongoing technological advances which pose challenges and opportunities.  To ensure it continues to fulfil its remit, the Courts Service must continue to adapt and evolve, responding proactively to promote access to justice and provide the necessary support for the Judiciary and the administration of justice generally.</p> <p>  The Courts Service has had a modernising agenda since its establishment in 1999.  In recent years, we have been successful in introducing a range of transformational changes which have delivered significant savings and benefits to court users.  The programme of structural, organisational and procedural reform, which continued during the economic downturn, introduced a range of efficiency and productivity measures across all aspects of the Court Service.  This programme of reform ensured that despite the severe reductions in staff numbers and funding, the Courts Service was able to continue to support the courts in a challenging operating environment, which included year-on-year increases in court sittings, increased judicial numbers and a programme of legislative reform, much of which impacted directly on the work of the Courts Service.</p> <p>  Significant performance and efficiency improvements have been achieved over the past five years as a result of a wide range of change projects implemented.  Increased productivity is highlighted by the 25% increase in the ratio of court sittings to staff and a 20% increase in ratio of judges to staff which has been achieved during this period.  The measures implemented included reform of the court regional and office structures, with the introduction of cross-jurisdictional combined court offices and the closure of smaller offices.  This initiative has reduced the number of provincial offices from 65 to 32.  This was the most radical reform in the courts administrative structures since the foundation of the State.  It introduced an effective single management structure for court offices, maximised the resources available and released county registrars from management functions to enable them use their professional and legal skills to focus on quasi-judicial work to the benefit of the administration of justice.  A review of the combined court office project is being carried out to review and assess the benefits realised and identify opportunities for further efficiencies and reform.  A programme of rationalisation of court venues was also undertaken, and overall the number of venues outside Dublin is now down to 85 from 267.  This has concentrated business in fewer venues of a standard more suitable for the administration of justice.  These measures have successfully maximised the use of resources and freed up judicial and staff time to support the hearing of cases.</p> <p>  We have also worked to introduce a substantial programme of legislative and process reform.  An ongoing programme to streamline court procedures is under way.  We have also, in collaboration with the courts rules committees, sought to address key obstacles to access to justice, including reducing delays and the cost and complexity of proceedings while at the same time promoting and facilitating recourse to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.  For example, the facilitation of mediation initiatives in the area of family law in Dublin and at a number of venues throughout the country offers very effective alternatives to court determined outcomes, resulting in real and significant ongoing benefits for the parties involved.  It also provides savings in judicial and staff time.  We work on an ongoing basis with the Department of Justice and Equality in proposing areas of legislative reform and supporting the implementation of the legislative reform programme.  This focus on procedural and legislative reform has resulted in improved operation of the courts and efficiency in the use not only of Court Service resources but also, and importantly, those of other justice agencies.  There has been increased staff flexibility in a number of areas, such as logging of digital audio recording by court registrars and increased in-house ICT and legal support, all of which have yielded significant savings.</p> <p>  The Courts Service has also made considerable progress on the information and statistics provided on the operation of the courts.  These are published in the annual report and available on the Courts Service website.  Recognising one of the pillars of the public service reform programme, which deals with greater openness and transparency, the Courts Service continues to progress improved reporting on a range of matters linked to the operation of the courts and intends, through the development of integrated case management systems, as soon as resources allow, to continue to extend the range of data which can be provided.</p> <p>  The Courts Service recognises that technology is a key enabler in delivering improved services to court users and achieving improved efficiencies.  Significant benefits have already been achieved through the ICT projects already in place for a range of stakeholders, including savings for the Exchequer and better service to court users.  The implementation of our ICT programme has resulted in the optimisation of courtroom and court support technology, including the roll-out of digital audio recording to all court jurisdictions and venues; extended use of video link and videoconferencing, which has resulted in significant cross-justice sector efficiencies, particularly in the Irish Prison Service; facilitating data exchange between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service through the criminal justice interoperability project, which has generated savings for both organisations; court-generated financial transactions, valued at &euro;1.8 billion, have been transformed and centralised in a shared service centre utilising modern financial accounting technology; and the development of case management and e-filing projects, including the case management systems for small claims, the personal insolvency service, the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, ICT support for the new fines legislation, and e-filing projects, such as the debt claims online project and e-licensing, which are still under way.</p> <p>  The very welcome additional funding provided in 2016 and again in 2017 for investment in ICT has allowed the Courts Service to commence a programme of maintenance and development of our ICT infrastructure, equipment and systems, including a comprehensive cybersecurity programme, which is critical to maintaining the integrity of ICT support for the courts.  An ICT strategy has been put in place to ensure ICT development in the next three years is focused on achieving the maximum benefit for the court user and the State.</p> <p>  The Courts Service has also continued its capital building programme with the development of seven public private partnership, PPP, courthouse projects around the country.  The first of these projects, the courthouse in Drogheda, was completed in June and was officially opened on Monday.</p><p>The remaining six projects which will provide state of the art court accommodation and facilities are on target for completion this year.</p><p> When these projects are completed only five major will remain to be addressed and we are progressing the acquisition of sites where appropriate and necessary to ensure that we are in a position to undertake those projects as soon as funding becomes available.  We are also progressing development of a family law and children's court complex and the Hammond Lane site by the Four Courts.  This project presents a once in a lifetime opportunity to provide much needed accommodation and facilities for vulnerable people coming before the courts.  The accommodation and facilities in Dublin are not adequate and this project will ensure that current and future needs for the hearing of children and family law cases can be met.  It is also proposed to provide accommodation for the Supreme Court which publicly acknowledges and recognised its position as the highest court in our justice system.  Significant progress has been made on this project and the business case for funding is with the Department of Justice and Equality for consideration.  </p><p> In addition to the provision of new and refurbished court buildings, the Courts Service is also responsible for ensuring that court accommodation is maintained to an appropriate standard which meets the needs of court users and protects the architectural integrity of our historic courthouses.  The additional capital funding provided in 2016 and 2017 will allow a planned maintenance programme to be put in place to address the deficiencies in court accommodation around the country on an ongoing planned basis. </p><p> The Courts Service launched a three year learning and development strategy in 2016 to ensure the service has the skilled competent and engaged staff needed to support the administration of justice now and in the future.  Between 2008 and 2015, as a result of cuts in staffing and funding, there was a significant erosion of resources allocated to training and this was exacerbated by the impact on our corporate knowledge and expertise with the loss of many experienced staff.  The learning and development strategy is designed to address these deficiencies and through staff training and skill development play important part in building organisational capability and capacity.  The strategy is delivered using a blended learning approach, using in house experts and on line facilities where possible to maximise the resources available.  Additional staff and funding have been provided to support the implementation of the strategy in developing a learning culture throughout the organisation and developing technical and management capacity. </p><p> It is critical that the Courts Service has the capabilities and operating model to continue our reform agenda, meet the challenges we are facing and capitalise on opportunities as they arise.  In keeping with the renewed focus at government level on key reforms in the civil and wider public sectors, the Courts Service is committed to putting in place a co-ordinated and focused approach to the implementation of change in the organisation.  To this end a change management office was established in 2016 to clearly define, prioritise and drive change and reform in a co-ordinated manner and to ensure that the full potential benefits of change projects are captured and realised.  A three year high level change programme has also been put in place with a strong customer focus and based on delivering improved outcomes with measurable benefits for court users and other stakeholders. </p><p> The Courts Service priority always has been and will continue to be the provision of front line core court services to support the judiciary and court users.  This can only be achieved through the ongoing review of the organisation and the delivery of services and the continued implementation of our change modernisation programme.</p><p> The Courts Service strategic plan for the period 2014-17 set out the key priorities for the service over the last three years and in the lifetime of that plan considerable progress was achieved in the review and reform of our structures and service delivery with a focus on maximising the use of technology; developing our staff and rationalising processes.  The next strategic plan, currently being worked on, will build on these achievements and, informed by the strategies and change programme already in place, will define how the Courts Service can continue to play a key role in delivering improved access to justice, better support for the administration of justice and delivery of improved value for money for tax payers.</p></speech>

The moneys are not in a bank account, they are in a fund and we can track the value of funds at any one time based on the number of units held, and the price of that unit.</p></speech>

The strategies are changed from time to time based on the  advice of our investment advisers.  Wards of court have day-to-day needs also.  A portion of the growth fund is retained in a cash fund, which is a cash strategy relating to the Euribor plus fund.  The equivalent of three years' cash flow is retained in the short-term fund and the other portion is invested in the growth fund for the longer term in order that the short-term money is not exposed to fluctuations in value.</p></speech>

Since the financial crisis, the Courts Service has put two significant risk management strategies in place.  Does this suggest that those strategies should have been in place before the economic crash because there was a fall in the return on investments at that stage?</p></speech>

The Courts Service has an investment committee and independent investment advisers.  We regularly review what is happening in the financial markets and what the requirements are for investment.  We considered what happened during the financial crisis to see if anything was required.  Fundamental strategies did not change.  However, the measure brought in was the separate cash holding to ensure we do not sell equities when their value is down.  That was the main area.  I am not sure what the second risk measure the Deputy mentioned was.  We are aware that claims have been made that funds were lost during the financial crisis.  There is no evidence to support that.  One must consider the performance of the funds.  In spite of the financial crisis, which was the worst in living memory, our funds have averaged returns, net of fees, of 6% per annum and are currently yielding approximately 8.5% per annum net of fees.</p></speech>

The argument made by some is that that is what impacted on some funds.  One set of figures I received shows where the dip occurred.  Their ability to recover when it is sold off is negatively affected because there is nothing to recover as money was taken out of the system when it was at its lowest.  Does the witness accept that corrective action has been taken as a consequence of a learning exercise in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.932" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Quigley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017071300002#AA01200"><p>We are always learning and considering areas where improvement can be made.  The implication in the question is that people lost money because of it being in the growth fund and there being no cash holding.  There is no evidence to support that.  Even if all investment was in the growth fund, there was no separate cash holding and we were selling units out of the growth fund, those funds are above the level at which they were originally purchased and thus no realised cash has been  lost.  If the Deputy has evidence to the contrary, we would be happy to investigate the issue but we have investigated several cases in that regard and such a situation did not pertain.  It was a pragmatic solution to ensure that that risk was taken off the table.</p></speech>

Very often, they are wholly dependent on the Courts Service to properly manage the funds for their care.  It is, therefore, an extremely important group of people who must be protected as well as possible.  The witness has indicated he expects there will be another review.  When will that take place and will it be independent?</p></speech>

It will be put out to tender.  We fully appreciate the importance of managing these funds effectively and our track record over the 15 years since the Courts Service was established has been very good in terms of what has been achieved.  If the Deputy has examples of specific cases which involve a suggestion that funds have been lost, we will investigate that but we have no evidence thereof.</p></speech>

There is much material in the statement concerning savings, efficiencies, modernisation and so on.  Some of the difficulties in regard to the Courts Service relate to the time that people have to wait, particularly at District Court level where it can taken an inordinate length of time for cases to be heard.  Does the modernisation programme include timescales for dealing with cases because some escalate to higher courts due to delays at District Court level.</p></speech>

Some 21 offices deal with cases before the end of three months and a further seven do so with a six month period.  The committee will appreciate that the Judiciary tends to give priority initially to criminal law and then to family law.  Civil law is afforded the least priority.</p></speech>

That is a suggestion that Mr. Quigley might look at.

As part of the consideration of an application for repossession the court should undertake an assessment of the fairness, if one likes, of the arrangement with the borrower in the context of the EU directive.  As I understand it - I may be wrong - the issue was raised in a case.  A comment was made, but it was subsequently to be part of a further hearing in the High Court, if my recollection serves me right.  As far as I am aware, that has not yet taken place, but I may be wrong.  The issue concerned the proficiency of county registrars to adjudicate on repossessions.  As the chief executive said, the county registrar can only grant a repossession order with consent or by agreement.</p></speech>

Do people see the way I am treated?  What system is in place for Oireachtas Members to ask genuine questions about court awards?  If there is no formal system in place, will the witnesses consider putting one in place?  That might ease everyone's lives a little as such issues arise frequently.</p> <p>  On asset disposal, for instance, I have been asked about the courthouse in Borrisokane.  Obviously, there are valuations, but is there a process in place whereby such buildings are offered to local authorities?  Has that happened in the case of the courthouse in Borrisokane?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017071300002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for giving me the opportunity to discuss the motion referred to the select committee for consideration.  The motion D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has been asked to approve reads:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approve the terms of the Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of the Philippines, of the other part, signed at Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 11 July 2012, a copy of which was laid before the D&aacute;il on 1 June 2017.</blockquote> <p>The main objective of the agreement is to provide a framework for a strengthening of the bilateral relationship between the European Union and the Philippines.  The agreement will provide for comprehensive and wide-ranging dialogue between the European Union and the Philippines, including co-operation in a wide range of areas such as trade and investment, human rights, development, civil society, disaster management, energy, tourism, the environment, asylum and migration, science and technology, as well as maritime and aviation transport, agriculture and health.  It is also, of course, expected to benefit the people of the Philippines and the Philippine economy.  </p><p>There are no bilateral agreements between Ireland and the Philippines.  Our political, economic and cultural contacts with the Philippines have increased in recent years and the potential to expand further.  For many years Irish missionaries have taught in schools and worked in parishes across the country and although their numbers have dwindled, their vital work continues today.  In recent years there has been a considerable increase in the number of Filipino citizens living and working in Ireland, particularly in the health sector.  Some 3,500 Irish citizens identify themselves as Irish-Filipino.  The Irish community in the Philippines is small - approximately 500<b>- </b>and they work predominantly as missionaries and, more recently, in sectors which include ICT and telecoms, construction, renewables and energy.  </p><p>Our bilateral trade with the Philippines has increased in recent years.  In 2016 total merchandise trade was valued at &euro;257 million, with exports and imports being of almost equal value, at &euro;134 million and &euro;123 million, respectively.  In 2015 total services exports were valued at &euro;169 million.  The beef industry has been particularly successful in recent years in accessing the Philippines market.  In 2016 we exported over 14,000 tonnes of beef to this market which has a population of over 102 million.</p><p>Ireland also provided funding and supplies worth more than &euro;3.5 million in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan-Yolanda.  A team of Irish Aid technical experts visited in December 2013 to conduct a needs assessment.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, visited in March 2014 to evaluate programmes supported by Irish Aid, and members of this committee visited the Philippines later in the same year.</p><p> We need to build our profile and reputation in countries with which we do not have long-standing historical associations.  Strengthening our bilateral relationships with such countries is all the more important as we adjust to new political and commercial realities in the run-up to Brexit.  This is reflected in the Government&rsquo;s commitment to deliver a new cross-sectoral strategy for the Asia-Pacific region, and this is under development.</p><p> That said, the EU, including Ireland, has expressed strong concerns about the deterioration in the human rights situation over the past year, including extrajudicial killings associated with a so-called war on drugs and the possible reintroduction of the death penalty.  The partnership and co-operation agreement is based on a commitment to promoting respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights.  It will introduce a framework for a human rights dialogue with the Philippines, which will provide a forum for discussion of these concerns with the authorities there.  The agreement also addresses issues in the area of money laundering, illicit drugs, organised crime and combating terrorism.</p><p> This agreement is the first between the EU and the Philippines since the 1980 EC co-operation agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has served as the primary legal framework for Philippines-EU relations until now.  As the agreement is a mixed competence agreement, it must also be ratified by all EU member states as well as by the European Union.  Ireland has signed but not yet ratified the agreement and is one of only two member states, the other being Greece, that has not yet completed the necessary ratification procedures.  It is important that Ireland makes the necessary arrangements to ratify the agreement as it will not enter into force until the first day of the month following the date on which the last party has notified the others of the completion of the legal procedures necessary for this purpose.  The Philippines has signalled its intention to ratify the agreement by August 2017.  If Ireland is the last EU member state to ratify the agreement, this will be the final impediment to the agreement&rsquo;s entry into force.  The agreement was signed on 11 July 2012.  It was endorsed during the plenary session of the European Parliament on 8 June 2016.</p><p> I again thank the committee.  I hope this motion will meet with the committee&rsquo;s approval and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will approve the terms of the agreement in order that Ireland can proceed to ratify it very soon.  I am willing to take questions at this point. </p></speech>

The possible reintroduction of the death penalty would be a reprehensible and objectionable idea.  The EU and the Irish Government need to make that position very clear and continue to make it clear.</p> <p>  It was our colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, who arranged for Fr. Shay Cullen to make a presentation to Oireachtas Members.  It was a powerful presentation on the ills, vices and terrible injustice in that society.  He highlighted a number of issues of which all governments need to be conscious and the terrible plight of so many people, in particular the exploitation of young people and children.  These are issues that all of us must bear in mind at all times in regard to the Philippines, while trying to help the situation of the underprivileged in that country.</p></speech>

I know this is the first of what will be many visits to this committee, given his other areas of responsibility.</p> <p>  I have a general question.  We dealt with another framework agreement for Mongolia recently.  Ireland was the last or the second last in Europe to ratify that agreement and we are again second last in this regard.  That is not a criticism and I am wondering whether this is a resource issue or a procedural issue.  Why is it that Ireland and Greece are the last two countries in the EU to get to this stage?</p> <p>  In one respect, that is not necessarily a bad thing and I do not think we should rush the fences.  I note we have a substantial Filipino population in Ireland and they play a very active part in the community here.  However, over the course of this framework arrangement being negotiated, we have seen quite substantial changes in the Philippines, in particular around the extrajudicial killings and the comments of its President, whose regular public comments nearly incited people to take the law into their own hands with regard to suspected drug dealers.  There are vigilante gangs, bodies being left on streets and people being murdered after being dragged out of their homes.  While he seems to be extremely popular, based on opinion polls in the Philippines, I would be particularly uncomfortable with the manner in which he is ruling his country.</p> <p>  The Minister of State rightly mentioned the area of human rights and the potential for the death penalty to be reintroduced.  Does he consider this the right time to be ratifying an agreement like this with the Philippines given the horrendous human rights record under President Duterte?  I would have serious questions.  Trade is important and we certainly need to look to new markets.  To be specific, trade with the Philippines is not insignificant and there is potential given the large population, our long-standing good relations with the people of the Philippines through the work of missionaries and Irish Aid and, as I said, the substantial Filipino population here, who are very welcome.  I am most uncomfortable with this and I want to know what assurances, if any, the EU has got from the Philippines Government about what is happening in the country at the moment and about ensuring the rule of law is upheld, given the regular extrajudicial killings, which greatly concern me.  I want to know what assurances the EU or the Irish Government have sought and received from the Philippines Government.  I would also like to know that we have received assurances the death penalty will not be reintroduced and what outs there are in this framework agreement should the situation there deteriorate politically.  What would be available to the EU at that stage, should we formally enter into this agreement?  I have genuine concerns about this.</p></speech>

It is a strange kind of country, with some 140 families ruling over 100 million.  I note there is not that much of a difference between exports and imports, which is interesting.  The Minister of State might outline what we are exporting and importing.  I see trade as a real opportunity to get and keep human rights on the agenda.  There is an opportunity to have those conversations in any of our trade negotiations, especially in regard to workers' rights.  The agreement is also based on a commitment to democratic principles and fundamental human rights and there is a basis to establish a formal human rights dialogue between the EU and the Philippines.</p> <p>  There are opportunities to highlight exactly what Fr. Shay Cullen and others have been telling us.  Issues of particular concern are the plan to reduce the age of criminality to nine years of age, the reintroduction of the death penalty - although I see this morning a report that Japan has hanged two people for offences - the shoot to kill policy and, in particular, the exploitation of children and women.  Fr. Cullen showed us very graphic pictures of children behind bars, children who were malnourished and very significant cases of stunted growth, but in particular material in regard to the sex industry.  It is horrifying to learn about children being forced to perform sexual acts in videos which are live-streamed to adults who can pay for this.  Fr. Cullen also highlighted human trafficking.</p> <p>  I want to bring the discussion back to what we can do because we are not doing enough.  At this point, a convicted paedophile from this country with his or her passport - it is usually a he - can travel to the Philippines and buy children for sex.  Between this committee, the Committee on Justice and Equality, and Defence, and the Minister of State, this is an issue we can address.  I hope to meet some of the officials from the Department of Justice and Equality because I have been advised that is what we have to do.</p><p>Our legislation allows this and it is allowing people in this country to pay to see children being murdered on video as well for sexual gratification, which I do not understand.  The trade is an opportunity to do that and I hope we take every opportunity we can to highlight this and to say it is totally and utterly unacceptable but Ireland will do what it can in legislation to prevent this happening.  Australia recently introduced legislation to combat this and we hope to bring that to the justice officials as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2017071300002#C00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his appointment.  I will pursue the same theme as my colleagues.  The EU regularly negotiates these framework or partnership agreements with third countries.  They generally contain proposals to improve diplomatic and economic ties and they usually contain paragraphs on respect for human rights, but there is no framework for these to be enforced or acted on.  The agreements are usually precursors to free trade agreements and this particular agreement contains references to the EU supporting the Philippines on counterterrorism and anti-crime measures.  The agreement, which was supposed to be negotiated in 2012, came before the European Parliament for ratification in 2016.  We generally abstain in the Parliament from these types of reports because we object to the EU being the body negotiating with third countries <i>en bloc</i>.  The text of the agreement has positive elements relating to human rights and inclusive conflict resolution.  My colleague, Gerry Kelly, has been involved in conflict resolution on one of the Philippine islands.  Unfortunately, that negotiation has broken down but it is positive work if we can get involved in that.</p><p>The agreement goes to member states to ratify and the question is why it is taking so long  When the agreement went through the European Parliament, President Duterte had only taken up office, but since then a campaign of extrajudicial killings by the police of people they accuse of selling drugs, including addicts, has unfolded and the death penalty has been introduced.  It is reported that up to 7,000 people have been killed as part of the campaign.  Collectively, we have concerns about deteriorating human rights in the country.  The EU should not agree to work with the Philippines on counterterrorism and anti-crime measures and I have a huge problem with that.  This will involve sharing additional information with that state.  The human rights provisions in the agreement will not be enacted by the Union.  Why do I say that?  We have similar agreements with other countries such as Colombia, Morocco and Israel.  People are being picked off one by one in Colombia because of their background while, with regard to Israel, war crimes were committed in Gaza and 2,700 people were killed.  People were saying we should cut this off but there is no mechanism and my worry is this agreement will result in the same lack of enforcement.  An Irishman, Mr. Eanna &Oacute; Cochl&aacute;in, was arrested leaving the Laoag Airport and it was claimed he had drugs on him.  He claims they were planted on him.  Since then, he is living in fear and he is hiding because of the campaign by President Duterte and his followers.  This agreement will, therefore, impact on an Irish citizen.</p><p>Considering it was approved by the European Parliament in 2016, why is the Government only bringing the agreement to the Oireachtas during the final week of this session?  It is a fair question.  Everyone is asking about this and what went on in the D&aacute;il earlier in the week.  Does the Minister of State agree the D&aacute;il should at least debate these important framework agreements before it is asked to approve them?  We have not had the opportunity previously to debate such an agreement.  As a new Minister of State, does he accept that should be best practice and the normal practice?  The agreement was reached in 2012 and ratified by the European Parliament in 2016.  A great deal has changed and President Duterte has come to the power.  My difficulty relates to the counterterrorism and anti-crime measures.  The President has openly boasted in media interviews about his own involvement in extrajudicial killings and he is completely unrepentant.  He has no regrets about his involvement.  Human rights groups say this is bonkers and are asking what message this is sending not just to the Philippines Government but other countries around the world.  Why should we ratify an agreement with a country that has such a despicable human rights record?</p><p>I acknowledge the Minister of State will argue that we are trying to move the Philippines on this but if it does not move, what will be the trigger mechanism to stop the agreement?  The human rights provisions are weak and will not be enacted.  Will the Minister of State outline one example of where an EU framework or association agreement with a third country has led to substantial improvement in human rights in that country?  I do not know of one but I can think of many where this did not happen.  I outlined what is happening in Colombia and Israel.  Why will this framework agreement be any different?  These are reasonable questions, which we must ask as part of our role in monitoring these agreements.  The Minister of State referred to Brexit in his opening contribution and positives for trade and so on but we need to look at who we are trading with and why we are trading with them.  If they have a bad human rights record, we should try to avoid trading with them.  This framework agreement will not push the Philippines Government in any direction.  President Duterte is proud and boasts of his own involvement in this activity while one Irishman is potentially facing a long sentence and there could be others in the future.  He says it is the result of corrupt practices, but he has been in touch with us as committee members and his friends here have also been in contact with us.  They are terrified about his safety.  As part of the bigger picture, we are being asked to agree to this framework but I have huge difficulties with it.  When the committee concludes its discussion, a message will be sent to the D&aacute;il stating we have scrutinised it.  I request that the committee recommends that the D&aacute;il debates this framework before it is ratified.  That would be best practice but I do not know if other committee members agree.</p></speech>

I am looking forward immensely to the role and to performing to the best standard.</p><p> Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Se&aacute;n Crowe raised the issue of the delay.  I agree with them that there has been a significant and regrettable delay in terms of our ratification of this agreement.  The agreement was first signed on 11 July 2012, following which an issue arose within the EU.  The conclusion of the agreement was held up by a challenge by the Commission to the choice of a legal basis for the relevant Council Decision.  This continued until June 2014.  Since then, in Ireland, for a number of reasons, including resources, the reallocation of responsibilities between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach and the time taken to form a Government and appoint committees in 2016, the matter was, unfortunately, not progressed until late March 2017.  The delay is regrettable, but it is now important that we make the necessary arrangements for the approval and ratification of the agreement as quickly as possible.  As I said earlier, this will not enter into force until the first day of the month following the date on which the last party has notified the others of the completion of the legal procedures.  I would not like Ireland to be the last group standing in terms of final ratification because we would, in essence, be the final impediment to the agreement entering into force.  It has been ratified by all countries, with the exception of Ireland and Greece.  We should move with as much haste as possible to approve and ratify it.  </p><p> All Deputies raised the issue of the ongoing and significant human rights issues within the Philippines.  While the focus of my earlier contribution may have been on the significant trade opportunities arising from this particular agreement, the agreement is about much more than that.  Concerns had been expressed by the EU, including Ireland, about the deterioration of human rights in the Philippines since 2016.  Many Deputies referred to the large number of extrajudicial killings.  We have continually raised our concerns at a bilateral level and in our contacts with the authorities in the Philippines in regard to the death penalty.  At the most recent 35th session of the Human Rights Council in June last, we delivered a statement in which we raised our concerns about the proposed reintroduction of the death penalty and the number of extrajudicial killings which have taken place in the past year.  We also supported a joint statement delivered by Iceland on the human rights situation in the Philippines, which raised concerns about impunity for violence and killings in the country.  </p><p> I reiterate that the purpose of the agreement is to provide a framework for strengthening a bilateral relationship between the European Union and the Republic of the Philippines.  It is based on a commitment to promoting respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights.  It will provide for a comprehensive ongoing and wide-ranging dialogue between the EU and the Philippines, including co-operation in many areas such as trade, as mentioned earlier, and in the areas of health, civil society, development co-operation, disaster risk management, the environment, climate change, energy, science and technology.  It is a wide-ranging agreement.  I have always argued that in one's attempts to engage with a country that has a very poor human rights track record, one should create that engagement around an ongoing building of trust and a relationship between two entities.  One cannot stand on the sidelines and criticise, and legitimately so.  If one is seeking to engage with a country or any entity and to work with it in changing practices which have been ongoing for decades and are deeply imbedded in its culture, it is essential that one engages with that country or entity at every level and builds relationships that will hopefully allow the parties concerned to address the issues arising, currently, and into the future.  </p><p> This agreement is an incredibly important tool in our arsenal not alone in Ireland, but across the European Union, to address the issues raised.  Without it in place and without the ongoing relationship building, the type of issues about which we are deeply concerned will never be addressed.  That is my view on it.  I agree with what Deputy Crowe said.  If time had permitted, this should have been debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are now at the point where, perhaps, that time is not available to us.  As I said, I do not want us to arrive at the point whereby Ireland is the final country to ratify this agreement.  In an ideal situation, and if the delays to which I referred earlier had not occurred, the most desirable outcome would have been to have it debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised the issue of child slavery and online abuse of children and the incredible work of Shay Cullen in the Philippines through the Preda Foundation.  The rights of children globally remain a priority for my Department and for Ireland.  We have engaged in the protection of children's rights and the elimination of violence against children through our work to address the route cause of gender inequality, to prevent gender-based violence, to strengthen child protection systems and to combat child labour.  We have also provided funding for a number of organisations working on the rights of the child, including UNICEF, the UNFPA and UN Women.  Between 2012 and 2015, we provided funding to Anti-Slavery International of more than &euro;500,000.  Our longstanding commitment to eliminating child slavery is at the core of the work we do.  </p><p> The Deputy also referred to the horrendous exploitation of children that technology allows and is taking place globally.  This is a very difficult area.  If we were to pass a law in this jurisdiction seeking to eliminate such activity, it would have little impact in the Philippines or anywhere else.  The global borderless nature of the Internet allows such exploitation to occur.  Many people are, unfortunately, exploiting this and engaging in the horrendous things mentioned by the Deputy.  All we can do is continue supporting NGOs in particular who work in these regions to eliminate child slavery.  Last week, I had an engagement with one NGO that is working with a number of NGOs in India where child slavery is also an issue.  I was surprised to learn that there are 50,000 charities in India alone working on child slavery, which is extraordinary, and shows just how pressing an issue this is there.  </p><p> Deputy Crowe raised the issue of Mr. Eanna &Oacute; Cochl&aacute;in's ongoing consular case.  Again, the Department is conscious of the interest of a number of Deputies in this particular case.  I assure the committee that the Department continues to work on behalf of this citizen and that this case is a top priority for the Government.  Based on my knowledge of the case, it is a difficult, complex and challenging one.  The citizen has been on bail since his conviction and sentencing in 2013 and he remains on bail.  His lawyer has filed an appeal with the Philippines Supreme Court and we made a representation asking that the appeal process be expedited on humanitarian grounds.  I am pleased to note that the appeal is now proceeding on foot of that request.  At a political level, and through our embassy in Singapore, we have raised our concerns about the case and made a request to the authorities in Manila on a number of occasions that the appeal would proceed as quickly as possible.  The former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, raised the issue with his Philippine counterpart in New York last September and our ambassador in Singapore, who is accredited to the Philippines, followed up, including with a direct letter to the administrator of the Supreme Court, which I understand is highly unusual but we deemed it a necessary step to take.  I am very much aware of the gentleman's ongoing issues and we are working to support him in every way possible.</p></speech>

I note that the Philippines' plan to ratify this agreement in August.  The Minister of State has explained the reason for the delay.  I would like to know if there are any other draft framework agreements coming down the track that will be brought before us at the last minute?  It is wholly inappropriate that the D&aacute;il and the Seanad may not have an opportunity to debate this motion.  The Minister, in terms of his response, has assumed the consent of the D&aacute;il on this motion but it will only be taken in by the D&aacute;il at 6 p.m., without debate.  There are some very important issues arising.  In fairness, if there was ever a draft framework agreement that required debate in terms of how it will work into the future, particularly in light of the changes in the political situation in the Philippines, it is this one yet we are expected to pass it on the nod in the D&aacute;il this evening.</p><p>It is the last week and the D&aacute;il goes into recess for the summer tomorrow.  It is not a situation that we, as parliamentarians, want to be put in.  I do not think the Minister of State does either.  How firm is the timeframe?  It is scheduled to go to the D&aacute;il today without debate.  It is only being considered by the committee in a short hearing, which is wholly inappropriate.  If we really want to look at the ramifications of the agreement and the potential positives and negatives, it requires debate in the D&aacute;il.  It should be put back to September; so what if we are the last.  We are second last at present.  It does not make a massive difference.  There has been no contact from the Minister of State's Department.  I can only speak for my party.  I do not know if Deputy Crowe will agree there was no contact from the Minister of State's office on the urgent need for this to be passed until it was scheduled for today.  Between now and the vote at 6 p.m. this evening, we will have to make a decision on supporting it.  To bring forward an important framework document like this with all the issues associated with it, which Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Crowe and I have highlighted, and to deny our colleagues in the D&aacute;il an opportunity to debate it is not acceptable.  Is there a possibility of deferring it to September to allow a proper debate on it?  We will have to see what we do later today.</p></speech>

Does the Minister have an example?  I do not have one.  It is not a trick question.  I am concerned by the idea that this is put in the agreements as sop to show we are trying to move towards better conditions in the country.</p> <p>  I have listened to the Minister of State's explanation.  The framework was negotiated back in 2012.  It did not come to the European Parliament until June 2016.  The Minister of State said there were all sorts of difficulties.  I do not know what preparation was done for this.  There is nothing wrong with being the last man standing.  It is an honourable position.  It is probably the correct position to be in particularly in light of the fact that one of our citizens is facing serious charges.  I am not saying it should be used to send a signal but it does send a signal that we are concerned about what is happening in that country.  The agreement is also about sharing information on crime and drugs.  There was such an agreement between the EU and Iran on the pipeline for heroin that comes through Afghanistan to Europe.  We cut off that co-operation because Iran has the death penalty.  We could not be convinced about the way the information that was shared would be used so the agreement fell through.  Some of us say it is a key component in seriously fighting drugs.  We could say the same about sharing crime and security information with the Government of the Philippines, which is involved in the extra-judicial killing of up to 7,000 of its own citizens.  Its President is on record boasting about his involvement in it.  I have huge difficulties with it.  Our party will not support it if we do not have an opportunity to debate it in the D&aacute;il.  If the Minister of State cannot give that commitment, that is our position.  It sends out the wrong signals.  </p> <p>  In many countries with which we had framework and partnership agreements in the past, there was huge concern it did not improve the situation or it pushed them in a different direction.  Perhaps the Minister of State can enlighten me on it.  The direction we are taking is all wrong.  It would be good if we were the last country standing in Europe.  If this went to the European Parliament today for ratification, it would not receive it because of the concerns I have outlined.  They are not only concerns of the left.  There are individuals in all groups in the European Parliament who have huge concern about what is happening in the Philippines.</p></speech>

It would have been far more desirable to have this debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That opportunity does not arise right now.  In April, all Departments confirmed that no new legislation was required to ensure Ireland is able to implement the agreement once it has been ratified.  There has been significant interdepartmental collaboration on getting us to the point we are at right now.  There are no other similar agreements in the pipeline but I will give a commitment that we will not arrive at a point again where we are running up to a vote at 6 p.m. without having had an agreement debated in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  It is not the most desirable scenario.  I agree with the Deputy and undertake to ensure it does not happen again as long as I am working with my colleagues in the Department.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe sought examples of inter-country or framework agreements that have secured lasting human rights improvements in the past.  The only comparison one might be able to make is with the expansion of the EU after the fall of the Berlin Wall.  It is not completely analogous to this but the agreements that were formed with countries such as Romania and Bulgaria are the basis for what we are trying to do now with the Philippines.  They were countries in which there were significant human rights abuses back in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  As part of accession to the EU and forming ongoing economic and societal relationships, those issues had to be addressed.  They were addressed through engagement and by building bilateral and multilateral relationships with these countries.  What is the alternative to not forming this agreement with the Philippines?  It has been ratified by virtually every other country in the EU.  I would like Ireland to be inside the fence of that ongoing engagement in order that it is able to interact with the Philippines at the highest level with the support and backing of the EU.  In that way, we can address the very issues the Deputy raised because it is a far more productive use of our time and diplomatic power to be able to engage and change culture.  I agree with the Deputy that it will take a very long time but the alternative is not being part of the process.  We have much to bring to the table and much expertise that we have built up over the years to be able to play a very productive part in slowly but surely addressing these major human rights issues.</p><p> Did I leave anything out?</p></speech>

However, the countries that are relevant to this discussion are not seeking to join the European Union and not subject to European human rights law.  There is a difficulty in that regard.  I gave as an example what was happening in Gaza.  There are war crimes and the world is looking on helplessly.  Meanwhile, we have a favourable trade agreement with Israel and have not really been able to do anything to this day, but we know what conditions are like in Gaza.  I can also give as an example what is happening in Colombia where trade unionists, land activists and so on are being assassinated, but, in its wisdom, the European Union decided to go ahead with the agreement.</p> <p>  I do not want to argue with the Minister of State; I just think what we are doing is wrong.  While I am conscious of Irish citizens, I am also conscious that we need to stand up to these regimes.  What is the worst case scenario?  At worst, we would not have this agreement, but Ireland would have stood up for human rights.  It is not only about the people who are impacted on directly, it is also about Irish citizens.  On the information we are going to share with the Philippines Government and its security organisations, what they are doing is wrong and I do not think it can be justified by anyone.  They are not even bringing people to court.  They are killing them on the streets and in their homes.  They are extrajudicial killings.  Someone is making that decision and it is wrong.</p> <p>  I have outlined my position.  The Minister of State says there cannot be a discussion on the framework agreement.  It is not the first to be left until the last minute in order that we do not have an opportunity to discuss it.  It is the wrong way to do things and another agreement that will slip through, although I welcome the Minister of State's commitment that it will not happen in the future.  It may not happen under his watch, but it may happen under another Minister's.  It is something we all accept that we need to address.  There was enough time since March to discuss the agreement in the D&aacute;il.  We know for a fact that there were times when there was no legislation being brought forward and nothing was going through the D&aacute;il.  There were long gaps during which we could have had this debate.</p></speech>

As well as reporting back to us on whether there are other framework agreements coming down the tracks, will the Minister of State also have the Department make some analysis of the benefits, if any, that have flowed from previous framework agreements, particularly in the areas of civil and human rights, as referred to by Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe?  Again, I emphasise to the Minister of State the need to keep emphasising in all of the fora available to him and the Department the intolerable human trafficking and exploitation of women and children and the extrajudicial killings referred to by all of our colleagues.  Every opportunity must be taken to deplore such deeds and make our very serious concerns known about the unacceptable treatment of innocent people in the state in question.</p> <p>  I again thank the Minister of State for his engagement with the committee.</p></speech>

NAMA was created as one of a number of policy responses to the financial and banking crisis.  It was never intended that it would be a permanent feature of the landscape.  NAMA was mandated by the Oireachtas in late 2009 to deal expeditiously with its acquired loan portfolio and to extract best value from that portfolio.  It was widely accepted that its mandate was to be fulfilled over approximately one decade rather than decades.  This was the understanding of the EU Commission when it approved the NAMA scheme in February 2010.  As market conditions reverted to normality, it was assumed that NAMA would no longer be required.  NAMA has now entered the final phase of its work - its  wind-down - which involves completing our remaining deleveraging activity and implementing our residential delivery programme and Dublin Docklands SDZ programme.<br/><br/>Under the NAMA Act, it is a matter for the Minister for Finance to determine when NAMA has completed its work.  Current expectation is that our work will be largely completed by 2020.  Based on this assumption, our focus for the next three years will be threefold.  First, to maximise the return to the State from our remaining loans; second, subject to commercial viability, to facilitate the development of residential sites that secure our loans and, third, subject to commercial viability, to facilitate the development of sites in the Dublin Docklands SDZ that secure our loans.  I will give a brief overview of each of the three objectives. <br/><br/><b></b>On maximising the State&rsquo;s return<b>,</b>we last appeared before this committee in December 2015.  The intervening period has seen very good progress made on our key debt redemption objective.  We redeemed &euro;5.5 billion of senior debt in 2016 and another &euro;2.1 billion in the first half of this year.  Our senior debt is now down to &euro;500 million, less than 2% of the &euro;30.2 billion originally issued.  We expect to redeem that residual &euro;500 million senior debt later in the year.  In my view, elimination of this State guaranteed contingent liability for Irish taxpayers is a significant achievement, particularly bearing in mind the widely aired commentary in 2009, and in some years since, that NAMA would lose billions over its lifetime.  We take pride in the fact that our senior debt has been, to all intents and purposes, redeemed and that this has been achieved three years ahead of the 2020 target date originally envisaged.  This is a major burden which an already heavily indebted State could not have carried.  Furthermore, the progress that was made in reducing the senior debt by two thirds, &euro;20 billion, between 2014 and 2016 was a factor in enabling Ireland to re-access the debt markets and in stabilising and reducing the funding cost of Ireland's debt.  We expect to redeem our subordinated debt of &euro;1.6 billion by its first call date of March 2020 and, assuming that the cash proceeds realised from our remaining loans are in line with our current projections, we would hope to be in a position to transfer a surplus of about &euro;3 billion to the Exchequer when we complete our work.  I should point out that there is much work left to be done if we are to realise this &euro;3 billion.  The carrying value of the overall loan portfolio at the end of 2016 was &euro;4 billion and approximately 60% of this related to the residential delivery and Dublin Docklands SDZ programmes.  The other 40% of the loan portfolio was secured for the most part by a large volume of low-value assets, many of which will require close and rigorous workout if their value is to be optimised.  To date, the resolution of some of these assets has been delayed by litigation or by other complications. <br/><br/><b></b>On residential delivery, the second major focus for us over the coming years will be to facilitate residential delivery.  In late 2013, we were asked by the then Minister for Finance if we could facilitate and fund the delivery of 4,500 homes by end-2016.  This target was exceeded.  We remain committed to facilitating and funding much-needed housing delivery in the period to 2020.  Estimates of housing supply requirements now indicate that Ireland will need 30,000 to 35,000 new units annually in the coming years. Taking the period 2017-2020, we estimate that NAMA debtors and receivers, even operating at full capacity, can deliver only about one-seventh of the 120,000 to 140,000 units that will be required over that period.  It is clear that the market is responding to this need.  New residential funding and delivery platforms are being established on a regular basis but no one expects supply and demand to be in balance for quite some time.  From our perspective, much progress has been made in terms of preparing a pipeline of sites for development.  In addition to the 5,300 units delivered to date, another 9,200 units are either under construction or have obtained planning permission.  Sites with a delivery capacity of another 9,500 units are either in the planning system or will be within a year.  Pre-planning and feasibility work is under way on sites which have a delivery capacity for another 17,000 units.  We continue to work towards maximising the delivery of social housing from properties controlled by our debtors and receivers.  We offered almost 7,000 vacant houses and apartments owned by our debtors and receivers to the Housing Agency.  Demand was confirmed for 2,768 of these properties and, to date, almost 2,400 units have been delivered.  In total NAMA&rsquo;s expenditure on social housing - through drawn and committed payments - amounts to approximately &euro;330 million.  This includes costs incurred by our NARPS vehicle in purchasing units for onward lease to housing bodies and local authorities.  It also includes capital expenditure incurred on the completion of housing units including fit-out costs and, where necessary, remediation costs. <br/><br/><b></b>On the Dublin Docklands SDZ, a third major focus for NAMA over the next three years will be to facilitate the development of our interests in the Dublin Docklands Strategic Development Zone, SDZ.  This area has the capacity to deliver 4 million square feet of commercial space and over 2,000 residential units.  Again, much progress has been made over recent years.  Construction has started on sites which are expected to deliver 1.92 million square feet of commercial space.  Planning permission has been obtained for another 620,000 square feet.  Pre-planning work is under way on another 760,000 square feet.  As regards the other 700,000 square feet of commercial space, one project has been completed and we have sold our interest in the other projects.  A positive aspect of this activity is that most of the development work being carried out in the Docklands SDZ is being funded through private capital.  We have achieved our objective of acting as a catalyst for development without putting taxpayers' money at risk on any major scale.  Development of the Dublin Docklands SDZ will not only enhance the commercial return on our acquired loans but will also make a significant economic contribution by increasing the supply of prime office accommodation, thereby helping to attract foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland. <br/><br/>With NAMA phasing down its activities over the next three years as we realise the last &euro;4 billion of our portfolio and with alternative employment opportunities readily available for many of our staff, we face a major challenge in retaining the expertise necessary to complete our work.  As members may know, the majority of NAMA staff are employed on specified purpose contracts and, accordingly, have limited job security.  The voluntary redundancy programme approved by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, in 2014 has been effective to date in stemming what could otherwise have been a major exodus of staff but, with a very strong economy and construction and associated skills in strong demand, it is a challenge every day to ensure that we continue to deliver on our objectives. <br/><br/>Over the coming year, we look forward to co-operating fully with the commission of investigation into the disposal of the Project Eagle loan portfolio.  We note that the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference provide that it will avail of appropriate and independent commercial and financial expertise to inform its investigation.  From our perspective, the fact that analysis of a major loan sale is to be informed by relevant expertise is indeed welcome.  I do not accept the view that NAMA moved too quickly in terms of asset and loan sales and in terms of redeeming its senior debt.  This is not the view of everybody, I know, but it is the view of some people.  We had to take advantage of favourable market opportunities when they presented themselves.  In the case of the Irish market, market recovery began tentatively in 2012 before gathering pace in the subsequent years from 2014 onwards.  Given the vast scale of our exposure, we had no alternative but to reduce our exposure on a phased and orderly basis.</p><p>Failure to take advantage of the recovery would have been highly irresponsible, particularly in a small market such as Ireland that is very exposed to adverse financial and market developments elsewhere.  There was no certainty at any point in 2014 and 2015 that market conditions would remain positive in Ireland or in the United Kingdom.  The folly of assuming prolonged favourable market conditions is clearly illustrated by the outcome of the UK Brexit referendum and its impact on the UK commercial property market.  Those who say that we moved too quickly would have a different tune now if we had missed the boat.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017071300002#F00200"><p>The committee invited us today to discuss the operations and functioning of NAMA, including the recently-published 2016 annual report and financial statements.  I am pleased to report we generated a profit of &euro;1.5 billion in the 2016 financial year.  Taking into account the profit of &euro;1.8 billion reported for 2015, this brings to &euro;3.3 billion the cumulative profit reported since we last appeared before this committee in late 2015.  This strong performance reflects the impact of market recovery but also the detailed, professional asset management and corporate finance work that had been put in place by NAMA in earlier years towards enhancing asset values through focused planning work, remediation and capital expenditure.</p> <p>  Since we last appeared before the committee, we have redeemed &euro;7.6 billion in senior debt.  That leaves only &euro;500 million to be redeemed later this year from the original &euro;30.2 billion that we issued in senior debt.  The &euro;30.2 billion has been redeemed from cash generated by debtor asset sales and by NAMA loan sales.  The reason we no longer have a contingent liability of &euro;30 billion potentially falling on Irish taxpayers is that international and domestic investors have invested heavily in Irish property assets since Ireland exited the troika programme at the end of 2013.  That has enabled NAMA to generate almost &euro;40 billion in cash from inception to date, including &euro;5.4 billion generated in 2016.  The carrying value of our loans at the end of 2016 was &euro;3.9 billion and over 80% of our residual exposure is to assets located in Ireland.  Our exposure to UK assets is now relatively low.  When we acquired loans from banks, the associated UK asset portfolio was valued at over &euro;12 billion; that portfolio has now fallen to less than &euro;600 million.</p> <p>  With regard to our residential delivery programme, part of NAMA&rsquo;s residual loan portfolio is secured by sites that have capacity to deliver houses and apartments in the years ahead.  There has been much talk of the shortage of housing in urban areas and the reasons supply has been slow in responding.  In my view, the principal explanation for the supply shortage was that residential prices fell by over 50% between 2007 and 2013 and only in recent years has it become commercially viable to build houses again.  No funder, be it NAMA, banks or otherwise, could have funded the building of housing unless it was profitable to do so.  Apartment schemes are still very challenging to fund given the planning requirements and restrictions.  Our role in residential delivery must be understood in that context.  To the extent that we fund any residential development by our debtors, it is to ensure that we maximise the return from the sites and thereby maximise the debtors' debt repayment.  We will only fund residential development that is commercially viable; which is under the control of co-operative debtors and receivers; and, importantly, which is under the control of debtors who have a proven capability to deliver quality houses and apartments.  Sites which do not meet these criteria and the loans secured by them are subject to sale.  We can only fund residential development projects that generate a better commercial return through funding than they would generate from alternative options such as the sale of the sites concerned.  A debtor or receiver will want to maximise the debt repayment and therefore it is important that the management and disposal of the asset yields the highest return.</p> <p>  There has been some commentary to the effect that NAMA should not sell its interest in residential sites to international funds and that instead any sales should have been restricted to domestic developers.  The reality is that under our legislation, we could not have limited the field of potential buyers if the effect of doing so was to reduce the sales proceeds generated by sales.  In any event, these funds bought less than 40% of interests in sites sold and they did so mainly through loan sales.  Crucially, under our section 10 objective, we cannot refuse to sell to funds or any other financial institutions that submit the best bid for the asset concerned.  We are obliged to get the best price.  This is normally achieved through open marketing of loans and assets.  We depart from the open marketing policy only if a better price can be achieved through a more restricted sales process.</p> <p>  It has also been suggested that as part of its asset and loan sales, NAMA should have imposed covenants requiring purchasers to develop sites within certain predetermined periods.  There are two difficulties with such an approach.  The first is that it would have led to discounts on the prices achieved on the assets and sales concerned.  The second relates to the doubts as to the enforceability of such covenants; I am not convinced one can force a purchaser to develop a site if he or she considers it unprofitable to do so.  We have a number of licensing arrangements in place and are actively reviewing the feasibility of other potential licences. Generally speaking, licensing arrangements are suitable for sites controlled by receivers.  They usually involve smaller builders who acquire the development rights by paying a small amount upfront and who then build out the sites and pay us as houses are sold.</p> <p>  For reasons I outlined, we fund sites that are commercially viable to develop and which are under the control of co-operative and capable debtors.  We have and will continue to dispose of our interest in other sites.  Since inception, we have disposed, either through loan sales or through asset sales by our debtors and receivers, of sites with a capacity to deliver 50,000 units.  Approximately 38% of these interests have been sold to financial institutions or funds; the remaining 62% have been sold to developers and other private purchasers.  The committee may have noted from recent media coverage that some of the funds and financial institutions have established, or are preparing to establish, residential development operations with a view to actively funding the delivery of new supply.</p> <p>  We estimate that, at this stage, more than 50% of the 50,000 unit delivery capacity disposed of by NAMA is commercially viable to develop, although it is difficult to be certain about this in the absence of detailed project-by-project information.  Approximately 10,000 of these units had planning permission or were in the planning system prior to sale.  To our knowledge, only approximately 3,700 have been built or are under construction to date.  Why are so few being delivered?  In the short time available here, I will outline some of the many factors that are at play.  There is no doubt that land hoarding is an issue, although it is not the full story.  For any given site, there is little disincentive to hoarding as long as the owner expects house prices to rise.  Costs remain relatively fixed, as illustrated by the table in my submission, and any rise in house prices translates into profit on land.</p> <p>  The fact that planning permission has been obtained does not make development viable in itself.  Construction costs remained relatively stable during the financial and property crisis as prices collapsed.  Therefore, the key factor in determining viability now is the sales prices that can be achieved on newly-built houses and apartments.  In some cases, prices have risen sufficiently to make development viable but this is not necessarily the case throughout the country.  For many residential sites it is not possible to proceed until such time as critical infrastructure is in place, including roads, sewerage and water services, schools and recreational amenities.  The introduction of the local infrastructure housing activation fund programme is a welcome move in this respect.  There are particular difficulties with the viability of developing apartment blocks which are, at best, commercially marginal at present.  We need to build many more apartment blocks if we are to make a serious impact on new supply.  Height restrictions that apply under current planning policy have an impact on the viability of commercial apartment development.  In some cases, statutory development plans set a height restriction that is less than the most cost-effective scale.  A city centre apartment development project that is not commercially viable at six to seven storeys is more likely to be commercially viable at 12 to 15 storeys, for example.  The height restrictions currently applied, particularly in city centre locations, are no longer appropriate given current and prospective housing needs.  Amending height restrictions to 15 storeys in city centre locations and perhaps to ten storeys in suburban areas merits serious consideration.</p> <p>  The provision of basement car parks can add considerably to the development cost of an apartment project.  Most urban apartment schemes require basement parking as a condition of planning, usually on the basis of a car space for every two apartments.  Basement parking costs are estimated, on average, to add about &euro;30,000 per car space to development costs, and that must be added to the recovered price.  Greater flexibility in the exclusion of expensive car parking requirements would improve the commercial viability of certain apartment schemes, particularly in city centre locations or locations already well served in terms of access to good quality public transport.</p> <p>  Finally, it is worth mentioning there are practical reasons the market can be slow to respond to supply shortages.  In practice, the development process from initial site assessment to the start of construction takes at least two years.  It involves assessing a site, resolving issues relating to services or legal title, employing a design team, completing pre-planning consultations, lodging a planning application, dealing with additional information requests from a local authority, awaiting planning permission, raising construction finance, tendering to construction firms, appointing a construction team and then starting to build.  That two-year timeframe assumes all goes well but in many cases there are delays that may be caused by planning refusals, objections, legal problems or funding shortages.</p><p>After the preparatory period of two years or more, building commenced with the start-up phase and initial site works for roads and other infrastructure, and thereafter the completion of even a 100-unit housing scheme can take 18 to 24 months.  For these very practical reasons, the house-building deficit is unfortunately not going to be resolved quickly.</p></speech>

I have a different assessment of the role of NAMA over the past period, close to a decade at this stage.  I want to inquire along two different lines which I think probably relate to both Mr. Frank Daly and Mr. Brendan McDonagh.  One is on the role of NAMA as an enabler of vulture funds, facilitating their control of large swathes of land and their lack of building on large swathes of land, thereby contributing to the housing crisis that we have, as well as their treatment of tenants.  The second question is on the massive write-down of debt, which was not envisaged when NAMA was originally set up or at least was not publicly stated, to some of the richest people, mostly men, in Ireland.</p> <p>  On the first line of inquiry, which relates to Mr. Brendan McDonagh, I appreciate that he is responding to criticism.  His response is to say that there is nothing NAMA can do and that it could not have put conditions into its sale of portfolios of loans or land to vulture funds insisting that houses would be built within a certain period of time, because that would be in contravention of its section 10 obligations under the National Asset Management Agency Act.  Is that accurate?</p></speech>

Section 2 is referred to as an overall guiding principle, and included in the overall guiding principle is the point about contributing to the social and economic development of the State.  That is one of the principles of NAMA.  It is not simply about getting the largest amount of money in the shortest amount of time.  It is meant to have an aim of contributing to the social and economic development of the State.  Does Mr. McDonagh not accept that there are at least grounds to make an argument there that NAMA could have imposed some conditions as opposed to just selling off all this land and loans to vulture funds?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1232" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017071300002#G00500"><p>On our sales to vulture funds, while I understand the Deputy's position, we wanted to take advantage of the capital coming into Ireland.  The funds were coming here to buy portfolios.  They were buying portfolios all across the world, including in the UK and in Europe.  They came to Ireland.  They were not here up until 2014.  They arrived here in 2014 and their first real foray into deploying much capital in Ireland was in the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  Once a fund bought a large amount of the IBRC, other international funds came in on the back of people who bought funds from IBRC and bought funds from NAMA.</p> <p>  In any portfolio that one sells, one sells different types of assets, and some of that is land.  As I said in my presentation, a potential 20,000 units of the 50,000 sold were bought by these funds.  These funds are not long-term holders of these assets.  That is not their business model.  Their objective is to get their money back quickly so that they can negotiate to sell down the portfolio on a piecemeal basis.  A thing which these funds do which NAMA cannot do is to sell the assets back to the original debtor.  That allows the original purchaser to refinance it at times.  The fund having it is only a staging post, because it is never going to be a long-term holder.  It is going to be sold on to somebody else, so it is going to come back into the system at some stage, because these funds, with international capital raised from US colleges, endowment funds or international pension funds, do not want to hold land in Ireland long-term.  They have bought the asset at a price and are trying to make a profit on selling that asset again.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised an issue about tenants.  We have seen much commentary on this, and we have never sought to empty properties of tenants when they are being sold.  Some of the properties, which have been emptied of tenants claimed on the back of these funds, have been of loan portfolios which were never in NAMA, but were sold by other banks.</p></speech>

We have never said to people that they need to get out of a property.  That is not policy and many times, in fairness to the debtors, if somebody is renting the property and debtors have been getting income from that, they would always have the view that they would not evict somebody.  Receivers have a different view on that, are independent of NAMA and operate independently, but we have never asked anybody to remove tenants from a property prior to sale.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second point, the write-down of debt, from our point of view, we bought &euro;74 billion worth of loans and paid &euro;32 billion because the assets were only worth that.  We try to get back as much of the &euro;74 billion as possible but the reality is that we have gone after debtors.  We took &euro;800 million of additional assets from debtors as part of working with NAMA.  Some had transferred loans to third parties, and we went after them legally and forced them to hand them back.  Others gave up the unencumbered assets voluntarily.  It is only when the debtor has sold all the assets and has no other residual assets left that we get a sworn statement of affairs and we do asset searches on people, and think about the possibility of writing-down debt.  Much of our debt write-down has happened because of another legal process.  When somebody goes bankrupt, that person's debt is effectively written off, because that is what happens in a bankruptcy process, and if all the assets have been sold, one cannot go after a debtor that has gone through a bankruptcy process.  We have written-down very little debt to date.  Of the &euro;32 billion that we paid, to date, we have only written off about &euro;230 million where there was no prospect of recovery.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the debate on the Summer Economic Statement has taken many of our members away, so we have a bit of time.  On the issue of the vulture funds, putting the legal matter aside for a minute, does Mr. McDonagh accept that there is a problem when a large portion of NAMA's sales of large portfolios has gone to international funds?  Mr. McDonagh does not really think that it is a problem because they will only hold on to it for a short period of time and it will come back to someone in any event.  Does Mr. McDonagh not accept that it is a contributing factor to the hoarding of land and absence of development that is taking place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1236" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017071300002#G00900"><p>No.  Some 60%, 30,000 of the 50,000 sites, have actually gone to other types of buyers, and they are equally culpable of hoarding land, as much as anybody else.  I said this is the long-term report and I put this graphic in today, but if I could take the Deputy back to that graphic, I was trying to illustrate it in a hopefully very straightforward and simple way for people.  If the Deputy looks at the graphic on page 4 of my presentation, and the middle bar there, that is the base case house price.  If one has a house for sale on the market for &euro;275,000, then the site value in that instance, which is the red box, depends on where the location is, but could be &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000.  It depends on the location of the overall component.  If house prices go up by 20%, then everything else stays the same.  The cost of building does not change that much.  The developer profit generally stays the same.</p><p>The guy who has the land, who is hoarding it without doing anything to it, will see the value of the land going from approximately &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 to approximately &euro;125,000.  My point is that with the system, a guy can buy land and effectively hold it back on the expectation of rising house prices.  He does not even have to build a house and he can just sell the land.  It is super profit.  That is something I feel strongly about and it needs to be examined.  Sometimes people who buy land have no interest in building houses.</p><p> Of the potential 20,000 or 50,000 sites bought by these funds, in the two to three-year time horizon, they will end up back in the system.  There must be some incentive if a party has land that is viable for development and a normal profit in building houses can be made.  Given the demand for housing in the system, there must be an incentive to make that party sell the land instead of hoarding it and squeezing it as house prices rise quickly.</p></speech>

We must incentivise it in some way or force the building on homes on land or whatever.  On behalf of NAMA, the witness is effectively saying it is none of his business, which is to make money for NAMA as quickly as possible.  There are two points in that regard.  Does the witness not accept that in selling multi-billion euro portfolios, it tilts towards what the witness describes as international or vulture funds as builders who may have gone through a difficult time or who are getting back on their feet would find it difficult to engage in a bidding process for a multi-billion euro portfolio?  NAMA could have included conditions when selling land that it had to be built on within a certain period but it chose not to do so.  NAMA is contributing to this as well.</p></speech>

We have effectively introduced into the Irish market the licensing system.  Effectively, with some pretty good sites that are ready for building, we have put them on the market and said the value might be &euro;10 million but we do not want it upfront.  The builders could pay &euro;2 million upfront and give us the other &euro;8 million as they build houses, sell them and give us X amount from each house.  We have done that.</p> <p>  We are engaged in a very substantial programme in supporting debtors and trying to deliver 20,000 houses by the end of 2020.  It was not put into legislation in 2009 that NAMA had to be the national housing agency.  We were not such an agency.  Effectively, we were given a distressed portfolio.  That was the focus in 2009.  I was there for all the Oireachtas debates, with 400 amendments going through between September and November that year.  It was all about how to sell these assets, who was going to buy them and if we were ever going to get the money back that we paid for those assets.  We were charged with getting that money back.</p> <p>  We are also trying to get houses built.  If we can get 20,000 units delivered by the end of 2020, we will have contributed to that solution.  I agree it is not enough but we have a capacity issue too in terms of what we can do.  We must sell.  The criticism comes that land is being hoarded and it should be sold into the market to allow people to build.  We have done that.  Some 30,000 of the 50,000 sites are gone into the market.  They are gone not to funds but to others.  The full expectation was that many of those buyers would build but they have not.  I do not know why that is.  Perhaps they are waiting for prices to increase or maybe they could not get development finance.  These are different matters and NAMA is not responsible for them.  We must also raise money to get rid of the contingent liability hanging over the State.  The national debt is at &euro;200 billion according to the National Treasury Management Agency report.  If we have a loss, the Government guarantee would mean it would add to the national debt.  Our objective is to ensure we do not add to the State's already heavily indebted condition.  We are trying to do other things as well.  I understand and respect the Deputy's position but we also try to balance what we are doing with our commercial mandate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017071300002#H00400"><p>I have another question and if I get the chance I will come back in afterwards.  There is the matter of the write-off.  The witness has stated NAMA got all the money back because it is measuring it not against the par value of &euro;74 billion but rather the &euro;30 billion-odd.  At the time NAMA was set up, the then Minister for Finance, former Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated the loans would be pursued for the full original value and interest rather than the price NAMA paid for them.  He stated developers would not be allowed to buy their own loans at a discount and NAMA repeatedly insisted this to be the case.  The write-off is something in the order of &euro;40 billion relative to that par value.  It is huge.  On 25 June, <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>reported that 34 debtors have been permitted to share the upside profits of projects where NAMA owns the debt, with agency negotiations with at least 20 other builders regarding potential deals or debt write-offs.  There are profit-share arrangements taking place between NAMA and developers.  I presume these are developers who have not repaid the money they owe.  They have been bailed out.  It is evident that NAMA has operated as a life support machine for developers to get them back on their feet and even provide profit-share arrangements.  They are being given six-figure salaries, or allowances, effectively.  How is any of that justified?</p></speech>

If it made sense to finish a half-completed development, there would be additional loans to a developer in order to build out and sell properties.  That costs money.  We look at what is the least costly path.  We could appoint a receiver to everything but that will have a cost and the receiver would have no more expertise in building houses than I would.  He would just employ a construction professional, add a layer and charge me a fee for that employment.  If the builder has expertise to build an office block or complete or construct houses, we would pay him or her a reasonable fee to do it.  It would be cheaper than the alternatives.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about recovering the par debt.  I have been living with this for a long time and every day the objective of my team and board has been to recover every penny we can.  We have been quite litigious and gone after people, trying to pursue them in multiple jurisdictions.  Some of these people claim they have no money but have employed very expensive lawyers and accountants.  They have offshore trusts.  We have had to deal with multiple jurisdictions and complications to trace the money trail.  It is expensive but we do it.</p> <p>  In fairness to many debtors, they did not see the crash coming and they do not have the money stashed away that people think they have.  We have been monitoring these people for years.  We do asset searches and check if they have any more assets.  If we hear they have assets they have not told us about, the process usually moves towards enforcement very quickly.  The Deputy spoke about profit-share arrangements.  There were 800 debtors who came to NAMA, with 5,000 parties borrowing into these with the likes of special purpose vehicles hanging out of that.</p><p>We have concluded deals with 34 of them, with 20 under negotiation.  We are trying to maximise the return by seeing if a debtor can bring something to the table to add value over and above what is there.  These things are not entered into lightly but on the basis of adding incremental value to the amount we can return.  Some debtors will not pay off their full, par debt but some have done so and by working with us they have been able to come out the other side.</p><p> There is no one-size-fits-all approach.  It is easy to be popular and close down the whole development community meaning there would be no one around at all but who would get Ireland up and running again now that we need houses, with all the builders kicked out of the game?  There has to be a balance and the board and I are not interested in personalities, but maximising the return from the portfolio.  The developers are not friends of mine and they do not regard me and my team as friends.  It is an arm's length relationship and the more I hear somebody giving out about NAMA, the better I feel about it, because it means we did our job properly.  If people were saying we were great fellows I would be worried that they had pulled the wool over our eyes.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly said he welcomed the expert-led investigation into the sale of Project Eagle.  One of the central questions hanging over Project Eagle was the rush to bundle a large portfolio and sell it off as quickly as possible.  He went on to say he did not accept the view that NAMA moved too quickly in its assets and loan sales and in redeeming its senior debt.  Does that mean he does not accept the basic premise behind the Project Eagle inquiry, namely, that the sale was rushed for political expediency?</p></speech>

The inquiry has terms of reference which are quite broad but which will look at that issue.  During our extensive discussions at the Committee of Public Accounts and with the Comptroller and Auditor General it seemed to us the premise was that we should have held onto the portfolio and sold it piecemeal.  I still wonder who would want to sell such a portfolio piecemeal in Northern Ireland right now, after Brexit.</p> <p>  I do not want to get into the commission of investigation today as it would be inappropriate.  We made our points quite forcefully and at length at the Committee of Public Accounts, over the course of several hearings.  We will co-operate with the commission of investigation and we welcome the fact that one of its terms of reference is to avail of appropriate commercial and financial expertise.  We welcome the transaction being looked at.  There were several things in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and other things came to prominence later about who had held meetings and so on, but the key finding of the report that there was a probable significant loss by NAMA has never been accepted by us.  We did not accept it then and, without intruding on the commission of investigation, we do not accept it now.  We will argue that position before the commission and will provide it with every piece of material we have and for which it asks.</p></speech>

NAMA will obviously state that it got the best deals for citizens, whether the assets were sold to vulture funds or somebody else.  Has any analysis been done into the follow-on profits that have been made by either the vulture funds or whoever bought the assets?  We would then have empirical evidence of the amounts in question, the amounts we could have made had we held onto these assets for another 12 or 24 months, notwithstanding all the variables in the markets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017071300002#J00500"><p>We might also have a figure for the amount that would have been lost had we held onto them.  We do not seek such empirical evidence.  Once we have sold the loans or the assets they are no longer under our control.  There would be no obligation on anyone who buys an asset from us to tell us what they do with it.  One can follow some of this in the media and in the property pages and I believe there would be a very mixed outcome.  Some people will have made a profit, while other people have certainly not made any profit as of yet and are struggling.  It would be something of a fruitless exercise.  Once one sells something, one decides that the price is the best one can get for a loan or an asset and that one would not get more in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>  The overarching point was raised by Deputy Murphy.  We cannot sit around on these loans and assets for ten or 20 years.  The senior debt had to be repaid, a contingent liability on the State, so we had to generate cash and funds and we had to make the investment in the 5,300 houses we have delivered, with a target of 20,000 by 2020.  We have delivered 2,500 social housing units to date and we are going to make a surplus of &euro;3 billion.  We have invested substantially in the docklands, where over 80% of the development area we control is constructed, under construction, has planning or is in start mode.  We could not have done all that if we had sat back and sold nothing.  We had to put stuff on the market.  In doing that, one gets buyers and takes the best price possible, provided one is satisfied that it is value for what one is selling.  There is no point excluding international funds, or saying to someone, "We won't take it from you because you come from the US or the UK and we don't like you".  We were set up as a commercial body and section 10 drives us.  It is not a suggestion but it directs us - it is a mandate to get the best financial outcome we can for the State.  There are all sorts of interactions with social or economic development but the best social and economic dividend we can deliver out of NAMA would be for no debt to be hanging over the Irish people when we have done our business.  We are nearly there - within &euro;500 million of the target - and on top of that we will have delivered some 20,000 houses as well as the docklands, social housing and other bits and pieces.</p></speech>

That is how Irish citizens look at it.  There is an obligation on NAMA to work within the overall State.</p></speech>

The &euro;74 billion is what the developers got from the banks by way of bad lending and bad borrowing.  It was never realistic to expect all of it to come back.  One cannot start with NAMA at &euro;74 billion because that was before we were even a gleam in anybody's eye.  We started with what we paid for the loans, which was &euro;31.6 billion.  We overpaid because &euro;5.6 billion was state aid and when we deliver a &euro;3 billion surplus, the &euro;5.6 billion should be added on from a technical point of view.</p></speech>

We have not let a cent go in respect of which we have not done, and continue to do, our utmost to recover it.</p></speech>

It is difficult for people when they see the likes of Cerberus making a profit of &euro;77 million and paying &euro;1,900 in tax on that.  That is what people are trying to decipher in all this.  Obviously, NAMA will say it got the best deal for the State but we have an obligation to question that, analyse it and examine at the figures behind it, including in respect of the selling-on prices and profits made based on the decisions made by NAMA on behalf of the State.</p></speech>

Every time somebody says that if NAMA had held on to an asset for another year, it might have made more, I say we might have but that we might have made less.  Consider the UK situation.  At one stage, NAMA's loans in the UK amounted to &euro;12 billion.  Right now, we are down to approximately &euro;600 million.  That was a really strategically wise approach by NAMA.  Imagine we were still stuck with assets worth &euro;12 billion in the UK, bearing in mind its current circumstances, the Brexit vote, its current property market and the associated financial uncertainty.  I do not know whether there would be anybody, even on this committee, saying we would be right to hold on to them.  We have done very well out of the UK.

We are an independent board.  If one looks back over the year at NAMA and the evolution of the strategy in NAMA, one notes it has always been our strategy to avail of every opportunity to reduce the debt.  Reducing the debt means putting assets on the market.  The Minister quite correctly used to come to our strategy day every year and he gave us an overall view on Ireland's debt, the markets and the troika.  It seemed to us, as members of a board, that NAMA's contribution to Ireland getting out of the mess it was in would be to get rid of the debt of &euro;30 billion, but it was our decision.  We did not need anyone to direct us, and nobody did.  That is a conclusion we came to as professionals on the board and in the organisation.</p></speech>

There is no direction from the Minister because it is ultimately the Act that is important from our point of view.  It goes back to section 10.

We delivered somewhat more than the 4,500 but it was very much a stretched target.  We could not have done any more than that.  In the same way, we will deliver what we can in the period 2017 to 2020.  We are somewhat constrained because we have to do a viability test before we engage in any funding of housing or anything.  Again, it comes back to section 10.  We cannot fund something that is not going to result in the best financial return for the State.  We cannot fund houses if we do not believe they will sell at a margin that at least returns the cost of funds.</p></speech>

We were set up to take unviable property assets from the banks.  To do that we issued almost &euro;32 billion in debt.  That last thing one wants is for an organisation that has issued that debt, backed up by the State, to take decisions subsequently that are simply going to increase it rather than reduce it.  If one ends up committing to funding projects that are not viable or losing money, one is adding to one's debt rather than reducing it.  The decision was sensible.</p></speech>

That is a policy matter that I am not really mandated or permitted to discuss here at the committee.  We, as with anybody else, recognise the housing crisis in this country.  Under the Act, we are doing our best to contribute to addressing that.  We are contributing a very significant amount of the housing that is currently being built in this country, and we will continue to do so, but while section 10 of the Act is in place we have to have regard to the commercial viability test.</p></speech>

Much of the property was in Dublin and the commuter belt.  Debtors in NAMA had borrowed very little money for building in the regions.  In 2010, just after NAMA was set up, there was talk that debtors' loans with banks with a value of less than &euro;20 million would come into NAMA.  At the time, the Government was preparing legislation to bring it in, and it would have incorporated many of the smaller debtors who had built in the west of Ireland.  When the new Government came to office in 2011, it decided that those sub-&euro;20 million loans would not come into NAMA.  If the sub-&euro;20 million debtor loans had come into NAMA, I suspect that we would see smaller debtors building now.  However, those loans stayed with the banks.  We had very little exposure in the Border, midlands and western region.  Anything we did have, we offered up to the local authorities and the outcome is per the map provided.</p></speech>

Some 2 million people live in Dublin and the commuter belt.  There is good economic activity in Dublin and the surrounding counties.  The position is the same in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  However, the economic activity is not there in other parts of Ireland in which we hold assets.  I come from Kerry.  I met a friend of mine a few months ago who is a carpenter.  He told me that he only had three jobs last year.  The impression is that Dublin is booming but my friend only had three jobs and is now considering moving to Cork.  He said that he would prefer to go to Dublin than Cork, being from Kerry, of course.  His position is that he has to leave to get work because there is no house-building or house extensions happening in Kerry.  Any of the jobs he is getting are small, mostly involving necessary repairs, and there is not enough work for him to support himself and his family.  That is tough.</p></speech>

I was there.</p> <p>  Unfinished housing estates are a good example to the contrary.  A year ago, there were 45 unfinished housing estates in which NAMA had an involvement in and 37 of those were in the regions.  It is not as if we are not paying attention to the regions.  It is the reality of the type of portfolio we inherited.  It is also the reality that there was a predominance of unfinished housing estates in the regions.  In February 2016 we had 37 unfinished housing estates outside Dublin.  As of April 2017, we have ten and these are well on their way to resolution.</p></speech>

We are about to announce our voluntary redundancy programme, which will apply to 14 staff by the end of 2017 and 50 a year after that.  The issue we are having is that with a &euro;4 billion portfolio there is a higher volume of lower-value assets and these involve as much work as the bigger assets.  A big asset can be sold for &euro;100 million, but it might take selling 20 smaller assets in order to reach that figure.  It takes time and effort.  We are working on the special development zones, SDZs, and the raising of the 20,000 units, so by the end of 2018 we will have declined by 40 to 50 staff and a similar number in 2019.  What happens in 2020 depends on whether we can sell down the assets.  We review staff numbers twice a year.  The issue from our point of view is that with unemployment heading towards 6% and the economy heading towards full employment, our staff are getting very good opportunities in the private sector and we are trying to hold on to them.  We are doing our best, and we have managed it so far, but it is not easy.</p></speech>

That is the market and if people can move on and get a pay rise by moving to the private sector, they will take it.  One cannot blame them.</p></speech>

Sometimes we hold them for up to a year for the housing agencies and local authorities but eventually, if they are not taken up, they will be sold, either as individual units or as whole apartment blocks as the case may be.  We had 16,000 units in our portfolio at the beginning.  We now have approximately 4,000 units left.  I saw the most recent figures yesterday evening and of those 4,000, there are only 72 vacant units.

The reality is that there are not that many new cases now.  Many of the cases have been ongoing for years and have been held up or drawn out in various court systems.  To be fair to the Irish court system, we generally move through it reasonably quickly, if not quickly enough - that is certainly the case in the commercial court - but in foreign jurisdictions, cases are subject to their vagaries.</p></speech>

From dealing with someone in Finland, I am aware that a company was set up there called Arsenal, like the football club, which was its NAMA.  It had sold almost all its assets by the mid-2000s but there are still four or five people working there, dealing with litigation which remains ongoing.  It can go on for ever and there are constantly new challenges.  We hope that will not happen in NAMA's case.  We are working towards resolution and we favour mediation.  Due to the fact that the costs are huge on both sides, we always ask if we can do mediation.  Sometimes the other side will not do it but, thankfully, there has been a move towards it.</p></speech>

We generally find it very useful.  Sometimes it is about explaining the respective sides' positions.  Going into court drives up costs for everyone.  The best outcome with mediation is that both sides do not feel as if it has been a victory, that the each feels some pain but at least there is a conclusion to the matter.  We have used it quite a lot this year.  Thankfully, many of the debtors who have sometimes been in long term litigation with us have come to us after a long period and asked to go to mediation.  We did mediation and it has worked out very well.</p></speech>

Ongoing litigation is being pursued by Flow East in the Czech courts.  Flow East also made a complaint to the European Commission.  We had to provide it with substantial information and the Commission has now written to Flow East.  I must be careful about what I say but we got full recovery of all the moneys owing to us.  That satisfied the European Commission, which advised Flow East of the position.  Anyone who wishes to litigate can continue to do so but we did not leave any money behind.</p></speech>

The agent had put the assets onto the market and invited bids.

It made the higher bid after the event.  In terms of the highest bid we can secure for the debtor, if the debtor owes 100 and the asset sells for 90, we still get 100 back from the debtor. In this instance, the debtor paid us back the full amount he owed us.  We did not leave any money behind.</p></speech>

My final question concerns the knowledge that Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh have built up over the years.  As Mr. Daly said, he and one other colleague have been in the organisation since the very beginning. This concerns a policy matter so the witnesses can answer me in that way if they wish, though I hope that they do not do so.  There are major discussions around vulture funds and how NAMA handled the current debt of mortgages left with the banks.  Depending on the timeframe applied and how stretched the mortgages are, that total figure for that debt now amounts to &euro;16.5 billion.  What do the witnesses think of that figure?  Is there any possibility of the State managing it in the manner of benevolent fund or as a co-op agency?  We currently have a Bill on this in the Houses.  This would mean that no profit would be made on it but that the State would just help work out that debt.  Given the witnesses' experience with the banks and with that particular kind of debt, would they consider this a long-term prospect?</p></speech>

That is the real beauty of NAMA.  We still get people who think that we should have left those loans with the banks and that the banks would have worked them out over time.  I do not believe that they would have, in fact, I believe that the &euro;30 billion or &euro;74 billion figure would still be there.  Other than the expertise of the team, one of the beauties of NAMA was the focus.  All we had to do was focus.  We were not worried about other things, about ongoing customer relations, for example.  The approach that commends itself to me is the focused approach.</p></speech>

The issue here is whether something is capable of resolution within a certain period of time. What sort of solutions do we want?  Do we leave people in their homes for a certain period, for example?  Do they then agree to sell after that period, when the kids grow up or when they are ready to downsize or whatever the case may be?</p> <p>  A further difficult aspect to this is the scenario where somebody may have been doing very well in the mid-2000s and took out a mortgage of &euro;2 million to buy a house.  Today that house might only be worth &euro;1 million and the person in question cannot pay off the &euro;2 million mortgage because their earnings have dropped.  Should that person be treated the same as the person earning &euro;40,000 a year who borrowed &euro;200,000 and then could not repay it because he or she lost their job for a period?  Do I personally think that somebody should stay in a house that cost &euro;2 million?  No, I do not.  Do I think that that person should have a home?  Yes, I do.  Solutions have to be found requiring people to downsize in these kinds of situations.  </p> <p>  Things are different when it comes to what we might call ordinary people with mortgage debt due to unfortunate circumstances.  Somebody might have lost his or her job and been left unable to pay, for example, so they get into arrears.  They may unfortunately have paid &euro;400,000 for a house now only worth &euro;250,000, and they are left unable to pay the &euro;400,000 mortgage.  In these circumstances the resolution has to provide for some kind of resizing of that debt, if the person could pay a &euro;250,000 mortgage, for example.  In our experience, this is very simple.  We look at the person's tax returns, earnings and P60s and we can see from that how much he or she can put up.  If a person cannot support a &euro;400,000 mortgage we are never going to get &euro;400,000 back for it anyway.  </p> <p>  There might be a view in the banking system that the house will, in time, go back up to &euro;400,000, and while the bank might be forced by the regulator to take a provision for &euro;150,000, if the economy improves in five years time and prices rise they might be able to write back that &euro;150,000 and the profits will look great.  This does not deal with the problem, however.  </p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's comment, I have engaged a good deal with the European Central Bank with regard to both NAMA and other matters.  All the ECB wants is that the foreign loans come off the banks' balance sheets and that the banks focus on what they should be doing.  A huge amount of energy, however, is being devoted to dealing with a problem that has been around for a long time now.  It is not getting any better.  Generally speaking, in fact, it is probably getting worse.</p></speech>

The agency could relate that to what the vulture funds do, building in the criteria the it wants observed through the process of taking in that &euro;16.5 billion of mortgage debt from the banks.  The likelihood is that a vulture fund might pay &euro;5 billion for the &euro;16.5 billion.  It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the agency could be told to work on that basis.</p></speech>

There could be a solution in finding a different kind of investor to buy that portfolio from the banks.  An insurance company, for example, might come in to buy a portfolio of &euro;16 billion loans for the price of &euro;5 billion.  It might decide to take a longer-term view and work it out over time, settling for an income of 4% to 5% per annum.  There is nothing that cannot be done, Chairman.</p></speech>

They will only pay what the underlying assets are worth.  If the underlying assets of &euro;16 billion of loans only amount to &euro;5 billion, then the vulture fund will only pay the bank that &euro;5 billion.  The vulture fund will then try to earn a return on that &euro;5 billion, generally looking for at least 15% per annum.  That is a very high return.  A longer-term investor, however, might be satisfied with a 5% return per annum.</p></speech>

It is a great privilege for me to be invited to appear today.  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about myself, in the sense of my experience and qualifications, as well as the Pyrite Resolution Board, which I hope to serve as chair.  I will try to answer the committee's questions as comprehensively as I can.</p> <p>  I have spent most of my career working at senior level in local government, including working as Cavan county manager for ten years from 2004 to 2014.  Before that, I was with Offaly County Council and Dublin City Council as director of services and senior executive engineer level.  I worked in all service areas, including housing in particular, where we constructed quite a number of houses during a period when local government did construct a lot of houses.</p> <p>  The first decade of my career was in the private sector as a consulting engineer in large practices in Dublin.  That is particularly relevant in that I understand the mentality of consultants and also managed a lot of contractors in that time.  I hold an honours degree in civil engineering from University College Dublin and have postgraduate qualifications in accountancy, personnel management, public management and leadership.  I am a chartered engineer and a fellow of Engineers Ireland. </p> <p>  For the past three years, since I finished in Cavan, I have worked in leadership development, strategic planning, organisational development and project management with a variety of bodies and boards in the public, private and voluntary sectors.  I am currently chair of several boards and committees including the national rural water services committee, which oversees the whole rural water area, and the national rural water expert group, which allocates the finances.  I was recently chair of the boundary review committees for Athlone and Drogheda.  All of these appointments were made by the Government.</p> <p>  I currently chair a number of other bodies, including Cavan Sport and Leisure Company Limited, a private company running facilities in Cavan, and Cavan Institute, a post-second-level institute with 1,400 students.  That appointment comes to an end in September   I was chairman of Cavan County Enterprise Board from 2004 to 2014.  I serve on the board of the National Library of Ireland and chair its readers' advisory committee, which liaises with the people who use the library.  My academic work includes lecturing in leadership and strategic planning in the Institute of Public Administration at levels 9 and 10. </p> <p>  When I was county manager in Cavan, I focused on strengthening governance processes and oversaw the establishment of the council's first audit committee.  I drew up its risk register and achieved high levels of compliance in all Government and EU audits.  In addressing challenging societal issues, in which I am particularly interested, I achieved a balance, I hope, between facilitating the voice and catering for the needs of citizens - including those in challenging situations - on the one hand and achieving value for money for the State on the other.  By focusing on results and processes, successful outcomes were achieved in many areas and Cavan became an award-winning county in many fields.  My principal focus at undergraduate and postgraduate engineering level was on soil mechanics, a topic very relevant to this post, including dealing with challenging ground conditions.  I understand the construction industry and all its facets and diverse players.  </p> <p>  The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 sets out the respective functions of the Pyrite Resolution Board, PRB, and the Housing Agency.  The Act mandated the PRB to draw up a scheme for the remediation of significant pyritic damage to dwellings, to accept applications from affected homeowners and to direct and oversee the implementation of a pyrite remediation programme.  The pyrite remediation scheme sets out the conditions that must be satisfied to qualify for remediation under the scheme.  </p> <p>  The Pyrite Resolution Board was established by the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government following the commencement of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 on 10 January 2014.  The pyrite remediation scheme was made by the board on 12 February 2014 and amended on 5 February 2015.  This scheme constitutes the framework for the application of the provisions contained in the Act and first came into operation on 13 February 2014.  Its mission statement is "to procure the remediation of certain dwellings with damage caused by pyritic heave of hardcore under floor slabs in a fair, efficient, transparent and cost effective manner."  The committee may be familiar with the terms.  The hardcore is the stone underneath the slabs in a house; it expands and causes these horrific cracks to occur.</p> <p>  The PRB must be acutely conscious of the need to ensure that the expenditure of public funds is managed carefully, consistent with achieving the scheme&rsquo;s objectives.  To ensure value for money, framework panels have been set up for building professionals and building contractors following open tendering procedures and contracts for individual projects are subject to further tendering from these panels.  Exchequer funding provided for pyrite remediation purposes is routed through the Housing Agency and the audited financial statements pertaining to such funds are contained in the Housing Agency&rsquo;s annual report.  There is a partnership approach with the Housing Agency.</p> <p>  The original geographical scope of the scheme was limited to the areas identified in the pyrite panel report of June 2012, namely, the counties of Meath, Kildare and Offaly and the administrative areas of Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council.  The majority of the cases were in Fingal and the second highest concentration was in Meath.  However, during 2014, reports were received of pyritic heave in a number of houses in two estates in the administrative areas area of South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown county councils.  On investigation, the Pyrite Resolution Board was satisfied that damage attributable to pyritic heave was present in dwellings in those developments and recommended an amendment of the scheme to include those areas. </p> <p>  The process works as follows: The Pyrite Resolution Board accepts and validates applications under the scheme and oversees the implementation of the pyrite remediation programme for approved dwellings.  The scale of the programme is determined by the availability of funding and other factors.   The Housing Agency, subject to the direction of the PRB, remediates approved dwellings affected by pyrite and implements the pyrite remediation scheme.  The Housing Agency also assesses and makes recommendations to the PRB on applications from homeowners for inclusion in the scheme.  An audit and risk committee assists the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities and operates to the board&rsquo;s approved terms of reference.  The committee meets quarterly, comprising of a chairman, five board members and one external member with experience in financial accounting.  The board's tasks include overseeing the process I have just described, and ensuring that a robust risk management system is in place. </p> <p>  The funding of pyrite remediation works is from voted Exchequer expenditure, allocated by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  The PRB approves expenditure profiles by the Housing Agency in respect of costs, commitments and expenses to the householders.  In 2016, expenditure on the pyrite remediation programme amounted to almost &euro;27 million, a very significant sum.  </p> <p>  The status of applications at the end of June 2017 are as follows:  The total number of applications that have come in is 1,798.  The number of dwellings under remediation at the moment is 127.  There is a scheme set up whereby a stream of things is happening.  There are about eight stages in the process.  That would be a typical number.  Included in the scheme so far we have 1,309 dwellings.  The difference between the 1,798 total applications and the 1,309 is that a number are awaiting validation.  The number of closed cases is 109, which were not approved for various, mainly administrative reasons.  I can give the committee further details on those cases if members are interested.</p><p> Looking ahead at the next three years, the challenge will be to maintain the progress.  We currently have something that is working quite well but it would need to be assessed and perhaps improved as time goes on.  We want to complete the requisite number of repairs.  The need to deal with applicants fairly, with empathy, objectively and consistently and in accordance with legislation will underpin the work of the board, as it has to date.</p><p> Comprehensive oversight of the complex processes involved in inviting and initially assessing applications, overseeing the work of expert consultants and contractors, focusing on minimising disruption to the families involved and delivering value for money will demand that the board performs its functions efficiently and effectively.  If it happens, a family will leave the house for a 12 week period and expenses will be paid for board.  It is a huge disruption to the family to have mini-JCBs in their living room digging up the floor.  An ever-increasing emphasis on corporate governance will result in ongoing significant focus on this area.</p><p> I hope I have demonstrated to the committee that I have the expertise and corporate governance experience to chair the Pyrite Resolution Board.

He is a very busy man and I am beginning to wonder how he fits everything in.</p> <p>  Reference was made to everything depending on funding.  Total applications are shown  in the statement as numbering 1,798 and the number of dwellings currently being worked on is 127.  This is a huge gap between the figures.  What is the procedure and how does the board decide who is going to get the work done first?  Will everyone who applies and who is told they qualify get the funding?  What role is played by the local authority in this regard and will Mr. Keyes inform the committee if the board works with local authorities?  It is a very good report and maybe Mr. Keyes could fill me in with some answers to those queries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1303" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017071300002#D00300"><p>I thank Mr. Keyes for his presentation.  By the looks of it Mr. Keyes' qualifications are very strong.  I did not know if Mr. Keyes had another job apart from all the different roles he has.  There is a lot there and chairing all of these committees and so on would be very challenging.</p> <p>  I am curious about a number of aspects.   Are there any plans for the Pyrite Resolution Board to look at the mica issue?  This has been a concern, especially in the Donegal area.  We need to look at whether the board's remit can be expanded.  Time without number we have been refused by the Department in trying to deal with this major issue.  Perhaps Mr. Keyes could fill the committee in on that.</p> <p>  A lot of the pyrite problems were mainly confined to the more northern region of the State and we can clearly define those areas.  Is there a plan to expand on those areas?  Outside of those regions we are discovering that pyrite issues are also to be found in the west and a small number of other areas.  I have visited many of the sites and it is a traumatic matter for anyone to have to deal with.  Even though it is roughly a two to three month period while they are out of their homes, it is very challenging for many people.</p> <p>  We speak of the subject in terms of private houses, but there are also many local authority tenants dealing with the same problem, who could number more than those we are currently discussing.  In my area Ballymun, Finglas, Swords and Ashbourne present major problems in this regard.  Will the Pyrite Resolution Board have a role in dealing with public housing?  How will it interact with those people?</p> <p>  I am not sure if Mr. Keyes' role as the chairman of the board, if he is appointed to it, will be a paid role.  I assume he can tell the committee if it is a paid role.  I have found that one of the biggest factors for affected people when it came to the whole process was the procuring engineers and also the associated the costs.  They found it very difficult and some people had to pay between &euro;2,000 and &euro;5,000.  It was very messy.  Maybe this process could be looked at to see if it could better help people.  From speaking with people who have been affected this aspect was really getting to them.</p> <p>  When we look at the amount that has been remediated since the board was set up, I believe we have been a bit slow.  The flagging process means that the lesser affected houses have been left behind to deteriorate as time goes on.  This needs to be looked at also to see if the process can be speeded up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1432" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017071300002#D00400"><p>Mr. Keyes appears to be eminently qualified.  I echo the Senator O'Connor's remark that that Mr. Keyes seems to be a very busy man indeed.  As part of the new role - if I can be presumptuous - are there plans to assist people practically who have, for example, grade 1 pyrite in their homes?  I have looked at this issue and I have been in contact with a lot of families in Lusk and Rush especially.  They have grade 1 pyrite and we can see that in many instances it can lead to grade 2 and to remediation being necessary.  Would Mr. Keyes see the board as having a role in communicating with those people?  Currently they are feeling a bit lost.  They know they have some pyrite but not quite enough to be as bad as their neighbours, for example, who may be getting remediated.  Their houses have not enough pyrite for remediation but these people can see that it is going to go in that direction.  I am interested to hear Mr. Keyes' views on that.</p> <p>  Consider the case where there are three or four houses in a row in a terrace and the first, second and fourth houses are owner occupied but the third is rented.  The first, second and fourth houses are being remediated but for some reason the third is not.  Would the Pyrite Resolution Board have a role in communicating with the house in the middle?  The people on either side would get their dwellings remediated and they fear that the person in the middle would not.  In the context of Mr. Keyes' role as chairman of the board, does he believe that there could be more communication?  People feel they have been left out of the loop and that the board has not been very proactive.  People affected by pyrite feel that those involved in the process have not been very approachable and that there has been insufficient action in this regard.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of the engineers, which deeply concerns me.  It is, of course, necessary to get an engineer's report.  Constituents have told me that where they have initially engaged an engineer the cost was &euro;1,800 to &euro;2,000.  When it becomes apparent that there is more business the costs then go up.  People were paying under &euro;2,000 at the beginning of the process but at the end, when the entire housing estate is looking for engineers, they found the price was going up.  Would Mr. Keyes have a view on whether he would seek powers or have powers to help those in that situation?  They must get the engineer's report because they must find out the extent of any damage.  At the back of all of this are people who bought their houses in good faith and who, like me or anyone else, would not be able to tell that there was a problem on the day they walked in to their houses.  They could not have known and it is not their fault but unfortunately, they are left with the consequences.  I appreciate that funding is important but there are many people who find themselves in a limbo in this respect and who would like to see the chairman and the board reaching out to them to try to bring them into the process a little more.  They currently do not feel part of it.</p></speech>

I would not claim to have comprehensive answers to many of the questions.  I will answer with the knowledge I have and will be more than happy to come back at any time if the committee wants an update on the workings of the board.  In respect of being busy, I do not have any big job.  While I was in the job of county manager, that was very full time.  For the past few years I have been working on the boundary committees, which became a very demanding task in that there were 28,000 submissions in Roscommon which for government in Ireland was an incredible figure.  Each had to be processed and considered.  That was a massive task that ended last autumn.  My role in Cavan Institute is also demanding because the college is very important to the area.  That will finish in the autumn.  With those two big jobs ended I am confident I will have time for this work. </p><p> At the start of the scheme there were 1,798 units and by now 1,309 are either completed or included in the scheme.  There is not a large number waiting.  The ones that are waiting are going through the stream of eight stages, apart from the 101 that have been rejected to date.  In June, for example,  37 applications came in.  There has been a constant flow for the past two years.  Although there is a bit of a gap it is not significant from what I have seen but I will not really know until I get in there.  The flow in is almost equivalent to what is being remediated and processed.  </p></speech>

My understanding is that &euro;500 is allowed for the initial survey if a house is accepted on the scheme.  The engineers employed to do the detailed contract documents are from a panel and they are paid fully by the moneys provided by the board or the State.  If one is not accepted on the scheme one is eligible for those fees.  I will keep in mind what the Deputy says about the fee of &euro;1,800 and try to tease it out. </p></speech>

It must be an incredible experience for people, especially when they are in their first house.  That brings me back to the point about the rented house in the middle of a terrace.  I was not aware that might be the case.  There is a policy to make an effort to do all the houses in a terrace at the same time.  I will see about that.</p> <p>  The word, "communication" came up in several questions here.  It is of the essence.  I will at an early stage look into how the communication is going and whether it can be improved.  People deserve to be communicated with comprehensively.  If that has not been satisfactory to date and I am not saying it is not, we will certainly address it.</p> <p>  My understanding is that the present scheme is predicated on dealing with grade two defects.  There is a category called "grade one with progression".  I cannot give any more answers on that now but I will focus on it at an early stage, to see what is the situation and whether something can be done or if it is necessary.  At the moment the building has to be at grade two.  </p> <p>  I think I have answered everything.  Forgive me if I have forgotten anything. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017071300002#E01000"><p>I thank Mr. Keyes for coming along today.  I come from the pyrite capital of the country and am very interested in whoever runs the board.  Most pyrite has occurred in Fingal because of the quarries located there.  There are three or four estates in Mulhuddart, where I live, within a proximity of 100 m, that are riddled with pyrite, including my estate.</p> <p>  I first became aware of this problem in 2008 or 2009.  The first public meeting was held on the night of the big snowfall in November 2009.  We advertised a public meeting in the estate to know whether pyrite was the problem people were experiencing.  When snow falls in Ireland the country shuts down but 50 people came, even though they thought the meeting was going to be cancelled.  Even within our estate of Castlecurragh, 38 houses were fixed.  Houses all around me are being fixed.  The problem raised of one house here or there is happening everywhere because there is no advertising campaign by the Pyrite Resolution Board, something I requested several years ago, to explain to people what pyrite is and the need to apply quickly.  I went to see the builder last summer.  He was working on a whole block because it happened that everyone there had applied.  It was the only block where everyone had applied.  Some people are still not aware of this problem.  That builder said it is bad practice for him to come in to fix one house and fix the house next door a year later.  That is ludicrous.  He could lift up all the houses for much less if the State was serious about this and not just about saving money initially.  The work could be done so much more cheaply.</p> <p>  It is fine that the individuals have to get their own reports but there is no attempt to advise people.  People in my estate still do not know.  That is something Mr. Keyes needs to consider.  I do not know why there is no explanation of the process on television or social media rather than people being obliged to approach their Deputies.  I think that is why the board is getting 30 applications a month.  In the report we received in advance of the meeting we were told that since the board was set up there have been 1,494 applications in total.  That is a drop in the ocean.  There are 700 units in my estate.  I am not saying they all have pyrite but 100 or 200 might.  There was a single application from 31 developments.  There is hardly only one house in those estates with pyrite.  The board needs to address the advertising immediately.  Some people are attempting to conceal the fact that there is pyrite in their estate.</p><p>I understand that, but it is in no one's interest.  What is in everyone's interest is that this gets fixed.  It took seven years of campaigning by communities, in respect of which the Pyrite Action Group should get a great deal of credit.</p><p> The fund was initially to have been &euro;50 million a year and a levy was to be placed on the construction sector to pay for it.  The CIF and the insurance sector threatened constitutional challenges and, quietly, the then-Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, dropped the levy.  Generally speaking, it has been &euro;10 million annually as a result although I see there was more last year as, perhaps, more people have become aware.  There is meant to be &euro;50 million, however.  We could get all of the pyrite fixed if the fund was put in place and advertised.  That would get this done quickly rather than via the piecemeal approach being taken.</p><p> The issue of stage 1 and stage 2 pyrite is really important.  For example, I live in an estate where there is pyrite.  I have some pyrite but it is not enough to get it fixed.  While it is not causing me a problem, people who want to sell their houses are stuck in this incredibly difficult situation.  It is not the case, as might have been said earlier, that every case will develop.  It is very unlikely because the estate is 15 years old and usually it develops within ten years, albeit it is not ruled out that it might take more time.  Having been to so many houses, I am nearly an expert on it and that is what I have been told.  People like me and other residents who have contacted me, like the woman who was on "Morning Ireland" a couple of weeks ago, are in a difficult situation in that they may have had amber certification.  They do not have enough pyrite to get it fixed but they can also not sell their houses.  While that is fine if they want to rent out the houses, people have to move on.  Not everyone wants to be a landlord.</p><p> This is now the biggest issue facing the pyrite board.  Where there is enough to get it fixed, that is fine.  It will be fixed.  However, I am now worried about all of the other people who do not have enough to get it fixed.  We have to move on and start addressing that issue.  Does Mr. Keyes have any solutions for those people?  Mr. Keyes is from Cavan and I do not know if there have been any pyrite issues there at all.  To the best of my knowledge, there have not.  The problem has been in Dublin, Meath and some other parts of the country.  Mr. Keyes may not have experience on it although he may be able to develop an understanding given his engineering background, which is clearly very helpful.  I am concerned to ensure that he goes out very quickly to the estates where this is happening.  He is very welcome to come to Castlecurragh where I passed JCBs and other equipment as I was leaving.  This is a real problem for people living in estates with pyrite but who do not have enough to get it fixed.  What are they to do?  They are stuck in this limbo.  If the construction levy had been imposed, there would be enough to fix all of the houses.  At the very least, something needs to be developed whereby homeowners can get a certificate to say that pyrite will not develop as a problem.</p></speech>

Deputy Coppinger has raised some fundamental issues and I do not have all the answers today.  I have heard her clearly and I am aware of people with stage 1 or amber status and the difficulties they may be having.  Moving onto the board, I will be looking at how that demarkation is made and drawing conclusions about whether the funding is adequate.  It may be that the brief for the board to address those may have to be changed by way of legislation.  I am not sure yet but that is my impression.  Certainly, I hear the Deputy clearly.  One of the early things I would like to do is visit the estates as she suggests.  I have only seen one house being remediated as part of the preparation for the application but to go out and see some of the stage 1 houses, which I have not seen yet would be particularly interesting.  I would be very happy and willing to do that.</p> <p>  I am not sure about the history of the fund and the levy.  The funding comes directly from the Exchequer now.  Communication and advertising was mentioned earlier and it is key.  People deserve to know what is available.  There is a good news story here as well as a bad news one.  We have done a great job as a State to address this as well as the fact that there is a big gap there.  Sometimes, we do not tell people what we do when we are focused on the problems.  I will be looking at that early in the course of my tenure.</p> <p>  My vision is to try to help the people who are in this awful situation, balanced with the funding that is made available to the board.  It is an awful position for people to find themselves in.  The board has done a good job so far but we will be reassessing its role and efficiency if I go in.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Keyes satisfied that they will prevent pyrite again?  Are they sufficiently vigilant from the quarry to the site?  I have spoken to some engineers who think they are inadequate.  If he is successful in his role, that may be something we can discuss with Mr. Keyes in greater depth in six months' time.  I have been told by some that they think this may happen again.</p></speech>

When we look at local authorities and the amount of pyrite we are experiencing, I fear we have another problem having looked at an estate the other day.  I first I encountered this going back to 2006 and 2007 at Avila Park in Finglas.  I knew there was something very serious albeit I did not know it was pyrite.  I got engineers out and it took us two years to figure out what it was.  The true figures are staggering when one takes the public and private estates into account.  I do not think we have done a full audit to determine how serious this is and the potential for further issues.  As Deputy Coppinger said, there are some houses which have a certain amount of pyrite but that could activate further down the road.  The potential is still there.  To ignore those and just walk away from people in a different category because it is currently less serious will be done at our peril.  Those people may face serious problems down the road.  We have to look at that more carefully and not just dismiss people where one category is more serious than the other.  We must tackle both categories.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to today's meeting to discuss Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  Mr. Anthony Flynn from Dublin City Council and I will outline the progress made to date on Rebuilding Ireland in the case of Dublin City Council.  The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive is operated by Dublin City Council and oversees the delivery of a range of homelessness services on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities.  We provide a co-ordinated response to the needs of both families with children and individuals experiencing homelessness.  Our functions are to direct client services through placements, allocations and provision of facilities, including operation of the housing assistance payment for homeless households; corporate support including finance, research and communications; and sectoral development and co-ordination through training and learning and provision of integrated services and quality standards.</p> <p>  Our first role is tenancy protection.  Prevention is better than cure.  We have had a tenancy protection service in place since 2014 and it has been very successful.  In the period from January to March 2017, 805 households contacted the service.  Of the 405 that were at risk of homelessness, 356 tenancies have been protected to date and the remainder are being worked with.  None has entered homelessness.</p> <p>  In addition, we have had a specific prevention team at Parkgate Hall to deal with new families presenting there since February.  These prevention officers work with the families who present daily to prevent them from entering emergency accommodation by assisting them directly with their housing situations.  To date, this has prevented another 150 families from entering homelessness.  The success of the initiative is driven largely by the homeless HAP scheme.</p> <p>  Regarding family homelessness, I have outlined in the report the trends in respect of homeless adults accessing emergency accommodation and where they are housed.  The table on page 2 shows the drop in the use of hotel accommodation and the upward trend in the use of emergency accommodation - that is, supported temporary accommodation units, STAs, which are the family hubs.  Under Rebuilding Ireland, the use of commercial hotels by homeless families was to be phased out by the middle of this year except in emergency cases.  At the end of October 2016, 813 family households were in emergency accommodation in commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  Between then and the end of June, 842 households were moved to more appropriate accommodation.  It is expected that a further 533 families will be moved over the period from July to September.  The breakdown of this is outlined in the report.  It is important to note that on average, 80 families per month are entering homelessness despite the effort to prevent this.</p> <p>  The family hubs have been in the media over the past few days again as we opened the latest one in Drumcondra this week.  The intention is that family hubs will be the first response for families that become homeless and currently have no alternative other than commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  Family hubs are not a long-term housing solution.  Families will move into houses and apartments when they become available.  In the hubs they will be provided with support to work them through to more permanent-type accommodation that is suitable for families.  The details of the family hub facilities currently planned, under development or in operation are outlined in the report.  We will continue to source alternative and additional properties to add to the stock of family-appropriate emergency accommodation.  In addition to what I have outlined, eight commercial properties throughout the region are being adopted as family accommodation and will cater for nearly another 300 families.  All families in hubs retain their priority on the relevant social housing lists and will be allocated homes when they become available.</p> <p>  I have outlined in the report the rough sleeper count as of April 2017.  The spring count showed 161 persons confirmed sleeping rough on the night in question.  Of that figure, there were 23 sleeping on Henry Street who were non-Irish and who, as we discovered later, had arrived in the country in the previous days.  A majority of those have repatriated.  We have worked with them through our housing first and outreach teams and they have returned to their country of origin.</p> <p>  The number of nightly placements into emergency accommodation for each quarter in the Dublin region is set out in a table in the report.  On average, we place 243 people into emergency accommodation every night of the week.  This has decreased because of the way in which we are operating the system.  There has been a reduction in the number of placements as a result of our "rolling bed" initiative, by which people who present for one-night-only beds regularly are booked in for longer periods and prioritised for access to supported temporary accommodation that becomes available.  While they are in the temporary accommodation, a kind of case management system works with them.  This reduces the need for individuals to ring the freefone number every day and links them into the services more efficiently.  In line with the key actions in Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness to ensure an adequate supply of accommodation, the DRHE will continue to source additional premises in the Dublin region for use as emergency accommodation for both families and single persons.</p> <p>  I will hand the committee over to Mr. Anthony Flynn to continue.</p></speech>

I will give an update on Dublin City Council's social housing action plan in the context of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.</p> <p>  Regarding pillar 1, as the committee will be aware, the Government's initiative for rapid-build housing is for the early delivery of housing across the four local authorities.  In Dublin city we have delivered 22 units, and 131 will be made available starting in the next ten days.  Allocations have been made and we are in the process of awarding the tender for the next 70 units, which we anticipate will be on site in the month of August, with a view to having two schemes completed by the end of this year and one scheme early next year.  We are also bringing a proposal to the city council with a view to commencing a volumetric - that is, multi-storey - rapid-build housing programme.  Basically, they are apartments.  We anticipate we will get a yield of approximately 500 units from that programme.</p> <p>  Our targets that were set in the 2020 programme are set out in the table in the report.  We were asked to deliver 3,347 social housing units.  We anticipate we will deliver 6,480 units and have already delivered 5,147 units, as broken down in the table on page 8 of the report.  Our allocation was &euro;292 million; to date, we have spent &euro;420 million.  There is also provision for the completion of 453 social housing units in the remainder of 2017 and these are listed in the report.  We have also received confirmation that there will be funding for a number of schemes, which are again outlined in the report.</p> <p>  Regeneration works are ongoing for the refurbishment of 143 homes in Dolphin Park and Dolphin House and we will issue tenders for regeneration projects in St. Teresa's Gardens, Ballybough Road and Croke Villas this year.  We have spent &euro;24 million on returning void properties to use, and 2,316 have been returned to stock, with a current vacancy rate of 1.56%.  I have provided on pages 9 to 13, inclusive, an outline of the progress of our schemes in the context of the four-stage capital works management framework process.</p> <p>  Regarding pillar 3, concerning the building of more homes, the council has developed a housing land initiative scheme for its lands on Oscar Traynor Road, O'Devaney Gardens and St. Michael's Estate, Emmet Road, which will yield 1,646 homes, of which 385 will be social housing.  The prior information notice is out for those three schemes and a pre-qualification questionnaire notice will be on eTenders in the next two weeks.  The social housing public private partnership pilot scheme is also ongoing in the city and will yield 220 units in two schemes, both of which are at Part 8 stage.</p><p>The multi-unit housing developments sites, which are large public and private landbanks in the city, are identified in the table provided in the documentation and we have successfully received funding from the local infrastructural housing activation fund to facilitate works at Belmayne and the Poolbeg strategic development zone, SDZ.</p><p> A number of important changes were made to Dublin city's development plan from 2016 to 2022.  This was primarily to assist the development of residential lands within the city.  In that context, the amount of zoned land in the city has increased by 47 ha and there is provision at this point for in excess of 52,000 homes to be built in the lifetime of the development plan.  There are approximately 12 elements to this as outlined in the report.</p><p> New initiatives that we have implemented in the city include the buy and renew scheme and the repair and leasing scheme.  The buy and renew scheme seems to be more appropriate to an urban environment, particularly Dublin city.  We are looking derelict sites and properties etc. and we have identified 144 of them.  We are using our powers with the compulsory purchase order process to bring some of those back into stock.</p><p> To conclude, real progress is being made to provide accommodation, both new and refurbished, in properties in the city.  However, there are real challenges to overcome to provide the number of homes needed.  Dublin City Council and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive will continue to provide short-term emergency housing requirements.  However, we will phase out the need for this temporary accommodation and replace it with permanent housing solutions over the term of the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  We thank members for inviting delegates from Dublin City Council and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive to present a report at today's sitting of the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1459" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Geraghty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017071300002#J00300"><p>I am the director of housing and community services at Fingal County Council and my colleague, Ms Mary Egan, is accompanying me.  I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us here this morning.  Fingal is the second largest of the four Dublin authorities and Fingal County Council has the third biggest local authority catchment area in the country.  The results from the 2016 census indicate that Fingal is Ireland's fastest-growing county, with the youngest population, and Balbriggan is the youngest town in the country.  We have a population of just under 300,000 and that has increased by 22,000 since the last census.  This 8% increase is the highest of any county or city in the past five years and it is more than twice the average national rate of increase.</p> <p>  The provision of social housing for those unable to provide housing for themselves is a strategic high priority for Fingal and is a big challenge, particularly in light of the significant increase in population.  There are currently 7,865 eligible applicants for social housing support on our housing list and our aim is for every household that has a need to be able to access an affordable home of good quality, suited to their needs in a secure environment.  It is important to note that despite the challenging operating environment over the past ten years, there has been a 60% increase in the social housing stock provided by Fingal in the area between 2006 and 2016.</p> <p>  The council is very proactive in the delivery of social housing units and has provided 1,408 families with social housing support through a range of delivery mechanisms under the social housing strategy for 2015 to 2017.  The council has already exceeded the targets set in this strategy and delivery outputs on our target of 1,376 units stand at 102% at the end of June 2017.  In addition, the council has a high-level land management and activation group chaired by our chief executive.  The council was allocated &euro;81 million under the housing strategy 2020 to fund our delivery up to the end of 2017.  To date, we have spent &euro;85 million and we expect to spend a further &euro;66 million before year-end, bringing the total expenditure to &euro;150 million, versus the initial allocation of &euro;81 million.  That additional funding is being provided to us by the Department.  Based on current approvals in the pipeline, it is projected a further &euro;120 million will be required during 2018.  The total expenditure requirement from 2015 to 2018 is therefore expected to be approximately &euro;270 million.</p> <p>  We have put much time, effort and focus into managing projects through to completion in our construction programme and it is supported by a strong project management process.  That may seem basic but housing delivery is a complex process and putting a relentless focus on all stages of the process has proved successful for us.  A major element of our strategy has been bringing forward plans to the elected members on a regular basis for building social housing units on land in our ownership.  We have brought more proposals through in the past 18 months than we had been in a position to do over the previous six years or so.  This process has ensured a continuous pipeline of planned units for construction across the county and it is heartening to see the council back building houses again.  There is a significant construction pipeline already under way, with 23 active social housing sites across the county delivering 630 social houses over the next two years.  Construction is under way on 160 houses, with a further 219 at tender stage and 222 at pre-planning.  It is also important to note we have 36 approved housing bodies active across the county, working with us to support housing delivery.</p> <p>  The council owns significant landbanks at Donabate, Mulhuddart, Cappaghfinn, Castlelands and Hacketstown and is in the process of developing land management plans for these sites, which have the potential to deliver 3,200 housing units over the medium term.  In line with policy, these developments will be of mixed tenure with social, affordable, cost-rental, co-operative housing etc.  The council will consider various models of delivery for these sites based on individual characteristics.  The council has received infrastructural funding though the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which will help us bring these sites forward for development.  The council has undertaken an ambitious acquisitions programme to acquire properties on the open market.  A number of bulk purchases of turnkey units have been completed.  To date, we have acquired 286 properties and the Housing Agency is in the process of acquiring a further 92 properties on behalf of Fingal.</p> <p>  Activity in the Part V area is increasing with the upturn in construction.  The council proactively works to seek early on-site delivery of units during Part V negotiations with developers.  With planning permissions in the pipeline, there is potential to yield more than 2,000 social units under Part V in the coming years.  The council is also working with a number of developers across the county to bring forward property for leasing.  We have been working with the Department on the development of a new form of social lease that would enable us to develop those proposals.</p> <p>  Homelessness has emerged as a major issue across the Dublin region and we are working with our partners in the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, approved housing bodies and the Housing Agency to deliver long-term sustainable housing solutions.  Family hubs in Fingal will provide quality family accommodation as an alternative to commercial hotels as we work to provide long-term tenancy solutions.  We are also using the housing assistance programme in that regard and it is working very well in Fingal.  It is important to note a total of 175 households have had their homeless circumstances alleviated up to the end of June 2017 and in 2016 we addressed the housing support need of 274 households with regard to their homeless status.  We have provided 243 homeless HAP tenancies since the initiative was introduced and 99 mainstream HAP tenancies since March this year.</p> <p>  An important part of our work relates to private developments in the county and we have 49 active housing sites delivering housing across the county by private developers, and these will also attract Part V elements in time.  A strategic part of the new Fingal development plan is to build on previous successes and strengthen our strategic advantage as a county.  The recently adopted development plan has made provision for housing supply over the lifetime of the plan, with 1,700 ha of land zoned for housing in the county.  Fingal County Council has ambitious plans for growth in the development areas identified by the metro north economic zoning designations.  The recent zoning of this land reflects the importance of this infrastructural investment for both Swords and the entire county and will support the development of new towns and urban districts, while providing for a significant level of employment and residential development.</p> <p>  Fingal secured &euro;26 million under the local infrastructure housing activation fund and there is the potential to deliver 10,300 units in the long term, with 2,500 to be delivered by 2021.</p><p> We participated in the national working group on the development of a vacant homes plan, which is due to be published.  A lot of work on behalf of Fingal County Council has gone into this strategy.  We worked for a number of months prior to the vacant homes initiative being launched and we identified from census figures that 3,000 homes were listed as vacant in the county.  Having done an exercise on those, we established that 361 residential properties were possibly vacant out of 3,000, with the remaining 3,000 being commercial accommodation or stock that was under way in the 49 active private developments or the 23 active sites that Fingal has.  They were actually not vacant properties.  We carried out a number of investigations into the level of vacant property and a pilot visit we did identified 74 properties that were potentially vacant.  Those properties were inspected on an individual basis and only 13 were actually vacant.  At this point in time, the existing data have proven to be unreliable in that regard.  We have now appointed a company appointed that is surveying all our streets in Dublin 15 and Swords to ensure we have tracked all potential vacant property.  We also have a publicity campaign in place.  </p><p> From a derelict sites perspective, the CPO process is long and complicated.  We have instigated what is working out to be a successful approach in which we have examined all the properties on our CPO list that are potentially suitable for housing and we are engaging directly with the owners of the properties.  Rather than using the CPO process, we have negotiated to work with ten owners who are prepared to make the property available.  The numbers are small but the approach is working for us.  </p><p> In terms of void property, we manage and maintain 4,800 homes.  Our unoccupied stock at any point in time is less than 1% of our total stock, which is a normal churn in terms of vacancy.  The approach we take to the management of our void properties is very significant.  </p><p> Over the next 14 years the population of Dublin is forecast to grow by 22% to 1.63 million.  This will place further pressure on services but it also presents an opportunity and economic asset.  It is essential that Fingal continues to grow in order to support the sustainability of the Dublin region.  Fingal County Council has embarked on an ambitious programme of social housing delivery that will see the delivery of more than 10,000 housing units of mixed tenure in the medium term.  As for private sector housing, there is significant provision in our development plan to meet these needs.  There has been a lot of criticism from many sources that the local authorities have been too slow to react to the current housing crisis.  In the case of Fingal, we have mobilised comprehensively, have good support from the elected members and departmental officials and our staff have stepped up to the mark in an exceptional manner.</p></speech>

We are looking forward to dealing with its questions.  My name is Pat Ledwidge.  I am the deputy chief executive of Cork City Council and the director of planning and economic development.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Valerie O'Sullivan, who is the director of housing and community.  Ms O'Sullivan will read our opening statement but I preface it by saying we view housing as an economic, social and environmental asset to the city.  Housing is about shelter and building communities.  The context of our housing policy is set by Pure Cork, which is our local, economic and community plan and that is how we interact with our stakeholders to build those sustainable communities.  I have brought some copies of the plan that I will leave with the secretariat.  I will hand over to Ms O'Sullivan now.</p></speech>

We have structured it, like other authorities, in accordance with the pillars set out in Rebuilding Ireland.</p> <p>  Similar to other cities, Cork has experienced strong demand for housing in recent years.  Progress is good, given that we began delivery from a standing start, but significant barriers remain that must be overcome to deliver the appropriate accommodation types to meet the diverse demands in a timely manner.  The population of Cork city increased by more than 5% between 2011 and 2016, with a net inward migration of 4,390 people, directly correlating to increased employment levels and opportunities in the city.  Our five-yearly employment survey shows that employment in the city grew by 9% in the same period.  In terms of economic development, it is very encouraging but it underlines the urgency of addressing the housing supply shortage.  Not only is the supply issue a social challenge; equally it is an economic challenge and unless tackled is a potential obstacle to future employment and economic growth in Cork city.  In 2016, a Cork Chamber of Commerce survey found that 72% of big employers perceived employee accommodation to be a challenge and the same number stated it was an upward driver of wage demands. </p> <p>  Cork City Council has programmes in place to meet the housing needs of its 4,629 eligible housing applicants, which was the figure at the end of May.  We have adopted a number of particularly innovative approaches to deliver additional housing units, resulting in a notable turnaround of previously vacant units and commencement of construction on six sites across the city, with a further nine imminent.  Most noteworthy is our use of the EU competitive dialogue procurement procedure, which has proven very successful in unlocking viable development opportunities more rapidly than traditional procurement models.  It is our considered view that the use of this procurement option could be a model for other housing authorities facing similar challenges, particularly the big urban areas, and that its wider use across the State could speed up social housing provision. </p> <p>  We will have provided a total of 1,349 new homes for eligible applicants between 2015 and 2017.  In addition, we will have facilitated almost 2,000 applicants to access suitable housing under the housing assistance payment scheme in the same period.  Therefore, by the end of the current year, Cork City Council will have housed, either directly or indirectly, 3,345 housing applicants.  It is essential to provide sustainable housing in a manner and in such a quantity as to meet the needs of applicants, both in numbers and profile.  To this end, empirical data had to drive our programme.  Our choice-based letting scheme was introduced in 2015.  It was a key provider of empirical data that shaped our programme for us.  At the end of May, 55% of those eligible for housing had engaged with CBL.  We have allocated about 424 units since it came into operation.</p> <p>  Pillar 1 is to address homelessness.  As is expected by the Minister and our elected members, we are addressing the level of family homelessness to divert families from emergency and hotel accommodation.  We have long had a programme in place to address the needs of the most vulnerable in the city.  We have processes in place to identify people at risk of homelessness and to support them through our tenancy sustainment service, as well as assisting those in mortgage arrears.  We established, for example, the Cork homeless forum in the mid-1990s, which is still operating today at regional level, and we work closely with other forum members to address the multi-layered needs of our homeless population.  Recently, we reconfigured the housing directorate, which has allowed us to deliver better with the HSE South, Cork County Council, Kerry County Council and the Cork Education and Training Board. </p> <p>  Specific actions we undertake include-----</p></speech>

The one to which I will draw members' attention is the new facility at Bishopsgrove, which is the first of its kind in the State .  It is an innovative type of homeless accommodation for students who wish to pursue third level accommodation.</p> <p>  Pillar 2 is to accelerate social housing and the key points are listed in our submission.  There will be an additional 1,293 social housing units provided up to 2021.  They are all in the pipeline.  This pertains to new housing stock rather than voids recovery or other housing options.  </p> <p>  Pillar 3 is concerned with building more homes.  One can see how prices in the purchase and rental sectors have increased since the trough of the recession.</p><p>They are listed in the submission I have provided to the committee.  We must focus on developing brownfield sites within the city boundary.  It is prudent to do so because they are adjacent to or on existing infrastructure or where infrastructure is available.  Some new infrastructure, particularly transport, is essential to enable larger brownfield development.</p><p> Under the local infrastructure housing activation fund we are focusing on two locations, one of which is land owned by Cork City Council at Old Whitechurch Road, which is capable of providing between 550 and 600 units.  There are two sites located on the south docks, which are capable of providing 800 units.  It is sensible and prudent to develop in that area.  The council is procuring the infrastructure works for our own lands at Old Whitechurch Road and our master plan is nearing completion.  We plan for this to be a mixed tenure scheme.  Design of infrastructure to facilitate housing development on the two sites in the south docks is also progressing.</p><p> Members can see further actions detailed in my written submission.  They include the potential for innovative ways of producing additional housing supply at a city council-owned site in the county council's area and which is under consideration in the planning process for 153 units.  Our north-west quarter regeneration plan in Knocknaheeny is to undergo a review this year.  It has been in place since 2011 and the physical side of it - with 23 units completed, 29 units under construction and 149 starts imminent in the next few months - is progressing very well.  We are now looking at the non-physical side of the regeneration such as socio-economic aspects in that area.</p><p> Pillar 4 applies to improving in the rental sector.  Rather than going into my written submission in detail, it is clear that the city council is engaging with landowners and developers.</p><p> Pillar 5 covers utilising existing houses.  One of the council's highlights to date in the delivery of housing was around the time when funding became available.  Matched by some of our own funds it created a combined fund of more than &euro;8 million combined and we returned 840 social housing units to stock in less than two years.</p><p> As for the buy and renew scheme, in terms of acquisitions it has worked well for us in that we bought without having to renew very much.  We are now looking at properties that can fall into this category.  The city council is partnering with other agencies locally under the repair and lease scheme.  There is a target of 26 units for delivery in the current year under this scheme.</p><p> Cork City Council is making progress.  We in Cork city believe that demand for social housing is capable of being met, especially if resources and progress continue at this pace.  Put into context, our social housing demand equates to less than one fifth of the city's population.  Some of this demand emanates from outside of Cork city.  The development and management of social housing is a very strong feature of the council's track record.  Of our total of approximately 57,000 homes within Cork city, almost one third were developed originally by Cork City Council.  We have a track record in building, managing and providing social houses.</p><p> There are, however, current and future challenges for us.  One challenge, which is quite obvious, is the scarcity of development land within the city.  This is what prompted our use of the competitive dialogue procedure to unlock sites about which we may not previously have been aware.  Another challenge is the growing population as evidenced by the 2016 census.  This is driving demand levels beyond normal growth levels.  That is a challenge.  As we learnt from a recent publication from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that our population is ageing, we must make sure we are providing the appropriate types of housing in future housing programmes to accommodate this need.  There is a tendency towards urbanism and urban living and the demand profile is changing.  Consequently, we need to respond.  There is a move away from what we may have traditionally provided in Cork city, in respect of social housing in particular but also in private housing.  We must build sustainable communities and not just houses, hence the review of our regeneration plan and other measures.</p><p> Like other local authorities we are experiencing a severe lack of investment into existing older housing stock.   If we do not invest in it then we will pay much more dearly into the future.  Local autonomy to make decisions is absolutely essential.  There are viability issues that still exist and which are quoted to us regularly by developers.  There are also some legacy land debt issues, which remain a challenge for the council. </p></speech>

In Waterford we have been looking at vacant houses as a potential source of social housing for well over a year.  In the first quarter of 2016 we carried out an extensive survey of areas in Waterford city.  Each property in nine local areas was surveyed to ascertain whether each housing unit was occupied or not.  Our survey ascertained that the vacancy rate for those areas in the first quarter of 2016 was 8.8%.  The census 2016 data for the nine local areas recorded a combined vacancy rate of 13.6%.</p> <p>  What can we conclude from these figures?  It is our view that the official vacancy rates, as recorded in the census, are overstated, possibly by 30% to 40% in larger urban areas.  The only reason we can deduce for this is that there are significant numbers of people who simply will not engage with State agencies, including the Central Statistics Office, despite the guarantee of confidentiality in respect of the census.</p> <p>  I will now briefly outline our experience in Waterford with the repair and lease scheme.  The scheme is targeted at the owners of long-term vacant properties that require some investment to bring them up to standard for occupation.  A loan of up to &euro;40,000 per property is available on condition that the owner leases the property to the local authority for social housing for a minimum of ten years.  The loan is repaid over the lifetime of the lease from the rental payment to the owner.</p> <p>  Waterford City and County Council has engaged with the owners of more than 60 properties so far.  We have entered agreements with or are about to enter agreements with the owners of nearly 20 properties.  We are also in ongoing discussions with owners of more than 30 other properties.  Two approved housing bodies are working on a further 18 properties in Waterford.</p> <p>  Not every property will be suitable for the scheme.  The issues that we have encountered include properties requiring too much work and expenditure, properties located in areas with no demand for social housing or properties not being suitable for social housing.  Several farmhouses were offered, for example, but these would require a significant maintenance commitment from tenants.</p> <p>  The biggest issue we have experienced with the scheme relates to the owners of the properties.  It is important to understand that every vacant property is owned by somebody.  Identifying the vacant property is fairly straightforward but identifying the owner is much more difficult.  Having identified the owner, convincing him or her to sign up to a new scheme is definitely not straightforward.  Some owners were reluctant to engage because the scheme is new while others are deterred by the length of the lease or the discount that is applied to the rents under leasing arrangements.  There is also an ingrained resistance by some owners towards a social housing solution in their properties.</p> <p>  Finally, it is important to note that the scheme may not be suitable in all locations, depending on the position of the rental market or the value of house prices.  Waterford City and County Council has not attracted any interest for the scheme in the seaside town of Tramore, which has a strong rental market particularly in the summer.  Looking at how the scheme might operate in areas where house prices have been increasing significantly like Dublin or Cork, an owner of a property that is in need of investment would probably generate a better economic return by simply selling the property.</p> <p>  In a national context, our view is that the scheme can be an effective instrument where property market values are around or below average.  Where property values and rents are very high there is less incentive for an owner to use the scheme and where values and rents are very low the economic conditions for use of the scheme do not exist from the owner&rsquo;s perspective.</p></speech>

I have a starting comment before I put my questions.  There are some Members of the Oireachtas who have tendency to beat up on local authorities in our debates about the housing crisis.  I am certainly not one of them.  While I have my criticisms and complaints about local authorities, it is important to put on the record the view of many on this committee as to what has happened to local authorities in the housing context since 2008-10.</p><p>There has been an 80% reduction in capital investment in social housing and a 23% reduction in staff, which is the single biggest loss of staff in any part of the public sector.  There have been nine Ministers, senior and junior, since 2010 and there have been four plans and statements.  While it is important that we should go into the detail, criticise and ask questions when local authority representatives are before us, I am firmly of the view that local authorities, in the context of their front-line operations, have been struggling to cope with a difficult set of circumstances over the past decade.  I also wish to acknowledge that the witnesses have taken the time to come here today.</p><p> I do not accept that the social housing targets are ambitious, particularly if one considers the need that exists versus the level of delivery outlined in the current action plan and that which preceded it.  The two do not match.  There will probably only be 4,500 real social houses delivered this year in terms of units owned by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  The figure for last year was roughly the same.  Next year there will be far fewer voids and some new builds will come on stream but there will still only be between 4,500 to 5,000 units delivered.  All of this is at a time when there are 90,000 people on the waiting list and a minimum of 4,000 households living in emergency accommodation, etc.  I shall not ask the witnesses to comment on whether the targets are ambitious.  If the Government was prepared to approach local authorities and state that it wanted to be more ambitious, what would be the capacity of the local authorities to deliver additional units if, as two Ministers have now told us, money is no object?  What is the capacity to deliver if the Government was serious about wanting to increase the output of real social housing beyond the current rate?</p><p> The four-stage approval process is absolutely appalling.  I am flabbergasted that the Department and the Minister have not tackled the matter.  I do not understand how it can take so long to grant approval.  The Department has repeatedly told this committee that it has worked on the matter and that its housing delivery teams have improved the process.  I have heard, off the record, that it is still a slow and cumbersome process.  I ask the witnesses to tell us, in as frank a way as possible, whether the process has improved.  I am firmly of the view that there must be a way to reduce the process to a single stage lasting six to nine months once Part 8 has been passed and before construction happens.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on the matter.</p><p> The next issue is land initiatives and public private partnerships.  Many of us are concerned that the costs, in terms of the public sector's benchmarking for PPPs, will be very expensive over the lifetime of the projects.  Can the witnesses who are involved in the projects share information about them and about the land initiative and joint ventures?  Again, South Dublin County Council has not included affordable rentals in its model because central government has not provided an affordable rental model.  Some newspapers have reported similar difficulties with Dublin City Council.  If the projects go ahead, is there hope that there will be affordability either in terms of rentals or sales?</p><p> I have the same question on the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF.  We have lots of exchanges with the Minister on where the affordability dividend from the LIHAF exists.  I have a question for the witnesses who work with the LIHAF.  Can any of them say with certainty that developments which benefit from taxpayers' money will deliver units in Dublin, for example, that will sell for below &euro;300,000?  Any progress update on the matter would be useful.</p><p> I have two big issues with homelessness.  First, there is an absolute need to introduce an independent inspection regime for emergency accommodation, particularly where children are involved.  My suggestion applies as much to the hubs as to the other forms of accommodation.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on the matter.  Would Tusla, for example, be the appropriate agency to deal with this?</p><p> Second, two pieces of research on homelessness were published by Maynooth University and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission yesterday.  There is a big concern about the hubs.  Most members understand that a hub is clearly much better than a hotel for all sorts of reasons.  Given that 70% of families with children who are in emergency accommodation have been there for six months and that 40% of families have been there for more than a year, some of us are concerned that, by default, the hubs, which are supposed to be a short-term solution, could end up serving as long-term emergency accommodation.  What can be done to institute a regime where no family stays more than six months in any form of emergency accommodation before being moved on?</p><p> Can the witnesses indicate how their HAP transfer lists are working?  There is a considerable variation in terms of how they operate.  I want to hear about the impact of being moved from a standard housing list to a HAP transfer list has on the potential length of time a person may have to wait before getting a full council allocation.  Have people on the HAP waiting list been allocated permanent social housing?</p><p> It has been claimed that there are 183,000 vacant properties throughout the State.  Even if that were true, we all accept that not all of the vacant properties can be used for social housing.  I shall outline one of the matters with which we are all trying to grapple.  Some local authorities have conducted scoping exercises.  Can the witnesses tell me what the ballpark figure is in percentage terms?  The Government is targeting approximately 3% of the vacant units over six years from the existing three schemes.  Do our guests think that is a reasonable percentage?  What percentage should it be?  In light of the difficulties in getting some of the owners of vacant units to join the schemes, what do the witnesses think about a  vacant home tax?  The tax could act as a way to encourage people who, for no justifiable reason, sit on vacant properties.</p><p> Rental inspections are another matter.  There is a huge variation in the level of inspections.  What would it take to increase the number of inspections conducted by local authorities?  Is it a staffing matter?</p><p> I have a final query about staff levels in general.  The Minister keeps telling us that there is no end of money and staff and that local authorities can have everything that they want.  That has not been my experience.  I know that housing departments are struggling under a huge amount of strain.  Can the witnesses give us a read of the situation?  Is staffing a problem for front-line homelessness services?  Should we, as politicians, advocate for staffing levels to be increased in the housing departments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017071300002#M00200"><p>Previous speakers have said that the local authorities have been verbally bashed in the D&aacute;il.  One hears it quite a bit and it is an effort to put the blame on local councils.  I am not one of those Deputies either but I shall be quite critical about some of the issues that have been raised.  I shall focus on Fingal because I am based in the area.  I am not just being parochial because, as the manager said, Fingal is the fastest-growing county in the country and has the youngest population.  As a result, it has the most families with children who will likely need housing and its population is increasing rapidly.  Fingal also has the highest migrant population, which is the largest single group in the private rental sector that has fallen into homelessness.  There are added problems, complications and issues relating to the migrant population.</p> <p>  I studied the previous presentation.  Fingal's social housing stock is half that of South Dublin County Council.  I always wondered why councillors and Deputies in Fingal had to face such a difficult problem, particularly those from the Solidarity Party, which was previously known as the Anti-Austerity Alliance.  Fingal has 380 homeless families out of a total of 1,312 such families throughout the State.  In other words, 29% of all of the homeless families in the country live in Fingal.  Earlier, however, the director of housing and community services at Fingal County Council stated, "The council has already exceeded the targets set in this strategy and delivery outputs on our target of 1,376 units stand at 102%".  That sounds like everything in the garden is rosy.  Everything in the garden is an absolute nightmare in Fingal in terms of housing.  Homelessness now spans two generations.  I know of a homeless mother who resides in bed and breakfast accommodation on the Navan Road and her daughter who is in her 20s is homeless somewhere else because she has a child of her own.  I will not go into how bad the situation is because I am sure the council's staff have got it in the neck and need counselling themselves.  Council managers should shout and demand more.  They should not say, "We have reached our targets, we are doing really well and we are mobilising the staff."  Council managers must be a lot more critical and demand that central government deliver what is needed for their areas.</p> <p>  I shall go through some of the issues that were raised in the presentation made by Fingal County Council.  It claims to have delivered 1,408 social housing units over the past three years.  As much as 41% of those housing units are HAP or rental accommodation scheme, RAS, units which means they are not permanent housing.  As Dr. Rory Hearne said at a conference yesterday, one quarter of HAP housing has fallen out of permanent accommodation and after a couple of years people become homeless.</p><p>We are only shoring up a problem.  Of the 1,400 units, 270 are voids.  The real figure for the number provided in the two and a half year period is 553.  At that rate, it would take 35 years to house everyone on Fingal County Council's social housing list permanently.  The council should be screaming for more resources because it deserves much more.  The &euro;81 million is no different from what has been allocated to other councils, yet Fingal County Council has a more acute problem.  The housing figure has decreased in recent years, which probably has more to do with a cleaning up of people on the list.  Many more who would love to be given a house are not being accommodated.</p><p> Less than 20% of the units provided by local authorities are new builds, with the majority being acquisitions.  Councils are buying housing.  I am not opposed to this because we need to do something quickly, but it pushes up prices for others who are competing for the same housing.  Of the 286 units in the process, how many have been acquired and how many will be acquired soon?</p><p> Only 601 homes are under construction, at tender stage or in the preplanning process, with 842 approved in total versus a total of 7,865 people on the list.  At that construction rate, how long would it take to house everyone?  This number does not include land management planned sites which have the potential to provide 3,200 homes.  It has been stated that these will be mixed tenure developments - social and affordable, cost rental, co-operative housing, etc.  How many social homes will be built on these sites?  I have a particular concern about the greater Blanchardstown area, given that the majority of the homeless persons in question are located within a couple of miles of it.  This problem could be easily solved if we had the political will to do so.  It is targeted in areas.</p><p> The last remaining council-owned, zoned site is in Wellview which is listed as being 33 ha.  I am making this comment to all of the parties represented at this meeting, not just Fingal County Council.  It is the only remaining piece of council land left in Blanchardstown to cater for most of the homeless in Dublin 15.  If properly planned, it could solve our housing problem in one fell swoop.  Even if the council opted for a low to medium density of 50 houses per hectare, 1,650 families could be catered for.  I am not arguing that the council aim for that many, but I would be open to considering it if the council were to break up the development properly with parks, facilities, etc.  It would be outrageous if the last remaining piece of land in the area of the country hit most by the homelessness problem was halved and given over to the private sector.  Any party on the council that supports it has serious questions to answer.  The council must make an exception in its support for mixed tenure developments.</p><p> In terms of Part V developments, a figure of 41 units in the past two and a half years was cited.  That is low.  Estates are being built all over the place, although mainly as higher end housing in Castleknock and elsewhere that probably would not be affordable.  Surely we are getting Part V contributions from them.</p><p> A great deal of NAMA building has occurred in Fingal, including Dublin 15.  At the launch of its annual report, NAMA stated it had sold off enough land for 50,000 homes in the past six years.  Has the council noticed this land hoarding?  Who owns the land in Fingal not council owned?  Is it owned by vulture funds or developers?</p><p> Regarding the reliance on the HAP scheme, the level is at 41%, yet the council has called it a great success.  How many HAP tenancies in Fingal have ended?  How many landlords have shown their willingness to make properties available under the HAP scheme?  It is not my experience or that of any of our councillors that people can find HAP housing.  When someone can get &euro;2,000 per month in renting a house in Dublin 15, why would he or she provide housing under the HAP scheme?</p><p> I was amazed that Fingal County Council did not list homelessness as one of its challenges, given that it has one third of the country's homeless population.  Orwellian language was used, in that "175 households have had their homeless circumstances alleviated through the allocation of social housing support".  What does that mean and why is the figure less than the 243 homeless HAP tenancies available?  Is it because people have become homeless again?  How many homeless families have been given council houses?  It was mentioned that 3,000 vacant houses in Fingal were listed by the CSO, but only 361 had been identified as being possibly vacant.  Will the delegates explain the situation of the remainder?  Has someone started to live in them since?  It seems to be a low level of acquirable vacant houses.</p><p> Fingal appears to have the highest figure for the handing over of estates to approved housing bodies, AHBs.  I saw this while I was a member of the council for 11 years.  I have studied the figures for other councils.  For some reason, Fingal County Council does not seem to run any housing estate anymore.  It is passed over immediately to Cl&uacute;id, Respond! and T&uacute;ath Housing.  Why is the rate so much higher in Fingal than in other areas?  This causes problems for those who enter the estates.  They do not have the same recourse to representation by councillors, etc.</p></speech>

I spend much of my time dealing with Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council, as Mr. Flynn and Ms Geraghty will know.  The staff have been fantastic, given the pressure they have been under, particularly those working in the homeless area.  By and large, they have gone well beyond the call of duty when dealing with people, even at the last minute.  I have made contact with the homeless section and its staff have done their utmost.</p> <p>  The entire situation is frustrating.  Everyone in every local authority shares the opinion that our greatest problem, especially in dealing with this crisis, is the lack of social and affordable housing, on which we must focus.  We are delivering approximately 4,000 units per year, but we need to deliver at least 10,000 per year to try to get on top of the problem, although we seem to be fighting.  The local authorities are laying out their plans, but these plans are matched with the funding they receive.  We are bringing properties and various mechanisms on stream, but we are working on the basis of the funding available.  That is a major problem because we do not have enough.</p> <p>  We are being let down in many respects.  One of the matters that is not being focused on enough focus is compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, and derelict sites.  The record varies and some local authorities are good at it, but when I say "good", I mean that they have implemented the system using a targeted approach, in that they have acquired sites through CPOs.  As many of them had been left idle for ten or 15 years, they have been put in the derelict site category and considered for CPOs.  We need to up our game.  Dublin City Council has used virtually no CPOs, which is disappointing.  It is a matter about which I have spoken.</p> <p>  All local authorities need to consider vacant shops on the ground floor rather than just upper floors.  Whenever I submit a parliamentary question, I am told that this applies to shops above ground floor.  In estate after estate, ground floor shops have been left idle for ten or 15 years.</p><p>I cannot figure out why that is the case.  We need to deal with them and to find a mechanism to do that.  We need to do an audit of them and find out exactly where the problem lies.  There is no question but that the number is in five figures.  </p><p> The Government has also failed to deliver in the area of affordable housing.  We recently saw the delivery of five houses in Ballymun by the &Oacute; Cualann co-operative at a price well below the &euro;200,000 mark.  We need to examine if that model can be replicated.  I would have liked to have seen a State-run housing body established, but if the Government is ideologically opposed to that mechanism, we could consider selecting from a list of private companies to build co-operative housing such as the &Oacute; Cualann co-operative has built.  A list could be drawn up from which we could work.  The procurement procedure would become much easier and we could speed up the process.  That is one action we should take.</p><p> We are well behind all our targets with respect of modular housing.  When the former Minister said that no homeless families would be living in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation by July, did no one in the local authorities tell him that was not possible?  It was a target set but people should have been upfront with him and said that it would be possible to deliver on it.  The former Minister should have been stopped in his tracks instead of engaging in a public relations exercise by putting out the message that all homeless people, families in particular, would no longer be living in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation by July.  Obviously, it is better for people to live in hubs than in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation but the danger with the concept, like anything else, is that it will end up being a long-term measure.  We must ensure that does not happen. </p><p> The local authorities have rowed back on the idea of financial contributions, but we need to increase that.  A few hundred people in my area alone are on the housing waiting list.  When that number is replicated, be it in Cork, Dublin or Waterford, it concerns many thousands of people.  Consideration has been given to building more senior citizen housing complexes.  It is not what I believe should be done, but that is what many people want.  They want to live in senior citizen complexes.  We should consider building more of those in order that we can bring more housing on stream.  That is an important aspect.</p><p>It was stated that the next phase of rapid builds is coming up but we are well behind on the first phase.  A total of 500 units were to have been built by this year.  Twenty-two units have been delivered in Ballymun and some units have been delivered in Finglas and Cherry Orchard.  I have seen those units and they are well built and of a very good quality.  We were originally told they would be temporary but now it is fairly obvious that they will become more permanent.  If we are going to go down that road, we should consider mainstreaming that model instead of saying that these are units for the homeless.  We should examine that model and see if we can make such housing affordable for people.  That is an important aspect. </p><p> We have not started to use public private partnerships, PPPs.  I have had my doubts about them.  A number of sites have been identified in Dublin.  This will be a difficult one.  We would have been better off going down another road rather than going with the PPPs.  I would like to hear from the representatives whether the management or otherwise believe that the PPPs will deliver.  I am curious to know-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1432" speakername="Mick Barry" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017071300002#O00500"><p>I will keep it quite short.  I thank the Chairman for calling me to speak.  My question is solely directed at the representatives from Cork City Council.  I will say hello to Ms Valerie O'Sullivan and to Mr. Pat Ledwidge, both of whom I know from back in the day.  A report entitled "Investing in the Right to a Home: Housing, HAPs and Hubs" - a good alliteration - by the authors Dr. Rory Hearne and Dr. Mary Murphy from the sociology department in Maynooth University was published during the week.  The authors warned that the so-called family hubs could become the next direct provision centres.  I will not go into all the reasons they said that.  It is self-evident in many respects.  It backs up the approach that our party would take that it should be a case of homes, not hubs, and the provision of homes is the key central issue.</p> <p>  I was not here for the Cork City Council presentation and I apologise for that, but I made a point of reading the material that was submitted in advance last night.  I noted a sentence which states: "We have identified premises suitable for the provision of a family hub near the city centre."  I do not like these hubs in Dublin and I was hoping we would not see them in Cork.  Can the witnesses give me some information on that?  Are they in a position to give information about that premises the council has indicated is suitable for the provision of a family hub?  I put my opposition to the hubs on the record of the committee.  </p> <p>  My second question relates to people who have been made homeless by fire.  Both Ms Valerie O'Sullivan and Mr. Pat Ledwidge will be aware of the fire that took place on the Wellington Road a few weeks ago.  Twelve persons were affected by it, comprising seven households with some families among them.  It was a serious fire with thick smoke billowing out.  People had to be evacuated from their homes in the early hours of the morning of the fire and they presented as homeless.  I will meet these residents in my constituency clinic tomorrow morning.  According to reports, they went to the council and were referred by the council to the homeless persons unit.  They were asked to source emergency accommodation for themselves.  Some did that and some did not.  I understand some of those residents ended up sleeping in a car.  One of the families affected was a mother with five-week old twins.  A dispute played its way out in the pages of the newspapers, where the new Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said the local authority had a duty to provide temporary shelter but the representatives of Cork City Council stated they did not have a statutory duty because the fire department had not declared a major emergency.  I seek clarification as to what the legal position is but I will state for the record that I believe these seven households should have been treated better either way.  They should have received emergency accommodation provided by the local authority.  It was a traumatic experience for these people.  We must examine what happens in this State in the event of such an emergency.  We should consider the provision of counselling services after a traumatic experience, with people having been burned out of their homes and made homeless.  The representatives of Cork City Council should comment on that point, including whether they think we might do better for them in the weeks ahead, given that those people are still homeless in nearly all cases and accommodation will not be available to them for up to six months according to reports.</p></speech>

As other speakers have alluded to, it was expected that modular or rapid build homes would come on stream much more quickly than they have and would be a viable option for people in homeless situations.  As Deputy Ellis said, there is potential for more long-term solutions with the delivery of these units.  They have not been completed at the pace we were led to expect.  What are the problems?  Deputy Barry referred to a report that was published earlier this week.  It was proposed yesterday to introduce new legislation or emergency legislation to assist in ensuring these units are provided more quickly.  What do the witnesses recommend should be done to improve the delivery and the speed at which they are delivered?  If procurement is the solution, will the witnesses make specific recommendations we can analyse so that we can make suggestions to the Department and the Minister?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree that it is unfortunate that there is no national, Government-sponsored affordable housing scheme at present?  It has been mentioned that the &Oacute; Cualann Cohousing Alliance has achieved significant success in Dublin in recent times.  Is that the template for the roll-out of affordable housing nationally?  If that can be confirmed, a recommendation to that effect should be made so that we can insist on it being implemented.</p> <p>  In Rebuilding Ireland, the Government has proposed to expand on the NAMA asset residential property service by putting in place a vehicle to provide finance for units that can be leased back by local authorities over a longer period.  We have been told the Government is still awaiting an EU decision on this proposal.  What are the witnesses' thoughts on that?  Can they confirm that the local authorities are prepared to have a role as part of such a scheme?  From our perspective, we can make advances in this regard by putting pressure on those who have the power to take action in this area.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on what Deputy Barry said about recent fires.  Obviously, we are conscious of this issue following the terrible disaster in London.  I am familiar with the position in my constituency and in Offaly County Council.  I am sure it is the same throughout the country.  Can the officials confirm that local authorities do not have the staff to carry out inspections on their own HAP properties?  Can they confirm that up to 50% of HAP properties have yet to be inspected?  If that is the case, this issue should be an urgent priority within the efforts, led by the Minister, to ascertain and audit the entire system of inspection, fire safety and control, policing and implementation of recommendations.  Regardless of whether the officials are prepared to say so, I would say there is no doubt that many properties across the country that are subsidised by HAP have not been inspected by local authorities.  It needs to be identified immediately whether this can be attributed to a shortage of staff of resources.  If that transpires to be the case, funding needs to be made available so that it can be rectified.  It cannot be allowed to be the case, especially in light of recent disasters.</p></speech>

A question was asked about the capacity of local authorities.  The simple reality is that we are at the coalface.  We know the demands and the needs.  We believe we have the capacity to respond to the demands made of us, as long as we know what we are being asked to do.  Eight or ten years ago, we delivered between 6,000 and 7,000 units by means of direct construction.  We can return to that level within a couple of years if it is clear to us that the Legislature or the Government is requiring us to do so.  We have faced a challenge over the past two or three years.  We had moved almost completely away from the direct delivery model.  From 2015 onwards, we were asked to accelerate direct delivery again.  That takes time when one is starting from the complete inception of sites.  We have a pipeline of projects now.  Reference has been made to the four-stage approval process, which is less relevant now that we have a pipeline and the stream of housing has started to flow.  I would be absolutely confident that in a limited period of time, we can return to the direct delivery of significant numbers of houses.</p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is not insignificant in that context.  Regardless of whether one agrees with it as a policy platform, at least it sets out that 47,000 houses are to be delivered in particular formats over a period of four or five years.  We have been asked whether, as managers, we are critical of the level of resources that is available.  From our point of view, the key issue is knowing what will be available and when.  If we have that knowledge, we can plan and resource accordingly and put the necessary steps in place.  I would be the first to accept that under the current arrangements, we have been under pressure to deliver and it has taken time.  We were going from a position of zero.  We had lost all of our inherent capacity in this space.  Now we are going again very significantly.  There are 1,500 units on site in the current year.  That will be 2,500 next year.  That figure could be increased if we were satisfied about the availability of resources.  The local authority sector can certainly deliver in this context.</p> <p>  There was a reference to the policy issues that are affecting the leaseback scheme.  We are as conscious as anybody of the need to deliver housing units.  We have no difficulty working with any schemes.  If we have one slight issue, it is that there may be too many schemes at present.  We are trying to manage and service various schemes in a host of areas, including the lease and repair and buy and renew schemes.  We are working with the housing bodies on leasing, direct delivery and other forms of housing provision.  In some respects, simplicity is better than a host of schemes.  As a sector, we are very happy to work with whatever schemes are available to us to deliver new units.  We are at the coalface of the need for such units.</p> <p>  In the past two or three years, we have used all the resources from Exchequer funding that have been available to us.  Some of those resources were used for acquisitions, but only where local authorities deemed that acquisition was a better and more timely response than construction.  In many areas, acquisition is still delivering significantly better value for money and is not interfering with the market.</p> <p>  There was a query about whether the 3% target with respect to vacant properties is sufficiently ambitious.  We would reserve our judgment in that regard.  We have concerns about the CSO statistics.  A serious body of work needs to be done to re-establish the position.  If we had one wish in the morning, it would be for the CSO statistics for vacant houses to be available to us at an individual level.  That would bring this whole process forward by four, five or six months.  We would be quite happy to use any of the measures that are available.  We find that the CPO process with regard to derelict sites and dangerous structures is frustrating in many respects and comes at a significant cost.  The elephant in the room in this overall space is the constitutional right to property, which complicates the process, adds expense and can lead to contests.</p></speech>

It goes without saying that it is labour intensive.</p></speech>

We have spent that and have received approval from the Department to spend double the amount by the end of 2018.  Schemes we have approved to date - not ones we are dreaming about - will see us spending three times that allocation at a minimum.  In terms of Fingal's response to the delivery of social housing, by any standard this is a very positive and comprehensive response.</p> <p>  In terms of units delivered, I am really not sure about the percentages Deputy Coppinger was calling out.  I will give a broad overview to the committee in terms of the 1,400 units we have delivered to date.  Between delivery by approved housing bodies, AHBs, which are mandated to deliver social housing just like the local authorities, and direct delivery by Fingal in terms of its own stock including voids, acquisitions, construction and Part V, it comes to about 60% of overall delivery, with the balance broken down pretty much evenly between the HAP scheme and the various leasing initiatives.  In terms of the delivery of direct stock by not-for-profit organisations such as the AHBs and what Fingal is doing itself, that is coming in at 60% of delivery.</p> <p>  On the analysis of stock breakdown, I would like to make a point that was raised a couple of times in respect of voids.  Every void that is turned around is a new tenancy.  On an annual basis, Fingal would generally have between 100 and 120 void properties.  It is not correct to say that void properties will drop off as a means of delivery.  That is the annual churn that we experience.  On an annual basis, we keep our void property that is under repair at less than 1%.  People come off the housing list into those properties on an ongoing annual basis and that will continue.</p> <p>  In terms of our construction programme and the rate of construction, we have brought 18 Part XIs through our council in the past 18 months or so.  I commend our councillors as it is sometimes very challenging to deliver social housing across the county.  It can be difficult for elected representatives to manage the variety of schemes that are in operation.  They have stood by us and supported us, including in respect of our rapid delivery programme.  Our rapid delivery projects have also been given approval by our council.</p> <p>  I am not sure about the Deputy's point about reliance on the housing assistance payment, HAP.  The percentages I presented a few minutes ago do not show an over-reliance on HAP in Fingal.  Our experience in terms of HAP ending is that this is not the case.  HAP is working very well for us in Fingal.  We have had 342 HAP tenancies since it was introduced.  It is proving to be a very good source of stock and one that people who are on the housing list are happy to - well, they are working with us in that regard and they do see - there are people who will avail of that option and they are availing of it and will continue to do so.  It is a valuable source of additional stock.</p> <p>  Perhaps I was not clear on the methodology around vacancy levels, as other Deputies have picked up on the same issue.  There is a requirement to be able to identify vacant properties.  As the new census process kicks off, there may be an opportunity to look at how we do this.  It is very important to note that the list for Fingal was 3,000.  That was what came out of the census.  We do not have exact addresses for those properties.  We had among the lowest vacancy rate across the country at 5.3% so we already knew the numbers of vacant stock were not likely to deliver a significant amount.</p> <p>  We did a very comprehensive exercise in respect of the figure of 3,000.  We took properties off the list that we knew were not vacant, as well as properties that were under construction, for sale or for social housing.  We also took from it commercial estates such as our business parks, where property was included that was clearly not residential property.  That left us with 376 potential vacant properties across the entirety of Fingal.  Given the size of the county, it is a very low level.  Our approach to the issue has been boots on the ground, to be blunt.  We have not sat in offices looking at the numbers.  We have gone out and put staff out on the ground.  We are doing a street by street survey to ensure we are not missing anything.  In one survey, for example, of 74 properties that were identified as vacant, it turned out that 13 were vacant while the remainder were lived in. </p> <p>  To take up Mr. Walsh's point, accuracy of data on vacant properties is necessary.  In the context of high demand and high rental rates, however, even in cases where we do identify vacancy, the attractiveness of the scheme is limited.  We are not getting significant traction on it, although we are continuing to get traction on our ordinary leasing schemes under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, or the long-term lease.  People continue to be interested in that as an option.</p> <p>  There was a point which I do not quite understand.  The Deputy spoke about her time on the council and lands being passed over to AHBs.  I am not really sure what she is referring to there.  Is she referring to the unsold affordable scheme?</p></speech>

The Deputy's response was in respect of the development of the lands at Mulhuddart.</p><p>Support has been given to approved housing bodies to enable them to access funding that is not directly State funded to ensure they have the capacity to deliver affordable rental models, incremental purchase schemes and co-operative schemes.  These are the types of mixed tenure proposed for the land banks in Fingal, particularly in Mulhuddart.  We are extremely conscious of the level of demand for social housing in that particular area and we will continue to work in partnership with the approved housing bodies to bring forward mixed tenure models.</p><p> On the question regarding Dublin 15, in which area the Deputy obviously has a keen interest, from the beginning of 2015 to date, under the housing strategy, we have provided 570 families with tenancies in the Dublin 15 area.  A further 400 tenancies are approved and in terms of immediate future delivery an additional 1,100 units will be provided in the Dublin 15 area through the social housing mechanisms.  This data is not inclusive of the land bank in Mulhuddart.  I am happy to provide more detail later.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-07-13a.1521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Anthony Flynn" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017071300002#R00300"><p>I will respond first to the questions raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, following which I will group and respond to the points made by other members.  As clarified by the Chairman of the CCMA, we can increase our delivery targets in regard to the provision of social housing in local authorities but we need to speed up the programmes.  The use of new building technologies is vital, so we need to buy-in in that regard.</p> <p>  In regard to the capital works management framework and single stage process, I would have no sleepless nights if what was suggested could be considered, although I am not sure it will be.  I believe there is some capacity in the context of a three-stage or a two-stage process - by this I mean, an approval stage and a go-to-tender stage, which would be a two-stage process.  Some work in the context of the capital works management framework is important.</p> <p>  Our housing land initiatives are currently out to tender, and they will provide an affordable element.  We have been working on an affordable rental model, a cost rental model and a starter homes model.  In the context of economic appraisals, we have to put some meat on the bones in relation to that process but I am confident there will be an affordable model in Dublin City Council's housing land initiatives.  On whether the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, will provide some form of sale or cost rental dividend, I believe it will.  In terms of Poolbeg, it will certainly provide a dividend of in excess of the 10% requirement from the developer in regard to Part V.  We believe there will be capacity in that scheme in terms of LIHAF.  </p> <p>  On staff resources, at this point in time Dublin City Council is appropriately staffed to deliver the housing programme in terms of administrative and professional supports.  On the point made by Deputy Ellis in regard to compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, they are a last resort in the context of taking back properties.  We would use all other mechanisms first to try to get vacant properties back into residential use.  Dublin City Council recently completed 11 CPOs and we have identified 144 other derelict homes in respect of which we are going through a process or a CPO with landlords to bring them into stock.  On vacant shops and other vacant properties, I agree that there is some scope to examine change-of-use of those properties in the context of the development plan. </p> <p>  On the financial contribution scheme, I am in favour of a down-sizing scheme or under-occupancy scheme.  We recently had a scheme of this nature in Ballyfermot whereby an approved housing body delivered 70 homes.  The scheme was open to tenants who had large accommodation which they no longer required and 17 tenants surrendered their homes and moved to accommodation for older persons.  We are putting in place similar plans for the Crumlin-Drimnagh area and the north-west area.</p></speech>

We believe city rapid build will become mainstream, in respect of which we are operating a stackable volumetric system.  I will respond later to Deputy Cowen's question on how we can move things on in that regard.</p> <p>  With regard to the PPP bundle, there have been difficulties and issues arising in this regard but they relate not to the process, but the consultation with adjoining communities.  There is need for greater consultation with the local communities to try to provide them with assurances that the homes will be well managed.  This is where the difficulty lies from my point of view in relation to the two schemes proposed for the city.  I will leave the issue of competitive dialogue for a response by the representative of Cork City Council.  The aforementioned is the manner in which Dublin City Council is rolling out its housing land initiatives and competitive dialogue process.</p> <p>  On the issues raised by Deputy Cowen in relation to rapid build homes, primarily what is required is scale.  We must send out the message to the industry in this country that we are behind the rapid build process and that scale is required.  Irish manufacturers and Irish designers are leading manufacturers in the UK in terms of the provision of rapid build for both volumetric and standard build homes.  The largest development is in Birmingham.  Most of the designers involved in this area are Irish.  We have had conversations with manufacturers and providers who are capable of providing 1,000 units.  We have also had conversations on this issue with our colleagues in Fingal County Council.  These manufacturers can erect the factories needed to build and provide these homes quickly and thus create employment, but they need a commitment on scale.</p> <p>  In this regard, we need "buy-in".  There is a need for an understanding of what the local authorities require from the industry.  While previously these houses were termed "modular homes" and "prefabricated homes", that is no longer the case.  As rightly said by Deputy Ellis, they are houses which comply with all building regulations and current building standards.  What is needed is a little bit of tweaking in the context of procurement and some tidying up in terms of fast-tracking connections by utility companies.  This is very important.  I would suggest that these are important steps in the context of moving ahead with a full scale programme of rapid build homes.</p> <p>  An affordable home scheme, or a "starter home scheme", as it is known in the city, is vital.  A number of reports have identified that there are a number of people between the ages of 28 and 38 who want to move from private rented accommodation to a permanent home.  Dublin City Council, in conjunction with our colleagues in the Dublin region, are working on a model in respect of which we hope to bring a proposal to the Department by the end of this month.  We are keen to ensure an affordable-starter home scheme is put in place.</p></speech>

There are key differences in the way a local authority can procure a housing programme now, as we did, for the construction and addition of new units to stock, and how we would have done that previously.  We had to find a different way of doing it.  The reason this particular European framework lent itself to doing it that way was because the city is running out of developable land; it is quite small.  We no longer have stocks of landbanks.  Those that are remaining we have plans for, and the demand did not meet what we had on the books.  In simple terms, that allowed us to put out a call to landowners - the size of the land did not matter - and developers, regardless of whether they had land.  The landowners did not have to be developers.  It included approved housing bodies, AHBs, as well.  It was a mechanism by which we could assess the capacity of the proposals that came forward either from individuals in those sectors or partnerships that were proposed among those sectors with Cork City Council.</p> <p>  The last step in the process is Part 8 planning permission, not the first step.  The entire testing of capacity and the rigorous rules of procurement, as applied by a panel that was set up, will have been applied by the time we go in to try to secure Part 8 planning permission.  We secured four of those on Monday night and another four are imminent.  They will require a special meeting of the elected members to be held.  They have started their summer recess but are willing to return and examine those in the interest of speeding up the starts on those sites.  We are very happy to expand on that if the Deputy is interested.  We are not saying this should be a model for other local authorities.  We are saying it could be, particularly for urban local authorities challenged by the same availability of land issue as we might have been.  We also believe it uncovered 31 sites in the first instance.  Not all of those were viable developments, but we believe there is space, even within the so-called diminishing land within Cork city, for a second run at an EU competitive dialogue.  It has been quite successful for us.</p> <p>  It was units produced mainly under that model which attracted the &euro;97 million funding for Cork City Council that we secured in February this year.  That is what allowed us to proceed.</p> <p>  In more general terms, I would agree with much of what has been said already, particularly about our capacity.  If we are resourced, we will do it.  Our track record speaks for itself.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin commented on the level of need versus ambition.  In my experience, the local authority has never been short of ambition, but we need to assess the level of need correctly because just as the number of vacant properties in Cork city is overstated, our empirical experience is that our level of need was overstated by 100%.  We dropped people from the housing list who were not in need of housing by means of introducing choice-based letting, CBL, and going through the housing needs assessment.  We can share the details of that with any member.  Other local authorities are going through that same process as CBL is rolled out.  The level of real or net need must be established and there has never been a shortage of ambition in local government.</p> <p>  With regard to the HAP inspections, there will be an issue in terms of resourcing those.  Cork City Council will have to examine the option of outsourcing.  We are fortunate in that the eight months inspection deadline per HAP property is only now coming upon us because we were quite late to HAP.  At the same time, it has been very successful because we have just under 1,200 units in the HAP system now.  Similar to what our colleagues in Fingal City Council said, HAP has proven an attractive option for many Cork applicants.  They want to live in those addresses.  They perceive private rented accommodation to be a viable housing option.</p> <p>  As for how the transfer list is working, transfers are not as much of a priority for us as the first provision of housing, but there are no HAP tenants banging on the door saying they want to get out of HAP properties.  That has not been our experience in Cork.</p> <p>  With regard to acquisitions, we acquired well over 130 units in our acquisitions programme.  We had to focus on that because it takes a long time for construction to get up and running.  We acquired all those units off-market and our vacancy rate is 0.5%.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked another question about the four-stage delivery process.  I agree with the comments made by Dublin City Council.  We would add to that by saying we have built excellent relationships in the Department and much depends on those excellent relationships because there remains a certain level of control and repetition.  We, too, have planners, architects, quantity surveyors, engineers, property experts and so on but one wonders how many of those are needed to go over proposals.  Undoubtedly, a level of oversight, centralisation and duplication is adding to the timelines between submission and approval.</p> <p>  In terms of the rapid build units, at the end of quarter 2 we submitted a proposal for 20 units.  We believe "rapid build" is somewhat of a misnomer because they all still need to go through the procurement and planning process and so on.  Once that process is complete they may well be capable of being built more rapidly but that misleads people.</p> <p>  In regard to Deputy Barry's question, there is no problem in providing a written response.</p></speech>

I am aware scale is also an issue.  Mr. Flynn said scale is an issue.  We hear Ministers saying that resources and funding are not an issue and that if money were the problem, this problem would be resolved many moons ago.  I do not necessarily subscribe to that.  The manner in which we respond to the issue is too simplistic.  Can Mr. Flynn be a little more forthcoming?  Is he saying he does not have the authority to make the call regarding the level of scale he believes is necessary to address this issue in a way that could be successful and achieved much earlier than conventional housing?</p></speech>

That tells me there is a major issue in terms of money.  The Minister is saying he is providing the money but we need to be more ambitious in terms of saying we can deliver something if the funding is provided.  We need to be straight about that.</p><p>The procurement issue seems to have always been a bit of a problem in terms of how quickly we can deliver.  How can that process be speeded up?  How can these obstacles be dealt with to ensure quicker delivery?  I talked about co-operative housing and mentioned &Oacute; Cualann and the model it is using.  Is there scope for more of that?  &Oacute; Cualann has said it could deliver more, but are there other places we can look to in order to deliver similar initiatives?  As I said, we could set up a list of companies that could sign up, which would help to deal with procurement.  One could choose from the list to build social and affordable housing schemes.  Can the local authority deliver this?  Must we go to &Oacute; Cualann?  Is there a mechanism to deliver this and more?  This is also key to setting prices.  I believe the private sector is just holding on to a lot of land in many cases to up the prices before they start building.  If we build more affordable housing, it will level out prices and rents in the long term.  I am curious whether the witnesses could tell me what is the big hold-up.  Where are the real obstacles?</p></speech>

What I mean by scale is that these guys set up jigs to manufacture off-site.  What they are doing is manufacturing boxes.  It is as easy for them to manufacture 100 boxes or 500 boxes as 20 boxes, as my Cork colleague said.  What I am suggesting is that if there are appropriate locations for this rapid build housing in the context of scale - traditional build may be just as quick - from a national policy perspective, we have said we will build 700 units in the next 18 months and, if we do so, I think that will generate interest from big players.

We are bundling our schemes now.  Our next scheme will consist of 70 units.  We were going to proceed with three schemes of 20 units each.  We did not do that.  We bundled them into 70 units to generate interest from the market, and we got that interest.  This is what I mean by scale.  Deputy Ellis would know the Valley site in Finglas, which is an ideal site for rapid build homes, of which two thirds could be starter homes and one third could be social housing.  This is what I mean by scale.  Procurement is-----</p></speech>

We have been working from the OGP framework in this regard.  Talking to developers delivering such a construction model in Fingal, I understand that to make rapid delivery work, we need to get to a point of early contract or involvement.  There is little point in going through our whole Part XIII process, getting a product at the end and then talking to those contractors about how they deliver it.  If we are to look at rapid delivery on scale, we need to look at that early contractor involvement.</p> <p>  Regarding land specifically, in terms of PPPs, joint ventures or otherwise, traditionally, we have looked at the land value and what the developer would look to put on the table in that regard.  We need to start looking at some kinds of models whereby one takes the land value out of the equation and tries to set the price of the property in terms of what one knows about the cost at which it can be constructed.  That information is there, and then one marks against it.  These are two models we need to examine.  Equally, private developers are very interested in working with us on leasing models.  This goes back to the question about NARPS.  We really need to start looking at that.  There is an opportunity for delivery there and we are missing it at present.</p></speech>

On that last point, I reiterate that in some respects local authorities know more than anyone the extent of the issues out there because we are genuinely at the coalface.  Equally, as a consequence, it is a significant problem for us and we are seriously interested in looking at any of the elements that can help solve it, if only to take pressure off ourselves a little.  I reassure the committee that we are building significant capacity again.  We are coming from a point of zero building only two or three years ago.  Is everything perfect?  We would never say that about our own operation but there is a real, significant improvement in our capacity and our delivery and we are confident we can continue to improve that.  We would be glad at any stage to come back to the committee.  This is a matter of significant social and economic importance and we welcome the opportunity to discuss it.</p></speech>
